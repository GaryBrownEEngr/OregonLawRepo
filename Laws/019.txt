APPEALABLE JUDGMENTS

 

(Generally)

 

      19.205 Appealable judgments and orders. (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, a limited judgment, general judgment or supplemental judgment, as those terms are defined by ORS 18.005, may be appealed as provided in this chapter. A judgment corrected under ORCP 71 may be appealed only as provided in ORS 18.107 and 18.112.

      (2) An order in an action that affects a substantial right, and that effectively determines the action so as to prevent a judgment in the action, may be appealed in the same manner as provided in this chapter for judgments.

      (3) An order that is made in the action after a general judgment is entered and that affects a substantial right, including an order granting a new trial, may be appealed in the same manner as provided in this chapter for judgments.

      (4) No appeal to the Court of Appeals shall be taken or allowed in any action for the recovery of money or damages only unless it appears from the pleadings that the amount in controversy exceeds $250.

      (5) An appeal may be taken from the circuit court in any special statutory proceeding under the same conditions, in the same manner and with like effect as from a judgment or order entered in an action, unless appeal is expressly prohibited by the law authorizing the special statutory proceeding.

      (6) Nothing in ORS chapter 18 affects the authority of an appellate court to dismiss an appeal or to remand a proceeding to the trial court under ORS 19.270 (4) based on the appellate court’s determination that the appeal has not been taken from an appealable judgment or order. [Formerly 19.010; 2003 c.576 §85]

 

      19.210 [1981 c.550 §2; 1997 c.389 §3; renumbered 19.405 in 1997]

 

(Class Actions)

 

      19.215 Determining amount in controversy in class action for purposes of appeal. The aggregate amount of the claims of all potential class members in a class action under ORCP 32 shall determine whether the amount in controversy is sufficient to satisfy the provisions of ORS 19.205 (4) for the purposes of any appeal to the Court of Appeals. [Formerly 19.013; 2003 c.576 §573]

 

      19.220 [1981 c.897 §107; renumbered 19.440 in 1997]

 

      19.225 Appealability of certain orders in class actions. When a circuit court judge, in making in a class action under ORCP 32 an order not otherwise appealable, is of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, the judge shall so state in writing in such order. The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order to the Court of Appeals if application is made to the court within 10 days after the entry of the order. Application for such an appeal shall not stay proceedings in the circuit court unless the circuit court judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order. [Formerly 19.015]

 

      19.230 [1987 c.793 §1; 1991 c.817 §17; 1995 c.595 §20; renumbered 34.102 in 1997]

 

(Determining Whether Judgment Appealable)

 

      19.235 Jurisdiction for determining whether decision is appealable. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 19.270, if any party or the trial court on its own motion, on receiving actual notice of the filing of the notice of appeal, raises the issue whether the decision being appealed is appealable, the trial court shall have jurisdiction to make a summary determination, with or without a hearing, whether the decision is appealable. As used in this section, “decision” means any trial court ruling, either oral or written.

      (2) If the trial court determines that the decision is not appealable, the trial court, in its discretion, may proceed through entry of judgment or stay proceedings pending an appellate court determination of the existence of an appealable decision. The trial court may refer the question of the existence of an appealable decision to the court to which the appeal is taken. Neither an order by the trial court to proceed through entry of judgment, an order by the trial court to stay proceedings pending an appellate court determination, nor a trial court referral of the question of the existence of an appealable decision to the appellate court is appealable. However, on motion of any party or on its own motion the appellate court may stay proceedings in the trial court or stay any order or judgment entered by the trial court pending a final determination of appealability.

      (3) When a party by motion, the trial court by referral or the appellate court on its own motion raises the issue whether the decision is appealable, the appellate court may make a summary determination of the appealability of the decision. A summary determination of the appealability of a decision under this subsection is subject to review by the Supreme Court as provided in ORS 2.520 except that the petition for review shall be served and filed within 14 days after the date of the court’s determination. Either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court may shorten the time period within which the petition for review shall be filed. A petition for review of a determination under this subsection shall not be treated as a request for reconsideration by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court shall expedite its review of the Court of Appeals’ summary determination under this subsection.

      (4)(a) The trial court’s authority to proceed with a case under subsection (2) of this section shall end when the appellate court has made an express determination that an appeal has been taken from an appealable order or judgment, all means for obtaining review of that determination under subsection (3) of this section have been exhausted, and the State Court Administrator at the direction of the court has mailed copies of the final appellate court determination to the trial court and the parties; otherwise, the trial court’s jurisdiction shall continue.

      (b) No action by the trial court taken pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, except for entry of judgment, shall be void solely because an appellate court later determines that a notice of appeal was filed from an appealable decision. [Formerly 19.034]

 

COMMENCING AN APPEAL

 

(Generally)

 

      19.240 How appeal to Court of Appeals taken. (1) An appeal to the Court of Appeals shall be taken in the manner prescribed in this chapter.

      (2) The appeal shall be taken by causing a notice of appeal, in the form prescribed by ORS 19.250, to be served:

      (a) On all parties who have appeared in the action, suit or proceeding;

      (b) On the trial court administrator; and

      (c) On the trial court transcript coordinator if a transcript is designated in connection with the appeal.

      (3) The original of the notice with proof of service indorsed thereon or affixed thereto shall be filed with the Court of Appeals. [Formerly 19.023; 1999 c.367 §2]

 

      19.245 Who may appeal; appeal of default judgments and judgments taken by confession; appeal of stipulated judgments. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, any party to a judgment may appeal from the judgment.

      (2) A party to a judgment given by confession or for want of an answer may not appeal from the judgment except as follows:

      (a) A plaintiff, third party plaintiff or a party who pleaded a cross-claim or counterclaim may appeal from the judgment if the judgment is not in accord with the relief demanded in the complaint.

      (b) A defendant may appeal from the judgment if the trial court has entered a default judgment against the defendant as a sanction or has denied a motion to set aside a default order or judgment.

      (c) A defendant may appeal from the judgment if it is void.

      (3) A party to a stipulated judgment may appeal from the judgment only if:

      (a) The judgment specifically provides that the party has reserved the right to appellate review of a ruling of the trial court in the cause; and

      (b) The appeal presents a justiciable controversy. [Formerly 19.020; 1999 c.367 §1; 2001 c.541 §1]

 

(Notice of Appeal)

 

      19.250 Contents of notice of appeal. (1) The notice of appeal must contain the following:

      (a) The title of the cause. The party appealing a judgment must be designated the appellant and the adverse party the respondent, but the title of the action or proceeding is not otherwise changed by reason of the appeal.

      (b) The names of the parties and their attorneys.

      (c)(A) If an appellant is not represented by an attorney, a postal address for the appellant and either an electronic mail address for the appellant or a statement that the appellant does not have an electronic mail address.

      (B) If the appellant is represented by an attorney, a postal address and electronic mail address for the attorney.

      (d) A notice to each party that appeared in the action or proceeding, or to the attorney for the party, that an appeal is taken from the judgment or some specified part of the judgment and designating the adverse parties to the appeal. The notice of appeal must contain the postal address and electronic mail address, if known to the appellant, for all other parties designated as parties to the appeal.

      (e) A designation of those portions of the proceedings and exhibits to be included in the record in addition to the trial court file. The appellant may amend the designation of record at any time after filing the notice of appeal until 35 days after the filing of a certificate of preparation for the transcript under ORS 19.370 (3). The amendment must be made by filing and serving in the same manner as a notice of appeal a notice of amended designation of record. The amended designation must clearly indicate those portions of the proceedings and exhibits being added to or deleted from the original designation of record. The designation may not be later amended by the appellant unless the appellate court so orders.

      (f) A plain and concise statement of the points on which the appellant intends to rely. On appeal, the appellant may rely on no other points than those set forth in such statement. If the appellant has designated for inclusion in the record all the testimony and all the instructions given and requested, no statement of points is necessary. Not later than the 15th day following the filing of the certificate of preparation for the transcript under ORS 19.370 (3), the appellant may serve and file an amended statement of points. Except by approval of the court, the appellant may then rely on no other points than those set forth in such amended statement.

      (g) The signature of the appellant or attorney for the appellant.

      (2) Within 14 days after the filing of the notice of appeal or amended designation of record, any other party may serve and file a designation of additional parts of the proceedings and exhibits to be included in the record. Such designation must be served and filed as provided for the serving and filing of a notice of appeal under ORS 19.240 and 19.260. If such party also appeals, the designation must be included in the notice of appeal of the party and may not be served and filed separately. [Formerly 19.029; 1999 c.367 §3; 2013 c.685 §4]

      19.260 Filing by mail or delivery. (1)(a) Filing a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court may be accomplished by mail or delivery.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided by law, the provisions of this section are applicable to petitions for judicial review, cross petitions for judicial review and petitions under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals.

      19.265 Payment of filing fee. At the time the notice of appeal is filed as provided in ORS 19.240, the appellant shall deposit with the State Court Administrator the amount of the appropriate filing fee. The timely deposit of such fee is not jurisdictional, but omission to do so shall be cause for dismissal of the appeal, subject to the provisions of ORS 19.270 (3). [Formerly 19.035]

      (a) Service of the notice of appeal on all parties identified in the notice of appeal as adverse parties or, if the notice of appeal does not identify adverse parties, on all parties who have appeared in the action, suit or proceeding, as provided in ORS 19.240 (2)(a), within the time limits prescribed by ORS 19.255.

      (b) Filing of the original of the notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals as provided in ORS 19.240 (3), within the time limits prescribed by ORS 19.255.

      (3) After the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals has acquired jurisdiction of the cause, the omission of a party to perform any of the acts required in connection with an appeal, or to perform such acts within the time required, shall be cause for dismissal of the appeal. In the event of such omission, the court, on motion of a party or on its own motion may dismiss the appeal. An appeal dismissed on a party’s motion or on the court’s own motion may be reinstated upon showing of good cause.

      (4) Notwithstanding the filing of a notice of appeal, the trial court has jurisdiction, with leave of the appellate court, to enter an appealable judgment or order if the appellate court determines that:

      (a) At the time of the filing of the notice of appeal the trial court intended to enter an appealable judgment or order; and

      (b) The judgment or order from which the appeal is taken is defective in form or was entered at a time when the trial court did not have jurisdiction of the cause under subsection (1) of this section, or the trial court had not yet entered an appealable judgment or order.

      (5) Notwithstanding the filing of a notice of appeal, the trial court has jurisdiction:

      (a) To enter in the trial court register a judgment or order that the trial judge signed before the notice of appeal was filed;

      (b) To enter an order or supplemental judgment under ORCP 71 or ORS 19.275, 107.105 (4) or 107.452; and

      (c) To enter an order or supplemental judgment for the purpose of implementing a settlement as allowed by ORS 19.410 (3).

      (6) Jurisdiction of the appellate court over a cause ends when a copy of the appellate judgment is mailed by the State Court Administrator to the court from which the appeal was taken pursuant to ORS 19.450, except that the appellate court may:

      (a) Recall the appellate judgment as justice may require;

      (b) Stay enforcement of the appellate judgment to allow the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States; and

      (c) Stay enforcement of the appellate judgment pending disposition of the matter by the Supreme Court of the United States or for such other time as the Oregon appellate court may deem appropriate.

      (7) If a limited or supplemental judgment is appealed, the jurisdiction of the appellate court is limited to the matters decided by the limited or supplemental judgment, and the trial court retains jurisdiction over all other matters in the proceeding.

      (8) After jurisdiction of the appellate court ends, all orders which may be necessary to carry the appellate judgment into effect shall be made by the court from which the appeal was taken. [Formerly 19.033; 2003 c.576 §86; 2005 c.568 §25c; 2007 c.66 §1; 2013 c.10 §1]

 

      19.275 Continuing jurisdiction of trial court in certain domestic relations cases. (1) Any motion that requires a showing of a change of circumstances before the court may modify a judgment, including a motion to reconsider the spousal or child support provisions of a judgment pursuant to ORS 107.135, may be filed with the trial court while an appeal from the judgment is pending before an appellate court. The filing of a motion under this subsection does not affect the right of the appellant to pursue the appeal of the judgment.

      (2) The trial court in its discretion may proceed to hear and decide a motion under this section or may hold the motion in abeyance pending disposition of the appeal.

      (3) Pursuant to the provisions of ORS 19.205, the court’s decision on a motion under this section is a supplemental judgment. The appellate court in its discretion may consolidate an appeal from a supplemental judgment under this section with the pending appeal of the general judgment in the case, may direct that both appeals be heard at the same time or may allow the appeals to proceed independently. [1997 c.71 §11; 2003 c.576 §87; 2005 c.568 §26]

[1997 c.172 §4; 1999 c.367 §10]

 

(Stays)

 

      19.330 Stays generally. The filing of a notice of appeal does not automatically stay the judgment that is the subject of the appeal. A party may seek to stay a judgment in the manner provided by ORS 19.335, 19.340 or 19.350, or as provided by other law. [1997 c.71 §5]

 

      19.335 Stay by filing of supersedeas undertaking. (1) If a judgment is for the recovery of money, a supersedeas undertaking acts to stay the judgment if the undertaking provides that the appellant will pay the judgment to the extent that the judgment is affirmed on appeal.

      (2) If a judgment requires the transfer or delivery of possession of real property, a supersedeas undertaking acts to stay the judgment if the undertaking provides that the appellant will not commit waste or allow waste to be committed on the real property while the appellant possesses the property, and the appellant will pay the value of the use and occupation of the property for the period of possession if the judgment is affirmed. The value of the use and occupation during the period of possession must be stated in the undertaking.

      (3)(a) If a judgment requires the transfer or delivery of possession of personal property, a supersedeas undertaking acts to stay the judgment if the undertaking provides that the appellant will obey the judgment of the appellate court, and that if the appellant does not obey the judgment, the appellant will pay an amount determined by the trial court and stated in the undertaking.

      (b) If a judgment requires the transfer or delivery of possession of personal property, the judgment is stayed without the filing of a supersedeas undertaking if the appellant transfers or delivers the personal property to the court or places the property in the custody of an officer or receiver appointed by the trial court.

      (4) If a judgment requires the foreclosure of a mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, and also requires payment of the debt secured by the mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, a supersedeas undertaking acts to stay that portion of the judgment that requires payment of the debt if the undertaking provides that the appellant will pay any portion of the judgment remaining unsatisfied after the sale of the property subject to the mortgage, lien or other encumbrance. The amount of the undertaking must be stated in the undertaking. The requirements of this subsection are in addition to any provisions in a supersedeas undertaking that may be required under subsection (2) or (3) of this section to stay delivery or transfer of property.

      (5) If a judgment requires the execution of a conveyance or other instrument, the judgment is stayed without the filing of a supersedeas undertaking if the appellant executes the instrument and deposits the instrument with the trial court administrator. Unless otherwise directed by the appellate court, the instrument must be held by the trial court administrator until issuance of the appellate judgment terminating the appeal.

      (6) Except as provided in ORCP 72, a stay of judgment described in this section takes effect only after the party has filed a notice of appeal and filed any supersedeas undertaking required for the stay. [1997 c.71 §6; 1999 c.367 §11; 2007 c.547 §5]

 

      19.340 Waiver of supersedeas undertaking; sale of perishables. (1) The trial court, in its discretion, may stay a judgment without requiring a supersedeas undertaking, or reduce the amount of the supersedeas undertaking required of the appellant, if the appellant is an executor, administrator, trustee or other person acting on behalf of another.

      (2) If a judgment that has been stayed requires the sale of perishable property, or if perishable property has been seized to satisfy or secure a judgment that has been stayed, the trial court may order that perishable property be sold and the proceeds of the sale deposited or invested until issuance of the appellate judgment terminating the appeal. [1997 c.71 §7]

 

      19.345 Enforcement of judgment in contract action notwithstanding appeal. If the judgment has been given in an action or suit upon a contract, notwithstanding an appeal and supersedeas undertaking, the respondent may proceed to enforce such judgment, if within 10 days from the time the appeal is perfected the respondent files with the trial court administrator an undertaking to the effect that if the judgment is reversed or modified the respondent will make such restitution as the appellate court may direct. Such undertaking may be excepted to by the appellant in like manner and with like effect as the undertaking of an appellant, and the sureties therein shall have the same qualifications. [Formerly 19.060; 1999 c.367 §12; 2003 c.576 §281]

 

      19.350 Discretionary stay by court. (1) A party may seek a stay of judgment pending a decision on appeal in the manner provided by this section only if the judgment may not be stayed under the provisions of ORS 19.335 or 19.340, or under any other provision of law specifying a procedure or grounds for staying the judgment. A stay of judgment may not be granted under this section if any other provision of law specifies that a stay may not be granted pending a decision on appeal.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a party seeking a stay under the provisions of this section must first request a stay from the trial court. The trial court may act on a request for a stay before or after a notice of appeal is filed. The time for filing a notice of appeal is not tolled by the making of a request for a stay under this section or by the trial court’s action on the request.

      (3) The trial court shall consider the following factors in deciding whether to grant a stay under this section, in addition to such other factors as the trial court considers important:

      (a) The likelihood of the appellant prevailing on appeal.

      (b) Whether the appeal is taken in good faith and not for the purpose of delay.

      (c) Whether there is any support in fact or in law for the appeal.

      (d) The nature of the harm to the appellant, to other parties, to other persons and to the public that will likely result from the grant or denial of a stay.

      (4) The trial court has discretion to impose reasonable conditions on the grant of a stay under the provisions of this section. The court may require that a supersedeas undertaking be filed in a specified amount as a condition of granting a stay under the provisions of this section.

      (5) A party may request a stay pending appeal from the appellate court in the first instance, and the appellate court may act on that request without requiring the party to seek a stay from the trial court, if the party establishes that the filing of a request for a stay with the trial court would be futile or that the trial court is unable or unwilling to act on the request within a reasonable time. In considering a request for a stay under this subsection, the appellate court shall consider the factors set out in subsection (3) of this section in addition to any other factors the court considers important. [1997 c.71 §8]

 

      19.355 Stay of domestic relations judgment. (1) The provisions of this chapter relating to stays on appeal apply to a domestic relations judgment.

      (2) If an appellant seeks a stay of only specific provisions of a domestic relations judgment, the motion seeking the stay must identify those provisions of the judgment that are to be stayed. If the court allows a stay of only certain provisions of the judgment, the order of the court must specifically indicate those provisions. If a supersedeas undertaking is filed with the court for the purpose of staying specific provisions of the judgment, the undertaking must indicate the specific provisions of the judgment covered by the undertaking. A stay of any specific provision of a domestic relations judgment may be granted only if:

      (a) The specific provision is subject to stay under the provisions of this chapter; and

      (b) All requirements of this chapter for a stay of the provision are satisfied.

      (3) For the purposes of this section, “domestic relations judgment” means a judgment entered in proceedings under ORS chapter 107, 108 or 109. [1997 c.71 §10; 2003 c.576 §282]

 

(Appellate Review of Trial Court Orders Relating to Undertakings and Stays)

 

      19.360 Appellate review of trial court orders relating to undertakings and stays. (1) Any party aggrieved by the trial court’s final order relating to an undertaking on appeal, the trial court’s grant or denial of a stay or the terms and conditions imposed by the trial court on the granting of a stay may seek review of the trial court’s decision by filing a motion in the appellate court to which the appeal is made. The motion must be filed within 14 days after the entry of the trial court’s order. During the 14-day period after the entry of the trial court’s order, the judgment shall automatically be stayed unless the trial court orders otherwise. The trial court may impose terms or conditions on the stay or take such other action as may be necessary to prevent prejudice to the parties.

      (2) The appellate court may review the decision of the trial court under the provisions of this section at any time after the filing of the notice of appeal. Notwithstanding ORS 19.415 (3), the appellate court shall review the decision de novo upon the record.

      (3) On de novo review under subsection (2) of this section, the record shall be restricted to the record made before the trial court unless:

      (a) There is additional relevant information relating to the period of time following the decision of the trial court that the appellate court determines to be important to review of the decision; or

      (b) The party submitting new information establishes that there was good cause for not submitting the information to the trial court.

      (5) If the record on appeal is not sufficient to allow the appellate court to review an assignment of error, the appellate court may decline to review the assignment of error and may dismiss the appeal if there are no other assignments of error that may be reviewed.

      (6) Except as provided by rules of the appellate court, the State Court Administrator shall return the trial court file and the exhibits to the trial court administrator upon issuance of the appellate judgment disposing of the appeal. [Formerly 19.065; 2013 c.685 §5]

      (8) When a transcript is settled, the State Court Administrator shall notify each transcriber who filed a certificate of preparation. Upon receiving the notice, a transcriber shall file an electronic copy of the transcript with the State Court Administrator in the manner and format prescribed by rules of the appellate court.
