      (c) The administrator may require of the parties any additional information that is necessary for the provision of support enforcement services under ORS 25.080.

      (d)(A) Upon a finding, which may be made ex parte, that the health, safety or liberty of a party or child would unreasonably be put at risk by the disclosure of information specified in this subsection or by the disclosure of other information concerning a child or party to a parentage or support proceeding or if an existing order so requires, a court or administrator or administrative law judge, when the proceeding is administrative, shall order that the information not be contained in any document provided to another party or otherwise disclosed to a party other than the state.

      (e) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may, in consultation with the Department of Justice, adopt rules under ORS 1.002 to designate information specified in this subsection as confidential and require that the information be submitted through an alternate procedure to ensure that the information is exempt from public disclosure under ORS 192.355.

      (9)(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, in any subsequent child support enforcement action, the court or administrator, upon a showing of diligent effort made to locate the obligor or obligee, may deem due process requirements to be met by mailing notice to the last-known residential, mailing or employer address or contact address as provided in ORS 25.085.

      (b) Service of an order directing an obligor to appear in a contempt proceeding is subject to ORS 33.015 to 33.155.

      (10) Subject to ORS 25.030, this section, to the extent it imposes any duty or function upon the Department of Justice, shall be deemed to supersede any provisions of ORS 25.501 to 25.556 and ORS chapters 107, 108, 109, 110, 419A, 419B and 419C that would otherwise impose the same duties or functions upon the county clerk or the Department of Human Services.

      (11) Except as provided for in subsections (12), (13) and (14) of this section, credit may not be given for payments not made to the Department of Justice as required under subsection (1) of this section.

      (12)(a) The Department of Justice shall give credit for payments not made to the department:

      (A) When payments are not assigned to this or another state and the party to whom unpaid support is owed and the obligor agree in writing that specific payments were made and should be credited;

      (C) As provided by rule adopted under ORS 180.345.

      (b) The credit under this subsection may not exceed the current unpaid balance of support owed to the party that has agreed in writing that payments were made and should be credited.

      (13) An obligor may apply to the Department of Justice for credit for payments made other than to the Department of Justice. If the party to whom unpaid support is owed does not provide the agreement or verification required by subsection (12) of this section, credit may be given pursuant to order of an administrative law judge assigned from the Office of Administrative Hearings after notice and opportunity to object and be heard are given to both the obligor and the party to whom unpaid support is owed. Notice shall be served upon the party to whom unpaid support is owed as provided by ORS 25.085. Notice to the obligor may be by regular mail at the address provided in the application for credit. A hearing conducted under this subsection is a contested case hearing and ORS 183.413 to 183.470 apply. Any party may seek a hearing de novo in the circuit court.

      (14) Nothing in this section precludes the Department of Justice from giving credit for payments not made to the department when there has been a judicially determined credit or satisfaction or when there has been a satisfaction of support executed by the person to whom support is owed.

      (15) The Department of Justice shall adopt rules that:

      (3) At the request of either party, child support may be established for the parent with current physical custody of the child.

      (4) If a change in the physical custody of a child is temporary, the obligee may satisfy support accruing for the child for periods that the child is in the physical custody of the obligor as provided in ORS 18.225, 18.228, 18.232 and 18.235. [1997 c.385 §4; 2003 c.73 §18; 2003 c.576 §575]

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies only if an election has been made as provided in ORS 25.130. [Formerly 23.767; 1989 c.976 §36; 1991 c.230 §32; 1997 c.872 §4; 1999 c.80 §78; 2003 c.210 §1]

Any judgment or order entered in a proceeding for the enforcement of any delinquent support obligation, including an order entered under ORS 25.378, shall include, on the motion of the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice or the district attorney, if either has appeared in the case, an order for payment of any support enforcement fees required by law in addition to any other costs chargeable to the obligor, and in addition to the support obligation. The Department of Justice shall deduct the amount of any previously imposed support enforcement fees from any payment subsequently made by the obligor but the amount of the deduction shall not exceed 25 percent of any payment. The support enforcement fee, when collected, shall be paid to the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice or the district attorney, whichever appeared in the case. [Formerly 23.787; 1993 c.798 §34; 1997 c.704 §15; 1999 c.80 §79; 2003 c.576 §294]

 

      25.075 Cooperative agreements with Indian tribes or tribal organizations. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 25.080, the Department of Justice may enter into cooperative agreements with Indian tribes or tribal organizations within the borders of this state, if the Indian tribe or tribal organization demonstrates that the tribe or organization has an established tribal court system or a Court of Indian Offenses with the authority to:

      (a) Establish parentage;

      (b) Establish, modify and enforce support orders; and

      (c) Enter support orders in accordance with child support guidelines established by the tribe or organization.

      (2) The agreements must provide for the cooperative delivery of child support enforcement services and for the forwarding of all child support collections pursuant to the functions performed by the tribe or organization to the department, or conversely, by the department to the tribe or organization, which shall distribute the child support collections in accordance with the agreement.

      25.080 Entity primarily responsible for support enforcement services; duties; application fees; rules. (1) The following entity is primarily responsible for providing the support enforcement services described in subsection (4) of this section when an application as described in ORS 25.084 is made, or when an assignment of support rights is made to the state:

      (a) The Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice:

      (A) If support rights are, or were within the past five months, assigned to this or another state; or

      (B) In any case where arrearage under a support order is assigned or owed to or the right to recover back support or state debt is held by this state or another state.

      (b) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the district attorney in cases other than those described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if an application as described in ORS 25.084 is made by the obligee, by the obligor, by a person having physical custody of a minor child or by a child attending school, as defined in ORS 107.108.

      (2) The provisions of this section apply to support enforcement services for any order or judgment that is or could be entered under ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 419B.400 or 419C.590 or ORS chapter 107, 108, 109 or 110. The entity specified in subsection (1) of this section shall provide the support enforcement services on behalf of the State of Oregon and not on behalf of any other party or on behalf of a parent. The Department of Justice shall adopt rules addressing the provision of support enforcement services when the purposes of the state in providing those services may be contradictory in individual cases.

      (3) Notwithstanding the division of responsibility for providing support enforcement services between the Division of Child Support and the district attorney as described in subsection (1) of this section, provision of support enforcement services may not be challenged on the basis that the entity providing the services in a particular case is not the entity responsible for the case under subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) When responsible for providing support enforcement services and there is sufficient evidence available to support the action to be taken, the entity described in subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) Shall establish and enforce any child support obligation;

      (b) Shall establish paternity;

      (c) Shall enforce spousal support when the obligee is living with the obligor’s child for whom support enforcement services are being provided and those services are funded in part by federal moneys;

      (d) May enforce any other order or judgment for spousal support;

      (e) Shall, on behalf of the state, initiate and respond to child support modification proceedings based upon a substantial change of circumstances;

      (f) Shall, on behalf of the state, initiate and respond to child support modification proceedings based upon a modification conducted under ORS 25.287 concerning existing child support orders;

      (g) Shall establish and enforce obligations to provide medical insurance coverage for dependent children;

      (h) Shall ensure compliance with the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 651 to 669 and 45 C.F.R. Chapter III as authorized by state law;

      (i) Shall carry out the policy of the State of Oregon regarding child support obligations as expressed in ORS 25.502; and

      (j) Shall ensure that child support orders are in compliance with the formula established by this chapter.

      (5) In any proceeding under subsection (4) of this section, the parties are those described in ORS 25.503.

      (6) The district attorney of any county and the department may provide by agreement for assumption by the Division of Child Support of the functions of the district attorney under subsection (1) of this section or for redistribution between the district attorney and the Division of Child Support of all or any portion of the duties, responsibilities and functions set forth in subsections (1) and (4) of this section.

      (7) All county governing bodies and all district attorneys shall enter into child support cooperative agreements with the department. The following apply to this subsection:

      (a) The agreements shall contain appropriate terms and conditions sufficient for the state to comply with all child support enforcement service requirements under federal law; and

      (b) If this state loses any federal funds due to the failure of a county governing body or district attorney to either enter into an agreement under this subsection or to provide sufficient support enforcement service, the county shall be liable to the department for, and the liability shall be limited to, the amount of money the state determines it lost because of the failure. The state shall offset the loss from any moneys the state is holding for or owes the county or from any moneys the state would pay to the county for any purpose.

      (8) The Department of Justice shall enter into an agreement with the Oregon District Attorneys Association to establish a position or positions to act as a liaison between the Division of Child Support and those district attorneys who provide support enforcement services under this section. The department shall fund the position or positions. The Oregon District Attorneys Association shall administer the liaison position or positions under the agreement. The liaison shall work to:

      (a) Enhance the participation and interaction of the district attorneys in the development and implementation of Child Support Program policies and services; and

      (b) Increase the effectiveness of child support enforcement services provided by the district attorneys.

      (9) The district attorney or the Division of Child Support, whichever is appropriate, shall provide the services specified in subsections (1) and (4) of this section to any applicant, but may in their discretion, upon a determination and notice to the applicant that the prospect of successful recovery from the obligor of a portion of the delinquency or future payments is remote, require payment to the district attorney or the Division of Child Support of an application fee, in accordance with an application fee schedule established by rule by the department. If service performed results in the district attorney or the Division of Child Support recovering any support enforcement fees, the fees shall be paid to the applicant in an amount equal to the amount of the application fee.

      (10) An obligee may request the Division of Child Support or a district attorney to cease all collection efforts if it is anticipated that physical or emotional harm will be caused to the parent or caretaker relative or the child for whom support was to have been paid. The department, by rule, shall set out the circumstances under which such requests shall be honored. [Formerly 23.790; 1991 c.758 §1; 1993 c.33 §367; 1995 c.608 §9; 1997 c.704 §16; 2001 c.900 §236; 2003 c.73 §20; 2003 c.576 §295; 2005 c.560 §2; 2009 c.352 §4; 2019 c.13 §8]

 

      25.081 Access to records with Social Security number. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an entity providing support enforcement services under ORS 25.080 shall have access, using a Social Security number as an identifier, to any record required by law to contain the Social Security number of an individual.

      (2) To the maximum extent feasible, a public body maintaining records described in ORS 25.785, including automated records, shall make the records accessible by Social Security number for purposes of support enforcement.

      (3) For purposes of this section, “public body” has the meaning given that term in ORS 192.311. [1997 c.746 §118]

 

      Note: 25.081 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 25 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.082 Administrative subpoenas; civil penalty; rules. (1) When services are being provided under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, the enforcing agency of this or any other state may subpoena financial records and other information needed to establish parentage or to establish, modify or enforce a support order. The subpoena may be served on a party or on a public or private entity. Service of the subpoena may be by certified mail.

      (2) A party or public or private entity that discloses information to the enforcing agency in compliance with a subpoena served under subsection (1) of this section is not liable to any person for any loss, damage or injury arising out of the disclosure.

      (3) Upon request of an enforcing agency of another state, only a court or enforcing agency of Oregon may enforce a subpoena issued by the enforcing agency of the other state.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 192.600, a party or public or private entity that fails without good cause to comply with a subpoena issued under this section is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250. A civil penalty under this section must be imposed in the manner provided by ORS 183.745.

      (5) The Department of Justice shall adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section. [1997 c.746 §33; 2003 c.73 §21; 2017 c.651 §10]

 

      Note: 25.082 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 25 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.083 High-volume automated administrative enforcement services. (1) As necessary to meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 666(a)(14), the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice, when requested by another state, shall provide high-volume automated administrative enforcement services. In providing services to another state under this section, the division may:

      (a) Through automated data matches with financial institutions and other entities where assets may be found, identify assets owned by persons who owe child support in other states; and

      (b) Seize such assets by execution as defined in ORS 18.005 or by such other processes to seize property as the division is authorized by law to use.

      (2) A request by another state for services provided under subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) Must include information, as required by rule, that will enable the department to compare the information about the case with information in databases within Oregon; and

      (b) Constitutes a certification by the state requesting the services:

      (A) Of the amount of periodic support under an order, the payment of which is in arrears; and

      (B) That it has complied with all procedural due process requirements applicable to the case.

      (3) The administrator is authorized to request from other states services of the type provided under subsection (1) of this section. [1999 c.930 §2; 2001 c.249 §71; 2003 c.576 §576]

 

      25.084 Assignment of rights or written application required for services; incorporation in judgment. (1) The administrator may provide support enforcement services as described in ORS 25.080 only if support rights have been assigned to the state or if a person has provided a written application to the administrator that:

      (a) Is signed by the person; and

      (b) Indicates that the person is applying for child support services.

      (2) Any support judgment that provides for payment to the Department of Justice under ORS 25.020 may have an application incorporated in the judgment. [2009 c.352 §2; 2011 c.318 §5; 2019 c.291 §3]

 

      Note: 25.084 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 25 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.085 Service on obligee; methods. (1) In any proceeding under ORS 25.080, service of legal documents upon an obligee may be by regular mail to the address at which the obligee receives public assistance, to an address provided by the obligee on the obligee’s application for child support enforcement services or to any other address given by the obligee. When service is authorized by regular mail under this section, proof of service may be by notation upon the computerized case record made by the person making the mailing. The notation must set forth the address to which the documents were mailed, the date they were mailed, the description of the documents mailed and the name of the person making the notation. If the documents are returned by the postal service as undeliverable as addressed, that fact must be noted on the computerized case record. If no new address for service by regular mail can be obtained, service must be by certified mail, return receipt requested, by personal service upon the obligee, or by any other mail service with delivery confirmation.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 25.501 to 25.556 or this chapter or ORS chapter 110, when a case is referred to this state by a public child support agency of another state for action in this state, there is no requirement that an obligee, present in the initiating state and receiving child support enforcement services from that state, be served in any action taken in this state as a consequence of the interstate referral. In such cases the requirement to serve the obligee that would otherwise apply is satisfied by sending to the initiating agency in the other state, by regular mail, any documents that would otherwise be served upon the obligee.

      (3) The appropriate child support agency of the state shall make any mailings to or service upon the obligee that is required by this section. [1993 c.596 §17; 1995 c.608 §26; 1997 c.249 §16; 1999 c.87 §1; 2003 c.572 §4; 2011 c.318 §8; 2019 c.13 §9]

 

      Note: 25.085 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 25 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.088 Effect of dismissal of judicial proceeding on existing administrative order of support. Unless otherwise provided, a general judgment of dismissal of a judicial proceeding under ORS chapter 107, 108 or 109 for want of prosecution under ORCP 54 B(3) does not dismiss an administrative support order that was entered under ORS 25.501 to 25.556 before the date of the dismissal where the parental parties involved in the judicial proceeding are the same as those affected by the administrative order of support. [2013 c.185 §2]

 

      Note: 25.088 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 25 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.089 Enforcement and modification of child support judgments. (1) As used in this section, “child support judgment” means the terms of a judgment or order of a court, or an order that has been filed under ORS 25.529, that provide for past or current child support, including medical support as defined in ORS 25.321. “Child support judgment” does not include any term of a judgment or order that deals with matters other than child support.

      (2)(a) A child support judgment originating under ORS 25.529 has all the force, effect and attributes of a circuit court judgment. The judgment lien created by a child support judgment originating under ORS 25.529 applies to all arrearages owed under the underlying order from the date the administrator or administrative law judge entered, filed or registered the underlying order under ORS 25.501 to 25.556 or ORS chapter 110.

      (b) Until the underlying order is filed under ORS 25.529, the order may not be enforced against and has no lien effect on real property.

      (c) No action to enforce a child support judgment originating under ORS 25.529 may be taken while the child support judgment is stayed under ORS 25.513, except as permitted in the order granting the stay.

      (3) In any judicial or administrative proceeding in which child support may be awarded under this chapter or ORS chapter 107, 108, 109 or 110 or ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 125.025, 419B.400 or 419C.590, if a child support judgment already exists with regard to the same obligor and child:

      (a) A court may only enforce the existing child support judgment, modify the existing child support judgment as specifically authorized by law or set aside the existing child support judgment under subsection (6) of this section or under the provisions of ORCP 71. If the court sets aside the existing child support judgment, the court may issue a new child support judgment.

      (b) The administrator or administrative law judge may only enforce the existing child support judgment, modify the existing child support judgment as specifically authorized by law or, with regard to an existing child support judgment originating under ORS 25.501, move to set aside the existing child support judgment under subsection (6) of this section or for the reasons set out in ORCP 71.

      (4) If the administrator or administrative law judge finds that there exist two or more child support judgments involving the same obligor and child and the same period of time, the administrator or administrative law judge shall apply the provisions of ORS 25.531.

      (5)(a) If the court finds that there exist two or more child support judgments involving the same obligor and child and the same period of time, and each judgment was issued in this state, the court shall apply the provisions of ORS 25.091 to determine the controlling terms of the child support judgments and to issue a governing child support judgment as defined in ORS 25.091.

      (b) If the court finds that there exist two or more child support judgments involving the same obligor and child and the same period of time, and one or more of the judgments was issued by a tribunal of another state, the court shall apply the provisions of ORS chapter 110 to determine which judgment is the controlling child support order.

      (6) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, a court may modify or set aside a child support judgment issued in this state when:

      (a) The child support judgment was issued without prior notice to the issuing court, administrator or administrative law judge that:

      (A) There was pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the child; or

      (B) There existed in this state or any other jurisdiction another child support judgment involving the child; or

      (b) The child support judgment was issued after another child support judgment, and the later judgment did not enforce, modify or set aside the earlier judgment in accordance with this section.

      (7) When modifying a child support judgment, the court, administrator or administrative law judge shall specify in the modification judgment the effects of the modification on the child support judgment being modified. [2003 c.146 §2; 2003 c.576 §298a; 2005 c.22 §14; 2009 c.351 §5; 2019 c.13 §10]

 

      Note: 25.089 and 25.091 were added to and made a part of ORS chapter 25 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.090 [Formerly 23.790; repealed by 1999 c.80 §95]

 

      25.091 Multiple child support judgments. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Child support judgment” has the meaning given that term in ORS 25.089.

      (b) “Governing child support judgment” means a child support judgment issued in this state that addresses child support, including medical support as defined in ORS 25.321, and is entitled to exclusive prospective enforcement or modification with respect to any earlier child support judgment issued in this state.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or ORS 25.089, when two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child and one or more of the judgments was issued by a tribunal of another state, the court shall apply the provisions of ORS chapter 110 before enforcing or modifying a judgment under this section or ORS 25.089.

      (3) When two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child and the same period, any party to one or more of the child support judgments or the administrator, under ORS 25.531, may file a petition with the court for a governing child support judgment under this section. When a matter involving a child is before the court and the court finds that two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child and the same period, the court on its own motion, and after notice to all affected parties, may determine the controlling terms of the child support judgments and issue a governing child support judgment under this section.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, when two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child and the same period, and each judgment was issued in this state, there is a presumption that the terms of the last-issued child support judgment are the controlling terms and terminate contrary terms of each earlier-issued child support judgment.

      (b) If the earlier-issued child support judgment requires provision of a specific type of child support and the last-issued child support judgment is silent with respect to that type of child support, the requirement of the earlier-issued child support judgment continues in effect.

      (5) A party may rebut the presumption in subsection (4) of this section by showing that:

      (a) The last-issued child support judgment should be set aside under the provisions of ORCP 71;

      (b) The last-issued child support judgment was issued without prior notice to the issuing court, administrator or administrative law judge that:

      (A) There was pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the child; or

      (B) There existed in this state or any other jurisdiction another child support judgment involving the child; or

      (c) The last-issued child support judgment was issued after an earlier child support judgment and did not enforce, modify or set aside the earlier child support judgment in accordance with ORS 25.089.

      (6) When a court finds that two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child and the same period, and each child support judgment was issued in this state, the court shall set the matter for hearing to determine the controlling terms of the child support judgments. When the child support judgments were issued in different counties of this state, the court may designate an auxiliary court under ORS 25.100.

      (7) Following a review of each child support judgment and any other evidence admitted by the court:

      (a) The court shall apply the presumption in subsection (4) of this section, unless the presumption is rebutted, and shall determine the controlling terms of the child support judgments; and

      (b) Notwithstanding ORS 25.089 (3), the court shall issue a governing child support judgment addressing child support, including medical support as defined in ORS 25.321, for the benefit of the child.

      (8) The governing child support judgment must include:

      (a) A reference to each child support judgment considered and a copy of the judgment;

      (b) A determination of which terms regarding child support, including medical support as defined in ORS 25.321, are controlling and which child support judgment or judgments contain those terms;

      (c) An affirmation, termination or modification of the terms regarding child support, including medical support as defined in ORS 25.321, in each of the child support judgments;

      (d) Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, a reconciliation of any child support arrears or credits under all of the child support judgments; and

      (e) The effective date of each controlling term and the termination date of each noncontrolling term in each of the child support judgments. In determining these dates, the court may apply the following:

      (A) A controlling term is effective on the date specified in the child support judgment containing that term or, if no date is specified, on the date the child support judgment was entered as described in ORS 18.075.

      (B) A noncontrolling term is terminated on the date the governing child support judgment is entered as described in ORS 18.075.

      (9) The court may order the parties, in a separate proceeding under ORS 25.167 or 25.540, to reconcile any child support arrears or credits under all of the child support judgments.

      (10) When the governing child support judgment is entered as described in ORS 18.075, the noncontrolling terms of each earlier child support judgment are terminated. However, subject to subsection (11) of this section, the entry of the governing child support judgment does not affect any child support payment arrearage or any liability related to medical support, as defined in ORS 25.321, that has accrued under a child support judgment before the governing child support judgment is entered.

      (11) For purposes of reconciling any child support arrears or credits under all of the child support judgments, amounts collected and credited for a particular period under one child support judgment must be credited against the amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under any other child support judgment.

      (12) Not sooner than 30 days and not later than 60 days after entry of the governing child support judgment, a party named by the court, or the petitioner if the court names no other party, shall file a copy of the governing child support judgment with each court or the administrator that issued an earlier child support judgment. A party who fails to file a copy of the governing child support judgment as required by this subsection is subject to monetary sanctions, including but not limited to attorney fees, costs and disbursements. A failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the governing child support judgment.

      (13) This section applies to any judicial proceeding in which child support may be awarded or modified under this chapter or ORS chapter 107, 108 or 109 or ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 125.025, 419B.400, 419B.923, 419C.590 or 419C.610. [2003 c.146 §3; 2005 c.22 §15; 2005 c.83 §2; 2009 c.351 §6; 2017 c.252 §4; 2019 c.13 §11]

      25.095 Later-issued child support judgment. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Administrator” has the meaning given that term in ORS 25.010.

      (b) “Child support judgment” has the meaning given that term in ORS 25.089.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 25.089, 25.091 and 25.531 to the contrary, the terms of a child support judgment originating under ORS 25.529 are terminated by the terms of a later-issued child support judgment of a court if:

      (a) The two child support judgments involve the same obligor and child and the same period;

      (b) The administrator is providing services under ORS 25.080;

      (c) The administrator or a court gives the later-issued child support judgment precedence over the earlier-issued child support judgment originating under ORS 25.529; and

      (d) All parties had an opportunity to challenge the amount of child support ordered in the later-issued child support judgment.

      (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 25.091 (11) and 25.531 (7), for purposes of reconciling any support payment records under the two child support judgments described in subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) The terms of the child support judgment originating under ORS 25.529 are deemed terminated on the effective date of the later-issued child support judgment; and

      (b) Entry of the later-issued child support judgment does not affect any support payment arrearage or credit that has accrued under the earlier-issued child support judgment originating under ORS 25.529. [2005 c.83 §1; 2007 c.356 §2; 2015 c.73 §1]

      25.100 Designation of auxiliary court in county where party resides or property located. (1) With respect to any order or judgment entered pursuant to ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 107.095, 107.105, 108.120, 109.155, 419B.400 or 419C.590 or ORS chapter 110, if a party seeking modification or enforcement of an order or judgment for the payment of money files a certificate to the effect that a party is presently in another county of this state, the court may, upon motion of the party, enter an order designating the circuit court of any county in this state in which the obligee or obligor resides, or in which property of the obligor is located, as an auxiliary court for purposes of the order or judgment.

      (2) The clerk of the circuit court in which the original order or judgment was entered shall notify the auxiliary court of the order designating the auxiliary court. [Formerly 23.795; 1993 c.33 §283; 1995 c.608 §27; 1995 c.609 §4; 1997 c.704 §18; 1999 c.80 §43; 2003 c.576 §296; 2017 c.252 §3]

 

      25.110 Jurisdiction of designated auxiliary court. (1) Upon entry of an order designating an auxiliary court under ORS 25.100, the auxiliary court has jurisdiction to compel compliance with an order or judgment for payment of support the same as if it were the court that made and entered the original order or judgment.

      (2) The only courts that have jurisdiction to modify any provision of the original order or judgment are:

      (a) The court having original jurisdiction of the cause in which the order or judgment was entered; and

      (b) An auxiliary court designated under ORS 25.100.

      (3) When an auxiliary court enters an order or judgment under this section, the clerk of the auxiliary court shall forward the order or judgment to the clerk of the court in which the original order or judgment was entered. The clerk of the court in which the original order or judgment was entered shall file the auxiliary court’s order or judgment in the original court file. [Formerly 23.800; 2003 c.576 §297; 2017 c.252 §6]

 

      25.120 [Formerly 23.805; 1993 c.33 §284; repealed by 1999 c.80 §95]

 

      25.125 Disposition of support obligation overpayments; liquidated debts in favor of state; rules. (1) The Department of Justice may return moneys to an obligor when the department determines that the obligor has paid more moneys than are due under a support obligation. However, when the obligor has an ongoing support obligation, the department may give the obligor credit for the excess amount paid and apply the credit to the future support obligation until the credit is fully used. When the department applies a credit to offset a future support obligation, the department shall so notify the obligee. The notice must inform the obligee that, if the obligee requests, the department will conduct an administrative review to determine if the record keeping and accounting related to the calculation of the credit balance is correct. The department shall conduct the administrative review within 30 days after receiving the request.

      (2) An overpayment in favor of the state is created when the Department of Justice, under ORS 25.020, has transmitted moneys to any person or entity, including but not limited to an obligor, an obligee, a child support agency of another state or an agency of this state, and:

      (a) The amount transmitted is attributable in whole or in part to a tax refund offset collection all or part of which has been taken back by the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Revenue; or

      (b) The Department of Justice performed an accounting adjustment that resulted in the refund, reallocation or redistribution of the amount transmitted to the state or any other person or entity.

      (3)(a) The person or entity to which the moneys were transmitted owes the amount of the overpayment to the state. The Department of Justice shall:

      (A) Attempt to recover the overpayment if it is cost-effective to do so;

      (B) Notify the person or entity to whom the overpayment was made that the person or entity owes money to the state and specify the amount of the overpayment to be returned to the department; and

      (C) Give the person or entity opportunity to object.

      (b) If the person or entity does not file a timely written objection, the overpayment amount determined by the department becomes a liquidated debt and creates an account receivable owed to the department, and the provisions of subsection (4) of this section apply. If the department does not resolve an objection to the person’s or entity’s satisfaction, an administrative law judge assigned from the Office of Administrative Hearings shall hear the objection. An order by the administrative law judge becomes a liquidated debt and creates an account receivable owed to the department. The person or entity may appeal the decision of an administrative law judge to the circuit court for a hearing de novo.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, if an agency of this or another state owes the overpayment, the agency shall return the amount of the overpayment to the department without notice and opportunity to object.

      (4)(a) The amount of the overpayment specified in subsection (3)(a) of this section is a liquidated debt owed to the state and an associated account receivable. The Department of Justice may recover the debt by obtaining from the obligee an agreement to apply all or a portion of future support payments to the account receivable or in any other way permitted by law.

      (b) Accounts receivable are considered delinquent for purposes of this subsection and are subject to the provisions of ORS chapter 293 if:

      (A) The person or entity fails to make full payment within 90 days of liquidation; or

      (B) A period of 90 days elapses without a payment as required by a payment agreement between the department and the obligated person or entity.

      (5)(a) In addition to the account receivable created under subsection (2) of this section, a debt in favor of the state and an associated account receivable are created when:

      (A) The Department of Justice receives payment for support amounts due from an obligor, a withholder subject to an order to withhold under this chapter or another issuer on behalf of an obligor;

      (B) The department transmits the amount to any other person or entity; and

      (C) The payment is dishonored or reversed.

      (b) When a debt is created under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the amount of money specified in the payment is owed to the state, and the department may collect the debt from one of the following:

      (A) The obligor, regardless of who presented the check.

      (B) The withholder, if the withholder presented the check.

      (C) The other issuer, if another issuer presented the check.

      (D) The person or entity to which the amount was transmitted by the department.

      (c) The department shall:

      (A) Attempt to recover the debt if it is cost-effective to do so;

      (B) Notify the obligor, withholder or other issuer who made the payment that the person or entity owes the money to the state; and

      (C) Specify the amount of the debt to be paid to the department.

      (d) The amount of the debt specified in paragraph (c) of this subsection is a liquidated debt owed to the state and an account receivable. The department may recover the debt and collect on the account receivable in any way permitted under law.

      (e) Accounts receivable are considered delinquent for purposes of this subsection and are subject to the provisions of ORS chapter 293 when:

      (A) The person or entity fails to make full payment within 90 days of liquidation; or

      (B) A period of 90 days elapses without a payment as required by a payment agreement between the department and the obligated person or entity.

      (6) The Department of Justice shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section. [1997 c.385 §2; 2001 c.961 §2; 2003 c.73 §22a; 2003 c.75 §72; 2003 c.572 §5; 2005 c.560 §3; 2015 c.72 §1; 2015 c.74 §1; 2017 c.459 §1; 2019 c.290 §3; 2019 c.291 §4]

 

      25.130 Election of alternative support payment method; termination of election. (1) The parties may elect to make support payments as provided in ORS 25.030 unless the provisions of ORS 25.020 (1) apply. The election terminates when the provisions of ORS 25.020 (1) apply subsequent to the election.

      (2) The election must be in writing and filed with the court that entered the support order. The election must be signed by both the obligor and the obligee and must specify the amount of the support payment, the date payment is due, the court order number and:

      (a) The account number of the checking or savings account that is to be used; or

      (b) The name of an escrow agent, licensed under ORS 696.511, to whom, and the account number into which, the payments are to be electronically transferred.

      (3) Notice of termination of the bank or escrow agent option and payment requirements pursuant to ORS 25.020 or 25.030 shall be sent by the Department of Justice to the obligor’s and to the obligee’s last-known address. [Formerly 23.807; 1993 c.596 §3; 1995 c.608 §8; 1997 c.704 §19; 1999 c.80 §80; 2003 c.210 §2]

 

      25.140 Copies of new or modified support orders to department. Counties that have heretofore transferred the collection, accounting and disbursement responsibilities to the Department of Justice, or that have elected not to maintain support collections, accounting and disbursement services, and clerks of courts not maintaining support collection services, shall forward to the department copies of all new and modified support orders, satisfactions or other pertinent documents in a timely manner. [Formerly 23.808; 1997 c.704 §20]

 

      25.150 Department to collect fees for services. The Department of Justice shall assess and collect any fees for establishment, enforcement, collection, accounting and disbursement services required by state law or administrative rule or by federal law or regulation, including the annual fee required under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. [Formerly 23.815; 1997 c.704 §21; 1999 c.80 §81; 2007 c.878 §2]

 

      25.160 Referral of support cases to department; duration of collection services. (1) For the purposes of ORS 25.020, 25.030, 25.070, 25.080, 25.085 and 25.130 to 25.160, a child support case shall be referred to the Department of Justice for provision of collection, accounting and disbursement services if an application as described in ORS 25.084 is made to the district attorney or to the Division of Child Support and the case qualifies for support enforcement services under federal regulations and state law.

      (2) The Department of Justice shall continue collection, accounting and disbursement services for a case referred to the department under subsection (1) of this section until notified by the district attorney or the Division of Child Support that enforcement action has been discontinued. [Formerly 23.825; 1997 c.704 §22; 1999 c.80 §82; 2009 c.352 §5]

 

      25.164 Payment of support through Department of Justice; application. (1) If the payment method for support payments set forth in the support judgment does not require that payments be made through the Department of Justice, an application may be made to the department for support enforcement services under this chapter and under federal laws and regulations relating to support payments and enforcement of judgments. An application under this section may be made by an obligee, by an obligor, by a person having physical custody of a minor child or by a child attending school, as defined in ORS 107.108.

      (2) An application under subsection (1) of this section must be in the form prescribed by ORS 25.084.

      (3) If an application is made under subsection (1) of this section, the administrator shall give notice to all parties that the application has been made. All support payments under the judgment that are due after the notice is given must be made through the department.

      (4) When an application is made under this section, the method of support accounting previously used for the support judgment terminates on the first day of the month following the month the application is made, and the department shall thereafter provide support accounting for the support judgment and disburse amounts paid under the judgment.

      (5) If an application is made under this section and a complete record of support payments does not exist, the department may establish a record of arrearage under ORS 25.167. [Formerly 25.320; 2003 c.146 §6; 2009 c.352 §6]

 

      25.165 Application of support payments; rules. The Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice shall adopt rules that:

      (1) Require distribution of payments to child, medical or spousal support obligations and arrears in any sequence that is consistent with federal law;

      (2) Permit the division to develop criteria for when the division may override the debtor’s designation of the particular support debt to which the payment of child support or spousal support is applied; and

      (3) Provide the manner in which payments of child, medical or spousal support shall be applied to principal and interest that is due and owing on such obligations and arrears, irrespective of any contrary law. [2017 c.458 §2]

 

      Note: 25.165 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 25 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.166 Support payment due dates. (1) Any court order or administrative order issued or modified in a proceeding under ORS 25.501 to 25.556 or ORS chapter 107, 108, 109, 110, 419B or 419C that contains an order for the payment of child support or spousal support must specify an initial due date and year for the payment of support that is on the first day of a calendar month, with subsequent payments due on the first day of each subsequent month for which the support is payable.

      (2) For purposes of support enforcement, any support payment that becomes due and payable on a day other than the first day of the month in which the payment is due shall be enforceable by income withholding as of the first day of that month.

      (3) Any court order or administrative order that contains an award of child, medical or spousal support that accrues on other than a monthly basis may, for income withholding and administrative support billing purposes only, be converted to a monthly amount.

      (4) Support payments become delinquent only if not paid in full within one month of the payment due date. A monthly child support obligation that is to be paid in two or more installments does not become delinquent until the obligation is not paid in full by the due date for the first installment in the next month. This subsection does not apply to the accrual of interest under ORS 82.010.

      (5) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not apply to the determination or issuance of support arrearage liens, installment arrearage liens, judgment liens, writs of garnishment or any other action or proceeding that affects property rights under ORS chapter 18. [2017 c.462 §1; 2019 c.13 §12; 2019 c.291 §5]

 

      Note: 25.166 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 25 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.167 Procedure for determining arrearages. This section establishes procedures for determining the amount of arrearage and for making a record of arrearage of support payments. All of the following apply to this section:

      (1) A record of support payment arrearage may be established by:

      (a) Court order;

      (b) A governing child support judgment issued under ORS 25.091 or 25.531;

      (c) Administrative order issued under ORS 25.513 or 25.540;

      (d) Stipulation of the parties; or

      (e) The procedures under subsection (2) of this section whenever an existing child or spousal support case enters the Department of Justice records system without a current payment record maintained by any court clerk.

      (2) When allowed under subsection (1) of this section, arrearage amounts may be established under this subsection. All of the following apply to this subsection:

      (a) The obligee or obligor may execute a certificate in a form acceptable to the Department of Justice that states the total amount owed or the payment history in as much detail as is necessary to demonstrate the periods and amounts of any arrearage.

      (b) The person making the certificate shall file the original certificate with the court in which the support judgment was entered. When a governing child support judgment has been issued, the person making the certificate shall file the original certificate with the court that issued the governing child support judgment.

      (c) The person making the certificate shall serve a true copy of the certificate upon the other party together with a notice that the certificate will be the basis of a permanent record unless the other party files objections.

      (d) For objections to be valid under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the other party must file the objection with the court within 30 days from the date of service of the certificate and must mail or serve true copies of the objections on both the party who filed the certificate and either:

      (A) The district attorney; or

      (B) If support rights are or have been assigned to the State of Oregon at any time within the last five months or if arrears under the support judgment are so assigned, the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice.

      (e) If objections are filed within the time allowed, the party filing the certificate must file a supplemental certificate that is in a form acceptable to the department and that provides any information concerning the payment history that the department determines necessary.

      (f) If objections are filed within the time allowed, the district attorney or the Division of Child Support shall cause the case to be set for a court hearing. At the hearing, the court shall consider the correctness of the certificate but may not consider objections to the merits of the support judgment. The parties may settle the case by written agreement anytime before the court hearing. Notice of the court hearing shall be served upon the party filing the objections as authorized in ORCP 9 B.

      (g) If no objections are filed under this subsection within the time allowed, the amount of arrearage stated in the certificate is the amount owed for purposes of any subsequent action. The district attorney or the Division of Child Support shall file with the court a certificate stating the arrearage established under this paragraph.

      (3) When an application for support enforcement services is made under ORS 25.164, an agency or court may not take or allow any ex parte enforcement action on amounts owed as arrearage from before the time that the Department of Justice commences support accounting and disbursement until the amount is established under this section. This subsection does not prohibit or limit any enforcement action on support payments that become due subsequent to the department’s commencement of support accounting and disbursement under ORS 25.164.

      (4) In any determination under this section, a canceled check, payable to the obligee, indorsed by the obligee or deposited to an account of the obligee, drawn on the account of the obligor and marked as child support shall be prima facie evidence that child support was paid to the obligee in the amount shown on the face of the check. It is immaterial that the check was signed by a person other than the obligor, provided that the person who signed the check was an authorized signatory of checks drawn on the account. [Formerly 25.330; 2003 c.146 §7; 2003 c.576 §298; 2009 c.352 §7; 2011 c.318 §1]

 

      25.170 Proceedings to require delinquent obligor to appear for examination of financial circumstances. When a support obligation is more than one month in arrears, the Attorney General or a district attorney may upon motion obtain an order requiring the obligor to appear for the purpose of examination regarding the obligor’s financial circumstances. The court shall require the obligor to appear at a time and date certain at such place as may be appropriate. The order to appear shall inform the obligor that the obligor’s answers may be used in subsequent enforcement and possible criminal proceedings, and that the obligor has a right to be represented by an attorney at the examination. The order shall be served upon the obligor in the same manner as service of summons. The order to appear shall also be served upon the obligee by regular mail. The obligee shall have the right to attend any such examination. [Formerly 23.835; 1989 c.599 §1; 1993 c.596 §4]

 

      25.180 Examination of obligor’s financial circumstances. (1) The examination shall be conducted under oath by an employee of the Department of Justice or district attorney. The employee shall inform the obligor that the obligor’s answers may be used in subsequent enforcement and possible criminal proceedings, and that the obligor has a right to be represented by an attorney at the examination. A record of the examination may be made by either stenographic or electronic means. The obligor may be examined in regard to the obligor’s income and property, and to any matter relevant to the obligor’s ability to pay support.

      (2) An obligee or the obligee’s attorney may examine the obligor in a proceeding conducted under this section. [Formerly 23.837; 1989 c.599 §2; 1993 c.596 §5]

 

      25.190 Continuance of proceedings; certification of matter to court; service of notice to obligor and obligee. (1) The examination may be continued for further review of the obligor’s financial circumstances and employment, or the matter may be certified to the court for a contempt hearing on the issue of failure to pay support as ordered. If the examination is to be continued for further review or is to be certified to the court for a contempt hearing, the obligor shall be served at the examination with a notice stating the time, date and place for further examination or hearing before the court. Service may be made by an employee of the Department of Justice or district attorney.

      (2) Any notice served upon the obligor regarding a continuation of the examination or regarding the certification of the matter to the court for a contempt hearing must also be served upon the obligee. Such service upon the obligee may be by regular mail. [Formerly 23.842; 1989 c.599 §3; 1993 c.596 §6]

 

      25.200 Arrest of obligor for failure to appear. (1) If the obligor fails to appear for examination or further examination, the Attorney General or a district attorney may apply to the court which issued the order to appear for an order directing the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the obligor. The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit which shall state the relevant facts and whether the obligor contacted the Department of Justice or district attorney, as appropriate. If the court finds that the obligor had notice and failed to appear, the court shall order the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the obligor in order to bring the obligor before the court to show cause why the obligor should not be held in contempt for a failure to appear as ordered.

      (2) If the matter has been certified to the court for a contempt hearing and the obligor, having been properly served, fails to appear, the court shall order the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the obligor. Upon arrest, the obligor shall be brought before the court to show cause why the obligor should not be held in contempt for a failure to appear as ordered. [Formerly 23.845; 1989 c.599 §4]

 

      25.210 Use of obligor’s property for delinquent support payments. If by examination of the obligor it appears that the obligor has any property liable to execution, the court, upon motion of the Attorney General or a district attorney, shall order that the obligor apply the same in satisfaction of the arrears or that the property be levied on by execution, or both. [Formerly 23.847; 1989 c.599 §5]

 

      25.213 Assignment of proceeds of insurance policy to secure support obligation. If by examination of the obligor under ORS 25.170, it appears that the obligor is the beneficiary and owner of an insurance policy on the life of the child, the court, upon motion of the Attorney General or a district attorney, may order that the obligor assign to the obligee the rights to as much of the proceeds of the insurance policy as necessary to secure the obligation to make support payments, if assignment is permitted in the policy. This assignment shall be in addition to any other security ordered by the court. [1997 c.54 §2]

 

      25.220 Computer records of administrator; evidence of authenticity not required in support proceedings; evidentiary effect. (1) In any proceeding to establish, enforce or modify a support obligation, extrinsic evidence of authenticity is not required as a condition precedent to the admission of a computer record of the administrator that may reflect the employment records of a parent, the support payment record of an obligor, the payment of public assistance, the amounts paid, the period during which public assistance was paid, the persons receiving or having received assistance and any other pertinent information, if the record bears a seal purporting to be that of the administrator and is certified as a true copy by original, electronic or facsimile signature of a person purporting to be an officer or employee of the administrator. Records certified in accordance with this section constitute prima facie evidence of the existence of the facts stated therein.

      (2) To the extent permitted under federal and state law, obligors and obligees, and their attorneys, may obtain copies of such records upon request made to the administrator. [Formerly 23.855; 1989 c.519 §1; 1997 c.704 §23; 1999 c.735 §19; 2019 c.291 §6]

 

      25.230 Court authorized to require security for support payments. Whenever a court has entered an order for the payment of support, the court may provide for such security, bond or other guarantee satisfactory to the court to secure the obligation to make support payments. [Formerly 23.865]

 

      25.240 Order to pay support by parent with legal custody of minor. Notwithstanding any other law, when a court or the administrator has the authority under ORS chapter 107, 108, 109 or 110 or ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 419B.400 to 419B.406 or 419C.590, 419C.592 and 419C.597 to require a parent without legal custody to pay support for a minor child, the court or administrator may require a parent with legal custody to pay support for the child as long as that parent does not have physical custody of the child or is not providing the child with the necessities of life, including but not limited to lodging, food and clothing. [1985 c.610 §11; 1993 c.33 §368; 1995 c.608 §28; 2001 c.455 §5; 2019 c.13 §13]

 

      25.241 Suspension of enforcement or holdback of moneys received during pendency of certain actions; rules. (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, when an action is pending to modify, terminate, satisfy, vacate or set aside a support order, the administrator may:

      (a) Suspend enforcement of the support order; or

      (b) Hold some or all moneys received from, or received on behalf of, an obligor under a support order for possible refund, reallocation or redistribution upon resolution of the pending action.

      (2) The Department of Justice may suspend enforcement of a support order or hold moneys received from, or received on behalf of, an obligor under a support order as described in subsection (1) of this section if the administrator determines that:

      (a) Collection of child support will impair the ability of the obligor with physical custody of all of the parties’ children to provide direct support to the children; or

      (b) Resolution of the pending action will result in:

      (A) A payee receiving more moneys than are due to the payee; or

      (B) An adjustment that may cause an overpayment in favor of the state under ORS 25.125 (2).

      (3) The administrator shall notify the parties when it suspends enforcement of a support order or holds moneys received under a support order under subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) Any party may request an administrative review of the administrator’s actions under subsections (1) and (2) of this section by submitting a written request for administrative review to the department. No later than 30 days following the receipt of a written request for administrative review, the department shall conduct an administrative review to determine if the department will resume enforcement of the support order or release moneys received under the support order to a party. A party may appeal the administrator’s decision under ORS 183.484.

      (5) The department shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section. [2019 c.290 §2]

 

      Note: 25.241 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 25 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.243 Grievance procedure; rules. In addition to any other hearing rights authorized by law, an applicant for services provided under ORS 25.080 and any party to a child support order for which services are provided under ORS 25.080 may file a grievance with the Department of Justice concerning any service provided under ORS 25.080. The department shall adopt rules establishing a process for handling grievances under this section. The process must provide that grievances not involving a public child support agency in another state be addressed no later than 90 days after the grievance is submitted to the department. [1995 c.608 §45; 2003 c.73 §23]

 

      25.245 Rebuttable presumption of inability to pay child support when parent receiving certain assistance payments; rules. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of Oregon law, a parent who is eligible for and receiving cash payments under ORS 412.001 to 412.069, Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, the general assistance program as provided in ORS chapter 411 or a general assistance program of another state or tribe, the Oregon Supplemental Income Program or the federal Supplemental Security Income Program shall be rebuttably presumed unable to pay child support and a child support obligation does not accrue unless the presumption is rebutted.

      (2) Each month, the Department of Human Services shall identify those persons receiving cash payments under the programs listed in subsection (1) of this section that are administered by the State of Oregon and provide that information to the administrator. If benefits are received from programs listed in subsection (1) of this section that are administered by other states, tribes or federal agencies, the obligor shall provide the administrator with written documentation of the benefits. The Department of Human Services shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.

      (3) The administrator shall refer to the information provided in subsection (2) of this section prior to establishing any child support obligation. Within 30 days following identification of persons under subsection (2) of this section, the entity responsible for support enforcement services under ORS 25.080 shall provide notice of the presumption to the obligee and obligor and shall inform all parties to the support order that, unless a party objects as provided in subsection (4) of this section, child support shall cease accruing beginning with the support payment due on or after the date the obligor first begins receiving the cash payments and continuing through the support payment due in the last month in which the obligor received the cash payments. The entity responsible for support enforcement services shall serve the notice on the obligee in the manner provided for the service of summons in a civil action, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other mail service with delivery confirmation and shall serve the notice on the obligor by first class mail to the obligor’s last-known address. The notice shall specify the month in which cash payments are first made and shall contain a statement that the administrator represents the state and that low cost legal counsel may be available.

      (4) A party may object to the presumption by sending an objection to the entity responsible for support enforcement services under ORS 25.080 within 30 days after the date of service of the notice. The objection must describe the resources of the obligor or other evidence that might rebut the presumption of inability to pay child support. The entity receiving the objection shall cause the case to be set for a hearing before a court or an administrative law judge. The court or administrative law judge may consider only whether the presumption has been rebutted.

      (5) If no objection is made, or if the court or administrative law judge finds that the presumption has not been rebutted, the Department of Justice shall discontinue billing the obligor for the period of time described in subsection (3) of this section and no arrearage shall accrue for the period during which the obligor is not billed. In addition, the entity providing support enforcement services shall file with the circuit court in which the support order or judgment has been entered a copy of the notice described in subsection (3) of this section or, if an objection is made and the presumption is not rebutted, a copy of the administrative law judge’s order.

      (6)(a) Within 30 days after the date the obligor ceases receiving cash payments under a program listed in subsection (1) of this section, the Department of Justice shall provide notice to all parties to the support order:

      (A) Specifying the last month in which a cash payment was made;

      (B) Stating that the payment of those benefits has terminated and that by operation of law billing and accrual of support resumes; and

      (C) Informing the parties of their rights to request a review and modification of the support order based on a substantial change in circumstance or pursuant to ORS 25.287 or any other provision of law.

      (b) The notice shall include a statement that the administrator represents the state and that low cost legal counsel may be available.

      (c) The entity providing enforcement services shall file a copy of the notice required by paragraph (a) of this subsection with the circuit court in which the support order or judgment has been entered.

      (7) Receipt by a child support obligor of cash payments under any of the programs listed in subsection (1) of this section shall be sufficient cause for a court or administrative law judge to allow a credit and satisfaction against child support arrearage for months that the obligor received the cash payments.

      (8) The notice and finding of financial responsibility required by ORS 25.511 shall include notice of the presumption, nonaccrual and arrearage credit rights provided for in this section.

      (9) The presumption, nonaccrual and arrearage credit rights created by this section shall apply whether or not child support enforcement services are being provided under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.

      (10) Application of the presumption, nonaccrual and arrearage credit rights created by this section does not constitute a modification but does not limit the right of any party to seek a modification of a support order based upon a change of circumstances or pursuant to ORS 25.287 or any other provision of law. In determining whether a change in circumstances has occurred or whether three years have elapsed, or such shorter cycle as determined by rule of the Department of Justice, since entry of a support order, the court or administrative law judge may not consider any action taken under this section as entry of a support order. The presumption stated in subsection (1) of this section applies in any modification proceeding. [1991 c.520 §3; 1993 c.799 §1; 1997 c.704 §24; 2001 c.104 §5; 2001 c.455 §6; 2003 c.75 §73; 2003 c.576 §299; 2007 c.861 §11; 2007 c.878 §3; 2009 c.80 §1; 2011 c.318 §2]

 

      25.247 Rebuttable presumption of inability to pay child support when obligor incarcerated; rules. (1) An obligor who is incarcerated for a period of 180 or more consecutive days shall be rebuttably presumed unable to pay child support and a child support obligation does not accrue for the duration of the incarceration unless the presumption is rebutted as provided in this section or as determined by the court.

      (2) The Department of Justice and the Department of Corrections shall enter into an agreement to conduct data matches to identify the obligors described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Within 30 days following identification of an obligor described in subsection (1) of this section whose child support obligation has not already been modified due to incarceration, the entity responsible for support enforcement services under ORS 25.080 shall provide notice of the presumption to the obligee and obligor and shall inform all parties to the support order that, unless a party objects as provided in subsection (4) of this section, child support shall cease accruing beginning with the first day of the first month that follows the obligor becoming incarcerated for a period of at least 180 consecutive days and continuing through the support payment due in the last month prior to the reinstatement of the support order as provided in subsection (6) of this section. The entity shall serve the notice on the obligee in the manner provided for the service of summons in a civil action, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other mail service with delivery confirmation and shall serve the notice on the obligor by first class mail to the obligor’s last-known address. The notice shall specify the month in which the obligor became incarcerated and shall contain a statement that the administrator represents the state and that low-cost legal counsel may be available.

      (4) A party may object to the presumption by sending an objection to the entity that served the notice under subsection (3) of this section within 30 days after the date of service of the notice. The objection must describe the resources of the obligor or other evidence that rebuts the presumption of inability to pay child support. The entity receiving the objection shall cause the case to be set for a hearing before a court or an administrative law judge. The court or administrative law judge may consider only whether the presumption has been rebutted.

      (5) If no objection is made, or if the court or administrative law judge finds that the presumption has not been rebutted, the administrator shall discontinue billing the obligor for the period of time described in subsection (3) of this section and no arrearage shall accrue for the period during which the obligor is not billed. In addition, the entity providing support enforcement services shall file with the circuit court in which the support order or judgment has been entered a copy of the notice described in subsection (3) of this section or, if an objection is made and the presumption is not rebutted, a copy of the court’s or administrative law judge’s order.

      (6) An order that has been suspended as provided in this section will automatically be reinstated at 50 percent of the previously ordered support amount on the first day of the first month that follows the 120th day after the obligor’s release from incarceration.

      (7)(a) Within 30 days following reinstatement of the order pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the administrator shall provide notice to all parties to the support order:

      (A) Specifying the last date on which the obligor was incarcerated;

      (B) Stating that by operation of law, billing and accrual of support resumed on the first day of the first month that follows the 120th day after the obligor’s release from incarceration; and

      (C) Informing the parties that the administrator will review the support order for purposes of modification of the support order as provided in subsection (8) of this section within 60 days following reinstatement of the order.

      (b) The notice shall include a statement that the administrator represents the state and that low-cost legal counsel may be available.

      (c) The entity providing support enforcement services shall file a copy of the notice required by paragraph (a) of this subsection with the circuit court in which the support order or judgment has been entered.

      (8) Within 60 days of the reinstatement under subsection (6) of this section, the administrator shall review the support order for purposes of modifying the support order.

      (9) An obligor’s incarceration for at least 180 consecutive days or an obligor’s release from incarceration is considered a substantial change of circumstances for purposes of child support modification proceedings.

      (10) Proof of incarceration for at least 180 consecutive days is sufficient cause for the administrator, court or administrative law judge to allow a credit and satisfaction against child support arrearages for each month that the obligor was incarcerated or that is within 120 days following the obligor’s release from incarceration unless the presumption of inability to pay has been rebutted.

      (11) Orders modified to zero prior to January 1, 2018, remain in force with reinstatement at the full amount ordered by the court occurring 61 days after release. Such orders are not subject to suspension and reinstatement as provided in this section.

      (12) The provisions of subsections (1), (9) and (10) of this section apply regardless of whether child support enforcement services are being provided under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.

      (13) The Department of Justice shall adopt rules to implement this section.

      (14) As used in this section, “support order” means a judgment or administrative order that creates child support rights and that is entered or issued under ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 419B.400 or 419C.590 or this chapter or ORS chapter 107, 108, 109 or 110. [2017 c.464 §2; 2019 c.291 §7]

FORMULA FOR DETERMINING AMOUNT OF CHILD SUPPORT

 

      25.270 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The federal Family Support Act of 1988 mandates that the state must establish a formula for child support award amounts that is applicable in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the award of child support.

      (2) It is further mandated that the amount of child support determined by the formula must be presumed to be the correct amount unless rebutted by a specific finding on the record that the application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case as determined under criteria established by the state.

      (3) It is also mandated that the formula is to be reviewed at least once every four years to insure that the application of the formula results in appropriate child support awards.

      (4) There is a need for uniformity in child support awards, and child support awards often are based upon noneconomic factors and are inadequate in terms of the needs of the child.

      (5) The Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice is the appropriate agency to establish the required formula. [1989 c.811 §2]

 

      25.275 Formula for determining child support awards; criteria to be considered; mandated standards; reduction; rules. (1) The Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice shall establish by rule a formula for determining child support awards in any judicial or administrative proceeding. In establishing the formula, the division shall take into consideration the following criteria:

      (a) All earnings, income and resources of each parent, including real and personal property;

      (b) The earnings history and potential of each parent;

      (c) The reasonable necessities of each parent;

      (d) The ability of each parent to borrow;

      (e) The educational, physical and emotional needs of the child for whom the support is sought;

      (f) The amount of assistance that would be paid to the child under the full standard of need of the state’s IV-A plan;

      (g) Preexisting support orders and current dependents; and

      (h) Other reasonable criteria that the division may find to be appropriate.

      (2) The formula described in subsection (1) of this section must also comply with the following standards:

      (a) The child is entitled to benefit from the income of both parents to the same extent that the child would have benefited had the family unit remained intact or if there had been an intact family unit consisting of both parents and the child.

      (b) Both parents should share in the costs of supporting the child in the same proportion as each parent’s income bears to the combined income of both parents.

      (3) The formula described in subsection (1) of this section must be designed to ensure, as a minimum, that the child for whom support is sought benefits from the income and resources of the absent parent on an equitable basis in comparison with any other minor children of the absent parent.

      (4) The child support obligation to be paid by the obligor and determined under the formula described in subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) May be reduced or increased in consideration of medical support, as provided in ORS 25.321 to 25.343.

      (b) May be reduced dollar for dollar in consideration of any Social Security or apportioned Veterans’ benefits paid to the child, or to a representative payee administering the funds for the child’s use and benefit, as a result of the obligor’s disability or retirement.

      (c) Shall be reduced dollar for dollar in consideration of any Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 paid to the child, or to a representative payee administering the funds for the child’s use and benefit, as a result of the obligor’s disability or retirement. [1989 c.811 §3; 1993 c.800 §2; 1999 c.1030 §1; 2003 c.73 §26a; 2003 c.75 §75; 2003 c.572 §6; 2003 c.637 §15; 2009 c.351 §7]

 

      25.280 Formula amount presumed correct; rebuttal of presumption; criteria. In any judicial or administrative proceeding for the establishment or modification of a child support obligation under ORS chapter 107, 108, 109 or 110 or ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 419B.400, 419B.923, 419C.590 or 419C.610, the amount of support determined by the formula established under ORS 25.275 is presumed to be the correct amount of the obligation. This is a rebuttable presumption and a written finding or a specific finding on the record that the application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case is sufficient to rebut the presumption. The following criteria shall be considered in making the finding:

      (1) Evidence of the other available resources of a parent;

      (2) The reasonable necessities of a parent;

      (3) The net income of a parent remaining after withholdings required by law or as a condition of employment;

      (4) A parent’s ability to borrow;

      (5) The number and needs of other dependents of a parent;

      (6) The special hardships of a parent including, but not limited to, any medical circumstances of a parent affecting the parent’s ability to pay child support;

      (7) The needs of the child;

      (8) The desirability of the custodial parent remaining in the home as a full-time parent and homemaker;

      (9) The tax consequences, if any, to both parents resulting from spousal support awarded and determination of which parent will name the child as a dependent; and

      (10) The financial advantage afforded a parent’s household by the income of a spouse or another person with whom the parent lives in a relationship similar to that of a spouse. [1989 c.811 §4; 1993 c.33 §287; 1993 c.354 §1; 1995 c.608 §30; 2001 c.622 §42; 2007 c.71 §8; 2007 c.356 §3; 2015 c.629 §1; 2019 c.13 §14]

 

      25.285 [1989 c.811 §5; repealed by 1991 c.519 §8 (25.287 enacted in lieu of 25.285 in 1993)]

 

      25.287 Proceedings to modify orders to comply with formula; when proceeding may be initiated; issues considered. (1)(a) The entity providing support enforcement services under ORS 25.080 may initiate proceedings to modify a support obligation to ensure that the support obligation is in accordance with the formula established under ORS 25.275.

      (b) Proceedings under this subsection may occur only after three years have elapsed, or such shorter cycle as determined by rule of the Department of Justice, from the latest of the following:

      (A) The date the original support obligation took effect;

      (B) The date any previous modification of the support obligation took effect; or

      (C) The date of any previous review and determination under this subsection that resulted in no modification of the support obligation.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection, a support obligation or modification takes effect on the first date on which the obligor is to pay the established or modified support amount.

      (d) The only issues at proceedings under this subsection are whether three years have elapsed, or such shorter cycle as determined by rule of the department, and whether the support obligation is in substantial compliance with the formula established under ORS 25.275.

      (e) Upon review, if the administrator determines that a support obligation does not qualify for modification under this section, a party may appeal the administrator’s decision under ORS 183.484.

      (f) If the court, the administrator or an administrative law judge finds that more than three years have elapsed, or such shorter cycle as determined by rule of the department, the court, the administrator or the administrative law judge shall modify the support order to bring the support obligation into substantial compliance with the formula established under ORS 25.275, regardless of whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the support obligation was last established, modified or reviewed. Proceedings by the administrator or administrative law judge under this subsection shall be conducted according to the provisions of ORS 25.513 and 25.527.

      (g) The provisions of this subsection apply to any support obligation established by a support order under this chapter or ORS chapter 107, 108, 109 or 110 or ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 419B.400 or 419C.590.

      (2) The entity providing support enforcement services shall state in the document initiating the proceeding, to the extent known:

      (a) Whether there is pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the child, including a proceeding brought under ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 107.085, 107.135, 107.431, 108.110, 109.100, 109.103, 109.165, 125.025, 419B.400 or 419C.590 or ORS chapter 110; and

      (b) Whether there exists in this state or any other jurisdiction a support order, as defined in ORS 110.503, involving the child, other than the support obligation the entity seeks to modify.

      (3) The entity providing support enforcement services shall include with the document initiating the proceeding a certificate regarding any pending support proceeding and any existing support order other than the support obligation the entity seeks to modify. The entity providing support enforcement services shall use a certificate that is in a form prescribed by the administrator and shall include information required by the administrator and subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) The administrator, court or administrative law judge may use the provisions of subsection (1) of this section when a support order was entered in another state and registered in Oregon, the provisions of ORS chapter 110 apply and more than three years have elapsed, or such shorter cycle as determined by rule of the department.

      (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, proceedings may be initiated at any time to modify a support obligation based upon a substantial change of circumstances under any other provision of law.

      (6) The obligee is a party to any action to modify a support obligation under this section.

      (2) The Department of Justice may adopt rules governing the determination of the income subject to withholding that remains after application of offsets. Withholding actions in a case that is not receiving support enforcement services under ORS 25.080 may be appealed to the circuit court. [1995 c.608 §1b; 2003 c.73 §27]

      25.323 Medical support. (1) Every child support order must include a medical support clause.

      (2) Whenever a child support order that does not include a medical support clause is modified the modification must include a medical support clause.

      (3) A medical support clause may require that medical support be provided in more than one form, and may make the requirement that medical support be provided in a particular form contingent on the availability of another form of medical support.

      (4) A medical support clause must require that one or both parents provide health care coverage for a child that is appropriate and available at the time the order is entered. If health care coverage for a child is not appropriate and available at the time the order is entered, the order must:

      (8) Cash medical support and the cost of other medical support ordered under a medical support clause constitute a child support obligation and must be included in the child support calculation made under ORS 25.275. [2003 c.637 §3; 2007 c.878 §6; 2009 c.351 §2; 2009 c.595 §55; 2011 c.318 §6; 2017 c.467 §1]

 

      25.325 Enforcing medical support; form of notice; rules. (1) When a child support order with a medical support clause is entered, the court or the enforcing agency may issue a qualified medical child support order as provided in section 609 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1169). The qualified medical child support order shall direct the providing party’s employer, or the plan administrator for the providing party’s employee health care coverage, to enroll the providing party’s child in the employee health benefit plan and direct the providing party’s employer to withhold any required premium from the providing party’s compensation.

      (2) When a child support order with a medical support clause is entered and support enforcement services are being provided under ORS 25.080, the enforcing agency shall, when appropriate, issue a medical support notice to the providing party’s employer within two business days after receiving information under ORS 25.790 that the employer has hired or rehired the providing party.

      (3) If a child support order with a medical support clause is in effect or is being sought:

      (a) The providing party’s employer or the plan administrator for the providing party’s employee health care coverage shall release to the enforcing agency, upon request, the name and address of the health benefit plan that provides the coverage and the plan administrator; and

      (b) The plan administrator shall release to the obligee or the enforcing agency, upon request, information about health care coverage for dependents under the employee health benefit plan.

      (4) If a qualified medical child support order or a medical support notice has been served on the providing party’s employer, the order or notice is binding on the employer and the plan administrator for the providing party’s employee health benefit plan to the extent that the child is eligible to be enrolled in the health benefit plan under the applicable terms and conditions of the plan and the standard enrollment guidelines as described in ORS 743B.470. Enrollment of the child shall be allowed at any time, notwithstanding any enrollment season restrictions.

      (5) The Department of Justice, by rule, shall prescribe the form of a medical support notice for the purposes of ORS 25.321 to 25.343. In prescribing the form, the department shall consider all relevant federal law relating to medical support notices. [2003 c.637 §4; 2007 c.878 §7; 2009 c.351 §3]

 

      25.327 Service of medical support notice. (1) The enforcing agency shall serve the medical support notice on the providing party’s employer as a withholder. The notice may be served upon the withholder or the withholder’s registered agent, corporate officer, bookkeeper, accountant, person responsible for payroll or local office manager by:

      (a) Personal service;

      (b) Any type of mail that is calculated to give actual notice and is addressed to one of the persons listed in this subsection; or

      (c) Electronic means if the employer has the ability to receive the medical support notice in that manner.

      (2) Service of a medical support notice constitutes receipt of a medical child support order.

      (3) The enforcing agency shall, as provided in ORS 25.333, notify the parties that the medical support notice has been served on the providing party’s employer. [2003 c.637 §5; 2007 c.878 §8]

 

      25.329 Actions required after service of medical support notice; rules. When the enforcing agency serves a medical support notice on an employer:

      (1) The employer shall comply with the provisions in the medical support notice;

      (2) The plan administrator and the employer shall treat the medical support notice as an application by the enforcing agency for health care coverage for the named child under the health benefit plan to the extent an application is required by the plan;

      (3) If the providing party named in the medical support notice is not an employee of the employer, or if a health benefit plan is not offered or available to the providing party, the employer shall notify the enforcing agency within 20 business days after the date of the medical support notice;

      (4) If a health benefit plan is offered or available to the providing party, the employer shall send the plan administrator’s portion of the notice to each appropriate plan administrator within 20 business days after the date of the medical support notice;

      (5) Within 40 business days after the date of the medical support notice, the plan administrator shall do all of the following as directed by the notice:

      (a) Complete the appropriate portion of the notice and return the portion to the enforcing agency;

      (b) If the child is or will be enrolled, notify the parties and furnish the obligee with the information necessary to effectuate coverage and submit claims for benefits;

      (c) If the child has been or will be enrolled, provide the enforcing agency with the type of health benefit plan under which the child has been or will be enrolled, including whether dental, optical, office visits and prescription drugs are covered services;

      (d) If more than one health benefit plan is available to the providing party and the providing party is not enrolled, forward the health benefit plan descriptions and documents to the enforcing agency;

      (e) If the providing party is subject to a waiting period that expires more than 90 days after the date of receipt of the medical support notice by the plan administrator or if the providing party has not completed a waiting period that is measured in a manner other than the passage of time, notify the employer, the enforcing agency and the parties; and

      (f) Upon completion of the enrollment, notify the employer of the enrollment;

      (6) If the plan administrator notifies the employer that the providing party is subject to a waiting period that expires more than 90 days after the date of receipt of the medical support notice by the plan administrator or that the providing party is subject to a waiting period that is measured in a manner other than the passage of time, the employer shall, when the providing party becomes eligible to enroll in the plan, notify the plan administrator that the medical support notice requires that the child named in the notice be enrolled in the plan; and

      (7) The plan administrator shall enroll the child and, if necessary to the enrollment of the child, enroll the providing party in the plan as provided by rules adopted by the Department of Justice. [2003 c.637 §6; 2007 c.878 §9]

 

      25.330 [1985 c.671 §6; 1991 c.588 §1; 1995 c.609 §5; 1997 c.704 §28; renumbered 25.167 in 1999]

 

      25.331 Obligation to withhold. (1) Upon notification from the plan administrator that the child is enrolled in the health benefit plan, the employer shall withhold from the providing party’s compensation the providing party’s share, if any, of premiums for the health benefit plan. The employer shall forward the amount withheld as required by the health benefit plan.

      (2) The withholding required by a qualified medical child support order or a medical support notice is a continuing obligation. The qualified medical child support order or medical support notice and the withholding remain in effect and are binding upon the employer until further notice from the court or the enforcing agency.

      (3)(a) An amount withheld by an employer in compliance with a withholding order issued for monetary support and a qualified medical child support order or medical support notice may not exceed 50 percent of the providing party’s net disposable income.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, upon the motion of a party and after a hearing, the court may order the withholding of more than 50 percent of the providing party’s net disposable income. However, the amount withheld may not exceed the amount allowed under section 303(b) of the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)).

      (4) If a providing party’s compensation drops to a level at which withholding under this section exceeds the amount allowed under subsection (3) of this section, the employer shall stop the withholding and send the court or the enforcing agency, as the case may be, a written notice within 15 days of stopping the withholding. The notice shall include the providing party’s name, address and Social Security number and the date the employer stopped withholding under this section.

      (5) An employer is not subject to civil liability to an individual or agency for conduct or actions in compliance with a medical support notice if the employer:

      (a) Is served with a medical support notice under ORS 25.327 that is regular on its face; and

      (b) Complies with the provisions of the medical support notice if the notice appears to be in conformance with section 609 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1169). [2003 c.637 §7; 2007 c.878 §10]

 

      25.333 Contesting medical support notice. (1) When the enforcing agency issues a medical support notice under ORS 25.325, the enforcing agency shall notify the parties by regular mail to the last known addresses of the parties:

      (a) That the notice has been sent to the providing party’s employer; and

      (b) Of the providing party’s rights and duties under the notice.

      (2) A providing party may contest a medical support notice within 30 days after the date the premium is first withheld pursuant to the notice or, if the health benefit plan is provided at no cost to the providing party, the date the first premium is paid by the employer.

      (3) The only basis for contesting a medical support notice is a mistake of fact. A “mistake of fact” means any of the following:

      (a) No order to provide health care coverage under a health benefit plan has been issued in regard to the providing party’s child;

      (b) The amount to be withheld for premiums is greater than is permissible under ORS 25.331;

      (c) The alleged providing party is not the party from whom health care coverage is required; or

      (d) The providing party’s income is equal to or less than Oregon minimum wage for full-time employment.

      (4) The providing party may contest the medical support notice by requesting an administrative review. After receiving a request for review and within 45 days after the date the premium is first withheld pursuant to the medical support notice, the enforcing agency shall determine, based on an evaluation of the facts, whether the withholding for premiums may continue. The enforcing agency shall inform the parties of the determination in writing and include information regarding the right to appeal the determination.

      (5) Any appeal of the enforcing agency’s determination under subsection (4) of this section is to the circuit court for a hearing under ORS 183.484.

      (6) The initiation of proceedings to contest a medical support notice or an appeal of the enforcing agency’s determination under this section does not stay the withholding of premiums. [2003 c.637 §8; 2007 c.878 §11; 2009 c.351 §10; 2011 c.318 §9]

 

      25.335 Termination of support order. When support enforcement services are being provided under ORS 25.080, the enforcing agency shall notify the employer when there is no longer in effect a support order requiring health care coverage for which the enforcing agency is responsible. However, termination of the health care coverage is governed by the health benefit plan’s provisions for termination and by applicable federal law. [2003 c.637 §9]

 

      25.337 Liability. (1) If the plan administrator or the employer fails to comply with the requirements described in ORS 25.329 or 25.331, the enforcing agency or obligee may bring a civil action against the plan administrator or employer for medical expenses, the providing party’s share of the premiums, attorney fees and costs.

      (2) An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if the employer discharges a providing party, refuses to hire a providing party or in any other manner discriminates, retaliates or takes disciplinary action against a providing party because of the entry of a medical support notice or qualified medical child support order or because of the obligations imposed upon the plan administrator by the order. An employee may bring a civil action under ORS 659A.885 or may file a complaint with the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries in the manner provided by ORS 659A.820.

      (3) A providing party who fails to maintain health care coverage for a child as ordered is liable, from the date of the order, for any medical expenses resulting from the failure to maintain coverage.

      (4) The remedies described in this section are not exclusive. Nothing in this section precludes action by the court to enforce a judicial or administrative order requiring health care coverage or payment of medical support by imposition of remedial or punitive sanctions for contempt or otherwise. [2003 c.637 §10; 2007 c.878 §12]

 

      25.339 Priority of medical support notice. A medical support notice issued under ORS 25.325 has priority over any previously filed attachment, execution, garnishment or assignment of income other than a withholding order issued for monetary support, unless otherwise requested by the obligee. [2003 c.637 §11]

 

      25.340 [1985 c.671 §7; 1993 c.798 §35; renumbered 25.381 in 1999]

 

      25.341 Notice of termination of employer’s relationship with providing party. When an employer is unable to continue withholding from a providing party’s compensation because the relationship between the employer and the providing party ends, the employer shall send the enforcing agency a written notice within 15 days of the termination of the relationship. The notice must include the providing party’s name, the providing party’s last known address, the providing party’s Social Security number, the date the relationship terminated and, if known, the name and address of a new employer of or other provider of a health benefit plan to the providing party. [2003 c.637 §12; 2007 c.878 §13]

 

      25.342 Rules. The Department of Justice may adopt all rules necessary for implementation of ORS 25.321 to 25.343. [2009 c.351 §12]

 

      25.343 Authorization for reimbursement payments. The signature of the obligee or guardian of a child covered by a health benefit plan is a valid authorization for purposes of processing an insurance reimbursement payment to the provider of the health services as provided in ORS 743B.470. [2003 c.637 §13]

INCOME WITHHOLDING AND PAYMENT RECORDS

 

      25.372 Applicability. ORS 25.372 to 25.427 apply to current support, arrears and interest on arrears, independently or combined, whether arrears are owed to an obligee, the state or a foreign jurisdiction. [Formerly 25.367; 2001 c.249 §73; 2003 c.73 §28; 2003 c.572 §7]

 

      25.375 Priority of withholding. Except as provided in ORS 25.339, withholding under ORS 25.378 has priority over any other legal process under Oregon law against the same income. [Formerly 25.722; 2003 c.637 §16]

 

      25.378 Payment of support by income withholding; initiation of income withholding. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 25.396, when a support order is entered or modified by the Division of Child Support, a district attorney, an administrative law judge or a circuit court, including a juvenile court, the order shall include a provision requiring the obligor to pay support by income withholding regardless of whether support enforcement services are being provided under ORS 25.080. In addition to the income withholding provided for in this subsection, income withholding may be initiated in accordance with subsections (2) to (6) of this section.

      (2) When an obligor is subject to a support order issued or registered in this state and fails to make payments at least equal to the amount of support payable for one month, a court or the administrator, whichever is appropriate, shall initiate income withholding without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing and without the need for advance notice to the obligor of the withholding.

      (3) When an arrearage exists and notice of the delinquent amount has been given to the obligor, a court, upon application, shall issue a withholding order upon the ex parte request of a person holding support rights or the administrator.

      (4) If an obligor is not otherwise subject to income withholding a court or the administrator may issue an order to withhold upon the ex parte motion of the obligor.

      (5) Upon the request of the holder of support rights, a court or the administrator, as appropriate, may issue a withholding order at any time if:

      (a) The obligor is not otherwise subject to withholding; and

      (b) After notice and an opportunity to object has been given to the obligor, a finding is made that it would be in the best interests of the child to issue a withholding order.

      (6) A court or the administrator shall issue an order to withhold when a support order or an arrearage from another jurisdiction is entered in Oregon in accordance with interstate income withholding under ORS chapter 110. [Formerly 25.311; 2001 c.104 §§6,7; 2003 c.73 §§29,30; 2003 c.75 §25; 2013 c.184 §2]

 

      25.381 Establishing income withholding as method of paying support; records. (1) Whenever services are being provided under ORS 25.080, support rights are not and have not at any time during the past five months been assigned to this or another state, and no arrearages under a support order are so assigned, the administrator shall provide, upon request of an obligor or obligee, services sufficient to permit establishment of income withholding under ORS 25.378, including services necessary to establish a support payment record under ORS 25.164 and 25.167.

      (2) Regardless of whether services are being provided under ORS 25.080, the administrator shall provide, upon request of an obligor or obligee, services sufficient to permit establishment of income withholding under ORS 25.378:

      (a) For the payment of child support without the necessity of an application for support enforcement services under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.); and

      (b) For the payment of spousal support if the obligee is receiving supplemental nutrition assistance or any other form of public assistance, as defined in ORS 411.010, from the Department of Human Services or medical assistance, as defined in ORS 414.025, from the department or the Oregon Health Authority. [Formerly 25.340; 2001 c.900 §8; 2003 c.73 §31; 2005 c.265 §1; 2009 c.599 §15; 2013 c.688 §7]

 

      25.384 Statement on withholding in support order. (1) Any child support order issued or modified after October 1, 1989, shall include a statement in substantially the following form:

______________________________________________________________________________

NOTICE OF INCOME WITHHOLDING

      The support order is enforceable by income withholding under ORS 25.372 to 25.427. Withholding shall occur immediately, whenever there are arrears at least equal to the support payment for one month, whenever the obligated parent requests such withholding or whenever the obligee requests withholding for good cause. The district attorney or, as appropriate, the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice will assist in securing such withholding. Exceptions may apply in some circumstances.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (2) The Department of Justice shall provide annual notice to each obligor and obligee on support orders being enforced by the district attorney or Division of Child Support of the availability of and requirements for exceptions to withholding. [Formerly 25.370]

 

      25.387 Withholding more than amount authorized by law. Notwithstanding ORS 25.414 and 656.234, the court upon motion of a party holding the support rights, the Division of Child Support or the district attorney, and after a hearing, may order the withholding of more than the amount otherwise authorized by law. In no case may an order require payment of an amount that exceeds the limits imposed by the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)). [Formerly 25.354]

 

      25.390 Amendment of support order not required for withholding. Disposable income is subject to an order to withhold to satisfy a support obligation without the need for any amendment to the support order involved or for any further action, other than those actions required or permitted under ORS 25.378. [Formerly 25.318]

 

      25.393 Remedy additional to other remedies. Collection of support by withholding income pursuant to ORS chapter 25 is in addition to any other remedy provided by law for the enforcement of support. [Formerly 25.313]

 

      25.396 Exception to withholding; termination of withholding; rules. (1) When a court or the administrator enters or modifies a support order, the court or administrator may grant an exception to income withholding required under ORS 25.378 if the court or administrator makes a written finding that there is good cause not to require income withholding. Good cause exists when there is proof of timely payment of previously ordered support and when initiating or continuing income withholding would not be in the best interests of the child.

      (2) The court or administrator may grant an exception to income withholding required under ORS 25.378 if:

      (a) The obligor and obligee at any time agree in writing to an alternative payment method;

      (b) When money is owed to the state under the support order, the state agrees in writing to the alternative payment method;

      (c) The obligor has paid in full all arrears accrued under the support order;

      (d) The obligor has complied with the terms of any previous exception granted under this section; and

      (e) The court or administrator accepts the alternative payment method.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, when child support is currently assigned to the state and the child is in the custody of the Oregon Youth Authority or the Department of Human Services, the state or the obligor may request and the court or administrator may grant an exception from income withholding if:

      (a) The order to withhold is a barrier to reunification of the family or rehabilitation of the youth or is prejudicial to the obligor’s ability to provide for another child to whom a duty of support is owed; and

      (b) The state and the obligor agree in writing to an alternative payment method.

      (4) Exceptions to income withholding described in this section may be granted by the administrator or the court, except that when support enforcement services are being provided under ORS 25.080 the only permissible alternative payment methods are an electronic funds transfer to the Department of Justice or another method permitted under rules adopted under this section.

      (5) A party may appeal the administrator’s decision granting or denying an exception under this section to the circuit court in accordance with ORS 183.484.

      (6) Income withholding may be terminated only if the conditions set forth in this section are met.

      (7) The Department of Justice shall adopt rules and establish procedures to implement this section. [Formerly 25.317; 2001 c.171 §1; 2003 c.73 §32; 2003 c.572 §8]

 

      25.399 Notice of order to withhold; contents of notice. (1) When an order to withhold is issued under ORS 25.378, the party or entity initiating the action shall send notice of the order to withhold to the obligor by regular mail to the last-known address of the obligor. The notice must state:

      (a) That withholding has commenced;

      (b) The amount to be withheld and the amount of arrears, if any;

      (c) That the order to withhold applies to any current or subsequent withholder or period of employment;

      (d) The procedures available for contesting the withholding and that the only basis for contesting the withholding is a mistake of fact, which means an error in the amount of current support or arrearages, or an error in the identity of the obligor;

      (e) The availability of and requirements for exceptions to withholding;

      (f) That the obligor has 30 days from the date that the income is first withheld pursuant to the order to withhold to contest the withholding; and

      (g) The actions that will be taken if the obligor contests the withholding.

      (2) The notice requirement of subsection (1) of this section may be met by mailing a copy of the order to withhold, by regular mail, to the obligor. [Formerly 25.315; 2011 c.318 §10; 2017 c.461 §1; 2019 c.13 §16]

 

      25.402 Service of order on withholder; contents. (1)(a) The party initiating the support action shall serve the order to withhold on the withholder. The order may be personally served upon the withholder or the withholder’s registered agent, an officer of the corporation, bookkeeper, accountant, person responsible for payroll or local office manager or may be served by any type of mail which is calculated to give actual notice and is addressed to one of the persons listed above.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection and unless the Department of Justice, prior to initiating service, receives written notice of completion of service by another party, the department shall serve the order to withhold in all cases affecting a support order for which the department or the district attorney has responsibility under ORS 25.080 for providing support enforcement services regardless of whether the department or another party initiated the support action.

      (2) The order to withhold shall inform the withholder of all of the following:

      (a) The amount of the obligor’s continuing support obligation.

      (b) That the withholder is required to withhold from the obligor’s disposable income due or becoming due to the obligor at each pay period an amount as determined by ORS 25.414.

      (c) The appropriate person to whom to make the withholding payment.

      (d) The information contained in ORS 25.375, 25.387, 25.411, 25.414, 25.417, 25.421 and 25.424. [Formerly 25.314]

 

      25.405 Contesting order to withhold; basis. (1) An obligor contesting an order to withhold issued under ORS 25.378 must do so within 30 days from the date income is first withheld pursuant to the order to withhold. The obligor may not contest an order to withhold issued under ORS 25.378 (5).

      (2) The only basis for contesting the order to withhold is a mistake of fact. “Mistake of fact” means an error in the amount of current support or arrearages, or an error in the identity of the obligor. Payment of all arrearages shall not be the sole basis for not implementing withholding.

      (3) If the order to withhold was issued by a court of this state, the obligor must contest the order to withhold in the court that issued the order.

      (4) If the order to withhold was issued by a court or administrative agency of another state and was received directly by an employer in this state under ORS 110.594, the obligor may contest the order to withhold by:

      (a) Seeking relief from enforcement of the order in the appropriate tribunal of the state that issued the order;

      (b) Contesting the validity and enforcement of the order under ORS 110.601; or

      (c) Registering the underlying withholding order in Oregon in the manner provided by ORS 110.605 to 110.611 and seeking relief from enforcement of the order as provided in ORS 110.617 and 110.620.

      (5) If the order to withhold was issued pursuant to a request for enforcement under ORS 25.080, the obligor may contest the order to withhold to the district attorney or the Division of Child Support. The district attorney or the Division of Child Support need not provide an opportunity for a contested case administrative hearing under ORS chapter 183 or a hearing in circuit court. Within 45 days after the date income is first withheld pursuant to the order to withhold, the district attorney or the Division of Child Support shall determine, based on an evaluation of the facts, if the withholding shall continue and notify the obligor of the determination and of the obligor’s right to appeal the determination.

      (6) Any appeal of the decision of the district attorney or the Division of Child Support made under subsection (5) of this section is to the circuit court for a hearing under ORS 183.484.

      (7) The initiation of proceedings to contest an order to withhold under subsection (4) of this section, a motion or request to contest an order to withhold or an appeal of the decision of the district attorney or the Division of Child Support made under subsection (5) of this section does not act to stay withholding unless otherwise ordered by a court. [Formerly 25.316; 2009 c.80 §2; 2011 c.318 §11; 2015 c.298 §87]

 

      25.408 Withholding is continuing obligation. The withholding required by the order is a continuing obligation. The notice and the withholding required by the order remain in effect and are binding upon the withholder until further notice from the court or the entity issuing the notice. [Formerly 25.359]

 

      25.410 [1985 c.671 §13a; 1993 c.798 §27; 1993 c.800 §3; repealed by 1995 c.608 §46]

 

      25.411 When withholding begins; payment to Department of Justice or obligee. (1) The withholder shall start withholding not later than the first pay period occurring five days after the date of the order to withhold. However, if on the date the employer receives the order the employer has already calculated the payroll for that pay period and has prepared the paycheck or submitted a deposit for that payroll, the employer shall start withholding no later than the second pay period occurring after the date of the order to withhold.

      (2) Within seven business days after the date the obligor receives income, the withholder shall pay amounts withheld to the Department of Justice or to the obligee by deposit into the obligee’s bank account, whichever is specified in the order to withhold. The withholder shall include, with the payment, the obligor’s name and case number and the date upon which the income was withheld.

      (3) When payments are made to the Department of Justice, the withholder may combine amounts withheld from different obligors’ incomes in a single payment as long as such payment is accompanied by a list that separately identifies which portion of the payment is attributable to each obligor, the obligor’s name and case number, if any.

      (4) As used in this section, “business day” means a day on which the Department of Justice is open for regular business. [Formerly 25.355; 2007 c.356 §4]

 

      25.414 Standard amount to be withheld; processing fee; rules. (1) The withholder shall withhold from the obligor’s disposable monthly income, other than workers’ compensation under ORS chapter 656 or unemployment compensation under ORS chapter 657, the amount stated in the order to withhold. The entity issuing the order to withhold shall compute this amount subject to the following:

      (a) If withholding is for current support only, the amount to be withheld is the amount specified as current support in the support order.

      (b) If withholding is for current support and there is an arrearage, the amount to be withheld is 120 percent of the amount specified as current support in the support order.

      (c) If withholding is only for arrearage, the amount to be withheld is one of the following:

      (A) The amount of the last ordered monthly support.

      (B) If there is no last ordered monthly support amount, the monthly support amount used to calculate the arrearage amount specified in the order or judgment for arrearage.

      (C) If there is no last ordered monthly support amount and if there was no monthly support amount, an amount calculated under the formula established under ORS 25.275. For purposes of this subparagraph, this calculation shall be based on the obligor’s current monthly gross income or, if the obligor’s current monthly gross income is not known, the Oregon hourly minimum wage converted to a monthly amount based upon a 40-hour workweek, zero income for the obligee, and one joint child, regardless of how many children the parties may actually have. No rebuttals to this calculation may be allowed.

      (d) Notwithstanding the amount determined to be withheld under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the obligor must retain disposable monthly income of at least 160 times the applicable federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by section 6 (a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206) or any future minimum hourly wages prescribed in that section, if the order to withhold is issued for:

      (A) Disability benefits payments from the United States Social Security Administration;

      (B) Black lung benefits payments from the United States Department of Labor; or

      (C) Disability benefits payments from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

      (2) The amount to be withheld from unemployment compensation under ORS chapter 657 is calculated as follows:

      (a) If withholding is for a current support order, regardless of the existence of arrearage, the amount to be withheld is the lesser of:

      (A) Twenty-five percent of the benefits paid; or

      (B) The current monthly support obligation. The entity issuing the order to withhold may convert the monthly support obligation amount to a percentage to be withheld from each benefits payment.

      (b) If withholding is for arrearage only, the amount to be withheld is the lesser of:

      (A) Fifteen percent of the benefits paid; or

      (B) The amount of the last ordered monthly support obligation. The entity issuing the order to withhold may convert the last ordered monthly support obligation amount to a percentage to be withheld from each benefits payment.

      (c) The withholder may not charge or collect a processing fee when withholding from unemployment compensation.

      (3) The amount to be withheld from workers’ compensation under ORS chapter 656 is set forth in ORS 656.234.

      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when withholding is from a lump sum payment or benefit, including but not limited to retroactive workers’ compensation benefits, lump sum retirement plan disbursements or withdrawals, insurance payments or settlements, severance pay, bonus payments or any other similar payments or benefits that are not periodic recurring income, the amount subject to withholding for payment of a support obligation may not exceed one-half of the amount of the lump sum payment or benefit.

      (5)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when the withholding is only for arrearage, the administrator shall set a lesser amount to be withheld if the obligor demonstrates the withholding is prejudicial to the obligor’s ability to provide for a child the obligor has a duty to support or the obligor’s ability to provide for the obligor’s basic needs. The factors to be considered by the administrator in determining whether the obligor can provide for the obligor’s basic needs include but are not limited to:

      (A) The health expenses of the obligor;

      (B) A verified disability affecting the obligor’s ability to work;

      (C) Whether the obligor’s income remaining after withholding would be less than the self-support reserve established by rule of the Department of Justice under paragraph (c) of this subsection;

      (D) The available resources of the obligor; and

      (E) The number and basic needs of other persons in the obligor’s household.

      (b) The administrator shall establish a procedure to give advance and periodic notice to the obligor of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection and of the means to reduce the amount stated in the order to withhold.

      (c) The Department of Justice shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.

      (6) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the withholder may deduct from the obligor’s disposable income a monthly processing fee not to exceed $5. The processing fee is in addition to the amount calculated to be withheld for support, unless the amount to be withheld for support is the maximum allowed under subsection (8) of this section, in which case the fee is deducted from the amount withheld as support.

      (7) If there are multiple withholding orders against the same obligor, the amount to be withheld is the sum of each support order calculated independently.

      (8) No withholding as calculated under this section, including the processing fee permitted in subsection (6) of this section, shall exceed 50 percent of the obligor’s net disposable income. The limit established in this subsection applies whenever withholding is implemented under this section, whether by a single order or by multiple orders against the same obligor.

      (9) When the obligor’s income is not sufficient for the withholder to fully comply with each withholding order, the withholder shall withhold the maximum amount allowed under this section. If all withholding orders for a particular obligor are payable to or through the department, the withholder shall pay to the department the income withheld and the department shall determine priorities for allocating income withheld to multiple child support cases relative to that obligor. If one or more of the withholding orders for a particular obligor require payment other than to or through the department, the withholder shall use the following to determine priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld to multiple child support cases:

      (a) If the amount withheld from the obligor’s income is sufficient to pay the current support due to each case but is not enough to fully comply with the withholding order for each case where past due support is owed, the withholder shall:

      (A) Pay to each case the amount of support due for the current month; and

      (B) Pay the remainder of the amount withheld in equal amounts to each case where past due support is owed. However, no case shall receive more than the total amount of current support and past due support owed to that case at the time the payment is made.

      (b) If the amount withheld is not sufficient to pay the current support due to each case, each case shall be paid a proportionate share of the amount withheld. The withholder shall determine this for each case by dividing the monthly amount ordered as current support for that case by the combined monthly amount ordered as current support for all cases relative to the same obligor, and multiplying this percentage by the total amount withheld.

      (10) An order to withhold income is not subject to the limitations of ORS 18.385.

      (11) A withholder shall withhold funds as directed in the order to withhold, except that when a withholder receives an income-withholding order issued by another state, the withholder shall apply the income-withholding law of the state of the obligor’s principal place of employment in determining:

      (a) The withholder’s fee for processing an income-withholding order;

      (b) The maximum amount permitted to be withheld from the obligor’s income;

      (c) The time periods within which the withholder must implement the income-withholding order and forward the child support payment;

      (d) The priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees; and

      (e) Any withholding terms or conditions not specified in the order. [Formerly 25.351; 2001 c.455 §10; 2003 c.73 §33; 2003 c.572 §9; 2011 c.317 §1]

 

      25.417 Amount to be withheld when obligor paid more frequently than monthly. When an obligor is required to pay support by income withholding and is paid more often than monthly, the withholder shall withhold up to the full amount specified in the order to withhold, based on the obligor’s pay period as specified in the order to withhold. The amount withheld may not exceed the maximum amount allowed under ORS 25.414 (8). [Formerly 25.353; 2001 c.455 §11]

 

      25.420 [1985 c.671 §13; 1993 c.800 §4; repealed by 1995 c.608 §46]

 

      25.421 Procedure if withholder does not withhold support. If for any reason a withholder does not withhold support in any month, the withholder shall explain the reason for not withholding. The withholder shall send the explanation for not withholding to the person or entity to whom the withholder sends payments and shall send the explanation on the date that the withholder would normally send a payment. If the withholder does not send a payment because the obligor is no longer employed by the withholder, the withholder may include in the explanation the name and address of the obligor’s new employer, if known. A withholder is not liable to the obligor for disclosure of this information. [Formerly 25.357]

 

      25.424 Liability of withholder; action against withholder; penalty; attorney fees; unlawful employment practice. (1) A person who is served with an order to withhold is not subject to civil liability to an individual or agency for conduct or actions in compliance with the order if:

      (a) The order is served on the person in the manner provided by ORS 25.402 (1);

      (b) The order is regular on its face; and

      (c) The order complies with ORS 25.402 (2).

      (2) A person who is served with an order to withhold is liable to the obligee for:

      (a) All amounts that the person fails to withhold or pay as required by the order;

      (b) Any damages suffered by the obligee by reason of the failure of the person to withhold or pay as required by the order; and

      (c) Any damages suffered by the obligee by reason of the failure of the person to pay withheld amounts within the time specified by ORS 25.411.

      (3) A person who is served with an order to withhold is liable to the obligor for:

      (a) All amounts withheld in excess of the amount required by the terms of the order;

      (b) Any damages suffered by the obligor by reason of withholding that is in excess of the amount required by the terms of the order;

      (c) Any damages suffered by the obligor by reason of the failure of the person to pay withheld amounts within the time specified by ORS 25.411; and

      (d) Any other damages suffered by the obligor by reason of the failure of the person to withhold or pay as required by the order.

      (4) An obligee or obligor may bring an action to recover amounts under this section, or the Division of Child Support or a district attorney may bring an action on behalf of the obligee or obligor to recover amounts under this section.

      (5) If the plaintiff in an action under this section establishes that the conduct of the defendant was willful or grossly negligent, the court shall:

      (a) Enter judgment against the defendant for a penalty, payable to the court, not to exceed $250 for each time the defendant failed to withhold or pay the amount required by the terms of the order to withhold, withheld an amount exceeding the amount required by the terms of the order, or failed to pay withheld amounts within the time specified by ORS 25.411; and

      (b) Enter judgment against the defendant, payable to the plaintiff, for reasonable attorney fees incurred by the plaintiff.

      (6)(a) An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if the employer discharges an employee, refuses to hire an individual or in any other manner discriminates, retaliates or takes disciplinary action against an obligor because of the entry or service of an order to withhold under ORS 25.378 and 25.402 or because of the obligations or additional obligations that the order imposes upon the employer. An obligor may bring an action under ORS 659A.885 or may file a complaint with the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries in the manner provided by ORS 659A.820. These remedies are in addition to any other remedy available in law or equity.

      (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to actions taken by an employer pursuant to any condition of employment required by law.

      (7) Nothing in ORS 25.372 to 25.427 precludes an action for contempt for disobedience of a judicial order to withhold. [Formerly 25.363; 2001 c.621 §67; 2003 c.572 §10; 2009 c.445 §1]

 

      25.427 Rules. The Department of Justice shall make rules and take action as is necessary to carry out the purposes of ORS 25.372 to 25.427. [Formerly 25.365; 2003 c.73 §34]

      (9) “Youth offender” has the meaning given that term in ORS 419A.004. [Formerly 416.400]

 

      Note: 25.501 to 25.556 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 25 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      25.502 Policy. It is the public policy of this state that dependent children shall be maintained, as much as possible, from the resources of both of the parents, thereby relieving or avoiding, at least in part, the burden often borne by single parents or by the general citizenry through public assistance programs. The existing remedies pertaining to family desertion and nonsupport of dependent children are to be augmented by the additional remedies provided in ORS 25.501 to 25.556 which are directed to the real and personal property resources of the responsible parents. These additional remedies are not in lieu of existing law. ORS 25.501 to 25.556 shall be liberally construed and administered to implement the policy stated in this section. [Formerly 416.405]

      (2) The moving party shall state in the motion, to the extent known:

      (a) Whether there is pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the dependent child, including a proceeding brought under ORS 25.287, 25.511, 107.085, 107.135, 107.431, 108.110, 109.100, 109.103, 109.165, 125.025, 419B.400 or 419C.590 or ORS chapter 110; and

The party shall use a certificate that is in a form prescribed by the administrator and include information required by the administrator and subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) The moving party shall serve the motion upon the obligor, the obligee, the party holding the support rights and the administrator, as appropriate. The nonrequesting parties must be served in the same manner as provided for service of the notice and finding of financial responsibility under ORS 25.511 (1)(a).

Upon proof of service, the administrative law judge shall issue an order granting the relief sought.

      (6) When the moving party is the administrator and no objections and request for hearing have been served within 30 days, the administrator may enter an order granting the relief sought.

      (7) A motion for modification made under this section does not stay the administrator from enforcing and collecting upon the existing order unless so ordered by the court in which the order is entered.

      (8) An administrative order filed in accordance with ORS 25.529 is a final judgment as to any installment or payment of money that has accrued up to the time the nonrequesting party is served with a motion to set aside, alter or modify the judgment. The administrator may not set aside, alter or modify any portion of the judgment that provides for any payment of money for minor children that has accrued before the motion is served. However:

      (a) The administrator may allow a credit against child support arrearages for periods of time, excluding reasonable parenting time unless otherwise provided by order or judgment, during which the obligor, with the knowledge and consent of the obligee or pursuant to court order, has physical custody of the child; and

      (b) The administrator may allow a credit against child support arrearages for any Social Security or veterans’ benefits paid retroactively to the child, or to a representative payee administering the funds for the child’s use and benefit, as a result of a parent’s disability or retirement.

      (12)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (11) of this section, any time support enforcement services are being provided under ORS 25.080, upon request of a party to a support order or judgment or on the administrator’s own motion, the administrator may move to suspend the order or judgment and issue a temporary modification order under this subsection when:

      (A) There is a period of significant unemployment as that term is described in paragraph (b) of this subsection; and

      (B) A party to the support order or judgment experiences an employment-related change of income as defined by rule in ORS 25.505.

      (b) Proceedings under this subsection may be initiated only when there is a period of significant unemployment in Oregon. The Attorney General shall determine when a “period of significant unemployment” exists in Oregon and designate the beginning and ending dates thereof. In making the determination of when a period of significant unemployment exists in Oregon, the Attorney General may consider whether there is in effect an “extended benefit period” as that term is defined in ORS 657.321.

      (c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the provisions of subsections (1) to (11) of this section apply to a motion for an order of suspension and temporary modification under this subsection.

      (d) A party’s employment-related change of income during a period of significant unemployment is considered a substantial change of circumstances for purposes of proceedings brought under this section.

      (A) The amount of the existing support order or judgment;

      (F) The proposed amount of the temporary modification order;

      (G) A statement that if a party objects to the motion for an order of suspension and temporary modification, then the party may request a hearing within 14 days of service of the motion as provided in paragraph (g) of this subsection;

      (H) A statement that the preexisting support order or judgment will be reinstated as provided in paragraph (h) of this subsection; and

      (I) A statement that a party may request a renewal of the order of suspension and temporary modification prior to its expiration as provided in paragraph (j) of this subsection.

      (f) The administrator shall serve the motion filed under this subsection upon the parties by regular first class mail, facsimile or electronic mail unless a party signs a form agreeing to accept service of the motion.

      (g) A party may request a hearing within 14 days of service of the motion. If a hearing is requested, the provisions of ORS 25.513 apply. When there has been no request for hearing, the administrator may enter an order of suspension and temporary modification under this subsection. The order must be consistent with the provisions of the motion filed under this subsection and be in substantial compliance with the formula established under ORS 25.275.

      (h) An order of suspension and temporary modification issued under this subsection is temporary and remains in effect for six months from the date the order is filed under ORS 25.529 or until the date specified in the notice provided under paragraph (i) of this subsection informing of the party’s reemployment, whichever is earlier, at which time the preexisting support order or judgment becomes immediately effective and payable on the first day of the following month unless an order of renewal is issued under paragraph (j) of this subsection.

      (i) The administrator may issue a notice of reinstatement at any time during which an order of suspension and temporary modification is in effect under this subsection when a party obtains employment and receives income that is sufficient to reinstate support in an amount substantially similar to the amount in the preexisting support order or judgment. The notice shall be served as provided in paragraph (f) of this subsection and must state that, unless a request for hearing is received within 14 days of service of the notice, the administrator will enter an order terminating the order of suspension and temporary modification and reinstating the amount of the preexisting support order or judgment effective on a date to be specified in the notice. If a hearing is requested, the provisions of ORS 25.513 apply. When there is no request for hearing, the administrator may enter an order terminating the order of suspension and temporary modification and reinstating the preexisting support order or judgment effective upon the date specified in the notice.

      (j) Prior to expiration of an order of suspension and temporary modification under this subsection and upon request of a party, the administrator may renew the order of suspension and temporary modification for additional six-month periods or until the party obtains employment as described in paragraph (i) of this subsection, whichever occurs first, if the circumstances under which the order was originally issued continue to exist unchanged.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or ORS 25.089, when two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child, and when one or more of the judgments was issued by a tribunal of another state, the administrator shall apply the provisions of ORS chapter 110 before enforcing or modifying a child support judgment under this section or ORS 25.089.

      (3) When the administrator finds that two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child and the same period, and each child support judgment was issued in this state:

      (a) The administrator may petition the court for the county where a child who is subject to the judgments resides for a governing child support judgment under ORS 25.091; or

      (b) The administrator may apply the presumption described in ORS 25.091, determine the controlling terms of the child support judgments and issue a proposed governing child support order and notice to the parties in the manner prescribed by rules adopted by the Department of Justice under ORS 25.505. The proposed governing child support order must include all of the information described in ORS 25.091 (8). The administrator shall serve the proposed governing child support order and notice in the manner provided in ORS 25.527. The notice must include a statement that the proposed governing child support order shall become final unless a written objection is made to the administrator within 30 days after service of the proposed governing child support order and notice.

      (4) If the administrator receives a timely written objection to a proposed governing child support order issued under subsection (3)(b) of this section, the administrator shall certify the matter to the court for the county where a child who is subject to the judgments resides for a governing child support judgment under ORS 25.091.

      (5) If the administrator does not receive a timely written objection to a proposed governing child support order issued under subsection (3)(b) of this section, the governing child support order is final. The administrator shall certify the governing child support order to a court for review and approval. The governing child support order is not effective until reviewed and approved by the court. If the court approves the governing child support order, the governing child support order becomes the governing child support judgment upon filing as provided in ORS 25.529.

      (6) When a governing child support judgment is entered as described in ORS 25.529, the noncontrolling terms of each earlier child support judgment are terminated. However, subject to subsection (7) of this section, the entry of a governing child support judgment does not affect any support payment arrearage or any liability related to medical support, as defined in ORS 25.321, that has accrued under a child support judgment before the governing child support judgment is entered.

      (7) For purposes of reconciling any child support arrears or credits under all of the child support judgments, amounts collected and credited for a particular period under one child support judgment must be credited against the amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under any other child support judgment.

      (8) Not sooner than 30 days and not later than 60 days after entry of the governing child support judgment, the administrator shall file a copy of the governing child support judgment with each court that issued an earlier child support judgment. A failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the governing child support judgment.

      (9) When an administrative law judge finds that two or more child support judgments exist involving the same obligor and child and the same period, and each child support judgment was issued in this state, the administrative law judge shall remand the matter to the administrator to follow the provisions of subsection (3) of this section. [Formerly 416.448]

      Note: See note under 25.501.

 

      25.540 Notice of intent to establish and enforce arrearages; request for hearing; order.

The notice must be served upon the obligor in the manner prescribed for service of summons in a civil action, mailed to the obligor at the obligor’s last-known address by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other mail service with delivery confirmation. The administrator shall mail the notice to the obligee by regular mail.

      (2) The notice shall include:

      (d) A statement that if the obligor or the obligee objects to the enforcement of the arrearages, then the objecting party must send to the office issuing the notice, within 30 days of the date of service, a written response that sets forth any objections and requests a hearing;

      (e) A statement that the only basis upon which an obligor or an obligee may object to the enforcement of the arrearages is that the amount of the arrearages specified in the notice is incorrect;

      (f) A reference to ORS 25.501 to 25.556;

      (g) A statement that the obligor and the obligee are responsible for notifying the office of any change of address or employment;

      (h) A statement that if the obligor or the obligee has any questions, the obligor or obligee should telephone or visit the appropriate office or consult an attorney; and

      (i) Such other information as the administrator finds appropriate.

      (3) If a timely written response setting forth objections and requesting a hearing is received by the appropriate office, a hearing shall be held under ORS 25.513.

      (4) If no timely written response and request for hearing is received by the appropriate office, the administrator shall enter an order directing that the amount of the arrearages stated in the notice be entered in the child support accounting record maintained by the Department of Justice.

      (5) Action to administratively enforce and collect upon the arrearages established under this section may be taken 30 days after service of or receipt or refusal of the notice by the obligor or obligee.

      (6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the administrator from using other available enforcement remedies at any time. [Formerly 416.429]

 

      Note: See note under 25.501.

 

      25.542 Preventing transfer of assets to evade compliance with order. If at any time subsequent to service, receipt or refusal of a notice pursuant to ORS 25.511, and prior to the entry of an order, the administrator reasonably believes that the parent is about to transfer, encumber, convey, sell, remove, secrete, waste or otherwise dispose of property which could be made subject to collection action to satisfy the order for past support, the administrator may certify the matter to the circuit court, accompanied by a legal description of the property in question, in order to obtain a temporary restraining order directing that such property not be transferred, encumbered, conveyed, sold, removed, secreted, wasted or otherwise disposed of pending entry of a support order by the circuit court. The administrator shall, in such cases, file in the case record a certified statement of the reasons upon which such belief is founded. If the parent furnishes a good and sufficient bond satisfactory to the court, the temporary restraining order shall be vacated. A certified copy of an order entered under this section may be recorded in the same manner as a notice of lis pendens under ORS 93.740. [Formerly 416.450]

 

      Note: See note under 25.501.

 

      25.550 Establishing paternity of child; certification of paternity issue to circuit court. (1) The administrator may establish paternity of a child in the course of a support proceeding under ORS 25.501 to 25.556 when both parents sign statements that paternity has not been legally established and that the male parent is the father of the child. The administrator may enter an order which establishes paternity.

      (2) If the parent fails to file a response denying paternity and requesting a hearing within the time period allowed in ORS 25.511 (2), then the administrator, without further notice to the parent, may enter an order, in accordance with ORS 25.511 (7), which declares and establishes the parent as the legal father of the child.

      (3) Any order entered pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section establishes legal paternity for all purposes. The Center for Health Statistics of the Oregon Health Authority shall amend the record of live birth for the child and issue a new certified copy of the record of live birth in the new name, if any, of the child. The original record of live birth shall be sealed and filed and may be opened only upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (4)(a) If paternity is alleged under ORS 25.511 (3) and a written response denying paternity and requesting a hearing is received within the time period allowed in ORS 25.511 (2), or if the administrator determines that there is a valid issue with respect to paternity of the child, the administrator, subject to the provisions of subsections (5) and (6) of this section, shall certify the matter to the circuit court for a determination based upon the contents of the file and any evidence which may be produced at trial. The proceedings in court shall for all purposes be deemed suits in equity. The provisions of ORS 109.145 to 109.230 apply to proceedings certified to court by the administrator pursuant to this section.

      (b) Any response denying paternity and requesting a hearing shall be sent by the enforcement office to the obligee by regular mail.

      (5) An action to establish paternity initiated under ORS 25.501 to 25.556 shall not be certified to court for trial unless all of the following have occurred:

      (a) Blood tests have been conducted;

      (b) The results of the blood tests have been served upon the parties and notice has been given that an order establishing paternity will be entered unless a written objection is received within 30 days; and

      (c) A written objection to the entry of an order has been timely received from a party.

      (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of this section, the administrator:

      (a) Shall certify the matter to court:

      (A) Within 30 days of receipt by the administrator of a timely written objection to the entry of an order by a party under subsection (5)(c) of this section;

      (B) When a party requests certification in writing after the administrator has received a party’s written denial of paternity if at least 120 days have elapsed from receipt of the denial; or

      (C) Upon receipt of blood test results with a cumulative paternity index of less than 99; and

      (b) May certify the matter to court at any time under any other circumstances.

      (7) If the blood tests conducted under ORS 109.250 to 109.262 result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater, evidence of the tests, together with the testimony of the parent, shall be a sufficient basis upon which to establish paternity and the administrator may enter an order declaring the alleged father as the legal father of the child unless a party objects in writing to the entry of the order. The testimony of the parent may be presented by affidavit.

      (8) Prior to certification to court, the administrator may attempt to resolve the issue of paternity by discovery conducted under the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure. Unless otherwise specifically provided by statute, the proceedings shall be conducted under the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.

      (9) When, in accordance with subsection (6)(a)(A) of this section, a party objects to the entry of an order and the blood tests conducted under ORS 109.250 to 109.262 result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater, notwithstanding the party’s objection, evidence of the tests, together with the testimony of a parent, is a sufficient basis upon which to presume paternity for purposes of establishing temporary support under this section. The court shall, upon motion of any party, enter a temporary order requiring the alleged father to provide support pending the determination of parentage by the court. In determining the amount of support, the court shall use the formula established under ORS 25.275. [Formerly 416.430]

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if there is an Oregon juvenile court case regarding the dependent child, the matter may be certified to the county that has jurisdiction of the juvenile court case.

      (4) Upon receipt of a timely application, the administrator shall order:

      (a) The mother and the male party to submit to blood tests; and

      (b) The person having physical custody of the child to submit the child to blood tests.

      (5) If a party refuses to comply with an order under subsection (4) of this section, the issue of paternity shall, upon the motion of the administrator, be resolved against that party by an order of the court either affirming or setting aside the order establishing paternity or the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity.

      (6) If the results of the blood tests exclude the male party as the biological father of the child, the administrator may file a motion with the court for an order setting aside the order establishing paternity or the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity and for a judgment of nonpaternity.

      (7) Support paid before an order establishing paternity or a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is set aside under this section may not be returned to the payer.

      (8) The administrator shall send a court-certified true copy of a judgment of nonpaternity to the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics. Upon receipt of the judgment, the state registrar shall correct any records maintained by the state registrar that indicate that the male party is the parent of the child.

CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES

 

      25.650 Information on past due support to consumer reporting agencies; rules. (1) As used in this section, “consumer reporting agency” means any person that, for monetary fees or dues or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and that uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.

      (2)(a) Notwithstanding any other law, and subject to rules established by the Department of Justice, for cases in which there is past due support, the department shall:

      (A) Report periodically to consumer reporting agencies the name of any obligor who is delinquent in the payment of support and the amount owed by the obligor; and

      (B) Otherwise make available to a consumer reporting agency upon its request information regarding the amount of past due support owed by an obligor.

      (b) The department shall provide advance notice to the obligor concerning the proposed reporting of information to the consumer reporting agencies. The notice must inform the obligor:

      (A) Of the amount of the past due support the department will report to the consumer reporting agencies;

      (B) That the department will continue to report the past due support amount owed without sending additional notice to the obligor;

      (C) Of the obligor’s right to request an administrative review within 30 days after the date of the notice; and

      (D) Of the issues that may be considered on review.

      (c) If an obligor requests an administrative review, the department may not report the past due support amount until the review is complete.

      (d) A party may appeal a decision from the administrative review under ORS 183.484. An appeal of the decision does not stay the department from making reports to consumer reporting agencies.

      (3) The administrator may request that a consumer reporting agency provide a consumer report when needed for one or more of the following purposes:

      (a) To establish or modify a support order.

      (b) When parentage has been established with respect to an individual, to establish the individual’s capacity to make child support payments or the appropriate amount of child support that may be ordered.

      (c) To enforce a support order.

      (4) The department shall report information under subsection (2) of this section only to a person that has furnished evidence satisfactory to the department that the person is a consumer reporting agency.

      (5) When the department has made a report to a consumer reporting agency under subsection (2) of this section, the department shall promptly notify the consumer reporting agency when the department’s records show that the obligor no longer owes past due support. [1985 c.671 §§45,46; 1993 c.596 §14; 1997 c.704 §35; 1999 c.80 §66; 2003 c.73 §38; 2005 c.560 §6; 2017 c.460 §1; 2017 c.461 §3]

 

LIENS ON PERSONAL PROPERTY

 

      25.670 Judgment lien on personal property. (1) Whenever there is a judgment for unpaid child or spousal support, a lien arises by operation of law on any personal property owned by the obligor, and the lien continues until the liability for the unpaid support is satisfied or the judgment or renewal thereof has expired. For purposes of this section and ORS 25.680 and 25.690, liability for the unpaid support includes the amount of unpaid support, with interest, and any costs that may be associated with lawful execution on the lien including, but not limited to, attorney fees, costs of notice and sale, storage and handling.

      (2)(a) A lien arising under subsection (1) of this section may be recorded by filing a written notice of claim of lien with the county clerk of the county in which the obligor resides or the property is located. The notice of claim of lien required under this subsection shall be a written statement and must include:

      (A) A statement of the total amount due, as of the date of the filing of the notice of claim of lien;

      (B) The name and address of the obligor and obligee;

      (C) The name and address of the office of the district attorney, Division of Child Support or other person or entity filing the notice;

      (D) A statement identifying the county where the underlying support order was entered and its case number;

      (E) A description of the personal property to be charged with the lien sufficient for identification; and

      (F) A statement of the date the lien expires under the laws of the issuing state. If no expiration date is provided, the lien expires in Oregon five years from the date of recording.

      (b) The county clerk shall record the notice of claim of lien filed under paragraph (a) of this subsection in the County Clerk Lien Record.

      (3) When a notice of claim of lien is recorded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the person or entity filing the notice of claim of lien shall send forthwith a copy of the notice to the owner of the personal property to be charged with the lien by registered or certified mail, or by any other mail service with delivery confirmation, sent to the owner’s last-known address.

      (4) Liens described in subsection (1) of this section that arise by operation of law in another state must be accorded full faith and credit if the state agency, party or other entity seeking to enforce the lien follows the applicable procedures for recording and service of notice of claim of lien set forth in this section. A state agency, party or other entity may not file an action to enforce a lien described in this section until the underlying judgment has been filed in Oregon as provided in ORS chapter 110. [1985 c.671 §47; 1993 c.223 §3; 1993 c.596 §15; 1999 c.80 §34; 2003 c.576 §577; 2011 c.318 §12; 2017 c.461 §4]

 

      25.680 Effect of lien; priority. (1) Whenever a notice of claim of lien has been recorded under ORS 25.670 (2), the owner of the personal property may not release, sell, transfer, pay over, encumber or convey the personal property that is the subject of the lien until the Department of Justice or person to whom the support is or was owed or, if services are being provided under ORS 25.080, the enforcing agency of this or any other state releases the lien, the lien has been satisfied or a court has ordered release of the lien on the basis that no debt exists or that the debt has been satisfied. The limitations of this subsection do not apply to transfers or conveyances of the property by the owner to the holder of a security interest that was in existence at the time the notice of claim of lien was filed.

      (2) The rights of bona fide purchasers for value or persons with a security interest in the personal property are not affected by the creation or the existence of the lien.

      (3) Liens filed under ORS 25.670 do not have priority over previously perfected security interests. [1985 c.671 §48; 1999 c.80 §35; 2003 c.73 §39]

 

      25.690 Foreclosure of lien. A lien arising pursuant to ORS 25.670 may be foreclosed in the manner set out in ORS 87.262 or ORS chapter 18 or in any other manner permitted under law. [1985 c.671 §49; 1999 c.80 §36; 2003 c.576 §577a]
