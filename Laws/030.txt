ACTIONS FOR INTIMIDATION

      (b) Punitive damages.

      (3) The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff in an action under this section.

Any claim for relief under this section does not prevent any person from seeking any other remedy otherwise available under law. [1981 c.785 §4; 2019 c.553 §17]

 

ACTIONS ON OFFICIAL BONDS

 

      30.210 To whom official bonds are security. The official undertaking or other security of a public officer to the state, or to any county, city or other public corporation of like character therein, is a security to the state, county, city or public corporation, as the case may be, and also, to all persons severally for the official delinquencies against which it is intended to provide.

 

      30.220 Parties. When a public officer by official misconduct or neglect of duty forfeits an official undertaking or other security of the public officer, or renders the sureties of the public officer liable thereon, any person injured by the misconduct or neglect, or who is by law entitled to the benefit of the security, may maintain an action thereon in the name of the person, against the officer and the sureties of the officer, to recover the amount to which the person may by reason thereof be entitled.

 

      30.230 Leave to begin action. Before an action can be commenced by a plaintiff other than the state, or the public corporation named in the undertaking or security, leave shall be obtained of the court or judge thereof where the action is triable. Such leave shall be granted upon the production of a certified copy of the undertaking or security, and an affidavit of the plaintiff or some person on behalf of the plaintiff showing the delinquency; but if the matters set forth in the affidavit are such that, if true, the party applying would clearly not be entitled to recover in the action, the leave shall not be granted. If it does not appear from the complaint that leave has been granted, the defendant on motion shall be entitled to judgment of dismissal without prejudice; if it does, the defendant may controvert the allegation, and if the issue be found in favor of the defendant, judgment shall be given accordingly. [Amended by 1979 c.284 §63]

 

      30.240 Subsequent delinquencies on same bond. A judgment in favor of a party for one delinquency shall not preclude the same or another party from maintaining another action on the same undertaking or security for another delinquency.

 

      30.250 Amount of judgment. In an action upon an official undertaking or security, if judgments have already been recovered on the same undertaking or security against the surety therein, other than by confession, and if such recovery is established on the trial, judgment shall not be given against the surety for an amount exceeding the difference between the amount of the penalty and the amount that already has been recovered against the surety.

(1) Subject to the limitations of ORS 30.260 to 30.300, every public body is subject to civil action for its torts and those of its officers, employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment or duties, whether arising out of a governmental or proprietary function or while operating a motor vehicle in a ridesharing arrangement authorized under ORS 276.598.

      (2) The sole cause of action for a tort committed by officers, employees or agents of a public body acting within the scope of their employment or duties and eligible for representation and indemnification under ORS 30.285 or 30.287 is an action under ORS 30.260 to 30.300. The remedy provided by ORS 30.260 to 30.300 is exclusive of any other action against any such officer, employee or agent of a public body whose act or omission within the scope of the officer’s, employee’s or agent’s employment or duties gives rise to the action. No other form of civil action is permitted.

      (3) If an action under ORS 30.260 to 30.300 alleges damages in an amount equal to or less than the damages allowed under ORS 30.271, 30.272 or 30.273, the sole cause of action for a tort committed by officers, employees or agents of a public body acting within the scope of their employment or duties and eligible for representation and indemnification under ORS 30.285 or 30.287 is an action against the public body. If an action is filed against an officer, employee or agent of a public body, and the plaintiff alleges damages in an amount equal to or less than the damages allowed under ORS 30.271, 30.272 or 30.273, the court upon motion shall substitute the public body as the defendant. Substitution of the public body as the defendant does not exempt the public body from making any report required under ORS 742.400.

      (4) If an action under ORS 30.260 to 30.300 alleges damages in an amount greater than the damages allowed under ORS 30.271, 30.272 or 30.273, the action may be brought and maintained against an officer, employee or agent of a public body, whether or not the public body is also named as a defendant. An action brought under this subsection is subject to the limitations on damages imposed under ORS 30.271, 30.272 or 30.273, and the total combined amount recovered in the action may not exceed those limitations for a single accident or occurrence without regard to the number or types of defendants named in the action.

      (5) Every public body is immune from liability for any claim for injury to or death of any person or injury to property resulting from an act or omission of an officer, employee or agent of a public body when such officer, employee or agent is immune from liability.

      (6) Every public body and its officers, employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment or duties, or while operating a motor vehicle in a ridesharing arrangement authorized under ORS 276.598, are immune from liability for:

      (f) Any claim arising out of an act done or omitted under apparent authority of a law, resolution, rule or regulation that is unconstitutional, invalid or inapplicable except to the extent that they would have been liable had the law, resolution, rule or regulation been constitutional, valid and applicable, unless such act was done or omitted in bad faith or with malice.

      (7) This section applies to any action of any officer, employee or agent of the state relating to a nuclear incident, whether or not the officer, employee or agent is acting within the scope of employment, and provided the nuclear incident is covered by an insurance or indemnity agreement under 42 U.S.C. 2210.

      (8) Subsection (6)(c) of this section does not apply to any discretionary act that is found to be the cause or partial cause of a nuclear incident covered by an insurance or indemnity agreement under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 2210, including but not limited to road design and route selection.

      (a) Tort liability of the public body and its officers, employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment or duties; or

      (b) Property damage.

      (2) In addition to, or in lieu of procuring insurance, the governing body may establish a self-insurance program against the tort liability of the public body and its officers, employees and agents or against property damage. If the public body has authority to levy taxes, it may include in its levy an amount sufficient to establish and maintain a self-insurance program on an actuarially sound basis.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, two or more local public bodies may jointly provide by intergovernmental agreement for anything that subsections (1) and (2) of this section authorize individually.

      (4) As an alternative or in addition to establishment of a self-insurance program or purchase of insurance or both, the governing body of any local public body and the Oregon Department of Administrative Services may contract for payment by the public body to the department of assessments determined by the department to be sufficient, on an actuarially sound basis, to cover the potential liability of the public body and its officers, employees or agents acting within the scope of their employment or duties under ORS 30.260 to 30.300, and costs of administration, or to cover any portion of potential liability, and for payment by the department of valid claims against the public body and its officers, employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment or duties. The department may provide the public body evidence of insurance by issuance of a certificate or policy.

      (5) Assessments paid to the department under subsection (4) of this section shall be paid into the Insurance Fund created under ORS 278.425, and claims paid and administrative costs incurred under subsection (4) of this section shall be paid out of the Insurance Fund, and moneys in the Insurance Fund are continuously appropriated for those purposes. When notice of any claim is furnished as provided in the agreement, the claim shall be handled and paid, if appropriate, in the same manner as a claim against a state agency, officer, employee or agent, without regard to the amount the local public body has been assessed.

      (6) A self-insurance program established by three or more public bodies under subsections (2) and (3) of this section is subject to the following requirements:

      (a) The annual contributions to the program must amount in the aggregate to at least $1 million.

      (b) The program must provide documentation that defines program benefits and administration.

      (c) Program contributions and reserves must be held in separate accounts and used for the exclusive benefit of the program.

      (d) The program must maintain adequate reserves. Reserve adequacy shall be calculated annually with proper actuarial calculations including the following:

      (A) Known claims, paid and outstanding;

      (B) Estimate of incurred but not reported claims;

      (C) Claims handling expenses;

      (D) Unearned contributions; and

      (E) A claims trend factor.

      (e) The program must maintain an unallocated reserve account equal to 25 percent of annual contributions, or $250,000, whichever is greater. As used in this paragraph, “unallocated reserves” means the amount of funds determined by a licensed independent actuary to be greater than what is required to fund outstanding claim liabilities, including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported.

      (f) The program must make an annual independently audited financial statement available to the participants of the program.

      (g) The program must maintain adequate excess or reinsurance against the risk of economic loss.

      (h) The program, a third party administrator or an owner of a third party administrator may not collect commissions or fees from an insurer.

      (7) A program operated under subsection (6) of this section that fails to meet any of the listed requirements for a period longer than 30 consecutive days shall be dissolved and any unallocated reserves returned in proportional amounts based on the contributions of the public body to the public bodies that established the program within 90 days of the failure.

      (8) A local public body may bring an action against a program operated under subsection (6) of this section if the program fails to comply with the requirements listed in subsection (6) of this section. [1975 c.609 §19; 1977 c.428 §1; 1981 c.109 §4; 1985 c.731 §21; 2005 c.175 §2; 2009 c.67 §19]

 

      30.285 Public body shall indemnify public officers; procedure for requesting counsel; extent of duty of state; obligation for judgment and attorney fees. (1) The governing body of any public body shall defend, save harmless and indemnify any of its officers, employees and agents, whether elective or appointive, against any tort claim or demand, whether groundless or otherwise, arising out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of duty.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply in case of malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty.

      (3) If any civil action, suit or proceeding is brought against any state officer, employee or agent which on its face falls within the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, or which the state officer, employee or agent asserts to be based in fact upon an alleged act or omission in the performance of duty, the state officer, employee or agent may, after consulting with the Oregon Department of Administrative Services file a written request for counsel with the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall thereupon appear and defend the officer, employee or agent unless after investigation the Attorney General finds that the claim or demand does not arise out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of duty, or that the act or omission complained of amounted to malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty, in which case the Attorney General shall reject defense of the claim.

      (4) Any officer, employee or agent of the state against whom a claim within the scope of this section is made shall cooperate fully with the Attorney General and the department in the defense of such claim. If the Attorney General after consulting with the department determines that such officer, employee or agent has not so cooperated or has otherwise acted to prejudice defense of the claim, the Attorney General may at any time reject the defense of the claim.

      (5) If the Attorney General rejects defense of a claim under subsection (3) of this section or this subsection, no public funds shall be paid in settlement of said claim or in payment of any judgment against such officer, employee or agent. Such action by the Attorney General shall not prejudice the right of the officer, employee or agent to assert and establish an appropriate proceedings that the claim or demand in fact arose out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of duty, or that the act or omission complained of did not amount to malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty, in which case the officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified against liability and reasonable costs of defending the claim, cost of such indemnification to be a charge against the Insurance Fund established by ORS 278.425.

      (6) Nothing in subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section shall be deemed to increase the limits of liability of any public officer, agent or employee under ORS 30.260 to 30.300, or obviate the necessity of compliance with ORS 30.275 by any claimant, nor to affect the liability of the state itself or of any other public officer, agent or employee on any claim arising out of the same accident or occurrence.

      (7) As used in this section, “state officer, employee or agent” includes district attorneys and deputy district attorneys, special prosecutors and law clerks of the office of district attorney who act in a prosecutorial capacity, but does not include any other employee of the office of district attorney or any employee of the justice or circuit courts whose salary is paid wholly or in part by the county. [1967 c.627 §7; 1975 c.609 §16; 1981 c.109 §5; 1981 c.913 §2; 1985 c.731 §22; 1987 c.763 §1; 2009 c.67 §11]

 

      30.287 Counsel for public officer; when public funds not to be paid in settlement; effect on liability limit; defense by insurer. (1) If any civil action, suit or proceeding is brought against any officer, employee or agent of a local public body which on its face falls within the provisions of ORS 30.285 (1), or which the officer, employee or agent asserts to be based in fact upon an alleged act or omission in the performance of duty, the officer, employee or agent may file a written request for counsel with the governing body of the public body. The governing body shall thereupon engage counsel to appear and defend the officer, employee or agent unless after investigation it is determined that the claim or demand does not arise out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of duty, or that the act or omission complained of amounted to malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty, in which case the governing body shall reject defense of the claim.

      (2) Any officer, employee or agent of a local public body against whom a claim within the scope of this section is made shall cooperate fully with the governing body and counsel in the defense of such claim. If the counsel determines and certifies to the governing body that such officer, employee or agent has not so cooperated or has otherwise acted in prejudice of the defense of the claim, the governing body may at any time reject the defense of the claim.

      (3) If the governing body rejects defense of a claim under subsection (1) of this section, no public funds shall be paid in settlement of the claim or in payment of any judgment against such officer, employee or agent. Such action by the governing body shall not prejudice the right of the officer, employee or agent to assert and establish in an appropriate proceedings that the claim or demand in fact arose out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of duty, or that the act or omission complained of did not amount to malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty, in which case the officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified by the public body against liability and reasonable costs of defending the claim.

      (4) Nothing in subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section shall be deemed to increase the limits of liability of any public officer, agent or employee under ORS 30.260 to 30.300, or relieve any claimant of the necessity of compliance with ORS 30.275, nor to affect the liability of the local public body itself or of any other public officer, agent or employee on any claim arising out of the same accident or occurrence.

      (5) The provisions of this section may be superseded to the extent that the claim against the public officer, employee or agent may be defended by any insurer, or may be subject under ORS 30.282 to agreement with the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, in which case the provisions of the policy of insurance or other agreement are applicable. [1975 c.609 §20; 1985 c.565 §3; 1989 c.1004 §1; 2009 c.67 §12]

 

      30.290 Settlement of claims by local public body. The governing body of any local public body may, subject to the provisions of any contract of liability insurance existing, compromise, adjust and settle tort claims against the public body or its officers, employees or agents acting within the scope of their employment for damages under ORS 30.260 to 30.300 and may, subject to procedural requirements imposed by law or other charter, appropriate money for the payment of amounts agreed upon. [1967 c.627 §8; 1975 c.609 §17; 1989 c.655 §1]

 

      30.295 Payment of judgment or settlement; remedies for nonpayment; tax levy for payment; installment payments. (1) When a judgment is entered against or a settlement is made by a public body for a claim within the scope of ORS 30.260 to 30.300, including claims against officers, employees or agents required to be indemnified under ORS 30.285, payment shall be made and the same remedies shall apply in case of nonpayment as in the case of other judgments or settlements against the public body except as otherwise provided in this section.

      (2) If the public body is authorized to levy taxes that could be used to satisfy a judgment or settlement within the scope of ORS 30.260 to 30.300, and it has, by resolution, declared that the following conditions exist, interest shall accrue on the judgment or settlement, but the same shall not be due and payable until after the canvass and certification of an election upon a special tax levy for purposes of satisfying the judgment or settlement:

      (a) The amount of the judgment or settlement would exceed amounts budgeted for contingencies, tort claims and projected surplus in the current budget;

      (b) The amount of the judgment or settlement would exceed 10 percent of the total of the next fiscal year’s projected revenues that are not restricted as to use, including the maximum amount of general property tax that could be levied without election but excluding any levy for debt service;

      (c) Payment of the judgment or settlement within less than a certain number of years would seriously impair the ability of the public body to carry out its responsibilities as a unit of government; and

      (d) The public body has passed an appropriate ordinance or resolution calling a special election to submit to its electors a special levy in an amount sufficient to satisfy the judgment or settlement.

      (3) A certified copy of the resolution provided for in subsection (2) of this section shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which an order permitting installment payments could be entered.

      (4) If the public body is not authorized to levy taxes as provided in subsection (2) of this section, and it has, by resolution, declared that the applicable conditions specified in subsection (2)(a) to (c) of this section exist, it may petition for an order permitting installment payments as provided in subsection (6) of this section.

      (5)(a) The provisions of subsections (2) and (4) of this section do not apply to the State of Oregon.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the conditions specified in subsection (4) of this section exist, the Secretary of State may, under Seal of the State of Oregon, attest thereto in lieu of a resolution, and the State of Oregon may thereafter petition for an order permitting installment payments as provided in subsection (6) of this section.

      (6) If the procedure specified in subsections (2) to (5) of this section has been followed, and, with respect to public bodies subject to subsection (2) of this section, the tax levy failed, the public body may petition for an order permitting installment payments. The petition shall be filed in the court in which judgment was entered or, if no judgment has been entered, it shall be filed in the circuit court of the judicial district in which the public body has its legal situs. Petitions by the State of Oregon when no judgment has been entered shall be filed in Marion County Circuit Court.

      (7) The court in which a petition is filed shall order that the judgment or settlement be paid in quarterly, semiannual or annual installments over a period of time not to exceed 10 years. The court shall determine the term of years based upon the ability of the public body to effectively carry out its governmental responsibilities, and shall not allow a longer term than appears reasonably necessary to meet that need. The order permitting installment payments shall provide for annual interest at the judgment rate. [1967 c.627 §9; 1977 c.823 §4; 2005 c.22 §20]

 

      30.297 Liability of certain state agencies for damages caused by foster child or youth offender; conditions; exceptions. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 125.235, the Department of Human Services is liable for damages resulting from the intentional torts of a foster child who is residing in:

VOLUNTEERS TRANSPORTING OLDER PERSONS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

 

      30.475 Legislative policy. In enacting ORS 30.480 and 30.485, the Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon declares:

      (1) That many persons with disabilities and older persons, due to disability or age, cannot obtain medical, educational, recreational or other important services or benefits, or pursue daily life activities outside the home, such as shopping or socializing, without transportation and other necessary assistance;

      (2) That public resources are not adequate to provide dependable transportation to persons with disabilities and older persons, and that it is in the best interest of this state to encourage volunteers to provide transportation services to Oregon’s people with disabilities and older people;

      (3) That the threat or fear of personal liability arising from the provision of transportation services to persons with disabilities and older persons seriously discourages individuals from providing services on a volunteer basis;

      (4) That the policy of this state is to encourage volunteers to provide such transportation services; and

      (5) That, therefore, persons who qualify under ORS 30.480 must be protected from the threat of unlimited personal liability arising from the provision of volunteer transportation services, and that ORS 30.475 to 30.485 shall be liberally construed in favor of such persons in order to promote fully the foregoing policies. [1983 c.468 §1; 1989 c.224 §5; 2007 c.70 §9]

 

      30.480 Limitation on liability of volunteers; conditions. (1) When a provider of volunteer transportation services who is qualified under subsection (3) of this section provides the services under the conditions described in subsection (4) of this section to a person with a disability or a person who is 55 years of age or older, the liability of the provider to the person for injury, death or loss arising out of the volunteer transportation services shall be limited as provided in this section. When volunteer transportation services are provided to five or fewer persons at one time, the liability of the provider of the volunteer transportation services shall not exceed the greater of the amount of coverage under the terms of the provider’s motor vehicle liability insurance policy, as described in ORS 806.080, or the amounts specified in ORS 806.070 for future responsibility payments for:

      (a) Bodily injury to or death of any one person to whom the transportation services are provided, in any one accident.

      (b) Bodily injury to or death of two or more persons to whom the transportation services are provided, in any one accident.

      (c) Injury to or destruction of the property of one or more persons to whom the transportation services are provided, in any one accident.

      (2) Notwithstanding the amount specified in subsection (1)(b) of this section by reference to ORS 806.070, if a qualified provider of transportation services provides the services to more than five persons, but not more than 16, at one time who have disabilities or who are 55 years of age or older, under the conditions described in subsection (4) of this section, the liability under subsection (1)(b) of this section shall not exceed the greater of the amount of coverage under the terms of the provider’s motor vehicle liability insurance policy or $300,000. The limitations on liability provided by ORS 30.475, 30.480 and 30.485 do not apply when volunteer transportation services are provided to 17 or more persons at one time who have disabilities or who are 55 years of age or older.

      (3) The following persons qualify for the limitation on liability under subsections (1) and (2) of this section:

      (a) The person who provides or sponsors transportation services.

      (b) The owner of the vehicle in which transportation services are provided.

      (c) The person who operates the vehicle in which transportation services are provided.

      (4) The limitation on liability under subsections (1) and (2) of this section applies to a person qualified under subsection (3) of this section only under the following conditions:

      (a) If the person is an individual, the individual must hold a valid Oregon driver’s license.

      (b) The person must provide the transportation services on a nonprofit and voluntary basis. However, this paragraph does not prohibit a sponsor of transportation services from reimbursing an operator of a private motor vehicle providing the services for actual expenses incurred by the operator. If an operator is paid, that operator is qualified only if operating as an emergency operator.

      (c) The person providing the transportation services must not receive from the persons using the services any substantial benefit in a material or business sense that is a substantial motivating factor for the transportation. A contribution or donation to the provider of the transportation services other than the operator of the motor vehicle or any mere gratuity or social amenity shall not be a substantial benefit under this paragraph.

      (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the transportation services must be provided without charge to the person using the services.

      (5) The amounts received by a person with a disability or a person 55 years of age or older under the personal injury protection provisions of the insurance coverage of a person who qualifies for the limitation on liability under this section shall not reduce the amount that the person may recover under subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

      (6) The liability of two or more persons whose liability is limited under this section, on claims arising out of a single accident, shall not exceed in the aggregate the amounts limited by subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

      (7) This section does not apply in the case of an accident or injury if the accident or injury was intentional on the part of any person who provided the transportation services or if the accident or injury was caused by the person’s gross negligence or intoxication. For purposes of this subsection, gross negligence is negligence which is materially greater than the mere absence of reasonable care under the circumstances, and which is characterized by conscious indifference to or reckless disregard of the rights of others.

      (8) For purposes of this section, a person has a disability if the person has a physical or mental disability that for the person constitutes or results in a functional limitation to one or more of the following activities: Self-care, ambulation, communication, transportation, education, socialization or employment. [1983 c.468 §2; 1985 c.16 §443; 1987 c.915 §7; 1989 c.224 §6; 2007 c.70 §10]

 

      30.485 Apportionment of damages; insurance issues excluded from jury consideration.

      30.643 Waiver or deferral of fees and costs. (1) If an adult in custody seeks to file an action against a public body, the fees and court costs of the adult in custody may be waived or deferred only in the manner provided by this section.

      (2) Any adult in custody seeking waiver or deferral of fees or court costs must submit with the application for waiver or deferral a certified copy of the trust account statement of the adult in custody for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint, petition, notice of appeal or petition for review. The statement must be certified as correct by an official of each correctional facility in which the adult in custody was confined within the six-month period or by an employee of the Department of Corrections charged with the responsibility of overseeing adult in custody trust accounts.

      (3) Upon the filing of a statement under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall review the information in the statement relating to deposits in the trust account of the adult in custody and any other resources available to the adult in custody. The court may only waive the fees and court costs of the adult in custody if the court determines that the adult in custody has no funds and will not have funds.

      (4) If the court makes a determination that an adult in custody has or will have funds to pay fees and court costs, the court shall require full payment of the filing fees and court costs, or, if funds are not immediately available in the trust account, shall assess and collect filing fees and court costs as funds become available in the trust account.

      (5) On its own motion or on the motion of the public body, the court may review the pleadings of the adult in custody in an action against a public body at the time a request for waiver or deferral of filing fees or court costs is made. If the court finds that the pleadings fail to state a claim for which relief may be granted, the court may decline to waive or defer filing fees or court costs. The court shall enter a denial of waiver or deferral of fees and costs under this subsection as a limited judgment. Notwithstanding the time established by statute for the commencement of an action, if a limited judgment is entered under this subsection within 30 days of the expiration of the time allowed for commencing the action, the adult in custody may commence the action not later than 45 days after the judgment is entered. Only one extension of the time allowed for commencing an action may be granted by the court under this section.

      (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an adult in custody from bringing an action against a public body because the adult in custody has no assets or means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee as provided under this section. [1999 c.657 §2; 2005 c.530 §1; 2007 c.493 §11; 2019 c.213 §5]

 

      30.645 Waiver or deferral of fees after three dismissals of action. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the court may not waive or defer the fees or court costs under ORS 30.643 for an adult in custody if the adult in custody has, on three or more prior occasions while incarcerated or detained in any correctional facility, filed an action against a public body in a court of this state that was dismissed on the grounds that the action:

      (a) Was frivolous or malicious;

      (b) Failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; or

      (c) Sought monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from a claim for monetary relief.

      (2) The court may waive or defer fees or court costs of an adult in custody who would not otherwise be eligible for waiver or deferral under subsection (1) of this section if the adult in custody establishes in the application for waiver or deferral that the adult in custody is in imminent danger of serious physical injury and the action against a public body is needed to seek relief from that danger. [1999 c.657 §3; 2007 c.493 §12; 2019 c.213 §6]

 

      30.646 Payment of costs under judgment against adult in custody. (1) If an adult in custody files an action against a public body and a judgment is entered that requires the adult in custody to pay costs to the public body, the adult in custody must pay the full amount of the costs ordered.

      (2) Payment for costs under this section shall be made by deductions from the income credited to the trust account of the adult in custody. [1999 c.657 §4; 2019 c.213 §7]

 

      30.647 Dismissal of action during proceedings. (1) If fees or court costs of an adult in custody have been waived or deferred under ORS 30.643, a court shall dismiss the case if at any time the court determines that the adult in custody was in fact able to pay fees and court costs at the time the application for waiver or deferral was made under ORS 21.680 to 21.698.

      (2) If the fees or court costs have been waived or deferred under ORS 30.643 for an adult in custody, a court shall dismiss the case if at any time the court determines that each claim in the action, petition or appeal:

      (a) Is frivolous or malicious;

      (b) Fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and the court denies leave to amend; or

      (c) Seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from a claim for monetary relief.

      (3) Upon appeal of any dismissal under this section, the Court of Appeals on its own motion, or on the motion of the respondent, may summarily affirm the judgment of the trial court, with or without submission of briefs and without oral argument, if the Court of Appeals determines that the appeal does not present a substantial question of law. Notwithstanding ORS 2.570, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals may deny a respondent’s motion for summary affirmance under this subsection or may grant the motion if the petitioner does not oppose the motion. A dismissal of an appeal under this subsection constitutes a decision on the merits of the case. [1999 c.657 §5; 2007 c.493 §13; 2019 c.213 §8]

 

      30.648 Small claims actions.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 46.415, in an action against a public body brought under this section, if the public body is the Department of Corrections or another state agency, or an officer, employee or agent of the Department of Corrections or the state agency, an attorney or paralegal employed by the Department of Justice may appear and represent the public body.

      (5)(a) Notwithstanding ORS 46.475, in an action against a public body brought under this section, notice of intent to apply for an order of default, in the form prescribed by Uniform Trial Court Rule 2.010, must be filed and served on the public body against which an order of default is sought at least 10 days before a court may enter an order of default. If the public body is the Department of Corrections or another state agency, or an officer, employee or agent of the Department of Corrections or the state agency, notice must also be served on the Attorney General.

      (b) The court may not enter a default judgment in favor of the adult in custody unless the adult in custody submits to the court proof of service by affidavit of the notice and claim required under subsection (1) of this section and the notice of intent to apply for an order of default required under paragraph (a) of this subsection. [2011 c.262 §2; 2019 c.213 §9]

 

      30.650 Award of noneconomic damages.
