It is the policy and purpose of ORS 36.100 to 36.238 that, when two or more persons cannot settle a dispute directly between themselves, it is preferable that the disputants be encouraged and assisted to resolve their dispute with the assistance of a trusted and competent third party mediator, whenever possible, rather than the dispute remaining unresolved or resulting in litigation.

      (2) If a public body is a party to a mediation agreement, any provisions of the agreement that are exempt from disclosure as a public record under ORS 192.311 to 192.478 are confidential.

      (3) If a public body is a party to a mediation agreement, and the agreement is subject to the provisions of ORS 17.095, the terms of the agreement are confidential to the extent that those terms are confidential under ORS 17.095 (2).

      (4) If a public body is a party to a mediation agreement arising out of a workplace interpersonal dispute:

      (2) If a public body conducts or makes available a mediation, ORS 36.220 to 36.238 do not limit the ability of the public body to compile and disclose general statistical information concerning matters that have gone to mediation if the information does not identify specific cases.

      (3) In any mediation in a case that has been filed in court, ORS 36.220 to 36.238 do not limit the ability of the court to:

      (a) Require the parties or the mediator to report to the court the disposition of the mediation at the conclusion of the mediation proceeding;

      (b) Disclose records reflecting which matters have been referred for mediation; or

      (c) Disclose the disposition of the matter as reported to the court.

      36.234 Parties to mediation. For the purposes of ORS 36.220 to 36.238, a person, state agency or other public body is a party to a mediation if the person or public body participates in a mediation and has a direct interest in the controversy that is the subject of the mediation. A person or public body is not a party to a mediation solely because the person or public body is conducting the mediation, is making the mediation available or is serving as an information resource at the mediation. [1997 c.670 §7]

 

      36.236 Effect on other laws. (1) Nothing in ORS 36.220 to 36.238 affects any confidentiality created by other law, including but not limited to confidentiality created by ORS 107.755 to 107.795.

(Mediation of Disputes Related to Farming Practices)

 

      36.280 Mediation of disputes related to interference with farming practices. (1) If a person that is engaged in a farming practice, as defined in ORS 30.930, has a reasonable belief that the planting, growing or harvesting of an agricultural or horticultural commodity on nearby land might interfere with or is interfering with the farming practice, and the person responsible for the planting, growing or harvesting disputes that it might interfere with or is interfering with the farming practice, the State Department of Agriculture shall, if requested by either party to the dispute:

      (a) Provide mediation program services under ORS 36.252 to assist the parties in attempting to reach a voluntary resolution of the dispute; or

      (b) Refer the parties to the United States Department of Agriculture for the purpose of participating in a certified state agricultural mediation program.

      (2) A person that is requested to participate in a mediation proceeding under this section may elect to have the proceeding conducted through the use of mediation program services described in subsection (1)(a) of this section or under a mediation program described in subsection (1)(b) of this section. However, if the State Department of Agriculture has referred the parties under subsection (1)(b) of this section, a person electing to instead use mediation services described in subsection (1)(a) of this section must pay any additional costs and fees resulting from that election.

      (3) If the State Department of Agriculture provides mediation program services under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the total amount that the department may require of the parties as costs and fees for services provided in connection with the mediation of the dispute may not exceed $2,500. The party requesting the mediation services is responsible for paying the costs and fees unless both parties agree to divide the costs and fees. Unless the parties agree to a shorter time, the department shall conduct at least four hours of mediation proceedings to attempt to reach resolution of the dispute.

      (4) If a party is offered dispute mediation under subsection (1) of this section and is unwilling to participate in a mediation proceeding, a court may consider that unwillingness when determining whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction.

      (5) If a court action arises out of an alleged interference with the use of land for a farming practice due to the planting, growing or harvesting of an agricultural or horticultural commodity on nearby land, and the parties to the action have not previously attempted to have the dispute mediated, the parties must participate in a mediation proceeding under a program described under subsection (1) of this section beginning no later than 270 days after the action is filed. This subsection does not require participation in a mediation proceeding if the action settles or is otherwise resolved within 270 days after filing or if all parties to the action agree to waive mediation. A court may impose sanctions against a party that is unwilling to participate for at least four hours, or for a shorter time that was agreed to by the parties, in a mediation proceeding required under this subsection.

      (6) This section does not create any new cause of action or supersede any requirement, condition or prohibition otherwise established by law regarding the bringing of an action. [2015 c.630 §1; 2017 c.72 §1]

COURT ARBITRATION PROGRAM

 

      36.400 Mandatory arbitration programs. (1) A mandatory arbitration program is established in each circuit court.

      (2) Rules consistent with ORS 36.400 to 36.425 to govern the operation and procedure of an arbitration program established under this section may be made in the same manner as other rules applicable to the court and are subject to the approval of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

      (3) Each circuit court shall require arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425 in matters involving $50,000 or less.

      (4) ORS 36.400 to 36.425 do not apply to appeals from a county, justice or municipal court or actions in the small claims department of a circuit court. Actions transferred from the small claims department of a circuit court by reason of a request for a jury trial under ORS 46.455, by reason of the filing of a counterclaim in excess of the jurisdiction of the small claims department under ORS 46.461, or for any other reason, shall be subject to ORS 36.400 to 36.425 to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as a case initially filed in circuit court. The arbitrator shall not allow any party to appear or participate in the arbitration proceeding after the transfer unless the party pays the arbitrator fee established by court rule or the party obtains a waiver or deferral of the fee from the court and provides a copy of the waiver or deferral to the arbitrator. The failure of a party to appear or participate in the arbitration proceeding by reason of failing to pay the arbitrator fee or obtain a waiver or deferral of the fee does not affect the ability of the party to appeal the arbitrator’s decision and award in the manner provided by ORS 36.425. [Formerly 33.350; 1993 c.482 §1; 1995 c.618 §10; 1995 c.658 §30a; 1997 c.46 §§3,4; 2005 c.274 §1]

 

      36.405 Referral to mandatory arbitration; exemptions. (1) Except as provided in ORS 30.136, in a civil action in a circuit court where all parties have appeared, the court shall refer the action to arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425 if either of the following applies:

      (a) The only relief claimed is recovery of money or damages, and no party asserts a claim for money or general and special damages in an amount exceeding $50,000, exclusive of attorney fees, costs and disbursements and interest on judgment.

      (b) The action is a domestic relations suit, as defined in ORS 107.510, in which the only contested issue is the division or other disposition of property between the parties.

      (2) The presiding judge for a judicial district may do either of the following:

      (a) Exempt from arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425 a civil action that otherwise would be referred to arbitration under this section.

      (b) Remove from further arbitration proceedings a civil action that has been referred to arbitration under this section, when, in the opinion of the judge, good cause exists for that exemption or removal.

      (3) If a court has established a mediation program that is available for a civil action that would otherwise be subject to arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425, the court shall not assign the proceeding to arbitration if the proceeding is assigned to mediation pursuant to the agreement of the parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 36.400 to 36.425, a party who completes a mediation program offered by a court shall not be required to participate in arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425. [Formerly 33.360; 1995 c.455 §2a; 1995 c.618 §11; 1995 c.658 §31a; 1995 c.781 §32; 2005 c.274 §2; 2009 c.83 §3]

 

      36.410 Stipulation for arbitration; conditions; relief. (1) In a civil action in a circuit court where all parties have appeared and agreed to arbitration by stipulation, the court shall refer the action to arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425 if:

      (a) The relief claimed is more than or other than recovery of money or damages.

      (b) The only relief claimed is recovery of money or damages and a party asserts a claim for money or general and special damages in an amount exceeding $50,000, exclusive of attorney fees, costs and disbursements and interest on judgment.

      (2) If a civil action is referred to arbitration under this section, the arbitrator may grant any relief that could have been granted if the action were determined by a judge of the court. [Formerly 33.370; 1995 c.618 §12; 1995 c.658 §32; 2005 c.274 §3]

 

      36.415 Arbitration after waiver of amount of claim exceeding $50,000; motion for referral to arbitration. (1) In a civil action in a circuit court where all parties have appeared, where the only relief claimed is recovery of money or damages, where a party asserts a claim for money or general and special damages in an amount exceeding $50,000, exclusive of attorney fees, costs and disbursements and interest on judgment, and where all parties asserting those claims waive the amounts of those claims that exceed $50,000, the court shall refer the action to arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425. A waiver of an amount of a claim under this section shall be for the purpose of arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425 only and shall not restrict assertion of a larger claim in a trial de novo under ORS 36.425.

      (2) In a civil action in a circuit court where all parties have appeared, where the only relief claimed is recovery of money or damages and where a party asserts a claim for money or general and special damages in an amount exceeding $50,000, exclusive of attorney fees, costs and disbursements and interest on judgment, any party against whom the claim is made may file a motion with the court requesting that the matter be referred to arbitration. After hearing upon the motion, the court shall refer the matter to arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425 if the defendant establishes by affidavits and other documentation that no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict in favor of the claimant in excess of $50,000, exclusive of attorney fees, costs and disbursements and interest on judgment. [Formerly 33.380; 1995 c.618 §13; 1995 c.658 §33; 2005 c.274 §4]

 

      36.420 Notice of arbitration hearing; open proceeding; compensation and expenses. (1) At least five days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, the arbitrator shall notify the clerk of the court of the time and place of the hearing. The clerk shall post a notice of the time and place of the hearing in a conspicuous place for trial notices at the principal location for the sitting of the court in the county in which the action was commenced.

      (2) The arbitration proceeding and the records thereof shall be open to the public to the same extent as would a trial of the action in the court and the records thereof.

      (3) The compensation of the arbitrator and other expenses of the arbitration proceeding shall be the obligation of the parties or any of them as provided by rules made under ORS 36.400. However, if those rules require the parties or any of them to pay any of those expenses in advance, in the form of fees or otherwise, as a condition of arbitration, the rules shall also provide for the waiver in whole or in part, deferral in whole or in part, or both, of that payment by a party whom the court finds is then unable to pay all or any part of those advance expenses. Expenses so waived shall be paid by the state from funds available for the purpose. Expenses so deferred shall be paid, if necessary, by the state from funds available for the purpose, and the state shall be reimbursed according to the terms of the deferral. [Formerly 33.390; 1993 c.482 §2]

 

      36.425 Filing of decision and award; notice of appeal; trial de novo; attorney fees and costs; effect of arbitration decision and award. (1) At the conclusion of arbitration under ORS 36.400 to 36.425 of a civil action, the arbitrator shall file the decision and award with the clerk of the court that referred the action to arbitration, together with proof of service of a copy of the decision and award upon each party. If the decision and award require the payment of money, including payment of costs or attorney fees, the decision and award must be substantially in the form prescribed by ORS 18.042.

      (2)(a) Within 20 days after the filing of a decision and award with the clerk of the court under subsection (1) of this section, a party against whom relief is granted by the decision and award or a party whose claim for relief was greater than the relief granted to the party by the decision and award, but no other party, may file with the clerk a written notice of appeal and request for a trial de novo of the action in the court on all issues of law and fact. A copy of the notice of appeal and request for a trial de novo must be served on all other parties to the proceeding. After the filing of the written notice a trial de novo of the action shall be held. If the action is triable by right to a jury and a jury is demanded by a party having the right of trial by jury, the trial de novo shall include a jury.

      (b) If a party files a written notice under paragraph (a) of this subsection, a trial fee or jury trial fee, as applicable, shall be collected as provided in ORS 21.225.

      (c) A party filing a written notice under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall deposit with the clerk of the court the sum of $159. If the position under the arbitration decision and award of the party filing the written notice is not improved as a result of a judgment in the action on the trial de novo, the clerk shall dispose of the sum deposited in the same manner as a fee collected by the clerk. If the position of the party is improved as a result of a judgment, the clerk shall return the sum deposited to the party. If the court finds that the party filing the written notice is then unable to pay all or any part of the sum to be deposited, the court may waive in whole or in part, defer in whole or in part, or both, the sum. If the sum or any part thereof is so deferred and the position of the party is not improved as a result of a judgment, the deferred amount shall be paid by the party according to the terms of the deferral.

      (3) If a written notice is not filed under subsection (2)(a) of this section within the 20 days prescribed, the court shall cause to be prepared and entered a judgment based on the arbitration decision and award. A judgment entered under this subsection may not be appealed.

      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure:

      (a) If a party requests a trial de novo under the provisions of this section, the action is subject to arbitration under the provisions of ORS 36.405 (1)(a), the party is entitled to attorney fees by law or contract, and the position of the party is not improved after judgment on the trial de novo, the party shall not be entitled to an award of attorney fees or costs and disbursements incurred by the party before the filing of the decision and award of the arbitrator, and shall be taxed the reasonable attorney fees and costs and disbursements incurred by the other parties to the action on the trial de novo after the filing of the decision and award of the arbitrator.

      (b) If a party requests a trial de novo under the provisions of this section, the action is subject to arbitration under ORS 36.405 (1)(a), the party is not entitled to attorney fees by law or contract, and the position of the party is not improved after judgment on the trial de novo, pursuant to subsection (5) of this section the party shall be taxed the reasonable attorney fees and costs and disbursements of the other parties to the action on the trial de novo incurred by the other parties after the filing of the decision and award of the arbitrator.

      (c) If a party requests a trial de novo under the provisions of this section, the action is subject to arbitration under ORS 36.405 (1)(b), and the position of the party is not improved after judgment on the trial de novo, the party shall not be entitled to an award of attorney fees or costs and disbursements and shall be taxed the costs and disbursements incurred by the other parties after the filing of the decision and award of the arbitrator.

      (5) If a party is entitled to an award of attorney fees under subsection (4) of this section, but is also entitled to an award of attorney fees under contract or another provision of law, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees pursuant to the contract or other provision of law. If a party is entitled to an award of attorney fees solely by reason of subsection (4) of this section, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees not to exceed the following amounts:

      (a) Twenty percent of the judgment, if the defendant requests the trial de novo but the position of the defendant is not improved after the trial de novo; or

      (b) Ten percent of the amount claimed in the complaint, if the plaintiff requests the trial de novo but the position of the plaintiff is not improved after the trial de novo.

      (6) Within seven days after the filing of a decision and award under subsection (1) of this section, a party may file with the court and serve on the other parties to the arbitration written exceptions directed solely to the award or denial of attorney fees or costs. Exceptions under this subsection may be directed to the legal grounds for an award or denial of attorney fees or costs, or to the amount of the award. Any party opposing the exceptions must file a written response with the court and serve a copy of the response on the party filing the exceptions. Filing and service of the response must be made within seven days after the service of the exceptions on the responding party. A judge of the court shall decide the issue and enter a decision on the award of attorney fees and costs. If the judge fails to enter a decision on the award within 20 days after the filing of the exceptions, the award of attorney fees and costs shall be considered affirmed. The filing of exceptions under this subsection does not constitute an appeal under subsection (2) of this section and does not affect the finality of the award in any way other than as specifically provided in this subsection.

      (7) For the purpose of determining whether the position of a party has improved after a trial de novo under the provisions of this section, the court shall not consider any money award or other relief granted on claims asserted by amendments to the pleadings made after the filing of the decision and award of the arbitrator. [Formerly 33.400; 1993 c.482 §3; 1995 c.455 §3; 1995 c.618 §14a; 1995 c.658 §34; 1997 c.756 §§1,2; 2003 c.576 §170; 2019 c.605 §25]

ORS 36.450 to 36.558 supersede ORS 36.100 to 36.425 with respect to international commercial arbitration and conciliation. [1991 c.405 §3]

 

      36.456 Construction of ORS 36.450 to 36.558. (1) Except as specified in ORS 36.508, where a provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 leaves the parties free to determine a certain issue, such freedom includes the right of the parties to authorize a third party, including an institution, to make that determination.

      (2) Where a provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 refers to the fact that the parties have agreed or that they may agree or in any other way refers to an agreement of the parties, such agreement includes any arbitration or conciliation rules referred to in that agreement.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 36.502 (1) and 36.516 (2)(a), where a provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 refers to a claim, it also applies to a counterclaim, and where it refers to a defense, it also applies to a defense of a counterclaim. [1991 c.405 §5]

 

      36.458 When written communication considered to have been received. (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties:

      (a) Any written communication is considered to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered at the place of business, habitual residence or mailing address of the addressee.

      (b) The communication is considered to have been received on the day it is so delivered.

      36.460 Waiver of objection to arbitration. (1) A party who knows that any provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 or of any requirement under the arbitration agreement that has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating an objection to such noncompliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for stating that objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived the right to object.

      (2) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, “any provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558” means any provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 in respect of which the parties may otherwise agree. [1991 c.405 §7]

 

      36.462 Prohibition on intervention by court. In matters governed by ORS 36.450 to 36.558, no court shall intervene except where so provided in ORS 36.450 to 36.558 or in applicable federal law. [1991 c.405 §8]

 

      36.464 Venue. (1) The functions referred to in ORS 36.468 and 36.470 shall be performed by the circuit court in:

      (a) The county where the arbitration agreement is to be performed or was made.

      (b) If the arbitration agreement does not specify a county where the agreement is to be performed and the agreement was not made in any county in the State of Oregon, the county where any party to the court proceeding resides or has a place of business.

      (c) In any case not covered by paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, in any county in the State of Oregon.

      (2) All other functions assigned by ORS 36.450 to 36.558 to the circuit court shall be performed by the circuit court of the county in which the place of arbitration is located. [1991 c.405 §9]

 

      36.466 Arbitration agreements to be in writing. The arbitration agreement shall be in writing. An agreement is in writing if it is contained in a document signed by the parties or in an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provides a record of the agreement, or in an exchange of statements of claim and defense in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by another. The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement provided that the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to make that clause a part of the contract. [1991 c.405 §10]

 

      36.468 Application to stay judicial proceedings and compel arbitration. (1) When a party to an international commercial arbitration agreement commences judicial proceedings seeking relief with respect to a matter covered by the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall, if a party so requests not later than when submitting the party’s first statement on the substance of the dispute, stay the proceedings and refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.

      (2) Arbitral proceedings may begin or continue, and an award may be made, while a judicial proceeding described in subsection (1) of this section is pending before the court.

      (3) A court may not, without a request from a party made pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, refer the parties to arbitration. [1991 c.405 §11; 1993 c.244 §1]

 

      36.470 Interim judicial relief; factors considered by court; determination of arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction. (1) It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request from a court, before or during arbitral proceedings, an interim measure of protection or for the court to grant such a measure.

      (2) Any party to an arbitration governed by ORS 36.450 to 36.558 may request from the circuit court the enforcement of an order of an arbitral tribunal granting an interim measure of protection pursuant to ORS 36.486. Enforcement shall be granted pursuant to the law applicable to the granting of the type of interim relief requested.

      (3) Measures which the circuit court may grant in connection with a pending arbitration include, but are not limited to:

      (a) An order of attachment issued to assure that the award to which the applicant may be entitled is not rendered ineffectual by the dissipation of party assets.

      (b) A preliminary injunction granted in order to protect trade secrets or to conserve goods which are the subject matter of the arbitral dispute.

      (4) In considering a request for interim relief, the court, subject to subsection (5) of this section, shall give preclusive effect to any and all findings of fact of the arbitral tribunal, including the probable validity of the claim which is the subject of the award for interim relief that the arbitral tribunal has previously granted in the proceeding in question, provided that such interim award is consistent with public policy.

      (5) Where the arbitral tribunal has not ruled on an objection to its jurisdiction, the court shall not grant preclusive effect to the tribunal’s findings until the court has made an independent finding as to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. If the court rules that the arbitral tribunal did not have jurisdiction, the application for interim measures of relief shall be denied. Such a ruling by the court that the arbitral tribunal lacks jurisdiction is not binding on the arbitral tribunal or subsequent judicial proceedings. [1991 c.405 §12; 1993 c.244 §2]

 

      36.472 Number of arbitrators. The parties may agree on the number of arbitrators. If the parties do not agree, the number of arbitrators shall be one. [1991 c.405 §13]

 

      36.474 Procedure for appointment of arbitrators; appointment by circuit court. (1) No person shall be precluded by reason of nationality from acting as an arbitrator unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

      (2) The parties may agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, subject to the provisions of subsections (4), (5) and (6) of this section.

      (3) If the parties do not agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators:

      (a) In an arbitration with two parties and involving three or more arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator and the appointed arbitrators shall appoint the remaining arbitrators. If a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party or parties, or if the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the remaining arbitrators within 30 days of their appointment, then, upon the request of any party, the circuit court shall make the appointment.

      (b) In an arbitration with more than two parties or in an arbitration with two parties involving fewer than three arbitrators, then, upon the request of any party, the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be appointed by the circuit court.

      (4) Unless the parties’ agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment, any party may request the circuit court to make the appointment if there is an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties and if:

      (a) A party fails to act as required under such procedure;

      (b) The parties, or the appointed arbitrators, are unable to reach an agreement as expected of them under such procedure; or

      (c) A third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it under such procedure.

      (5) A decision by the circuit court on a matter entrusted to it by subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be final and not subject to appeal.

      (6) The circuit court, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to all of the following:

      (a) Any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties;

      (b) Other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator; and

      (c) The advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than those of the parties. [1991 c.405 §14; 1993 c.244 §3]

 

      36.476 Disclosure by proposed arbitrators and conciliators; waiver of disclosure; grounds for challenge. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 36.450 to 36.558, all persons whose names have been submitted for consideration for appointment or designation as arbitrators or conciliators, or who have been appointed or designated as such, shall, within 15 days, make a disclosure to the parties of any information which might cause their impartiality to be questioned including, but not limited to, any of the following instances:

      (a) The person has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or personal knowledge of the disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.

      (b) The person served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, or the person is or has been associated with another who has participated in the matter during such association, or the person has been a material witness concerning it.

      (c) The person served as an arbitrator or conciliator in another proceeding involving one or more of the parties to the proceeding.

      (d) The person, individually or as a fiduciary, or the person’s spouse or minor child, or anyone residing in the person’s household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.

      (e) The person, the person’s spouse or minor child, anyone residing in the person’s household, any individual within the third degree of relationship to any of them, or the spouse of any of them, meets any of the following conditions:

      (D) The person is known to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.

      (E) The person is likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.

      (2) The obligation to disclose information set forth in subsection (1) of this section is mandatory and cannot be waived by the parties with respect to persons serving either as the sole arbitrator or sole conciliator or as one of two arbitrators or conciliators or as the chief or prevailing arbitrator or conciliator. The parties may otherwise agree to waive such disclosure.

      (3) From the time of appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, an arbitrator shall, without delay, disclose to the parties any circumstances referred to in subsection (1) of this section which were not previously disclosed.

      (4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or allowed by the rules governing the arbitration, an arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence or impartiality of the arbitrator, or as to possession of the qualifications upon which the parties have agreed.

      (5) A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by it, or in whose appointment it has participated, only for reasons of which it becomes aware after the appointment has been made. [1991 c.405 §15]

 

      36.478 Procedure for challenging arbitrator. (1) Subject to subsection (4)(a) of this section, the parties may agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator.

      (2) Failing any agreement referred to in subsection (1) of this section, a party which intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within 15 days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in ORS 36.476 (4) and (5), whichever shall be later, send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal.

      (3) Unless the arbitrator challenged under subsection (2) of this section withdraws from office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide the challenge.

      (4)(a) If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure under subsections (2) and (3) of this section is not successful, the challenging party may request the circuit court, within 30 days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the challenge, to decide on the challenge.

      (b) When the request is made, the circuit court may refuse to decide on the challenge if it is satisfied that, under the procedure agreed upon by the parties, the party making the request had an opportunity to have the challenge decided upon by other than the arbitral tribunal.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, whether the challenge is under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if a challenge is based upon the grounds set forth in ORS 36.476 (1), the circuit court shall hear the challenge and, if it determines that the facts support a finding that such ground or grounds fairly exist, then the challenge shall be sustained.

      (5) The decision of the circuit court under subsection (4) of this section is final and not subject to appeal.

      (6) While a request under subsection (4) of this section is pending, the arbitral tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. [1991 c.405 §16; 1993 c.244 §4]

 

      36.480 Withdrawal of arbitrator; termination of mandate. (1) If an arbitrator withdraws from the case or if the parties agree on termination because the arbitrator becomes unable, de facto or de jure, to perform the functions of the arbitrator or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, then the arbitrator’s mandate terminates.

      (2) If a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in subsection (1) of this section, a party may request the circuit court to decide on the termination of the mandate.

      (3) The decision of the circuit court under subsection (2) of this section is not subject to appeal.

      (4) If, under this section or ORS 36.478 (3), an arbitrator withdraws from office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, this does not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to under this section or under ORS 36.476 (4) and (5). [1991 c.405 §17]

 

      36.482 Substitute arbitrator; effect of substitution. (1) In addition to the circumstances referred to under ORS 36.478 and 36.480, the mandate of an arbitrator terminates upon withdrawal from office for any reason, or by or pursuant to the agreement of the parties.

      (2) Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.

      (3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties:

      (a) Where the number of arbitrators is less than three and an arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held shall be repeated.

      (b) Where the presiding arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held shall be repeated.

      (c) Where the number of arbitrators is three or more and an arbitrator other than the presiding arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held may be repeated at the discretion of the arbitral tribunal.

      (4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made prior to the replacement of an arbitrator under this section is not invalid because there has been a change in the composition of the tribunal. [1991 c.405 §18]

 

      36.484 Arbitral tribunal may rule on own jurisdiction; time for raising issue of jurisdiction; review by circuit court. (1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement and, for that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.

      (2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than the submission of the statement of defense. However, a party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that the party has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. In either case, the arbitral tribunal may admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.

      (3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in subsection (2) of this section either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any party shall request the circuit court, within 30 days after having received notice of that ruling, to decide the matter or shall be deemed to have waived objection to such finding.

      (4) The decision of the circuit court under subsection (3) of this section is not subject to appeal.

      (5) While a request under subsection (3) of this section is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. [1991 c.405 §19; 1993 c.244 §5]

 

      36.486 Interim measures of protection ordered by arbitral tribunal; security. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, at the request of a party, the arbitral tribunal may order any party to take such interim measure of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect to the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitral tribunal may require any party to provide appropriate security in connection with such measure. [1991 c.405 §20]

 

      36.488 Fairness in proceedings. The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity to present the case of the party. [1991 c.405 §21]

 

      36.490 Procedures subject to agreement by parties; procedure in absence of agreement. (1) Subject to the provisions of ORS 36.450 to 36.558, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting the proceedings.

If the parties do not agree, the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal or, if any members of the arbitral tribunal are not yet appointed and are to be appointed by the circuit court as pursuant to ORS 36.474 (4), by the Chief Justice, taking into account the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for the inspection of documents, goods or other property. [1991 c.405 §23]

 

      36.494 Commencement of arbitral proceedings. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect to a particular dispute commence on the date which a request for referral of that dispute to arbitration is received by the respondent. [1991 c.405 §24]

 

      36.496 Language used in proceedings. (1) The parties are free to agree on the language or languages to be used in the arbitral proceedings. If the parties do not agree, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the language or languages to be used in the proceedings. Unless otherwise specified therein, this agreement or determination shall apply to any written statement by a party, any hearing and any award, decision or other communication by the arbitral tribunal.

      (2) The arbitral tribunal may order that any documentary evidence shall be accompanied by a translation into the language or languages agreed upon by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal. [1991 c.405 §25]

(1) Within the period of time agreed upon by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal, the claimant shall state the facts supporting the claim of the claimant, the points at issue, and the relief or remedy sought, and the respondent shall state the defense of the respondent in respect of these particulars, unless the parties have otherwise agreed as to the required elements of those statements.

      (2) The parties may submit with their statements all documents they consider to be relevant or may add a reference to the documents or other evidence they will submit.

      (3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or supplement the claim or defense of the party during the course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow the amendment or supplement having regard to the delay in making it. [1991 c.405 §26]

 

      36.500 Oral hearing; notice; discovery. (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold oral hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument or whether the proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials.

      (2) Unless the parties have agreed that no oral hearings shall be held, the arbitral tribunal shall hold oral hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so requested by a party.

      (3) The parties shall be given sufficient advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for the purpose of the inspection of documents, goods or other property.

      (4) All statements, documents or other information supplied to, or applications made to, the arbitral tribunal by one party shall be communicated to the other party. Any expert report or evidentiary document on which the arbitral tribunal may rely in making its decision shall be communicated to the parties.

      (5) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, all oral hearings and meetings in arbitral proceedings shall be held in camera. [1991 c.405 §27; 1993 c.244 §6]

      (2) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where, without showing sufficient cause, the respondent fails to communicate the statement of defense of the respondent in accordance with ORS 36.498 (1) and (2), the arbitral tribunal shall continue the proceedings without treating that failure in itself as an admission of the claimant’s allegations.

      (3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where, without showing sufficient cause, a party fails to appear at an oral hearing or to produce documentary evidence, the arbitral tribunal may continue with the proceedings and make the arbitral award on the evidence before it. [1991 c.405 §28]

 

      36.504 Appointment of experts. (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may appoint one or more experts to report to it on specific issues to be determined by the arbitral tribunal and require a party to give the expert any relevant information or to produce, or to provide access to, any relevant documents, goods or other property for the expert’s inspection.

      (2) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, if a party so requests or if the arbitral tribunal considers it necessary, the expert shall, after delivery of the expert’s written or oral report, participate in an oral hearing where the parties have the opportunity to question the expert and to present expert witnesses on the points at issue. [1991 c.405 §29; 1993 c.244 §7]

 

      36.506 Circuit court assistance in taking evidence; circuit court authorized to enter certain orders upon application. (1) The arbitral tribunal, or a party with the approval of the arbitral tribunal, may request from the circuit court assistance in taking evidence and the court may execute the request within its competence and according to its rules on taking evidence. In addition, a subpoena may be issued as provided in ORCP 55, in which case the witness compensation provisions of ORS chapter 44 shall apply.

      (2) When the parties to two or more arbitration agreements have agreed in their respective arbitration agreements or otherwise, the circuit court may, on application by one party with the consent of all other parties to those arbitration agreements, do one or more of the following:

      (a) Order the arbitration proceedings arising out of those arbitration agreements to be consolidated on terms the court considers just and necessary.

      (b) Where all the parties cannot agree on an arbitral tribunal for the consolidated arbitration, appoint an arbitral tribunal in accordance with ORS 36.474 (6).

      (c) Where the parties cannot agree on any other matter necessary to conduct the consolidated arbitration, make any other order it considers necessary.

      (d) Order the arbitration proceedings arising out of those arbitration agreements to be held at the same time or one immediately after another.

      (e) Order any of the arbitration proceedings arising out of those arbitration agreements to be stayed until the determination of any other of them.

      (2) Any designation by the parties of the law or legal system of a given country or political subdivision thereof shall be construed, unless otherwise expressed, as directly referring to the substantive law of that state and not to its conflict of laws rules.

      (4) The arbitral tribunal shall decide ex aequo et bono or as amiable compositeur if the parties have expressly authorized it to do so.

      (5) In all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction. [1991 c.405 §31]

 

      36.510 Decision of arbitral tribunal. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any decision of the arbitral tribunal in arbitral proceedings with more than one arbitrator shall be made by a majority of all its members. However, the parties or all members of the arbitral tribunal may authorize a presiding arbitrator to decide questions of procedure. [1991 c.405 §32; 1993 c.244 §9]

 

      36.512 Settlement. (1) It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for an arbitral tribunal to encourage settlement of the dispute and, with the agreement of the parties, the arbitral tribunal may use mediation, conciliation or other procedures at any time during the arbitral proceedings to encourage settlement. If agreed by the parties, the members of the arbitral tribunal are not disqualified from resuming their roles as arbitrators by reason of the mediation, conciliation or other procedure.

      (2) If, during the arbitral proceedings, the parties settle the dispute, the arbitral tribunal shall terminate the proceedings and, if requested by the parties and not objected to by the arbitral tribunal, record the settlement in the form of an arbitral award on agreed terms.

      (3) An arbitral award on agreed terms shall be made in accordance with ORS 36.514 and shall state that it is an arbitral award.

      (2) The arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings when:

      (a) The claimant withdraws the claim, unless the respondent objects thereto and the arbitral tribunal recognizes a legitimate interest on the part of the respondent in obtaining a final settlement of the dispute;

      (b) The parties agree on the termination of the proceedings; or

      (c) The arbitral tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible.

      (3) Subject to ORS 36.518 and 36.520 (4), the mandate of the arbitral tribunal terminates with the termination of the arbitral proceeding. [1991 c.405 §35; 1993 c.244 §11]

      (b) A party may, if agreed by the parties, request the arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the arbitral award.

      (2) If the arbitral tribunal considers any request made under subsection (1) of this section to be justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within 30 days of the receipt of the request. The interpretation shall form part of the arbitral award.

      (3) The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in subsection (1)(a) of this section on its own initiative within 30 days of the date of the award.

      (4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request, within 30 days of receipt of the award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the award. If the arbitral tribunal considers the request to be justified, it shall make the additional award within 60 days.

      (5) If necessary, the arbitral tribunal may extend the period of time within which it shall make a correction, interpretation or an additional award under subsection (1) or (4) of this section.

      (6) The provisions of ORS 36.514 shall apply to a correction or interpretation of the award or to an additional award. [1991 c.405 §36; 1993 c.244 §12]

      (A) A party to the arbitration agreement referred to in ORS 36.466 was under some incapacity or that the agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the laws of the State of Oregon or the United States;

      (B) The party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present the party’s case;

      (C) The award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or

      (D) The composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with ORS 36.450 to 36.558; or

      (b) The circuit court finds that:

      (A) The subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of the State of Oregon or of the United States; or

      (3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the award or, if a request had been made under ORS 36.518, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal.

      (4) The circuit court, when asked to set aside an arbitral award, may, where appropriate and so requested by a party, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the arbitral tribunal’s opinion will eliminate the grounds for setting aside.

      (5) The clerk of the circuit court shall collect the filing fees established under ORS 21.135 from the party making application for setting aside under subsection (1) of this section and from a party filing an appearance in opposition to the application. [1991 c.405 §37; 1993 c.244 §13; 1997 c.801 §55; 2003 c.737 §§41,42; 2005 c.702 §§41,42,43; 2007 c.860 §5; 2011 c.595 §41]

(1) An arbitral award, irrespective of the country in which it was made, shall be recognized as binding and, upon application in writing to the circuit court, shall be enforced subject to the provisions of this section and ORS 36.524.

      (2) The party relying on an award or applying for its enforcement shall supply the authenticated original or a certified copy of the award and the original or certified copy of the arbitration agreement referred to in ORS 36.466. If the award or agreement is not made in the English language, then the party relying on the award or applying for its enforcement shall supply a duly certified translation thereof into the English language.

      (3) The party relying on an arbitral award or applying for its enforcement shall deliver to the clerk of the circuit court the documents specified in subsection (2) of this section along with proof of the delivery of a copy of the arbitral award as required by ORS 36.514 (4). The relying party shall pay to the clerk the filing fee established under ORS 21.135, after which the clerk shall enter the arbitral award of record in the office of the clerk. If no application to set aside is filed against the arbitral award as provided in ORS 36.520 within the time specified in ORS 36.520 (3) or, if such an application is filed, the relying party after the disposition of the application indicates the intention to still rely on the award or to apply for its enforcement, judgment shall be entered as upon the verdict of a jury, and execution may issue thereon, and the same proceedings may be had upon the award with like effect as upon a verdict in a civil action. [1991 c.405 §38; 2011 c.595 §42]

 

      36.524 Grounds for refusal to enforce award; fee. (1) Recognition or enforcement of an arbitral award, irrespective of the country in which it was made, may be refused only:

      (a) At the request of the party against whom it is invoked, if that party pays the clerk of the circuit court the filing fee established under ORS 21.135 and furnishes to the court where recognition or enforcement is sought proof that:

      (A) A party to the arbitration agreement referred to in ORS 36.466 was under some incapacity or that the agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or under the law of the country where the award was made;

      (B) The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present the party’s case;

      (C) The arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or the award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced;

      (D) The composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or

      (E) The award has not yet become binding on the parties or has been set aside or suspended by a court of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made; or

      (b) If the court finds that:

      (A) The subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of the State of Oregon or of the United States; or

      (B) The recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award would be contrary to the public policy of the State of Oregon or of the United States.

      (2) If an application for setting aside or suspension of an award has been made to the court referred to in subsection (1)(a)(E) of this section, and if it considers it proper, the court where recognition or enforcement is sought may adjourn its decision on application of the party claiming recognition or enforcement of the award. The court may also order the other party to provide appropriate security. [1991 c.405 §39; 2011 c.595 §43]

 

      36.526 Provisions to be interpreted in good faith. In construing ORS 36.454 to 36.524, a court or arbitral tribunal shall interpret those sections in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to their terms in their context, and in light of their objects and purposes. Recourse may be had for these purposes, in addition to aids in interpretation ordinarily available under the laws of this state, to the documents of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and its working group respecting the preparation of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and shall give those documents the weight that is appropriate in the circumstances. [1991 c.405 §40]

 

      36.528 Policy to encourage conciliation. It is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage parties to an international commercial agreement or transaction which qualifies for arbitration or conciliation pursuant to ORS 36.454 (3) to resolve disputes arising from such agreements or transactions through conciliation. The parties may select or permit an arbitral tribunal or other third party to select one or more persons to service as the conciliator or conciliators who shall assist the parties in an independent and impartial manner in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute. [1991 c.405 §41]

 

      36.530 Guiding principles of conciliators. The conciliator or conciliators shall be guided by principles of objectivity, fairness and justice, giving consideration to, among other things, the rights and obligations of the parties, the usages of the trade concerned and the circumstances surrounding the dispute, including any previous practices between the parties. [1991 c.405 §42]

 

      36.532 Manner of conducting conciliation proceedings. The conciliator or conciliators may conduct the conciliation proceedings in such a manner as they consider appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the wishes of the parties and the desirability of a speedy settlement of the dispute. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 36.450 to 36.558, no provision of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure nor any other provision of the Oregon Revised Statutes governing procedural matters shall apply to any conciliation proceeding brought under ORS 36.450 to 36.558. [1991 c.405 §43]

 

      36.534 Draft conciliation settlement. (1) At any time during the proceedings, the conciliator or conciliators may prepare a draft conciliation settlement which may include the assessment and apportionment of costs between the parties and send copies to the parties, specifying the time within which the parties must signify their approval.

      (2) No party may be required to accept any settlement proposed by the conciliator or conciliators. [1991 c.405 §44]

 

      36.536 Prohibition on use of statements, admissions or documents arising out of conciliation proceedings. When the parties agree to participate in conciliation under ORS 36.450 to 36.558:

      (1) Evidence of anything said or of any admission made in the course of the conciliation is not admissible in evidence and disclosure of any such evidence shall not be compelled in any civil action in which, pursuant to law, testimony may be compelled to be given. However, this subsection does not limit the admissibility of evidence if all parties participating in conciliation consent, in writing, to its disclosure, provided that such consent is given after the statement or admission to be disclosed is made in the conciliation proceeding.

      (2) In the event that any such evidence is offered in contravention of this section, the arbitration tribunal or the court shall make any order which it considers to be appropriate to deal with the matter, including, without limitation, orders restricting the introduction of evidence, or dismissing the case without prejudice.

      (3) Unless the document otherwise provides, no document prepared for the purpose of, or in the course of, or pursuant to, the conciliation, or any copy thereof, is admissible in evidence and disclosure of any such document shall not be compelled in any arbitration or civil action in which, pursuant to law, testimony may be compelled to be given. [1991 c.405 §45; 1993 c.244 §14]

 

      36.538 Conciliation to act as stay of other proceedings; tolling of limitation periods during conciliation. (1) The agreement of the parties to submit a dispute to conciliation shall be deemed an agreement between or among those parties to stay all judicial or arbitral proceedings from the commencement of conciliation until the termination of conciliation proceedings.

      (2) All applicable limitation periods, including periods of prescription, shall be tolled or extended upon the commencement of conciliation proceedings to conciliate a dispute under ORS 36.450 to 36.558 and all limitation periods shall remain tolled and periods of prescription extended as to all parties to the conciliation proceedings until the 10th day following the termination of conciliation proceedings.

      (3) For purposes of this section, conciliation proceedings are deemed to have commenced as soon as:

      (a) A party has requested conciliation of a particular dispute or disputes; and

      (b) The other party or parties agree to participate in the conciliation proceeding. [1991 c.405 §46]

 

      36.540 Termination of conciliation proceedings. (1) The conciliation proceedings may be terminated as to all parties by any of the following:

      (a) A written declaration of the conciliator or conciliators, after consultation with the parties, to the effect that further efforts at conciliation are no longer justified, on the date of the declaration.

      (b) A written declaration of the parties addressed to the conciliator or conciliators to the effect that the conciliation proceedings are terminated, on the date of the declaration.

      (c) The signing of a settlement agreement by all of the parties, on the date of the agreement.

      (2) The conciliation proceedings may be terminated as to particular parties by either of the following:

      (a) A written declaration of a party to the other party or parties and the conciliator or conciliators, if appointed, to the effect that the conciliation proceedings shall be terminated as to that particular party, on the date of the declaration.

      (b) The signing of a settlement agreement by some of the parties, on the date of the agreement. [1991 c.405 §47; 1993 c.244 §15]

 

      36.542 Conciliator not to be arbitrator or take part in arbitral or judicial proceedings. No person who has served as conciliator may be appointed as an arbitrator for, or take part in, any arbitral or judicial proceedings in the same dispute unless all parties manifest their consent to such participation or the rules adopted for conciliation or arbitration otherwise provide. [1991 c.405 §48]

 

      36.544 Submission to conciliation not waiver. By submitting to conciliation, no party shall be deemed to have waived any rights or remedies which that party would have had if conciliation had not been initiated, other than those set forth in any settlement agreement which results from the conciliation. [1991 c.405 §49]

 

      36.546 Conciliation agreement to be treated as arbitral award. If the conciliation succeeds in settling the dispute and the result of the conciliation is reduced to writing and signed by the conciliator or conciliators and the parties or their representatives, the written agreement shall be treated as an arbitral award rendered by an arbitral tribunal duly constituted in and pursuant to the laws of this state and shall have the same force and effect as a final award in arbitration. [1991 c.405 §50]

 

      36.548 Costs of conciliation proceedings. Upon termination of the conciliation proceedings, the conciliator or conciliators shall fix the costs of the conciliation and give written notice thereof to the parties. As used in this section and in ORS 36.550, “costs” includes only the following:

      (1) A reasonable fee to be paid to the conciliator or conciliators.

      (2) The travel and other reasonable expenses of the conciliator or conciliators.

      (3) The travel and other reasonable expenses of witnesses requested by the conciliator or conciliators with the consent of the parties.

      (4) The cost of any expert advice requested by the conciliator or conciliators with the consent of the parties.

      (5) The cost of any court. [1991 c.405 §51]

 

      36.550 Payment of costs. The costs fixed by the conciliator or conciliators as pursuant to ORS 36.548 shall be borne equally by the parties unless the settlement agreement provides for a different apportionment. All other expenses incurred by a party shall be borne by that party. [1991 c.405 §52]

 

      36.552 Effect of conciliation on jurisdiction of courts. Neither the request for conciliation, the consent to participate in the conciliation proceeding, the participation in such proceedings, nor the entering into a conciliation agreement or settlement, shall be deemed as consent to the jurisdiction of any court in this state in the event conciliation fails. [1991 c.405 §53]

 

      36.554 Immunities. (1) Neither the arbitrator or arbitrators, the conciliator or conciliators, the parties, nor their representatives, shall be subject to service of process on any civil matter while they are present in this state for the purpose of arranging for or participating in any arbitration or conciliation proceedings subject to ORS 36.450 to 36.558.

      (2) No person who serves as an arbitrator or as a conciliator shall be held liable in an action for damages resulting from any act or omission in the performance of their role as an arbitrator or as a conciliator in any proceeding subject to ORS 36.450 to 36.558. [1991 c.405 §54; 1993 c.244 §16]

 

      36.556 Severability. If any provision of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 or its application to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the invalidity does not affect the other provisions or applications of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application and to this end the provisions of ORS 36.450 to 36.558 are severable. [1991 c.405 §55]

 

      36.558 Short title. ORS 36.450 to 36.558 shall be known and may be cited as the “Oregon International Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation Act.” [1991 c.405 §1]

      36.630 Provisional remedies. (1) Before an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act, the court, upon petition of a party to an arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, may enter an order for provisional remedies to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding to the same extent and under the same conditions as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action.

      (2) After an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act:

      (a) The arbitrator may issue such orders for provisional remedies, including interim awards, as the arbitrator finds necessary to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding and to promote the fair and expeditious resolution of the controversy, to the same extent and under the same conditions as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action; and

      (a) There are separate agreements to arbitrate or separate arbitration proceedings between the same persons or one of them is a party to a separate agreement to arbitrate or a separate arbitration proceeding with a third person;

      (b) The claims subject to the agreements to arbitrate arise in substantial part from the same transaction or series of related transactions;

      (c) The existence of a common issue of law or fact creates the possibility of conflicting decisions in the separate arbitration proceedings; and

      (d) Prejudice resulting from a failure to consolidate is not outweighed by the risk of undue delay or prejudice to the rights of or hardship to parties opposing consolidation.

      (2) The court may order consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings as to some claims and allow other claims to be resolved in separate arbitration proceedings.

      (3) The court may not order consolidation of the claims of a party to an agreement to arbitrate if the agreement prohibits consolidation. [2003 c.598 §10]

(1) If the parties to an agreement to arbitrate agree on a method for appointing an arbitrator, that method must be followed, unless the method fails. If the parties have not agreed on a method, the agreed method fails, or an arbitrator designated or appointed fails or is unable to act and a successor has not been appointed, the court, on petition of a party to the arbitration proceeding, shall appoint the arbitrator. An arbitrator so appointed has all the powers of an arbitrator designated in the agreement to arbitrate or appointed pursuant to the agreed method.

      (2) An individual who has a known, direct and material interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or a known, existing and substantial relationship with a party may not serve as an arbitrator required by an agreement to be neutral. [2003 c.598 §11]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.650 Disclosure by arbitrator. (1) Before accepting appointment, an individual who is requested to serve as an arbitrator, after making a reasonable inquiry, shall disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate and arbitration proceeding and to any other arbitrators in the arbitration proceeding any known facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding, including:

      (a) A financial or personal interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding; and

      (b) An existing or past relationship with any of the parties to the agreement to arbitrate or the arbitration proceeding, their counsel or representatives, a witness or another arbitrator in the proceeding.

      (2) An arbitrator has a continuing obligation to disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate and arbitration proceeding and to any other arbitrators in the proceeding any facts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointment that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator.

      (3) If an arbitrator discloses a fact required by subsection (1) or (2) of this section to be disclosed and a party timely objects to the appointment or continued service of the arbitrator based upon the fact disclosed, the objection may be a ground under ORS 36.705 (1)(b) for vacating an award made by the arbitrator.

      (4) If the arbitrator did not disclose a fact as required by subsection (1) or (2) of this section, upon timely objection by a party, the court under ORS 36.705 (1)(b) may vacate an award.

      (5) An arbitrator appointed as a neutral arbitrator who does not disclose a known, direct and material interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or a known, existing and substantial relationship with a party, the party’s counsel or representatives, a witness or another arbitrator in the proceeding is presumed to act with evident partiality under ORS 36.705 (1)(b).

      (6) If the parties to an arbitration proceeding agree to the procedures of an arbitration organization or any other procedures for challenges to arbitrators before an award is made, substantial compliance with those procedures is a condition precedent to a petition to vacate an award on that ground under ORS 36.705 (1)(b). [2003 c.598 §12]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.655 Action by majority. If there is more than one arbitrator, the powers of an arbitrator must be exercised by a majority of the arbitrators, but all of them shall conduct the hearing under ORS 36.665 (3). [2003 c.598 §13]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.660 Immunity of arbitrator; competency to testify; attorney fees and costs. (1) An arbitrator or an arbitration organization acting in that capacity is immune from civil liability to the same extent as a judge of a court of this state acting in a judicial capacity.

      (2) The immunity afforded by this section supplements any immunity under other law.

      (3) The failure of an arbitrator to make a disclosure required by ORS 36.650 does not cause any loss of immunity under this section.

      (4) In a judicial, administrative or similar proceeding, an arbitrator or representative of an arbitration organization is not competent to testify, and may not be required to produce records as to any statement, conduct, decision or ruling occurring during the arbitration proceeding, to the same extent as a judge of a court of this state acting in a judicial capacity. This subsection does not apply:

      (a) To the extent necessary to determine the claim of an arbitrator, arbitration organization or representative of the arbitration organization against a party to the arbitration proceeding; or

      (b) To a hearing on a petition to vacate an award under ORS 36.705 (1)(a) or (b) if the petitioner establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating the award exists.

      (5) If a person commences a civil action against an arbitrator, arbitration organization or representative of an arbitration organization arising from the services of the arbitrator, organization or representative, or if a person seeks to compel an arbitrator or a representative of an arbitration organization to testify or produce records in violation of subsection (4) of this section, and the court decides that the arbitrator, arbitration organization or representative of an arbitration organization is immune from civil liability or that the arbitrator or representative of the organization is not competent to testify, the court shall award to the arbitrator, organization or representative reasonable attorney fees. [2003 c.598 §14]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.665 Arbitration process. (1) An arbitrator may conduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding. The authority conferred upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties to the arbitration proceeding before the hearing and, among other matters, determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.

      (2) An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue:

      (a) If all interested parties agree; or

      (b) Upon request of one party to the arbitration proceeding, if that party gives notice to all other parties to the proceeding and the other parties have a reasonable opportunity to respond.

      (3) If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a time and place and give notice of the hearing not less than five days before the hearing begins. Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party’s appearance at the hearing waives any objection based on lack or insufficiency of notice. Upon request of a party to the arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, or upon the arbitrator’s own initiative, the arbitrator may adjourn the hearing from time to time as necessary but may not postpone the hearing to a time later than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. The arbitrator may hear and decide the controversy upon the evidence produced although a party who was duly notified of the arbitration proceeding did not appear. The court, on request, may direct the arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision.

      (4) At a hearing under subsection (3) of this section, a party to the arbitration proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing.

      (5) If an arbitrator ceases or is unable to act during the arbitration proceeding, a replacement arbitrator must be appointed in accordance with ORS 36.645 to continue the proceeding and to resolve the controversy. [2003 c.598 §15]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.670 Representation by a lawyer; representation of legal or commercial entities. A party to an arbitration proceeding may be represented by a lawyer admitted to practice in this state or any other state. A corporation, business trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture or other legal or commercial entity may be represented by a lawyer admitted to practice in this state or any other state, by an officer of the entity, or by an employee or other agent authorized by the entity to represent the entity in the proceeding. [2003 c.598 §16]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.675 Witnesses; subpoenas; depositions; discovery. (1) An arbitrator may administer oaths. An arbitrator or an attorney for any party to the arbitration proceeding may issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness and for the production of records and other evidence at any hearing. A subpoena must be served in the manner for service of subpoenas under ORCP 55 D and, upon petition to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, enforced in the manner provided by ORCP 55 G.

      (2) In order to make the proceedings fair, expeditious and cost-effective, upon request of a party to or a witness in an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator may permit a deposition of any witness to be taken for use as evidence at the hearing, including a witness who cannot be subpoenaed for or is unable to attend a hearing. The arbitrator shall determine the conditions under which the deposition is taken.

      (3) An arbitrator may permit such discovery as the arbitrator decides is appropriate in the circumstances, taking into account the needs of the parties to the arbitration proceeding and other affected persons and the desirability of making the proceeding fair, expeditious and cost-effective.

      (4) If an arbitrator permits discovery under subsection (3) of this section, the arbitrator may order a party to the arbitration proceeding to comply with the arbitrator’s discovery-related orders, issue subpoenas for the attendance of a witness and for the production of records and other evidence at a discovery proceeding, and take action against a noncomplying party to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

      (5) An arbitrator may issue a protective order to prevent the disclosure of privileged information, confidential information, trade secrets and other information protected from disclosure to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

      (6) All laws compelling a person under subpoena to testify and all fees for attending a judicial proceeding, a deposition or a discovery proceeding as a witness apply to an arbitration proceeding as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

      (7) The court may enforce a subpoena or discovery-related order for the attendance of a witness within this state, and for the production of records and other evidence issued by an arbitrator or by an attorney for any party to the proceeding in connection with an arbitration proceeding in another state, upon conditions determined by the court so as to make the arbitration proceeding fair, expeditious and cost-effective. A subpoena or discovery-related order issued by an arbitrator or by an attorney for any party to the proceeding in another state must be served in the manner provided by ORCP 55 D for service of subpoenas in a civil action in this state and, upon petition to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, enforced in the manner provided by ORCP 55 G for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action in this state. [2003 c.598 §17]

 

      Note: ORCP 55 was repealed and replaced by the Council on Court Procedures Amendments promulgated on December 8, 2018, and effective January 1, 2020. The text of 36.675 was not amended by enactment of the Legislative Assembly to reflect the repeal. Editorial adjustment of 36.675 for the repeal of ORCP 55 has not been made. See the ORCP 55 Cross-Reference Chart available from the Council on Court Procedures.

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.680 Judicial enforcement of preaward ruling by arbitrator. If an arbitrator makes a preaward ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under ORS 36.685. A prevailing party may make a petition to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award under ORS 36.700, in which case the court shall summarily decide the petition. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under ORS 36.705 or 36.710. [2003 c.598 §18]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.685 Award. (1) An arbitrator shall make a record of an award. The record must be signed or otherwise authenticated by any arbitrator who concurs with the award. If the award requires the payment of money, including but not limited to payment of costs or attorney fees, the award must be accompanied by a separate statement that contains the information required by ORS 18.042 for judgments that include money awards. The arbitrator or the arbitration organization shall give notice of the award, including a copy of the award, to each party to the arbitration proceeding.

      (2) An award must be made within the time specified by the agreement to arbitrate or, if not specified therein, within the time ordered by the court. The court may extend or the parties to the arbitration proceeding may agree in a record to extend the time. The court or the parties may extend the time within or after the time specified or ordered. A party waives any objection that an award was not timely made unless the party gives notice of the objection to the arbitrator before receiving notice of the award. [2003 c.598 §19; 2003 c.576 §169a]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.690 Change of award by arbitrator. (1) Upon request by a party to an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator may modify or correct an award:

      (a) Upon a ground stated in ORS 36.710 (1)(a) or (c);

      (b) Because the arbitrator has not made a final and definite award upon a claim submitted by the parties to the arbitration proceeding; or

      (c) To clarify the award.

      (2) A request under subsection (1) of this section must be made and notice given to all parties within 20 days after the requesting party receives notice of the award.

      (3) A party to the arbitration proceeding must give notice of any objection to the request within 10 days after receipt of the notice under subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) If a petition to the court is pending under ORS 36.700, 36.705 or 36.710, the court may submit the claim to the arbitrator to consider whether to modify or correct the award:

      (a) Upon a ground stated in ORS 36.710 (1)(a) or (c);

      (b) Because the arbitrator has not made a final and definite award upon a claim submitted by the parties to the arbitration proceeding; or

      (c) To clarify the award.

      (5) An award modified or corrected pursuant to this section is subject to ORS 36.685 (1), 36.700, 36.705 and 36.710. [2003 c.598 §20]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.695 Remedies; fees and expenses of arbitration proceeding. (1) An arbitrator may award punitive damages or other exemplary relief if such an award is authorized by law in a civil action involving the same claim and the evidence produced at the hearing justifies the award under the legal standards otherwise applicable to the claim.

      (2) An arbitrator may award reasonable attorney fees and other reasonable expenses of arbitration as may be specified in the arbitration agreement if such an award is authorized by law in a civil action involving the same claim or by the agreement of the parties to the arbitration proceeding.

      (3) As to all remedies other than those authorized by subsections (1) and (2) of this section, an arbitrator may order such remedies as the arbitrator considers just and appropriate under the circumstances of the arbitration proceeding. The fact that such a remedy could not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground for refusing to confirm an award under ORS 36.700 or for vacating an award under ORS 36.705.

      (4) An arbitrator’s expenses and fees, together with other expenses, must be paid as provided in the award.

      (5) If an arbitrator awards punitive damages or other exemplary relief under subsection (1) of this section, the arbitrator shall specify in the award the basis in fact justifying and the basis in law authorizing the award and state separately the amount of the punitive damages or other exemplary relief. [2003 c.598 §21]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.700 Confirmation of award. (1) After a party to an arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the party may make a petition to the court for an order confirming the award. The party filing the petition must serve a copy of the petition on all other parties to the proceedings. The court shall issue a confirming order unless within 20 days after the petition is served on the other parties:

      (a) A party requests that the arbitrator modify or correct the award under ORS 36.690; or

      (b) A party petitions the court to vacate, modify or correct the award under ORS 36.705 or 36.710.

      (2) If a party requests that the arbitrator modify or correct the award under ORS 36.690, or petitions the court to vacate, modify or correct the award under ORS 36.705 or 36.710, the court may stay entry of an order on a petition filed under this section until a final decision is made on the request or petition. [2003 c.598 §22]

 

      Note: See note under 36.600.

 

      36.705 Vacating award. (1) Upon petition to the court by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:

If the petitioner alleges that the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means, a petition under this section must be filed within 90 days after the grounds for challenging the award are known or, by the exercise of reasonable care, would have been known by the petitioner. A party filing a petition under this section must serve a copy of the petition on all other parties to the proceedings.

      (3) If the court vacates an award on a ground other than that set forth in subsection (1)(e) of this section, it may order a rehearing. If the award is vacated on a ground stated in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section, the rehearing must be before a new arbitrator. If the award is vacated on a ground stated in subsection (1)(c), (d) or (f) of this section, the rehearing may be before the arbitrator who made the award or before any successor appointed for that arbitrator. The arbitrator must render the decision in the rehearing within the same time as that provided for an award in ORS 36.685 (2).

      (4) If the court denies a petition to vacate an award, it shall confirm the award unless a petition to modify or correct the award is pending. [2003 c.598 §23]

      (c) The award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the decision on the claims submitted.

      (2) If a petition made under subsection (1) of this section is granted, the court shall modify or correct and confirm the award as modified or corrected. Otherwise, unless a petition to vacate is pending, the court shall confirm the award.
