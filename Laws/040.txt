      (2) The Oregon Evidence Code applies generally to civil actions, suits and proceedings, criminal actions and proceedings and to contempt proceedings except those in which the court may act summarily.

      (3) ORS 40.225 to 40.295 relating to privileges apply at all stages of all actions, suits and proceedings.

      (4) ORS 40.010 to 40.210 and 40.310 to 40.585 do not apply in the following situations:

      (a) The determination of questions of fact preliminary to admissibility of evidence when the issue is to be determined by the court under ORS 40.030.

      40.020 Rule 102. Purpose and construction. The Oregon Evidence Code shall be construed to secure fairness in administration, elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay, and promotion of growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined. [1981 c.892 §3]

 

      40.025 Rule 103. Rulings on evidence. (1) Evidential error is not presumed to be prejudicial. Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and:

      (a) In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or

      (b) In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.

      (2) The court may add any other or further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection made and the ruling thereon. It may direct the making of an offer in question and answer form.

      (3) In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.

      (4) Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court. [1981 c.892 §4]

 

      40.030 Rule 104. Preliminary questions. (1) Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section. In making its determination the court is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.

      (2) When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.

      (3) Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury. Hearings on other preliminary matters shall be so conducted when the interests of justice require or, when an accused is a witness, if the accused so requests.

      (4) The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case.

      (5) This section does not limit the right of a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility. [1981 c.892 §5]

 

      40.035 Rule 105. Limited admissibility. When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. [1981 c.892 §6]

 

      40.040 Rule 106. When part of transaction proved, whole admissible. When part of an act, declaration, conversation or writing is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject, where otherwise admissible, may at that time be inquired into by the other; when a letter is read, the answer may at that time be given; and when a detached act, declaration, conversation or writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation or writing which is necessary to make it understood may at that time also be given in evidence. [1981 c.892 §6a]

 

JUDICIAL NOTICE

 

      40.060 Rule 201(a). Scope. ORS 40.060 to 40.085 govern judicial notice of adjudicative facts. ORS 40.090 governs judicial notice of law. [1981 c.892 §7]

 

      40.065 Rule 201(b). Kinds of facts. A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either:

      40.075 Rule 201(e). Opportunity to be heard. A party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial notice has been taken. [1981 c.892 §10]

 

      40.080 Rule 201(f). Time of taking notice. Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding. [1981 c.892 §11]

 

      40.085 Rule 201(g). Instructing the jury. (1) In a civil action or proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact or law judicially noticed.

      (2) In a criminal case, the court shall instruct the jury that it may, but is not required to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed in favor of the prosecution. [1981 c.892 §12]

 

      40.090 Rule 202. Law that is judicially noticed. Law judicially noticed is defined as:

      (1) The decisional, constitutional and public statutory law of Oregon, the United States, any federally recognized American Indian tribal government and any state, territory or other jurisdiction of the United States.

      (2) Public and private official acts of the legislative, executive and judicial departments of this state, the United States, any federally recognized American Indian tribal government and any other state, territory or other jurisdiction of the United States.

      (3) Rules of professional conduct for members of the Oregon State Bar.

      (4) Regulations, ordinances and similar legislative enactments issued by or under the authority of the United States, any federally recognized American Indian tribal government or any state, territory or possession of the United States.

      (6) The law of an organization of nations and of foreign nations and public entities in foreign nations.

      (7) An ordinance, comprehensive plan or enactment of any county or incorporated city in this state, or a right derived therefrom. As used in this subsection, “comprehensive plan” has the meaning given that term by ORS 197.015. [1981 c.892 §13; 2007 c.63 §1]

 

BURDEN OF PERSUASION; BURDEN OF PRODUCING EVIDENCE; PRESUMPTIONS

 

      40.105 Rule 305. Allocation of the burden of persuasion. A party has the burden of persuasion as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which the law declares essential to the claim for relief or defense the party is asserting. [1981 c.892 §14]

 

      40.110 Rule 306. Instructions on the burden of persuasion. The court shall instruct the jury as to which party bears the applicable burden of persuasion on each issue only after all of the evidence in the case has been received. [1981 c.892 §15]

 

      40.115 Rule 307. Allocation of the burden of producing evidence. (1) The burden of producing evidence as to a particular issue is on the party against whom a finding on the issue would be required in the absence of further evidence.

      (2) The burden of producing evidence as to a particular issue is initially on the party with the burden of persuasion as to that issue. [1981 c.892 §16]

 

      40.120 Rule 308. Presumptions in civil proceedings. In civil actions and proceedings, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of the presumed fact is more probable than its existence. [1981 c.892 §17]

 

      40.125 Rule 309. Presumptions in criminal proceedings. (1) The judge is not authorized to direct the jury to find a presumed fact against the accused.

      (2) When the presumed fact establishes guilt or is an element of the offense or negates a defense, the judge may submit the question of guilt or the existence of the presumed fact to the jury only if:

      (a) A reasonable juror on the evidence as a whole could find that the facts giving rise to the presumed fact have been established beyond a reasonable doubt; and

      (b) The presumed fact follows more likely than not from the facts giving rise to the presumed fact. [1981 c.892 §18]

 

      40.130 Rule 310. Conflicting presumptions. If presumptions are conflicting, the presumption applies that is founded upon weightier considerations of policy and logic. If considerations of policy and logic are of equal weight, neither presumption applies. [1981 c.892 §19]

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a prosecution for a crime or an attempt to commit a crime listed in subsection (1) of this section or in a proceeding conducted under ORS 163.760 to 163.777, evidence of an alleged victim’s past sexual behavior other than reputation or opinion evidence is also not admissible, unless the evidence other than reputation or opinion evidence:

Any motion made under this paragraph shall be served on all other parties and, in a criminal proceeding, on the alleged victim through the office of the prosecutor.

      (b) The motion described in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be accompanied by a written offer of proof. If the court determines that the offer of proof contains evidence described in subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the court shall order a hearing in camera to determine if the evidence is admissible. At the hearing the parties may call witnesses, including the alleged victim, and offer relevant evidence.

      (c) If the court determines on the basis of the hearing described in paragraph (b) of this subsection that the evidence the accused or the respondent seeks to offer is relevant and that the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice, the evidence shall be admissible in the trial to the extent an order made by the court specifies evidence that may be offered and areas with respect to which a witness may be examined or cross-examined.

If disclosure of the identity of the informer is made in camera, the record thereof shall be sealed and preserved to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal, and the contents shall not otherwise be revealed without consent of the unit of government.

      (2) Made without opportunity to claim the privilege. [1981 c.892 §40]

 

      40.290 Rule 513. Comment upon or inference from claim of privilege. (1) The claim of a privilege, whether in the present proceeding or upon a prior occasion, is not a proper subject of comment by judge or counsel. No inference may be drawn from a claim of privilege.

      (2) In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to facilitate the making of claims of privilege without the knowledge of the jury.

      (3) Upon request, any party against whom the jury might draw an adverse inference from a claim of privilege is entitled to an instruction that no inference may be drawn therefrom. [1981 c.892 §41]

 

      40.295 Rule 514. Effect on existing privileges.

      (4) When the credibility of a witness is attacked by evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime, the witness shall be allowed to explain briefly the circumstances of the crime or former conviction; once the witness explains the circumstances, the opposing side shall have the opportunity to rebut the explanation.

      (5) The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.

      (6) An adjudication by a juvenile court that a child is within its jurisdiction is not a conviction of a crime.

      (7) A conviction of any of the statutory counterparts of offenses designated as violations as described in ORS 153.008 may not be used to impeach the character of a witness in any criminal or civil action or proceeding. [1981 c.892 §53; 1987 c.2 §9; subsection (6) of 1993 Edition enacted as 1993 c.379 §4; 1999 c.1051 §121; 2001 c.714 §1; 2003 c.577 §3; 2009 c.56 §1; 2019 c.635 §6]

 

      Note: 40.355 (7) was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 40 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      40.360 Rule 609-1. Impeachment for bias or interest. (1) The credibility of a witness may be attacked by evidence that the witness engaged in conduct or made statements showing bias or interest. In examining a witness concerning a prior statement made by the witness, whether written or not, the statement need not be shown nor its contents disclosed to the witness at that time, but on request the statement shall be shown or disclosed to the opposing party.

      (2) If a witness fully admits the facts claimed to show the bias or interest of the witness, additional evidence of that bias or interest shall not be admitted. If the witness denies or does not fully admit the facts claimed to show bias or interest, the party attacking the credibility of the witness may then offer evidence to prove those facts.

      (3) Evidence to support or rehabilitate a witness whose credibility has been attacked by evidence of bias or interest shall be limited to evidence showing a lack of bias or interest. [1981 c.892 §54; 1999 c.100 §1]

 

      40.365 Rule 610. Religious beliefs or opinions. Evidence of the beliefs or opinions of a witness on matters of religion is not admissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature the credibility of the witness is impaired or enhanced. [1981 c.892 §54a]

 

      40.370 Rule 611. Mode and order of interrogation and presentation. (1) The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, avoid needless consumption of time and protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.

      (2) Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.

      (3) Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness’ testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions. [1981 c.892 §54b]

 

      40.375 Rule 612. Writing used to refresh memory. If a witness uses a writing to refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, either while testifying or before testifying if the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce into evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony, the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to order under this section, the court shall make any order justice requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not to comply the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial. [1981 c.892 §55]

 

      40.380 Rule 613. Prior statements of witnesses. (1) In examining a witness concerning a prior statement made by the witness, whether written or not, the statement need not be shown nor its contents disclosed to the witness at that time, but on request the same shall be shown or disclosed to opposing counsel.

      (2) Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require. This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-opponent as defined in ORS 40.450. [1981 c.892 §55a; 1983 c.433 §2; 1983 c.740 §5]

 

      40.385 Rule 615. Exclusion of witnesses. At the request of a party the court may order witnesses excluded until the time of final argument, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of:

      (1) A party who is a natural person;

      (2) An officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney;

      (3) A person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party’s cause; or

      (4) The victim in a criminal case. [1981 c.892 §56; 1987 c.2 §5; 2003 c.14 §20]

 

OPINIONS AND EXPERT TESTIMONY

 

      40.405 Rule 701. Opinion testimony by lay witnesses. If the witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony of the witness in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are:

      (1) Rationally based on the perception of the witness; and

      (2) Helpful to a clear understanding of testimony of the witness or the determination of a fact in issue. [1981 c.892 §57]

 

      40.410 Rule 702. Testimony by experts. If scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise. [1981 c.892 §58]

 

      40.415 Rule 703. Bases of opinion testimony by experts. The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence. [1981 c.892 §59]

 

      40.420 Rule 704. Opinion on ultimate issue. Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact. [1981 c.892 §60]

 

      40.425 Rule 705. Disclosure of fact or data underlying expert opinion. An expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts or data, unless the court requires otherwise. The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination. [1981 c.892 §61]

 

      40.430 Rule 706. Impeachment of expert witness by learned treatise. Upon cross-examination, an expert witness may be questioned concerning statements contained in a published treatise, periodical or pamphlet on a subject of history, medicine or other science or art if the treatise, periodical or pamphlet is established as a reliable authority. A treatise, periodical or pamphlet may be established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness, by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. Statements contained in a treatise, periodical or pamphlet established as a reliable authority may be used for purposes of impeachment but may not be introduced as substantive evidence. [1999 c.85 §2]

      40.455 Rule 802. Hearsay rule. Hearsay is not admissible except as provided in ORS 40.450 to 40.475 or as otherwise provided by law. [1981 c.892 §63]

 

      40.460 Rule 803. Hearsay exceptions; availability of declarant immaterial. The following are not excluded by ORS 40.455, even though the declarant is available as a witness:

If admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.

      (6) A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless the source of information or the method of circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.

      (15) A statement contained in a document purporting to establish or affect an interest in property if the matter stated was relevant to the purpose of the document, unless dealings with the property since the document was made have been inconsistent with the truth of the statement or the purport of the document.

      (16) Statements in a document in existence 20 years or more the authenticity of which is established.

      (17) Market quotations, tabulations, lists, directories, or other published compilations, generally used and relied upon by the public or by persons in particular occupations.

      (18a)(a) A complaint of sexual misconduct, complaint of abuse as defined in ORS 107.705 or 419B.005, complaint of abuse of an elderly person, as those terms are defined in ORS 124.050, or a complaint relating to a violation of ORS 163.205 or 164.015 in which a person 65 years of age or older is the victim, made by the witness after the commission of the alleged misconduct or abuse at issue. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, such evidence must be confined to the fact that the complaint was made.

      (b) A statement made by a person concerning an act of abuse as defined in ORS 107.705 or 419B.005, a statement made by a person concerning an act of abuse of an elderly person, as those terms are defined in ORS 124.050, or a statement made by a person concerning a violation of ORS 163.205 or 164.015 in which a person 65 years of age or older is the victim, is not excluded by ORS 40.455 if the declarant either testifies at the proceeding and is subject to cross-examination, or is unavailable as a witness but was chronologically or mentally under 12 years of age when the statement was made or was 65 years of age or older when the statement was made. However, if a declarant is unavailable, the statement may be admitted in evidence only if the proponent establishes that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide indicia of reliability, and in a criminal trial that there is corroborative evidence of the act of abuse and of the alleged perpetrator’s opportunity to participate in the conduct and that the statement possesses indicia of reliability as is constitutionally required to be admitted. No statement may be admitted under this paragraph unless the proponent of the statement makes known to the adverse party the proponent’s intention to offer the statement and the particulars of the statement no later than 15 days before trial, except for good cause shown. For purposes of this paragraph, in addition to those situations described in ORS 40.465 (1), the declarant shall be considered “unavailable” if the declarant has a substantial lack of memory of the subject matter of the statement, is presently incompetent to testify, is unable to communicate about the abuse or sexual conduct because of fear or other similar reason or is substantially likely, as established by expert testimony, to suffer lasting severe emotional trauma from testifying. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the court shall examine the declarant in chambers and on the record or outside the presence of the jury and on the record. The examination shall be conducted immediately prior to the commencement of the trial in the presence of the attorney and the legal guardian or other suitable person as designated by the court. If the declarant is found to be unavailable, the court shall then determine the admissibility of the evidence. The determinations shall be appealable under ORS 138.045 (1)(d). The purpose of the examination shall be to aid the court in making its findings regarding the availability of the declarant as a witness and the reliability of the statement of the declarant. In determining whether a statement possesses indicia of reliability under this paragraph, the court may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:

      (A) The personal knowledge of the declarant of the event;

      (B) The age and maturity of the declarant or extent of disability if the declarant is a person with a developmental disability;

      (C) Certainty that the statement was made, including the credibility of the person testifying about the statement and any motive the person may have to falsify or distort the statement;

      (D) Any apparent motive the declarant may have to falsify or distort the event, including bias, corruption or coercion;

      (E) The timing of the statement of the declarant;

      (F) Whether more than one person heard the statement;

      (G) Whether the declarant was suffering pain or distress when making the statement;

      (H) Whether the declarant’s young age or disability makes it unlikely that the declarant fabricated a statement that represents a graphic, detailed account beyond the knowledge and experience of the declarant;

      (I) Whether the statement has internal consistency or coherence and uses terminology appropriate to the declarant’s age or to the extent of the declarant’s disability if the declarant is a person with a developmental disability;

      (J) Whether the statement is spontaneous or directly responsive to questions; and

      (K) Whether the statement was elicited by leading questions.

      (c) This subsection applies to all civil, criminal and juvenile proceedings.

      (d) This subsection applies to a child declarant, a declarant who is an elderly person as defined in ORS 124.050 or an adult declarant with a developmental disability. For the purposes of this subsection, “developmental disability” means any disability attributable to mental retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, epilepsy or other disabling neurological condition that requires training or support similar to that required by persons with mental retardation, if either of the following apply:

      (A) The disability originates before the person attains 22 years of age, or if the disability is attributable to mental retardation the condition is manifested before the person attains 18 years of age, the disability can be expected to continue indefinitely, and the disability constitutes a substantial handicap to the ability of the person to function in society.

      (B) The disability results in a significant subaverage general intellectual functioning with concurrent deficits in adaptive behavior that are manifested during the developmental period.

      (19) Reputation among members of a person’s family by blood, adoption or marriage, or among a person’s associates, or in the community, concerning a person’s birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, death, legitimacy, relationship by blood or adoption or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of a person’s personal or family history.

      (20) Reputation in a community, arising before the controversy, as to boundaries of or customs affecting lands in the community, and reputation as to events of general history important to the community or state or nation in which located.

      (21) Reputation of a person’s character among associates of the person or in the community.

      (22) Evidence of a final judgment, entered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty, but not upon a plea of no contest, adjudging a person guilty of a crime other than a traffic offense, to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment, but not including, when offered by the government in a criminal prosecution for purposes other than impeachment, judgments against persons other than the accused. The pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affect admissibility.

      (23) Judgments as proof of matters of personal, family or general history, or boundaries, essential to the judgment, if the same would be provable by evidence of reputation.

      (24) Notwithstanding the limits contained in subsection (18a) of this section, in any proceeding in which a child under 12 years of age at the time of trial, or a person with a developmental disability as described in subsection (18a)(d) of this section, may be called as a witness to testify concerning an act of abuse, as defined in ORS 419B.005, or sexual conduct performed with or on the child or person with a developmental disability by another, the testimony of the child or person with a developmental disability taken by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place under the supervision of the trial judge and communicated to the courtroom by closed-circuit television or other audiovisual means. Testimony will be allowed as provided in this subsection only if the court finds that there is a substantial likelihood, established by expert testimony, that the child or person with a developmental disability will suffer severe emotional or psychological harm if required to testify in open court. If the court makes such a finding, the court, on motion of a party, the child, the person with a developmental disability or the court in a civil proceeding, or on motion of the district attorney, the child or the person with a developmental disability in a criminal or juvenile proceeding, may order that the testimony of the child or the person with a developmental disability be taken as described in this subsection. Only the judge, the attorneys for the parties, the parties, individuals necessary to operate the equipment and any individual the court finds would contribute to the welfare and well-being of the child or person with a developmental disability may be present during the testimony of the child or person with a developmental disability.

      (25)(a) Any document containing data prepared or recorded by the Oregon State Police pursuant to ORS 813.160 (1)(b)(C) or (E), or pursuant to ORS 475.235 (4), if the document is produced by data retrieval from the Law Enforcement Data System or other computer system maintained and operated by the Oregon State Police, and the person retrieving the data attests that the information was retrieved directly from the system and that the document accurately reflects the data retrieved.

      (b) Any document containing data prepared or recorded by the Oregon State Police that is produced by data retrieval from the Law Enforcement Data System or other computer system maintained and operated by the Oregon State Police and that is electronically transmitted through public or private computer networks under an electronic signature adopted by the Oregon State Police if the person receiving the data attests that the document accurately reflects the data received.

      (c) Notwithstanding any statute or rule to the contrary, in any criminal case in which documents are introduced under the provisions of this subsection, the defendant may subpoena the analyst, as defined in ORS 475.235 (6), or other person that generated or keeps the original document for the purpose of testifying at the preliminary hearing and trial of the issue. Except as provided in ORS 44.550 to 44.566, no charge shall be made to the defendant for the appearance of the analyst or other person.

      (26)(a) A statement that purports to narrate, describe, report or explain an incident of domestic violence, as defined in ORS 135.230, made by a victim of the domestic violence within 24 hours after the incident occurred, if the statement:

      (A) Was recorded, either electronically or in writing, or was made to a peace officer as defined in ORS 161.015, corrections officer, youth correction officer, parole and probation officer, emergency medical services provider or firefighter; and

      (B) Has sufficient indicia of reliability.

      (b) In determining whether a statement has sufficient indicia of reliability under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court shall consider all circumstances surrounding the statement. The court may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether a statement has sufficient indicia of reliability:

      (A) The personal knowledge of the declarant.

      (B) Whether the statement is corroborated by evidence other than statements that are subject to admission only pursuant to this subsection.

      (C) The timing of the statement.

      (D) Whether the statement was elicited by leading questions.

      (E) Subsequent statements made by the declarant. Recantation by a declarant is not sufficient reason for denying admission of a statement under this subsection in the absence of other factors indicating unreliability.

      (27) A report prepared by a forensic scientist that contains the results of a presumptive test conducted by the forensic scientist as described in ORS 475.235, if the forensic scientist attests that the report accurately reflects the results of the presumptive test.

      (28)(a) A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that:

      (A) The statement is relevant;

      (B) The statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and

      (C) The general purposes of the Oregon Evidence Code and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.

      (b) A statement may not be admitted under this subsection unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party the intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant, sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing, or as soon as practicable after it becomes apparent that such statement is probative of the issues at hand, to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it. [1981 c.892 §64; 1989 c.300 §1; 1989 c.881 §1; 1991 c.391 §1; 1995 c.200 §1; 1995 c.476 §1; 1995 c.804 §2; 1999 c.59 §13; 1999 c.674 §1; 1999 c.945 §1; 2001 c.104 §11; 2001 c.533 §1; 2001 c.870 §5; 2003 c.538 §2; 2005 c.118 §3; 2007 c.63 §2; 2007 c.70 §12; 2007 c.636 §3; 2009 c.610 §9; 2011 c.661 §14; 2011 c.703 §21; 2017 c.529 §21]

 

      40.465 Rule 804. Hearsay exceptions when the declarant is unavailable. (1) “Unavailability as a witness” includes situations in which the declarant:

      (a) Is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of a statement;

      (b) Persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of a statement despite an order of the court to do so;

      (c) Testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of a statement;

      (d) Is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or

      (e) Is absent from the hearing and the proponent of the declarant’s statement has been unable to procure the declarant’s attendance (or in the case of an exception under subsection (3)(b), (c) or (d) of this section, the declarant’s attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means.

      (2) A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if the declarant’s exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the declarant’s statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.

      (3) The following are not excluded by ORS 40.455 if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:

      (a) Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.

      (b) A statement made by a declarant while believing that death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be impending death.

      (c) A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant’s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant’s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.

      (d)(A) A statement concerning the declarant’s own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood or adoption or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history, even though the declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or

      (B) A statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the other’s family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared.

      (e) A statement made at or near the time of the transaction by a person in a position to know the facts stated therein, acting in the person’s professional capacity and in the ordinary course of professional conduct.

      (f) A statement offered against a party who intentionally or knowingly engaged in criminal conduct that directly caused the death of the declarant, or directly caused the declarant to become unavailable as a witness because of incapacity or incompetence.

      (g) A statement offered against a party who engaged in, directed or otherwise participated in wrongful conduct that was intended to cause the declarant to be unavailable as a witness, and did cause the declarant to be unavailable.

      (h) A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of the Oregon Evidence Code and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this paragraph unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party the intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant, sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing, or as soon as practicable after it becomes apparent that the statement is probative of the issues at hand, to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it. [1981 c.892 §65; 2005 c.458 §1]

 

      40.470 Rule 805. Hearsay within hearsay. Hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded under ORS 40.455 if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception set forth in ORS 40.460 or 40.465. [1981 c.892 §66]

 

      40.475 Rule 806. Attacking and supporting credibility of declarant. When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in ORS 40.450 (4)(b)(C), (D) or (E), has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness. Evidence of a statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent with the hearsay statement of the declarant, is not subject to any requirement under ORS 40.380 relating to impeachment by evidence of inconsistent statements. If the party against whom a hearsay statement has been admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party is entitled to examine the declarant on the statement as if under cross-examination. [1981 c.892 §67]

 

AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTIFICATION

[1981 c.892 §69; 1995 c.200 §2; 1999 c.674 §2; 2001 c.104 §12; 2003 c.14 §21; 2003 c.538 §3; 2005 c.22 §31; 2005 c.118 §4; 2007 c.636 §4; 2009 c.610 §10]

CONTENTS OF WRITINGS, RECORDINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS

 

      40.550 Rule 1001. Definitions for ORS 40.550 to 40.585. As used in ORS 40.550 to 40.585, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Duplicate” means a counterpart produced by the same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by means of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, by mechanical or electronic re-recording, by chemical reproduction, by optical imaging or by other equivalent techniques that accurately reproduce the original, including reproduction by facsimile machines if the reproduction is identified as a facsimile and printed on nonthermal paper.

      (2) “Original” of a writing or recording is the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it. An “original” of a photograph includes the negative or any print therefrom. If data are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an “original.”

      (3) “Photographs” includes still photographs, X-ray films, video tapes and motion pictures.

      (4) “Writings” and “recordings” mean letters, words or numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, optical imaging, mechanical or electronic recording or other form of data compilation. [1981 c.892 §71; 1991 c.857 §1; 1995 c.760 §1]

 

      40.555 Rule 1002. Requirement of original. To prove the content of a writing, recording or photograph, the original writing, recording or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in ORS 40.550 to 40.585 or other law. [1981 c.892 §72]

 

      40.560 Rule 1003. Admissibility of duplicates. A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless:

      (1) A genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original; or

      (2) In the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. [1981 c.892 §73]

 

      40.562 Rule 1003-1. Admissibility of reproduction. (1) If any business, institution or member of a profession or calling, in the regular course of business or activity, has kept or recorded any memorandum, writing, entry, print, representation or a combination thereof, of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, and in the regular course of business has caused any or all of the same to be recorded, copied or reproduced by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic, optical imaging or other process that accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for so reproducing the original, the original may be destroyed in the regular course of business unless held in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and the principal or true owner has not authorized destruction or unless its preservation is required by law. Such reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, is as admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding whether the original is in existence or not and an enlargement or facsimile of such reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspection under direction of the court. The introduction of a reproduced record, enlargement or facsimile does not preclude admission of the original.

      (2) If any department or agency of government, in the regular course of business or activity, has kept or recorded any memorandum, writing, entry, print, representation or combination thereof, of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, and in the regular course of business, and in accordance with ORS 192.040 to 192.060 and 192.105, has caused any or all of the same to be recorded, copied or reproduced by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic, optical imaging or other process that accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for so reproducing the original, the original may be destroyed in the regular course of business unless held in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and the principal or true owner has not authorized destruction or unless its preservation is required by law. Such reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, is as admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding whether the original is in existence or not and an enlargement or facsimile of such reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspection under direction of the court. The introduction of a reproduced record, enlargement or facsimile does not preclude admission of the original. [1995 c.760 §3]

 

      40.565 Rule 1004. Admissibility of other evidence of contents. The original is not required, and other evidence of the contents of a writing, recording or photograph is admissible when:

      (1) All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith;

      (2) An original cannot be obtained by any available judicial process or procedure;

      (3) At a time when an original was under the control of the party against whom offered, that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, and the party does not produce the original at the hearing; or

      (4) The writing, recording or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue. [1981 c.892 §74]

 

      40.570 Rule 1005. Public records. The contents of an official record or of a document authorized to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed, including data compilations in any form, if otherwise admissible, may be proved by copy, certified as correct in accordance with ORS 40.510 or testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. If such a copy cannot be obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, then other evidence of the contents may be given. [1981 c.892 §75; 1983 c.433 §3]

 

      40.575 Rule 1006. Summaries. The contents of voluminous writings, recordings or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary or calculation. The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at a reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be produced in court. [1981 c.892 §76]

 

      40.580 Rule 1007. Testimony or written admission of party. Contents of writings, recordings or photographs may be proved by the testimony or deposition of the party against whom offered or by the party’s written admission, without accounting for the nonproduction of the original. [1981 c.892 §77]

 

      40.585 Rule 1008. Functions of court and jury. When the admissibility of other evidence of contents of writings, recordings or photographs under ORS 40.550 to 40.585 depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the question whether the condition has been fulfilled is ordinarily for the court to determine in accordance with ORS 40.030. However, the issue is for the trier of fact to determine as in the case of other issues of fact when the issue raised is:

      (1) Whether the asserted writing ever existed;

      (2) Whether another writing, recording or photograph produced at the trial is the original; or

      (3) Whether the other evidence of contents correctly reflects the contents. [1981 c.892 §78]
