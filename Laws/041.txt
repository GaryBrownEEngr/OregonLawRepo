      41.740 Parol evidence rule. When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing by the parties, it is to be considered as containing all those terms, and therefore there can be, between the parties and their representatives or successors in interest, no evidence of the terms of the agreement, other than the contents of the writing, except where a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue by the pleadings or where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute. However this section does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made, or to which it relates, as defined in ORS 42.220, or to explain an ambiguity, intrinsic or extrinsic, or to establish illegality or fraud. The term “agreement” includes deeds and wills as well as contracts between parties.

Attempts to comply with the provisions of ORCP 32 I by a person receiving a demand shall be construed to be an offer to compromise and shall be inadmissible as evidence. Such attempts to comply with a demand shall not be considered an admission of engaging in the act or practice alleged to be unlawful nor of the unlawfulness of that act. Evidence of compliance or attempts to comply with the provisions of ORCP 32 I may be introduced by a defendant for the purpose of establishing good faith or to show compliance with the provisions of ORCP 32 I.

      (1) In violation of ORS 165.540 shall not be admissible in any court of this state, except as evidence of unlawful interception or when the evidence was created by the use of a video camera worn upon a law enforcement officer’s person and the officer either substantially complied with or attempted in good faith to comply with ORS 165.540 (5)(d)(B).

      (2) Under ORS 165.540 (2)(a) shall not be admissible in any court of this state unless:

      41.930 Admissibility of copies of original records. The copy of the records described in ORCP 55 H or ORS 136.447 is admissible in evidence to the same extent as though the original thereof were offered and a custodian of hospital records had been present and testified to the matters stated in the affidavit. The affidavit is admissible as evidence of the matters stated therein. The matters stated therein are presumed to be true.
