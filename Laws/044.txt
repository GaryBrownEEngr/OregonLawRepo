GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      44.080 Protection of witness from improper questions and excessive detention. It is the right of a witness to be protected from irrelevant, insulting or improper questions, and from harsh or insulting demeanor. The witness is to be detained only so long as the interests of justice require.

 

      44.090 Protection of witness from arrest. (1) Every person who has been, in good faith, served with a subpoena to attend as a witness before a court, judge, commissioner, referee or other officer, is exonerated from arrest, in a civil case, while going to the place of attendance, necessarily remaining there and returning. The arrest of a witness contrary to this section is void, and when willfully made is a contempt of the court; and the officer making the arrest is responsible to the witness for double the amount of the damages which may be assessed against the officer, and is also liable in an action by the party serving the witness with the subpoena, for the damages sustained by that party in consequence of the arrest.

      (2) But the officer is not liable in any way, unless the person claiming the exemption makes, if required, an affidavit stating:

      (a) That the person has been served with a subpoena to attend as a witness before a court, judge or other officer, specifying the same, the place of attendance and the action, suit or proceeding in which the subpoena was issued; and

      (b) That the person has not been served by the procurement of the person with the intention of avoiding an arrest.

      (3) The affidavit may be taken by the officer and exonerates the officer from liability for not making the arrest, or for discharging the witness when arrested.

      (4) The court, judge or officer before whom the attendance of the witness is required may discharge the witness from an arrest made in violation of this section.

      44.240 Production of witness confined in Department of Corrections institution. (1) Whenever a court or judge makes an order for the temporary removal and production of a witness who is confined in a Department of Corrections institution within this state before a court or officer for the purpose of being orally examined this section applies.

      (2) The sheriff shall give the superintendent a signed receipt when taking custody of the witness under subsection (1) of this section. The sheriff shall be responsible for the custody of the witness until the sheriff returns the witness to the institution. Upon the return of the witness to the institution by the sheriff, the superintendent shall give a signed receipt therefor to the sheriff.

      (3) When a witness is delivered to a sheriff under subsection (1) of this section, or at any time while the witness is in the custody of the sheriff as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the superintendent may give the sheriff a list of persons who may communicate with the witness or with whom the witness may communicate. Except as otherwise required by law, upon receipt of the list and while the witness is in the custody of the sheriff, the sheriff shall permit communication only between the witness and those persons designated by the list.

      (4) The sheriff and neither the institution nor the Department of Corrections shall be liable for any expense incurred in connection with the witness while the witness is in the custody of the sheriff as provided in subsection (2) of this section. If the witness is a party plaintiff, the sheriff shall recover costs of the care of the witness from the plaintiff, and shall have a lien upon any judgment for the plaintiff. In all other cases, the sheriff and not the witness shall be entitled to the witness fees and mileage to which the witness would otherwise be entitled under ORS 44.415 (2), or other applicable law.

This presumption, however, may be overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the character of the testimony of the witness, or by evidence affecting the character or motives of the witness, or by contradictory evidence. Where the trial is by the jury, they are the exclusive judges of the credibility of the witness.
