Thereupon the party to whom the remedy was allowed shall lose the benefit of the affidavit or declaration and all proceedings founded thereon, unless within eight days, or such other time as the court or judge may direct, upon a previous notice to the adversary of at least three days, the party produces the affiant or declarant for examination before the officer mentioned in the notice, or some other of like authority, provided for in the order of the court or judge. Upon production, the affiant or declarant may be examined by either party, but a party is not obliged to make this production of an affiant or a declarant except within the county where the provisional remedy was allowed. [Amended by 2003 c.194 §3; 2013 c.218 §12]

(Use of Deposition)

 

      45.250 Use of deposition. (1) At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions of this subsection:

      (a) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of a deponent as a witness.

      (b) The deposition of a party, or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director or managing agent of a public or private corporation, partnership or association that is a party, may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.

      (2) At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party for any purpose, if the party was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or had due notice thereof, and if the court finds that:

      (a) The witness is dead;

      (b) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity or imprisonment;

      (c) The party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena;

      (d) Upon application and notice, such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used; or

      (e) The deposition was taken in the same proceeding pursuant to ORCP 39 I.

      (3) For the purpose of subsection (2)(c) of this section, the failure of a party to serve a witness at the time of deposition with a subpoena that requires the appearance of the witness at trial or other hearing does not constitute sufficient grounds to deny the use of the deposition of that witness at the trial or other hearing without further showing of a lack of diligence on the part of the party offering the deposition. [1955 c.611 §§8,9; 1979 c.284 §83; 1987 c.275 §1; 1989 c.980 §4; 2001 c.234 §1; 2007 c.71 §12]

 

      45.260 Introduction, or exclusion, of part of deposition. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the party to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced and any party may introduce any other parts, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence. When any portion of a deposition is excluded from a case, so much of the adverse examination as relates thereto is excluded also. [1955 c.611 §10]

 

      45.270 Use of deposition in same or other proceedings. Substitution of parties shall not affect the right to use the depositions previously taken; and when an action, suit or proceeding has been dismissed and another action, suit or proceeding involving the same subject matter is afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, any deposition lawfully taken and duly filed in the former action, suit or proceeding may be used in the latter as if originally taken therefor, and is then to be deemed the evidence of the party reading it. [1955 c.611 §11]

      45.273 Policy. (1) It is declared to be the policy of this state to secure the constitutional rights and other rights of persons who are unable to readily understand or communicate in the English language because of a non-English-speaking cultural background or a disability, and who as a result cannot be fully protected in administrative and court proceedings unless qualified interpreters are available to provide assistance.

      (2) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly in passing ORS 45.272 to 45.297 to provide a procedure for the qualification and use of court interpreters. Nothing in ORS 45.272 to 45.297 abridges the rights or obligations of parties under other laws or court rules. [1993 c.687 §1; 1999 c.1041 §1]

 

      45.275 Appointment of interpreter for non-English-speaking party, witness or victim; substitution; payment of costs.

      (2) A fee may not be charged to any person for the appointment of an interpreter to interpret testimony of a non-English-speaking party or witness, to interpret the proceedings to a non-English-speaking party or victim or to assist the court, agency or hearing officer in performing the duties and responsibilities of the court, agency or hearing officer. A fee may not be charged to any person for the appointment of an interpreter if appointment is made to determine whether the person is non-English-speaking for the purposes of this section.

      (3) Fair compensation for the services of an interpreter appointed under this section shall be paid:

      (a) By the county, subject to the approval of the terms of the contract by the governing body of the county, in a proceeding in a county or justice court.

A request under this subsection must be made in a manner consistent with the policies and notice requirements of the court or agency relating to the appointment and scheduling of interpreters. If the substitution of another interpreter will delay the proceeding, the person making the request must show good cause for the substitution. Any party may object to use of any interpreter for good cause. Unless the court, hearing officer or the designee of the hearing officer has appointed a different interpreter for cause, the party using any interpreter other than the interpreter originally appointed by the court, hearing officer or the designee of the hearing officer shall bear any additional costs beyond the amount required to pay the original interpreter.

      (5) A judge or hearing officer, on the judge’s or hearing officer’s own motion, may substitute a different interpreter for the interpreter initially appointed in a proceeding. A judge or hearing officer may make a substitution under this subsection at any time and for any reason.

      (6) A court may allow as costs reasonable expenses incurred by a party in employing the services of an interpreter in civil proceedings in the manner provided by ORCP 68.

      (7) A court, a hearing officer or the designee of a hearing officer shall require any person serving as an interpreter for the court or agency to state the person’s name on the record and whether the person is certified under ORS 45.291. If the person is certified under ORS 45.291, the interpreter need not make the oath or affirmation required by ORS 40.325 or submit the interpreter’s qualifications on the record. If the person is not certified under ORS 45.291, the interpreter must make the oath or affirmation required by ORS 40.325 and submit the interpreter’s qualifications on the record.

      (c) “Qualified interpreter” means a person who is readily able to communicate with the non-English-speaking person and who can orally transfer the meaning of statements to and from English and the language spoken by the non-English-speaking person. A qualified interpreter must be able to interpret in a manner that conserves the meaning, tone, level, style and register of the original statement, without additions or omissions. “Qualified interpreter” does not include any person who is unable to interpret the dialect, slang or specialized vocabulary used by the party, victim or witness. [1991 c.750 §2; 1993 c.687 §8; 1995 c.273 §16; 1997 c.872 §18; 1999 c.1041 §4; 2001 c.242 §1; 2001 c.962 §§65,66; 2003 c.75 §§77,78; 2005 c.385 §2; 2012 c.107 §39; 2015 c.155 §2]

      (3) In any criminal proceeding, the court shall appoint a qualified interpreter and make available appropriate assistive communication devices whenever it is necessary to interpret the proceedings to a victim who is a person with a disability and who seeks to exercise in open court a right that is granted by Article I, section 42 or 43, of the Oregon Constitution, including the right to be present at a critical stage of the proceeding.

      (4) A fee may not be charged to the person with a disability for the appointment of an interpreter or use of an assistive communication device under this section. A fee may not be charged to any person for the appointment of an interpreter or the use of an assistive communication device if appointment or use is made to determine whether the person is a person with a disability for the purposes of this section.

      (5) Fair compensation for the services of an interpreter or the cost of an assistive communication device under this section shall be paid:

REMOTE LOCATION TESTIMONY

 

      45.400 Remote location testimony; when authorized; notice; payment of costs. (1) A party to any civil proceeding or any proceeding under ORS chapter 419B may move that the party or any witness for the moving party may give remote location testimony.

      (2) A party filing a motion under this section must give written notice to all other parties to the proceeding at least 30 days before the trial or hearing at which the remote location testimony will be offered. The court may allow written notice less than 30 days before the trial or hearing for good cause shown.

      (3)(a) Except as provided under subsection (5) of this section, the court may allow remote location testimony under this section upon a showing of good cause by the moving party, unless the court determines that the use of remote location testimony would result in prejudice to the nonmoving party and that prejudice outweighs the good cause for allowing the remote location testimony.

      (b) Factors that a court may consider that would support a finding of good cause for the purpose of a motion under this subsection include:

      (A) Whether the witness or party might be unavailable because of age, infirmity or mental or physical illness.

      (B) Whether the party filing the motion seeks to take the remote location testimony of a witness whose attendance the party has been unable to secure by process or other reasonable means.

      (C) Whether a personal appearance by the witness or party would be an undue hardship on the witness or party.

      (D) Whether a perpetuation deposition under ORCP 39 I, or another alternative, provides a more practical means of presenting the testimony.

      (E) Any other circumstances that constitute good cause.

      (c) Factors that a court may consider that would support a finding of prejudice under this subsection include:

      (A) Whether the ability to evaluate the credibility and demeanor of a witness or party in person is critical to the outcome of the proceeding.

      (B) Whether the nonmoving party demonstrates that face-to-face cross-examination is necessary because the issue or issues the witness or party will testify about may be determinative of the outcome.

      (C) Whether the exhibits or documents the witness or party will testify about are too voluminous to make remote location testimony practical.

      (D) The nature of the proceeding, with due consideration for a person’s liberty or parental interests.

      (E) Whether facilities that would permit the taking of remote location testimony are readily available.

      (F) Whether the nonmoving party demonstrates that other circumstances exist that require the personal appearance of a witness or party.

      (4) In exercising its discretion to allow remote location testimony under this section, a court may authorize telephone or other nonvisual transmission only upon finding that video transmission is not readily available.

      (5) The court may not allow use of remote location testimony in a jury trial unless good cause is shown and there is a compelling need for the use of remote location testimony.

      (6) A party filing a motion for remote location testimony under this section must pay all costs of the remote location testimony, including the costs of alternative procedures or technologies used for the taking of remote location testimony. No part of those costs may be recovered by the party filing the motions as costs and disbursements in the proceeding.

      (7) This section does not apply to a workers’ compensation hearing or to any other administrative proceeding.

      (8) As used in this section:

      (a) “Remote location testimony” means live testimony given by a witness or party from a physical location outside of the courtroom of record via simultaneous electronic transmission.

      (b) “Simultaneous electronic transmission” means television, telephone or any other form of electronic communication transmission if the form of transmission allows:

      (A) The court, the attorneys and the person testifying from a remote location to communicate with each other during the proceeding;

      (B) A witness or party who is represented by counsel at the hearing to be able to consult privately with counsel during the proceeding; and

      (C) The public to hear and, if the transmission includes a visual image, to see the witness or party if the public would otherwise have the right to hear and see the witness or party testifying in the courtroom of record. [1993 c.425 §1; 2001 c.398 §1; 2003 c.262 §1; 2017 c.240 §1]
