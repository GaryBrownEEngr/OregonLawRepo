      (a) Paying to the plaintiff the amount of the claim plus the amount of all filing fees and service expenses paid by the plaintiff and mailing proof of that payment to the court.

      (b) If the claim is for recovery of specific personal property, delivering the property to the plaintiff and paying to the plaintiff the amount of all filing fees and service expenses paid by the plaintiff and mailing proof of that delivery and payment to the court.

      (2) If the defendant denies the claim, the defendant:

      (a) May demand a hearing in the small claims department in a written request to the clerk in the form prescribed by the court, accompanied by payment of the defendant’s fee prescribed; and

      (b) When demanding a hearing, may assert a counterclaim in the form provided by the court.

      (2) If the amount or value of the counterclaim exceeds $10,000, the court shall strike the counterclaim and proceed to hear and dispose of the case as though the counterclaim had not been asserted unless the defendant files with the counterclaim a motion requesting that the case be transferred from the small claims department to the circuit court. After the transfer the plaintiff’s claim will not be limited to the amount stated in the claim filed with the small claims department, though it must involve the same controversy.

      (3)(a) If the amount or value of the counterclaim exceeds that specified in subsection (2) of this section, and the defendant files a motion requesting transfer as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the case shall be transferred to the circuit court.

The notice to the plaintiff shall contain a copy of the counterclaim and shall instruct the plaintiff to file with the court and serve by mail on the defendant, within 20 days following the mailing of the notice, a reply to the counterclaim and, if the plaintiff proposes to increase the amount of the claim originally filed with the small claims department, an amended claim for the increased amount. Proof of service on the defendant of the plaintiff’s reply and amended claim may be made by certificate of the plaintiff or plaintiff’s attorney attached to the reply and amended claim filed with the court. The defendant is not required to answer an amended claim of the plaintiff.

      (b) Upon filing the motion requesting transfer, the defendant shall pay to the clerk of the court an amount equal to the difference between the fee paid by the defendant as required by ORS 46.570 and the fee required of a defendant under ORS 21.160. Upon filing a reply to the counterclaim, the plaintiff shall pay to the clerk of the court an amount equal to the difference between the fee paid by the plaintiff as required by ORS 46.570 and the fee required of a plaintiff under ORS 21.160.

      (2) If the defendant asserts a counterclaim, the notice of the hearing time shall contain a copy of the counterclaim.

      (3)(a) If the defendant claims the right to a jury trial, the clerk shall notify the plaintiff by mail of the requirements of this paragraph. Within 20 days after the mailing of the notice, the plaintiff must file a formal complaint with the court and serve by mail a summons and copy of the complaint on the defendant at the designated address of the defendant. Proof of service must be filed by the plaintiff with the court. Proof of service may be made by filing a certificate of the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney with the complaint.

      (b) The plaintiff’s claim in the formal complaint filed pursuant to this subsection is not limited to the amount stated in the claim filed in the small claims department, but the claim in the formal complaint must relate to the same controversy.

      (c) The defendant must file an appearance in the matter within 10 days after the date on which the summons and copy of the complaint would be delivered to the defendant in due course of mail. Thereafter the cause shall proceed as other causes in the court, and costs and disbursements shall be allowed and taxed. Fees not previously paid shall be charged and collected as provided for other cases tried in the circuit court, except that the filing fee for the plaintiff shall be an amount equal to the difference between the filing fee paid by the plaintiff as required by ORS 46.570 and the filing fee required of the plaintiff under ORS 21.160.

      (4)(a) If the defendant claims the right to a jury trial and does not prevail in the action, the court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney fees incurred by the plaintiff in the action. Unless attorney fees are otherwise provided for in the action by contract or statutory provision, attorney fees awarded under this paragraph may not exceed $1,000.

      (b) If the defendant asserts a counterclaim that requires transfer of the matter under the provisions of ORS 46.461, and the defendant does not prevail in the action, the court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney fees incurred by the plaintiff in the action. [1971 c.760 §8; 1975 c.346 §1; 1983 c.673 §3; 1985 c.496 §14; 1991 c.790 §8; 1995 c.455 §5; 1995 c.618 §15a; 1997 c.46 §§9,10; 2011 c.595 §51]

      (2) If the defendant fails to pay the claim, demand a hearing, or demand a jury trial and comply with ORS 46.465 (3)(c), upon written request from the plaintiff the clerk shall enter a judgment against the defendant for the relief claimed plus the amount of the small claims filing fees and service expenses paid by the plaintiff and the prevailing party fee provided by ORS 20.190.

      (3) If the plaintiff fails within the time provided to file a formal complaint pursuant to ORS 46.465 (3)(a), the clerk shall dismiss the case without prejudice.

      (4) If the defendant appears at the time set for hearing but no appearance is made by the plaintiff, the claim shall be dismissed with prejudice. If neither party appears, the claim shall be dismissed without prejudice.

      (5) Upon good cause shown within 60 days, the court may set aside a default judgment or dismissal and reset the claim for hearing. [1971 c.760 §9; 1977 c.875 §6; 1985 c.496 §15; 1991 c.111 §6; 1995 c.618 §§8,8a; 1995 c.658 §51; 1997 c.46 §§12,13; 1999 c.84 §10; 2011 c.595 §52]

(1) In addition to any other award, the prevailing party shall be entitled to a judgment for the small claims filing fees and service expenses paid by the party and the prevailing party fee provided for in ORS 20.190 (1)(c) or (2)(b). The prevailing party may also be awarded prevailing party fees under ORS 20.190 (3). The award shall be paid or the property delivered upon such terms and conditions as the judge may prescribe.

      (2) The court may allow to the defendant a setoff not to exceed the amount of plaintiff’s claim, but in such case the court shall cause to be entered in the record the amount of the setoff allowed.

      (3) No attachment shall issue on any cause in the small claims department.

      (4) A judgment in the small claims department is conclusive upon the parties and no appeal may be taken from the judgment.

      (5) The clerk of the court shall keep a record of all actions, proceedings and judgments in the small claims department.

      (6) A judgment in the small claims department is a judgment of the circuit court. The clerk shall enter such judgment in the register of the circuit court in the manner provided by ORS 18.075. A judgment in the small claims department may create a lien as provided by ORS 46.488. Judgments that include money awards, as defined by ORS 18.005, are subject to ORS 18.042. [1971 c.760 §10; 1977 c.875 §7; 1985 c.540 §17; 1991 c.111 §7; 1995 c.618 §9; 1995 c.658 §52; 1997 c.801 §60; 1999 c.84 §8; 2003 c.576 §91]

 

      46.488 Lien effect of small claims judgments.

      (2) If a judgment is rendered in the small claims department in an amount of $3,000 or more, the clerk shall note in the register of the circuit court that the judgment creates a judgment lien if the judgment otherwise complies with the requirements of ORS chapter 18 for creating a judgment lien. A judgment creditor may create a lien for the judgment in other counties in the manner provided by ORS 18.152.

      (3) When a judgment is entered in the small claims department in an amount of $10 or more and less than $3,000, exclusive of costs or disbursements, a judgment creditor may at any time before expiration of judgment remedies for the judgment under ORS 18.180 create a judgment lien for the judgment by paying to the clerk of the court that entered the judgment the fees established under ORS 21.235 (1)(a) and requesting that the clerk of the court note in the register and in the judgment lien record that the judgment creates a judgment lien. Upon receipt of the fees and request for creating a judgment lien, the clerk shall note in the register that the judgment creates a judgment lien. Upon entry of the notation in the register, the judgment creates a lien as described in ORS 18.150, and a judgment creditor may create a lien for the judgment in other counties in the manner provided by ORS 18.152. [1997 c.801 §57; 1997 c.801 §58; 1999 c.195 §3; 1999 c.1095 §12; 2003 c.576 §92; 2003 c.737 §§77,78; 2007 c.339 §11; 2011 c.595 §119]

Notwithstanding the amendments to ORS 46.488 by section 58, chapter 801, Oregon Laws 1997, and by section 3 of this 1999 Act, any judgment entered in the small claims department of a circuit court before the effective date of this 1999 Act that was not docketed in the circuit court under the provisions of ORS 46.488 (1997 Edition) before the effective date of this 1999 Act may become a lien on real property only in the manner provided by ORS 46.488 (1997 Edition).

      (2) Any judgment docketed before the effective date of this 1999 Act, including judgments docketed under the provisions of ORS 46.488 (1997 Edition), that did not become a lien on real property by reason of failure of the judgment creditor to file a lien certificate with the court in the manner required by ORS 18.350 (4) to (9) (1997 Edition) shall automatically become a lien on real property to the extent described in ORS 18.350, as amended by section 1 of this 1999 Act, on January 1, 2000, and shall be considered in all respects as though the judgment had been docketed on January 1, 2000.
