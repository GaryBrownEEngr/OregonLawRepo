ORGANIZATION AND JURISDICTION

 

      51.010 Justice court defined; no terms of court; court always open for business. A justice court is a court held by a justice of the peace within the justice of the peace district for which the justice of the peace may be chosen. There are no particular terms of such court, but the same is always open for the transaction of business, according to the mode of proceeding prescribed for it.

 

      51.020 Justice of the peace districts; establishing and modifying boundaries; maximum number of districts. (1) The county court or board of county commissioners of every county may set off and establish, or modify the boundaries of, justice of the peace districts within the county. No more than six justice of the peace districts shall be set off or established or permitted to remain in existence within any county. Except in the counties of Baker, Crook, Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Morrow, Sherman, Tillamook and Wheeler, a justice of the peace district may not include any portion of the city that is the county seat for the county or any portion of a city in which a circuit court regularly holds court. In the counties of Baker, Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Morrow, Sherman, Tillamook and Wheeler, a justice of the peace district in existence on January 15, 1998, may include any portion of the city that is the county seat for the county, or any portion of a city in which a circuit court regularly holds court, until such time as the justice court ceases to provide judicial services within the county seat or city. If the justice court ceases to provide judicial services within the county seat or city, the district that includes portions of the county seat or city shall cease to exist and may not thereafter be reestablished.

      (2) At the time that the county court or board of county commissioners of a county sets off and establishes the boundaries of a justice of the peace district, the county court or board of county commissioners may require as a qualification for the office that a person serving as justice of the peace in the district be a member of the Oregon State Bar.

      (3) The prohibition of subsection (1) of this section on a justice of the peace district that includes any portion of the city that is the county seat for the county, or any portion of a city in which a circuit court regularly holds court, does not prevent a justice of the peace from conducting an arraignment for a person in custody in the city that is the county seat for the county, or in a city in which a circuit court regularly holds court, if the accusatory instrument for the offense was filed in the justice court and the offense was committed within the boundaries of the justice of the peace district. [Amended by 1965 c.568 §5; 1995 c.658 §53; 1997 c.801 §105; 1999 c.449 §1; 2011 c.420 §1; 2019 c.426 §2]

 

      51.025 Justice court as court of record. (1) Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, any justice court may become a court of record by:

      (b) The entry of an order by the Supreme Court acknowledging the filing of the declaration required under subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) Before a justice court may become a court of record, the governing body of the county in which the court is located must file a declaration with the Supreme Court that includes:

      (a) A statement that the justice court satisfies the requirements of this section for becoming a court of record;

      (b) The address and telephone number of the clerk of the justice court; and

      (c) The date on which the justice court will commence operations as a court of record.

      (3) The Supreme Court may not charge a fee for filing a declaration under subsection (2) of this section. Not later than 30 days after a declaration is filed under subsection (2) of this section, the Supreme Court shall enter an order acknowledging the filing of the declaration and give notice of the order of acknowledgment to the county and the public.

      (4) The county shall provide a court reporter or an audio recording device for each justice court made a court of record under this section.

      (5) The appeal from a judgment entered in a justice court that becomes a court of record under this section shall be as provided in ORS chapters 19 and 138 for appeals from judgments of circuit courts.

      (6) As a qualification for the office, the justice of the peace for any justice court that becomes a court of record must be a member of the Oregon State Bar.

      (7) A justice court may not become a court of record under the provisions of this section if the court is located within 50 driving miles of the circuit court for the county in which the justice court is located, measured by the shortest distance by public roads between the justice court and the circuit court. [1999 c.682 §1; 2007 c.330 §1]

 

      Note: Section 4, chapter 682, Oregon Laws 1999, provides:

      Sec. 4. Sections 1 (3) and 3 (3) of this 1999 Act [51.025 (3) and 221.342 (3)] do not affect the term of office of any justice of the peace or municipal judge serving on the effective date of an ordinance passed for the purpose of making a justice court or municipal court a court of record. Any justice of the peace or municipal judge elected or appointed after the effective date of the ordinance must, as a qualification for the office, be a member of the Oregon State Bar. [1999 c.682 §4]

 

      51.028 Justice court ceasing operation as court of record. (1) Any justice court that has become a court of record under ORS 51.025 may cease to operate as a court of record only if the governing body of the county in which the court is located files a declaration with the Supreme Court identifying the date on which the justice court will cease operation as a court of record. The date identified in the declaration may not be less than 31 days after the date the declaration is filed.

      (2) The Supreme Court may not charge a fee for filing a declaration under subsection (1) of this section. Not later than 30 days after a declaration is filed under subsection (1) of this section, the Supreme Court shall enter an order acknowledging the filing of the declaration and give notice of the order of acknowledgment to the county and the public.

      (3) The appeal from a judgment entered in a justice court after the date identified in a declaration filed under this section shall be as provided in ORS 53.005 to 53.125 and ORS chapter 157. [2007 c.330 §2]

Unless the agreement provides otherwise, and subject to the provisions of ORS 153.640 to 153.680, all fines, costs and forfeited security deposits collected shall be paid to the prosecuting city, and the city shall reimburse the county providing judicial services for expenses incurred under the agreement. The exercise of jurisdiction under such an agreement by a justice of the peace shall not constitute the holding of more than one office. [1989 c.679 §2; 1999 c.1051 §243; 2011 c.597 §120]

 

      51.040 [Amended by 1971 c.743 §312; 1979 c.777 §43; 1987 c.907 §13; repealed by 1999 c.605 §8 and 1999 c.1051 §42]
