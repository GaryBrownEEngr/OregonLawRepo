      55.065 Admission or denial of claim; request for jury trial. Within 14 days after the date of service of the notice and claim upon the defendant as provided in ORS 55.045:

      (1) If the defendant admits the claim, the defendant may settle it by:

      (a) Paying to the court the amount of the claim plus the amount of the small claims fee and service expenses paid by the plaintiff. The court shall pay to the plaintiff the amounts paid by the defendant.

      (b) If the claim is for recovery of specific personal property, delivering the property to the plaintiff and paying to the plaintiff the amount of the small claims fee and service expenses paid by the plaintiff.

      (2) If the defendant denies the claim, the defendant:

The request shall designate a mailing address to which a summons and copy of the complaint may be served by mail. Thereafter, the plaintiff’s claim will not be limited to the amount stated in the claim, though it must involve the same controversy. [1989 c.583 §6; 1995 c.227 §3]

 

      55.070 [Amended by 1957 c.6 §1; 1965 c.619 §29; 1973 c.393 §3; 1977 c.875 §14; 1977 c.877 §14a; 1979 c.284 §87; repealed by 1989 c.583 §11]

      (2) If the defendant asserts a counterclaim, the notice of the hearing time shall contain a copy of the counterclaim.

      (3) If the defendant claims the right to a jury trial, the court shall notify the plaintiff to file a formal complaint within 20 days following the mailing of such notice. The notice shall instruct the plaintiff to serve a summons and copy of the complaint by mail on the defendant at the designated address of the defendant. Proof of service of the summons and complaint copy may be made by certificate of the plaintiff or plaintiff’s attorney attached to the complaint prior to its filing. The plaintiff’s claim in such formal complaint is not limited to the amount stated in the claim filed in the small claims department but it must involve the same controversy. The defendant shall have 10 days in which to move, plead or otherwise appear following the day on which the summons and copy of the complaint would be delivered to the defendant in due course of mail. Thereafter, the cause shall proceed as other causes in the justice court, and costs and disbursements shall be allowed and taxed and fees not previously paid shall be charged and collected as provided in ORS 51.310 and 52.410 for other cases tried in justice court, except that the appearance fee for plaintiff shall be an amount equal to the difference between the fee paid by the plaintiff as required by ORS 51.310 (1)(c) and the fee required of a plaintiff by ORS 51.310 (1)(a).

      (4) If the defendant appears at the time set for hearing but no appearance is made by the plaintiff, the claim shall be dismissed with prejudice. If neither party appears, the claim shall be dismissed without prejudice.

      (5) Upon good cause shown within 60 days, the court may set aside a default judgment or dismissal and reset the claim for hearing. [1989 c.583 §9]

 

      55.080 Formal pleadings unnecessary; issuance of attachment, garnishment or execution; costs of execution taxable. No formal pleading, other than the claim and notice, shall be necessary. The hearing and disposition of all actions shall be informal, the sole object being to dispense justice between the litigants promptly. No attachment, garnishment or execution shall issue from the small claims department on any claim except as provided in this chapter. A prevailing party’s costs in securing and service of such execution shall be taxed against the other party and recoverable as part of the judgment. [Amended by 1971 c.179 §1; 1977 c.875 §15]

 

      55.090 Appearance by parties and attorneys; witnesses.

But the plaintiff and defendant may offer evidence in their behalf by witnesses appearing at the hearing, and the justice may informally consult witnesses or otherwise investigate the controversy and give judgment or make such orders as the justice deems right, just and equitable for the disposition of the controversy.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 9.320, a party that is not a natural person, state or any city, county, district or other political subdivision or public corporation in this state may appear as a party to any action in the department without appearance by attorney.

      (3) When spouses are both parties to an action, one spouse may appear on behalf of both spouses in mediation or litigation in the small claims department:

      (a) With the written consent of the other spouse; or

      (b) If the appearing spouse declares under penalty of perjury that the other spouse consents. [Amended by 1973 c.625 §4; 1987 c.158 §8; 1993 c.282 §3; 1997 c.808 §9; 2015 c.7 §4; 2017 c.268 §2]

      (2) If the amount of the counterclaim asserted by the defendant exceeds $10,000, the justice of the peace shall strike the counterclaim and proceed to hear and dispose of the case as though the counterclaim had not been asserted unless the defendant files with the counterclaim a motion requesting that the case be transferred from the small claims department to a court of appropriate jurisdiction and an amount to pay the costs of the transfer. After the transfer the plaintiff’s claim will not be limited to the amount stated in the claim filed with the justice of the peace, though it must involve the same controversy.

      (3)(a) If the amount or value of the counterclaim exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the justice court for a counterclaim and the defendant files a motion requesting transfer and an amount to pay the costs of transfer as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the case shall be transferred to the circuit court for the county in which the justice court is located and be governed as provided in ORS 52.320 for transfers to the circuit court. The justice court shall notify the plaintiff and defendant, by mail within 10 days following the order of transfer, of the transfer. The notice to the plaintiff shall contain a copy of the counterclaim and shall inform the plaintiff as to further pleading by the plaintiff in the court of appropriate jurisdiction.

      (b) Upon filing the motion requesting transfer, the defendant shall pay to the court of appropriate jurisdiction an amount equal to the difference between the fee paid by the defendant as required by ORS 51.310 (1)(c) and the appearance fee for a defendant in the court of appropriate jurisdiction. [1977 c.875 §22; 1981 s.s. c.3 §96; 1983 c.673 §8; 1985 c.367 §4; 1987 c.725 §4; 1987 c.829 §3; 1989 c.583 §7; 1995 c.658 §65; 1997 c.801 §109; 1999 c.84 §6; 2007 c.125 §6; 2011 c.595 §53a]

The judgment of the court shall be conclusive upon the plaintiff in respect to the claim filed by the plaintiff and upon the defendant in respect to a counterclaim asserted by the defendant. The defendant may appeal if dissatisfied in respect to the claim filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff may appeal if dissatisfied in respect to a counterclaim asserted by the defendant. A party entitled to appeal may, within 10 days after the entry of the judgment against the party, appeal to the circuit court for the county in which the justice court is located. If final judgment is rendered against the party appealing in the appellate court, that party shall pay, in addition to the judgment, an attorney’s fee to the other party in the sum of $10. Appeals from the small claims department shall only be allowed in cases in which appeals would be allowed if the action were instituted and the judgment rendered in the justice courts, as is provided by law. [Amended by 1977 c.875 §17; 1985 c.342 §10; 1995 c.658 §66]
