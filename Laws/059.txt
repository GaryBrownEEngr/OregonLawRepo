      (2) The request for approval shall be made by filing a registration statement, as provided in ORS 59.065, with a detailed statement of the plan.

All such persons shall have the right to appear at the hearing.

      (3) The director shall, after the hearing, consider the fairness of the terms and conditions of the plan, and, if the director finds that the plan is fair, just and equitable and free from fraud, shall approve it, subject to such conditions, limitations and restrictions as the director may impose. If the director finds that the plan is unfair, unjust or inequitable or not free from fraud, the director shall deny the request, and give notice of the denial, at the expense of the proponents, to all persons who were entitled to receive or received notice of the hearing.

      (2) The director may enter an order against the applicant, registrant or issuer under subsection (1) of this section if any partner, officer or director of an applicant, registrant or issuer, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant, registrant or issuer has been guilty of any act or omission which would be cause for denying, suspending or revoking the registration of an individual applicant, registrant or issuer, except:

      (a) This subsection shall not apply to subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section.

      (b) The director may not enter an order suspending or revoking a registration under this subsection, pursuant to subsection (1)(e) of this section, without 10 days’ prior written notice to the registrant. [1967 c.537 §12; 1989 c.197 §4]

      59.115 Liability in connection with sale or successful solicitation of sale of securities; recovery by purchaser; limitations on proceeding; attorney fees. (1) A person is liable as provided in subsection (2) of this section to a purchaser of a security if the person:

      (a) Sells or successfully solicits the sale of a security, other than a federal covered security, in violation of the Oregon Securities Law or of any condition, limitation or restriction imposed upon a registration or license under the Oregon Securities Law; or

      (b) Sells or successfully solicits the sale of a security in violation of ORS 59.135 (1) or (3) or by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (the buyer not knowing of the untruth or omission), and who does not sustain the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission.

      (2) The purchaser may recover:

      (a) Upon tender of the security, the consideration paid for the security, and interest from the date of payment equal to the greater of the rate of interest specified in ORS 82.010 for judgments for the payment of money or the rate provided in the security if the security is an interest-bearing obligation, less any amount received on the security; or

      (b) If the purchaser no longer owns the security, damages in the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender, less the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it and less interest on such value at the rate of interest specified in ORS 82.010 for judgments for the payment of money from the date of disposition.

Any person held liable under this section shall be entitled to contribution from those jointly and severally liable with that person.

      (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, a person whose sole function in connection with the sale of a security is to provide ministerial functions of escrow, custody or deposit services in accordance with applicable law is liable only if the person participates or materially aids in the sale and the purchaser sustains the burden of proof that the person knew of the existence of facts on which liability is based or that the person’s failure to know of the existence of such facts was the result of the person’s recklessness or gross negligence.

      (5) Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment.

      (6) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no action or suit may be commenced under this section more than three years after the sale.

      (2) The seller may recover:

      (a) Upon a tender of the consideration paid for the security, the security plus interest from the date of purchase equal to the greater of the rate of interest specified in ORS 82.010 for judgments for the payment of money, or the rate provided in the security if the security is an interest-bearing obligation;

UNIFORM TOD SECURITY REGISTRATION ACT

 

      59.535 Definitions for ORS 59.535 to 59.585. For the purposes of ORS 59.535 to 59.585, unless the context otherwise requires:

      (1) “Beneficiary form” means a registration of a security which indicates the present owner of the security and the intention of the owner regarding the person who will become the owner of the security upon the death of the owner.

      (2) “Devisee” means any person designated in a will to receive a disposition of real or personal property.

      (3) “Heirs” means those persons, including the surviving spouse, who are entitled under the statutes of intestate succession to the property of a decedent.

      (4) “Person” means an individual, a corporation, an organization or other legal entity.

      (5) “Personal representative” includes executor, administrator, successor personal representative, special administrator and persons who perform substantially the same function under the law governing their status.

      (6) “Property” includes both real and personal property or any interest therein and means anything that may be the subject of ownership.

      (7) “Register,” including its derivatives, means to issue a certificate showing the ownership of a certificated security or, in the case of an uncertificated security, to initiate or transfer an account showing ownership of securities.

      (8) “Registering entity” means a person who originates or transfers a security title by registration, and includes a broker maintaining security accounts for customers and a transfer agent or other person acting for or as an issuer of securities.

      (9) “Security” means a share, participation or other interest in property, in a business, or in an obligation of an enterprise or other issuer, and includes a certificated security, an uncertificated security and a security account.

      (10) “Security account” means:

      (a) A reinvestment account associated with a security, a securities account with a broker, cash, cash equivalents, interest, earnings or dividends earned or declared on a security in an account, a reinvestment account or a brokerage account, whether or not credited to the account before the owner’s death;

      (b) A cash balance or other property held for or due to the owner of a security as a replacement for or product of an account security, whether or not credited to the account before the owner’s death; or

      (c) An investment management account, a safekeeping account or a custody account with a financial institution or trust company, as those terms are defined in ORS 706.008, including the securities in the account and cash, cash equivalents, interest, earnings or dividends earned or declared on a security in the account, whether or not credited to the account before the owner’s death.

      (11) “State” includes any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any territory or possession subject to the legislative authority of the United States. [1991 c.306 §1; 2007 c.514 §1]

 

      59.540 Registration in beneficiary form; sole or joint tenancy ownership. Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties, or as owners of community property held in survivorship form, and not as tenants in common. [1991 c.306 §2]

 

      59.545 Registration in beneficiary form; applicable law. A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity’s principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner’s address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law. [1991 c.306 §3]

 

      59.550 Origination of registration in beneficiary form. A security, whether evidenced by certificate or account, is registered in beneficiary form when the registration includes a designation of a beneficiary to take the ownership at the death of the owner or the deaths of all multiple owners. [1991 c.306 §4]

 

      59.555 Form of registration in beneficiary form. Registration in beneficiary form may be shown by the words “transfer on death” or the abbreviation “TOD,” or by the words “pay on death” or the abbreviation “POD,” after the name of the registered owner and before the name of a beneficiary. [1991 c.306 §5]

 

      59.560 Effect of registration in beneficiary form. The designation of a TOD beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form has no effect on ownership until the owner’s death. A registration of a security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner or all then surviving owners without the consent of the beneficiary. [1991 c.306 §6]

 

      59.565 Ownership on death of owner. On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners. [1991 c.306 §7]

 

      59.570 Protection of registering entity. (1) A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form. If a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to the registering entity by ORS 59.535 to 59.585.

      (2) By accepting a request for registration of a security in beneficiary form, the registering entity agrees that the registration will be implemented on death of the deceased owner as provided in ORS 59.535 to 59.585.

      (3) A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs or devisees of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with ORS 59.565 and does so in good faith reliance on the registration, on ORS 59.535 to 59.585 and on information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary’s representatives, or other information available to the registering entity. The protections of ORS 59.535 to 59.585 do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from any claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form. No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under ORS 59.535 to 59.585.

      (4) The protection provided by ORS 59.535 to 59.585 to the registering entity of a security does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its value or proceeds. [1991 c.306 §8]

 

      59.575 Nontestamentary transfer on death. (1) A transfer on death resulting from a registration in beneficiary form is effective by reason of the contract regarding the registration between the owner and the registering entity and ORS 59.535 to 59.585, and is not testamentary.

      (2) ORS 59.535 to 59.585 do not limit the rights of creditors of security owners against beneficiaries and other transferees under other laws of this state. [1991 c.306 §9]

 

      59.580 Terms, conditions and forms for registration. (1) A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests for registrations in beneficiary form and for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries and substituting a named beneficiary’s descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary’s death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes.” This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary’s descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary’s domicile at the owner’s death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity’s terms and conditions.

      (2) The following are illustrations of registrations in beneficiary form which a registering entity may authorize:

      (a) Sole owner-sole beneficiary: John S. Brown TOD (or POD) John S. Brown Jr.

      (b) Multiple owners-sole beneficiary: John S. Brown Mary B. Brown JT TEN TOD John S. Brown Jr.

      (c) Multiple owners-primary and secondary (substituted) beneficiaries: John S. Brown Mary B. Brown JT TEN TOD John S. Brown Jr. SUB BENE Peter Q. Brown or John S. Brown Mary B. Brown JT TEN TOD John S. Brown Jr. LDPS. [1991 c.306 §10]

 

      59.585 Short title; rules of construction. (1) ORS 59.535 to 59.585 shall be known as and may be cited as the Uniform TOD Security Registration Act.

      (2) ORS 59.535 to 59.585 shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policy and to make uniform the laws with respect to the subject of ORS 59.535 to 59.585 among states enacting it.

      (3) Unless displaced by the particular provisions of ORS 59.535 to 59.585, the principles of law and equity supplement its provisions. [1991 c.306 §11]

A pretended purchase or sale of any stocks or bonds whereby, in whole or in part, no simultaneous change of ownership or interest therein is effected, is prima facie evidence of the violation of this section by the person taking part in the pretended purchase or sale.
