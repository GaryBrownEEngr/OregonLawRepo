      (b) A notice or communication may not be delivered by electronic transmission if:

      (A) The articles of incorporation or bylaws of a domestic corporation prohibit delivery by electronic consent;

      (B) The intended recipient of the notice or communication delivers an electronic notice revocation at least 30 days before the notice or communication is sent; or

      (C) The notice or communication is related to a revocation of dissolution under ORS 60.634.

      (c) A corporation that continues to deliver notices or communications by electronic transmission after an individual with responsibility for delivering the notices or communications received an electronic notice revocation or has actual knowledge of the failure described in paragraph (b) of this subsection does not by that continuation invalidate a meeting or action.

      (d) If an electronic transmission of a notice or communication fails as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the corporation that sent the notice or communication shall promptly use a method other than electronic transmission to deliver the notice or communication. A corporation’s failure to use a method of delivery other than electronic transmission does not by that failure invalidate a meeting or action.

      (D) Even if the recipient or an employee or agent of the recipient is not aware of the electronic transmission.

      (7)(a) A notice is effective only if the notice is communicated in a comprehensible form.

      (b) Unless a domestic or foreign corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise or unless a person who sends a notice or communication and the intended recipient of the notice or communication agree otherwise, the notice or communication is delivered and effective on the earliest of the following dates or times:

      (A) On the date and at the time the recipient actually receives a tangible copy of the notice or communication, or on the date and at the time the person that sends the notice or communication, or an agent of the person, leaves a tangible copy of the notice or communication at:

      (C) Five days after the person that sends the notice or communication, or an agent of the person, deposits the notice or communication in the United States mail, if the notice or communication is postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a recipient who is not a shareholder, except that if a person sends a notice or communication by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, the notice or communication is delivered and effective on the date on which the recipient actually received the notice or communication or on the date shown on the return receipt signed by the recipient or an agent of the recipient;

      (D) As provided in subsection (6)(a)(A) of this section, if a person sends the notice or communication by electronic transmission; or

      (E) On the date and at the time a person delivers the notice or communication to the recipient orally.

      (8) If this chapter requires a notice or communication in particular circumstances, the requirements in this chapter govern.

SHARES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

 

(Shares)

 

      60.131 Authorized shares. (1)(a) Articles of incorporation must prescribe the classes of shares and the number of shares of each class that a corporation may issue.

      (b) A corporation may not issue a document that entitles an unidentified individual or entity that possesses the document to a share in the corporation.

      (c) If the corporation may issue more than one class of shares, the articles of incorporation must prescribe a distinguishing designation for each class, and before shares of a class are issued, the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the class must be described in the articles of incorporation. All shares of a class must have preferences, limitations and relative rights identical to the preferences, limitations and relative rights of other shares of the same class except to the extent otherwise permitted by ORS 60.134 and 60.157.

      (2) If the articles of incorporation authorize only one class of shares, that class has unlimited voting rights and rights to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution. If the articles of incorporation authorize more than one class of shares, then one or more classes of shares must together have unlimited voting rights, and one or more classes of shares which may be the same class or classes as those with voting rights, must together be entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution.

      (3) The articles of incorporation may authorize one or more classes of shares that:

      (a) Have special, conditional or limited voting rights, or no voting rights, except to the extent prohibited by this chapter;

      (b) Are redeemable or convertible as specified in the articles of incorporation:

      (c) Entitle the holders to distributions calculated in any manner, including dividends that may be cumulative, noncumulative or partially cumulative; or

      (d) Have preference over any other class of shares with respect to distributions, including dividends and distributions upon the dissolution of the corporation.

      (4) The description of the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of share classes in subsection (3) of this section is not exhaustive. [1987 c.52 §33; 1989 c.4 §9; 1989 c.1040 §9; 2017 c.705 §13]

 

      60.134 Terms of class or series determined by board of directors. (1) If the articles of incorporation so provide, the board of directors may determine, in whole or part, the preferences, limitations and relative rights, subject to the requirements of ORS 60.131, of any class of shares before the issuance of any shares of that class or one or more series within a class before the issuance of any shares of that series.

      (2) Each series of a class must be given a distinguishing designation.

      (3) All shares of a series must have preferences, limitations and relative rights identical with those of other shares of the same series and, except to the extent otherwise provided in the description of the series, of those of other series of the same class.

      (4) Before issuing any shares of a class or series created under this section, the corporation must deliver to the office for filing, articles of amendment which are effective without shareholder action, that set forth:

      (a) The name of the corporation;

      (b) The text of the amendment determining the terms of the class or series of shares;

      (c) The date it was adopted; and

      (d) A statement that the amendment was duly adopted by the board of directors. [1987 c.52 §34; 1989 c.1040 §10]

 

      60.137 Issued and outstanding shares. (1) A corporation may issue the number of shares of each class or series authorized by the articles of incorporation. Shares that are issued are outstanding shares until they are reacquired, redeemed, converted or canceled.

      (2) The reacquisition, redemption or conversion of outstanding shares is subject to the limitations of subsection (3) of this section and ORS 60.177 and 60.181.

      (3) At all times that shares of the corporation are outstanding, one or more shares that together have unlimited voting rights and one or more shares that together are entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution must be outstanding. [1987 c.52 §35]

 

      60.140 [Repealed by 1953 c.549 §138]

 

      60.141 Fractional shares. (1) A corporation may:

      (a) Issue fractions of a share or pay in money the value of fractions of a share;

      (b) Arrange for disposition of fractional shares by the shareholders; and

      (c) Issue scrip in registered or bearer form entitling the holder to receive a full share upon surrendering enough scrip to equal a full share.

      (2) Each certificate representing scrip must be conspicuously labeled “scrip” and must contain the information required by ORS 60.161 (2).

      (3) The holder of a fractional share is entitled to exercise the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote, receive dividends and participate in the assets of the corporation upon liquidation. The holder of scrip is not entitled to any of these rights unless the scrip provides for them.

      (4) The board of directors may authorize the issuance of scrip subject to any condition considered desirable, including:

      (a) That the scrip will become void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date; and

      (b) That the shares for which the scrip is exchangeable may be sold and the proceeds paid to the scripholders. [1987 c.52 §36]

 

(Issuance of Shares)

 

      60.144 Subscription for shares before incorporation. (1) A subscription for shares entered into before incorporation is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement provides a longer or shorter period or all the subscribers agree to revocation.

      (2) The board of directors may determine the payment term of subscriptions for shares that were entered into before incorporation unless the subscription agreement specifies the payment term. A call for payment by the board of directors must be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.

      (3) Shares issued pursuant to subscriptions entered into before incorporation are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration specified in the subscription agreement.

      (4) If a subscriber defaults in payment of money or property under a subscription agreement entered into before incorporation, the corporation may collect the amount owed as any other debt. Alternatively, unless the subscription agreement provides otherwise, the corporation may rescind the agreement if the debt remains unpaid more than 20 days after the corporation sends a written demand for payment to the subscriber.

      (5) A subscription agreement entered into after incorporation is a contract between the subscriber and the corporation subject to ORS 60.147. [1987 c.52 §37; 2017 c.55 §7]

 

      60.147 Issuance of shares. (1) The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation.

      (2) The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed or other securities of the corporation.

      (3) Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. A record of action by the board of directors authorizing the issuance of shares for a specified consideration may be relied upon in concluding that shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

      (4) When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable.

      (5) The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note is paid or the benefits received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid or the benefits are not received, the shares placed in escrow or restricted and the distributions credited may be canceled in whole or in part. [1987 c.52 §38; 1989 c.1040 §11]

 

      60.150 [Repealed by 1953 c.549 §138]

 

      60.151 Liability of shareholders. (1) A purchaser from a corporation of its own shares is not liable to the corporation or its creditors with respect to the shares except to pay the consideration for which the shares were authorized to be issued or specified in the subscription agreement.

      (2) A shareholder of a corporation is not personally liable for the acts or debts of the corporation merely by reason of being a shareholder. [1987 c.52 §39]

 

      60.154 Share dividends. (1) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, shares may be issued pro rata and without consideration to the corporation’s shareholders or to the shareholders of one or more classes or series. An issuance of shares under this subsection is a share dividend.

      (2) Shares of one class or series may not be issued as a share dividend in respect to shares of another class or series unless the articles of incorporation so authorize, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class or series to be issued approve the issue or there are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be issued.

      (3) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend, the record date is the date the board of directors authorizes the share dividend.

      (4) For purposes of this section, a share dividend shall include a share split, other than a reverse share split. [1987 c.52 §40; 1989 c.1040 §12]

 

      60.157 Share rights, options, warrants and other equity compensation; designation by officers. (1) A corporation may issue rights, options or warrants for purchasing shares of the corporation.

The board shall also determine the form and content of the rights, options and warrants and the consideration for which the shares are to be issued.

      (2) Rights, options or warrants issued to the holders of all shares of any class do not conflict with the provisions of ORS 60.131 (1) if the terms and conditions of the rights, options or warrants include restrictions or conditions that:

      (a) Preclude or limit a person’s exercising, transferring or receiving rights, options or warrants if the person owns or offers to acquire a specified number or percentage of the outstanding stock or other securities of the corporation or any transferee of the person; or

      (b) Invalidate or void the rights, options or warrants that the person or a transferee holds.

      (3)(a) The board of directors may authorize one or more officers of the corporation to:

      (A) Designate recipients of rights, options, warrants or other equity compensation awards for purchasing or receiving shares; and

      (B) Determine, in accordance with amounts or limitations the board establishes, the number of, and the terms under which the recipient may receive, rights, options, warrants or other equity compensation awards.

      (b) An officer to whom the board gives the authority described in this subsection may not use the authority to designate the officer or other persons the board identifies as ineligible to receive the rights, options, warrants or other equity compensation awards described in this subsection. [1987 c.52 §41; 1989 c.4 §10; 2013 c.201 §1]

 

      60.160 [Repealed by 1953 c.549 §138]

 

      60.161 Form and content of certificates. (1) Shares may be but are not required to be represented by certificates. Unless this chapter or another statute expressly provides otherwise, shareholder rights and obligations are identical whether or not shares are represented by certificates.

      (a) The name of the issuing corporation and that the corporation is organized under the law of this state;

      (b) The name of the person to whom the share is issued; and

      (c) The number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, the certificate represents.

      (3) If the issuing corporation issues different classes of shares or different series within a class, the designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations applicable to each class, the variations in rights, preferences and limitations determined for each series and the authority of the board of directors to determine variations for future series must be summarized on the front or back of each certificate, or each certificate may state conspicuously on the front or back that the corporation will furnish the shareholder with this information on request in writing and without charge.

      (4) Each share certificate must be signed by two officers designated in the bylaws or by the board of directors. Each certificate may bear the corporate seal or a facsimile of the corporate seal.

      (5) If the person who signed a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate is nevertheless valid. [1987 c.52 §42; 2017 c.55 §8]

 

      60.164 Shares without certificates. (1) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors of a corporation may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series without certificates. The authorization does not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the corporation.

      (2) Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required on certificates by ORS 60.161 (2) and (3), and if applicable, ORS 60.167. [1987 c.52 §43]

 

      60.167 Restriction on transfer of shares and other securities. (1) The articles of incorporation, bylaws, agreements among shareholders or agreements between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.

      (2) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by ORS 60.164 (2). Unless so noted, a restriction is not enforceable against a person who has no knowledge of the restriction.

      (3) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is authorized:

      (a) To maintain the corporation’s status when it is dependent on the number or identity of its shareholders;

      (b) To preserve exemptions under federal or state securities law; or

      (c) For any other reasonable purpose.

      (4) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares may:

      (a) Obligate the shareholder first to offer the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively or simultaneously an opportunity to acquire the restricted shares;

      (b) Obligate the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively or simultaneously to acquire the restricted shares;

      (c) Require the corporation, the holders of any class of its shares or another person to approve the transfer of the restricted shares if the requirement is not manifestly unreasonable; or

      (d) Prohibit the transfer of the restricted shares to designated persons or classes of persons, if the prohibition is not manifestly unreasonable.

      (5) For purposes of this section, “shares” includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares. [1987 c.52 §44]

(Subsequent Acquisition of Shares by Shareholders and Corporation)

 

      60.174 Preemptive rights of shareholders. (1) Except to the extent limited or denied by this section or by the articles of incorporation, the shareholders of a corporation incorporated prior to June 15, 1987, shall have preemptive rights as defined in this section. By articles of amendment or restated articles filed after such date, a corporation may eliminate preemptive rights under this subsection by including in the articles of amendment or restated articles that “the corporation elects to waive preemptive rights,” or words of similar import, in which event this subsection shall no longer apply to the corporation.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation’s unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation so provide.

      (3) A statement included in the articles of incorporation that “the corporation elects to have preemptive rights,” or words of similar import, means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:

      (a) The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation’s unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.

      (b) A shareholder may waive the shareholder’s preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.

      (c) There is no preemptive right with respect to:

      (A) Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;

      (B) Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;

      (C) Shares authorized in articles of incorporation that are issued within six months from the effective date of incorporation; or

      (D) Shares sold other than for money.

      (d) Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class.

      (e) Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.

      (f) Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one year is subject to the shareholders’ preemptive rights.

      (4) For purposes of this section, “shares” includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares. [1987 c.52 §46; 1987 c.579 §3; 1991 c.883 §2]

 

      60.177 Corporation’s acquisition of its own shares. (1) A corporation may acquire its own shares and shares so acquired constitute authorized but unissued shares.

      (2) If the articles of incorporation prohibit the reissue of acquired shares, the number of authorized shares is reduced by the number of shares acquired, effective upon amendment of the articles of incorporation.

      (3) If pursuant to this section, the number of authorized shares is reduced, articles of amendment shall be adopted by the board of directors which may be without shareholder action and shall be delivered to the office for filing. The articles shall set forth:

      (a) The name of the corporation;

      (b) The reduction in the number of authorized shares, itemized by class and series; and

      (c) The total number of authorized shares, itemized by class and series, remaining after reduction of the shares.

      (4) For purposes of this section, if shares of one class or series of a corporation are converted into shares of another class or series of the corporation, the shares so converted shall be considered to have been acquired by the corporation. [1987 c.52 §47; 1993 c.403 §1]

 

(Distributions)

 

      60.181 Distributions to shareholders. (1) A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (3) of this section.

      (2) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than a date involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.

      (3) A distribution may be made only if, after giving it effect, in the judgment of the board of directors:

      (a) The corporation would be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; and

      (b) The corporation’s total assets would at least equal the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

      (4) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (3) of this section either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.

      (5) The effect of a distribution under subsection (3) of this section is measured:

      (a) In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares, as of the earlier of the date the money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation or the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;

      (b) In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and

      (c) In all other cases, as of the date a distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.

      (6) A corporation’s indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation’s indebtedness to its general unsecured creditors, unless the shareholder agrees to subordination or the corporation grants the shareholder a security interest or other lien against corporate assets to secure the indebtedness.

      60.210 [Repealed by 1953 c.549 §138]

 

      60.211 Action without meeting. (1)(a) Action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a shareholders’ meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the articles of incorporation may provide that action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a shareholders’ meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by shareholders having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote on the action were present and voted.

      (c) The action taken under this subsection must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, or by those shareholders taking action under paragraph (b) of this subsection, and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.

      (d) Action taken under paragraph (a) of this subsection is effective when the last shareholder signs the consent, unless the consent specifies an earlier or later effective date.

      (e) Action taken under paragraph (b) of this subsection is effective when the consent or consents bearing sufficient signatures are delivered to the corporation, unless the consent or consents specify an earlier or later effective date. An effective date specified under this paragraph may not be earlier than the effective date of the provision permitting action under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (2) If not otherwise determined under ORS 60.207 or 60.221, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first shareholder signs a consent under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) A consent signed under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.

      (4)(a) If this chapter requires that notice of proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by unanimous consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation must give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the proposed action at least 10 days before the action is taken.

      (b) If this chapter requires that notice of proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is taken as provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section, the corporation must give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the action promptly after the action is taken.

The notice given under this subsection must contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under this chapter, would have been required to be sent to those shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to those shareholders for action.

      (6) The fact that an action is taken by written consent without a meeting does not impair any rights a shareholder who does not consent to the action may have to dissent and obtain payment for the shareholder’s shares under ORS 60.551 to 60.594. A shareholder who consents to the action in writing is not entitled to receive payment for the shareholder’s shares under ORS 60.551 to 60.594. [1987 c.52 §52; 2001 c.315 §22]

 

      60.214 Notice of meeting.

      (5) Unless the bylaws require otherwise, if an annual or special shareholders’ meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under ORS 60.221, however, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given under this section to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.

      60.217 Waiver of notice. (1) A shareholder may at any time waive any notice required by this chapter, the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The waiver must be in writing, be signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes for filing with the corporate records.

      (2) A shareholder’s attendance at a meeting waives objection to:

      (a) Lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and

      (b) Consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. [1987 c.52 §54]

At the adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting originally held. [1989 c.1040 §18]

 

      60.220 [Repealed by 1953 c.549 §138]

 

      60.221 Record date. (1) The bylaws may fix or provide the manner of fixing the record date for one or more voting groups in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders’ meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other action. The record date must be the same for all voting groups. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board of directors of the corporation may fix a future date, or a later time on the date the board of directors fixes the record date, as the record date.

      (2)(a) A record date fixed under this section may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders.

      (b) A determination of shareholders must be made as of the close of business on the record date unless another time for making the determination is specified when the record date is fixed.

      (4) If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, the court may provide that the original record date continues in effect or the court may fix a new record date.

      (B) Ensure that a shareholder or proxy holder may participate by remote communication in an effective manner.

      (c) The corporation shall maintain a record of the vote or other action of a shareholder or proxy holder that participates in a shareholders’ meeting by remote communication.

The list must be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.

      (2) The shareholders’ list must be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation’s principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder, the shareholder’s agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of ORS 60.774 (3), to copy the list during regular business hours and at the shareholder’s expense during the period it is available for inspection.

      (3) The corporation shall make the shareholders’ list available at the meeting, and any shareholder, the shareholder’s agent or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

      (4) If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, the shareholder’s agent or attorney to inspect the shareholders’ list before or at the meeting or copy the list as permitted by subsection (2) of this section, on application of the shareholder, the circuit court of the county where a corporation’s principal office is located, or if the principal office is not in this state, where its registered office is or was last located, may enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction pursuant to ORCP 79 ordering the inspection or copying at the corporation’s expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete. The party initiating such a proceeding shall not be required to post an undertaking pursuant to ORCP 82 A.

      (c) Any other method allowed by law.

      (7) An authorization made irrevocable under subsection (5) of this section is revoked when the interest with which the authorization is coupled is extinguished.

      (9) Subject to ORS 60.237 and to any express limitation on the proxy’s authority appearing on the face of the authorization form or electronic transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy’s vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the authorization.

      (2) If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy authorization does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, may nevertheless accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy authorization and give the vote, consent, waiver or proxy authorization effect as the act of the shareholder if:

      (2) If the articles of incorporation or this chapter provide for voting by two or more voting groups on a matter, action on that matter is taken only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately as provided in ORS 60.241. Action may be taken by one voting group on a matter even though no action is taken by another voting group entitled to vote on the matter. [1987 c.52 §62; 1991 c.883 §5]

 

      60.247 Modification of quorum or voting requirements. (1) The articles of incorporation may provide for a lesser or greater quorum requirement for shareholders, or voting groups of shareholders, than is provided for by this chapter, but in no event shall a quorum for shareholders, or any voting group of shareholders, consist of less than one-third of the votes entitled to be cast on any matter by the shareholders, or voting group of shareholders. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater voting requirement for shareholders, or voting groups of shareholders, than is provided for by this chapter.

      (2) An amendment to the articles of incorporation that adds a greater quorum or voting requirement must meet the quorum requirement and be adopted by the vote and voting groups required to take action under the quorum and voting requirements then in effect. An amendment to the articles of incorporation that changes or deletes a greater quorum or voting requirement must meet the quorum requirement and be adopted by the vote and voting groups required to take action immediately prior to the change or deletion. [1987 c.52 §63; 1989 c.1040 §19]

 

      60.251 Voting for directors. (1) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

      (2) Shareholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for directors unless the articles of incorporation so provide.

      (3) A statement included in the articles of incorporation that “all shareholders are entitled to cumulate their votes for directors,” “a designated voting group of shareholders are entitled to cumulate their votes for director” or words of similar import means that the shareholders designated are entitled to multiply the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates. [1987 c.52 §64; 1993 c.403 §3]

 

(Voting Trusts and Agreements)

 

      60.254 Voting trusts. (1) One or more shareholders may create a voting trust and conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust which may include anything consistent with its purpose and transferring their shares to the trustee. When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and agreement to the corporation’s principal office.

      (2) A voting trust becomes effective on the date the first shares subject to the trust are registered in the trustee’s name. A voting trust is valid for not more than 10 years after its effective date unless extended under subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) All or some of the parties to a voting trust may extend it for additional terms of not more than 10 years each by signing an extension agreement and obtaining the voting trustee’s written consent to the extension. An extension is valid for 10 years from the date the first shareholder signs the extension agreement. The voting trustee must deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of beneficial owners to the corporation’s principal office. An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it. [1987 c.52 §65]

 

      60.257 Voting agreements. (1) Two or more persons may provide for the manner in which they will vote their shares by signing an agreement for that purpose. A voting agreement created under this section is not a voting trust subject to the provisions of ORS 60.254.

      (2) A voting agreement created under this section is specifically enforceable. [1987 c.52 §66]

 

(Derivative Proceedings)

 

      60.261 Derivative proceedings. (1) A person may not commence a proceeding in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation unless the person was a shareholder of the corporation when the transaction complained of occurred or unless the person became a shareholder through transfer by operation of law from one who was a shareholder at that time.

      (2) A complaint in a proceeding brought in the right of a corporation must allege with particularity the demand made, if any, to obtain action by the board of directors and either that the demand was refused or ignored or why a demand was not made. Whether or not a demand for action was made, if the corporation commences an investigation of the charges made in the demand or complaint, the court may stay any proceeding until the investigation is completed.

      (3) A proceeding commenced under this section may not be discontinued or settled without the court’s approval. If the court determines that a proposed discontinuance or settlement will substantially affect the interest of the corporation’s shareholders or a class of shareholders, the court shall direct that notice be given the shareholders affected.

      (4) For purposes of this section, “shareholder” includes a beneficial owner whose shares are held in a voting trust or held by a nominee on behalf of the beneficial owner. [1987 c.52 §67]

 

(Shareholder Agreements)

 

      60.265 Validity of shareholder agreements inconsistent with chapter; purposes; notice of agreement; effect on liability. (1) An agreement among the shareholders of a corporation entered into after December 31, 1993, that is inconsistent with one or more other provisions of this chapter is effective among the shareholders and the corporation, and binding on the board of directors, if the agreement complies with this section and it:

      (a) Restricts the discretion or powers of the board of directors;

      (b) Establishes who shall be directors or officers of the corporation or establishes their terms of office or manner of selection or removal;

      (c) Governs, in general or in regard to specific matters, the exercise or division of voting power by or between the shareholders and directors or by or among any of them, including use of weighted voting rights or director proxies;

      (d) Establishes the terms and conditions of any agreement for the transfer or use of property or the provision of services between the corporation and any shareholder, director, officer or employee of the corporation or among any of them; or

      (e) Requires dissolution of the corporation at the request of one or more of the shareholders or upon the occurrence of a specified event or contingency.

      (2) An agreement authorized by this section shall be:

      (a) Set forth:

      (A) In the articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement; or

      (B) In a written agreement that is signed by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement and is made known to the corporation;

      (b) Subject to amendment only by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise; and

      (c) Valid for 10 years, unless the agreement provides otherwise.

      (3) The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement required by ORS 60.164 (2). If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Any purchaser of shares who, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement shall be entitled to rescission of the purchase. A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares. An action to enforce the right of rescission authorized by this subsection must be commenced within the earlier of:

      (a) Ninety days after notice from the corporation or the seller to the purchaser of the existence of the agreement describing the rights of a purchaser without knowledge of the existence of the agreement, and stating that failure to timely exercise rescission rights will result in their termination;

      (b) One year after discovery of the existence of the agreement; or

      (c) Three years after the time of purchase of the shares.

      (4) An agreement authorized by this section shall cease to be effective when shares of the corporation are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System. If the agreement ceases to be effective for any reason and is contained or referred to in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, the board of directors may adopt, without shareholder action, an amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws to delete the agreement and any references to it.

      (5) An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement.

      (6) The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.

      (7) Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made. [1993 c.403 §12]

      60.311 Election of directors by certain classes of shareholders. If the articles of incorporation authorize dividing the shares into classes or series, the articles may also authorize the election of all or a specified number of directors by the holders of one or more authorized classes or series of shares.

      (2) The terms of all other directors expire at the next annual shareholders’ meeting following their election unless their terms are staggered under ORS 60.317.

      (3) A decrease in the number of directors does not shorten an incumbent director’s term.

      (2) If the terms of the directors are staggered, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders’ meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second annual shareholders’ meeting after their election and the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders’ meeting after their election. At each annual shareholders’ meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a term of two years or three years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.

      (3) If the corporation has cumulative voting, terms of directors may be staggered only if authorized by the articles of incorporation and each group of directors contains at least three members. [1987 c.52 §73; 1989 c.1040 §21; 2003 c.80 §11; 2005 c.92 §1]

      (2) If a director is elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the shareholders of that voting group may participate in the vote to remove the director.

      (3) If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the director’s removal. If cumulative voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove the director exceed the number of votes cast not to remove the director.

      (4) A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing the director and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director. [1987 c.52 §75]

 

      60.327 Removal of directors by judicial proceeding. (1) The circuit court of the county where a corporation’s principal office is located or if the principal office is not in this state where its registered office is or was last located, may remove a director of the corporation from office in a proceeding commenced either by the corporation or by its shareholders holding at least 10 percent of the outstanding shares of any class if the court finds that:

      (a) The director engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct or gross abuse of authority or discretion with respect to the corporation; and

      (b) Removal is in the best interest of the corporation.

      (2) The court that removes a director may bar the director from reelection for a period prescribed by the court.

      (3) If shareholders commence a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, they shall make the corporation a party defendant. [1987 c.52 §76]

      (a) The shareholders may fill the vacancy;

      (b) The board of directors may fill the vacancy; or

      (c) If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office.

      (2) If the vacant office is filled by the shareholders and was held by a director elected by a voting group of shareholders, then only the holders of shares of that voting group are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy.

      (3) A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, by reason of a resignation effective at later date under ORS 60.321 (2) or otherwise may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. [1987 c.52 §77]

The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by each director, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.

      (2) Action taken under this section is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies an earlier or later effective date.

      (3) A consent signed under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. [1987 c.52 §80]

      (2) A director’s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon the director’s arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting. [1987 c.52 §82]

 

      60.351 Quorum and voting. (1) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws requires a greater number or a lesser number as authorized under subsection (2) of this section, a quorum of a board of directors consists of:

      (b) If the corporation has a variable-range size board, a majority of the number of directors prescribed, or if no number is prescribed, a majority of the number in office immediately before the meeting begins.

      (b) The director’s dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or

(Standards of Conduct)

 

      60.357 General standards for directors. (1) A director shall discharge the duties of a director, including the duties as a member of a committee, in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.

      (2) In discharging the duties of a director, a director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:

      (a) One or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

      (b) Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert competence; or

      (c) A committee of the board of directors of which the director is not a member if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

      (3) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection (2) of this section unwarranted.

      (4) A director is not liable for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, if the director performed the duties of the director’s office in compliance with this section.

      (5) When evaluating any offer of another party to make a tender or exchange offer for any equity security of the corporation, or any proposal to merge or consolidate the corporation with another corporation or to purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all the properties and assets of the corporation, the directors of the corporation may, in determining what they believe to be in the best interests of the corporation, give due consideration to the social, legal and economic effects on employees, customers and suppliers of the corporation and on the communities and geographical areas in which the corporation and its subsidiaries operate, the economy of the state and nation, the long-term as well as short-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation, and other relevant factors. [1987 c.52 §85; 1989 c.4 §8]

 

      60.361 Conflict of interest. (1) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director’s interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:

      (a) The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;

      (b) The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or

      (c) The transaction was fair to the corporation.

      (2) For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if:

      (a) Another entity in which the director has a material financial interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or

      (b) Another entity of which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.

      (3) For purposes of subsection (1)(a) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. A transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (1)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection, voting as a single voting group. Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (2)(a) of this section may be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (1)(b) of this section. A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section. [1987 c.52 §86]

 

      60.364 Loans to directors. (1) Except as provided by subsection (3) of this section, a corporation may not lend money to or guarantee the obligation of a director of the corporation unless:

      (a) The particular loan or guarantee is approved by a majority of the votes represented by the outstanding voting shares of all classes, voting as a single voting group, excluding the votes of shares owned by or voted under the control of the benefited director; or

      (b) The corporation’s board of directors determines that the loan or guarantee benefits the corporation and either approves the specific loan or guarantee or a general plan authorizing the loans and guarantees.

      (2) The fact that a loan or guarantee is made in violation of this section does not affect the borrower’s liability on the loan.

      (3) This section does not apply to loans and guarantees authorized by statute regulating any special class of corporations. [1987 c.52 §87]

 

      60.367 Liability for unlawful distributions. (1) Unless the director complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in ORS 60.357, a director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of this chapter or the articles of incorporation is personally liable to the corporation for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating this chapter or the articles of incorporation.

      (2) A director held liable for an unlawful distribution under subsection (1) of this section is entitled to contribution:

      (a) From every other director who voted for or assented to the distribution without complying with the applicable standards of conduct described in ORS 60.357; and

      (b) From each shareholder for the amount the shareholder accepted knowing the distribution was made in violation of this chapter or the articles of incorporation. [1987 c.52 §88]

 

(Officers)

 

      60.371 Required officers. (1) A corporation has the officers described in its bylaws or appointed by the board of directors in accordance with the bylaws which shall include a president and a secretary.

      (2) A director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (3) Terminating a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or the equivalent of nolo contendere does not, of itself, determine that the director did not meet the standard of conduct described in this section.

      (a) A proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in which the director was adjudged liable to the corporation; or

      (b) Notwithstanding the prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a corporation may eliminate or impair a director’s right to indemnification if at the time the act or omission occurred the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws explicitly authorized the corporation to eliminate or impair the right after an act or omission occurs. [1987 c.52 §95; 2011 c.227 §1]

 

      60.394 Mandatory indemnification.

      (4)(a) A corporation that authorizes payments in accordance with subsection (3) of this section may not amend or rescind the articles of incorporation, bylaws or resolution that authorizes the payments so as to eliminate or impair a director’s right to payments after an act or omission occurs that subjects the director to a proceeding for which the director seeks payment.

      (b) Notwithstanding the prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a corporation may eliminate or impair a director’s right to payments if at the time the act or omission occurred the corporation’s articles of incorporation, bylaws or resolution explicitly authorized the corporation to eliminate or impair the right after an act or omission occurs. [1987 c.52 §97; 2011 c.227 §2; 2017 c.55 §14]

 

      60.401 Court-ordered indemnification. Unless the corporation’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director of the corporation who is a party to a proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice the court considers necessary may order indemnification if it determines:

      (1) The director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 60.394, in which case the court shall also order the corporation to pay the director’s reasonable expenses incurred to obtain court-ordered indemnification; or

      (2) The director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 60.391 or was adjudged liable as described in ORS 60.391 (4), whether the liability is based on a judgment, settlement or proposed settlement or otherwise. [1987 c.52 §98]

 

      60.404 Determination and authorization of indemnification. (1) A corporation may not indemnify a director under ORS 60.391 unless authorized in the specific case after a determination has been made that indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 60.391.

      (2) A determination that indemnification of a director is permissible shall be made:

      (a) By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

      (b) If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by a majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding. However, directors who are parties to the proceeding may participate in designation of the committee;

      (c) By special legal counsel selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection or, if a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the special legal counsel shall be selected by majority vote of the full board of directors, including directors who are parties to the proceeding; or

      (d) By the shareholders.

      (3) Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under subsection (2)(c) of this section to select counsel. [1987 c.52 §99]

 

      60.407 Indemnification of officers, employees and agents. Unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise:

      (1) An officer of the corporation is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 60.394, and is entitled to apply for court-ordered indemnification under ORS 60.401, in each case to the same extent as a director under ORS 60.394 and 60.401.

      (2) The corporation may indemnify and advance expenses under ORS 60.387 to 60.411 to an officer, employee or agent of the corporation to the same extent as to a director. [1987 c.52 §100]

The corporation may purchase and maintain the insurance even if the corporation has no power to indemnify the individual against the same liability under ORS 60.391 or 60.394. [1987 c.52 §101]

 

      60.414 Application of ORS 60.387 to 60.411. (1) The indemnification and provisions for advancement of expenses provided by ORS 60.387 to 60.411 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which directors, officers, employees or agents may be entitled under the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, any agreement, general or specific action of its board of directors, vote of shareholders or otherwise, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Specifically and not by way of limitation, a corporation shall have the power to make or agree to make any further indemnification, including advancement of expenses, of:

      (a) Any director as authorized by the articles of incorporation, any bylaws approved, adopted or ratified by the shareholders or any resolution or agreement approved, adopted or ratified, before or after such indemnification or agreement is made, by the shareholders, provided that no such indemnification shall indemnify any director from or on account of acts or omissions for which liability could not be eliminated under ORS 60.047 (2)(d); and

      (b) Any officer, employee or agent who is not a director as authorized by its articles of incorporation or bylaws, general or specific action of its board of directors or agreement. Unless the articles of incorporation, or any such bylaws, agreement or resolution provide otherwise, any determination as to any further indemnity under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with ORS 60.404.

      (2) If articles of incorporation limit indemnification or advance of expenses, any indemnification and advance of expenses are valid only to the extent consistent with the articles of incorporation.

      (3) ORS 60.387 to 60.411 do not limit a corporation’s power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director in connection with the director’s appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the director has not been made a named defendant or respondent to a proceeding. [1987 c.52 §102; 1991 c.883 §7]

      60.457 Effect of amendment. An amendment to articles of incorporation does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the corporation, a proceeding to which the corporation is a party or the existing rights of persons other than shareholders of the corporation.

(Judicial Appraisal of Shares)

If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.

      (2) The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the circuit court of the county where a corporation’s principal office is located, or if the principal office is not in this state, where the corporation’s registered office is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the registered office of the domestic corporation merged with or whose shares were acquired by the foreign corporation was located.

      (3) The corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding as in an action against their shares. All parties must be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.

      (4) The jurisdiction of the circuit court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (2) of this section is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the powers described in the court order appointing them, or in any amendment to the order. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.

      (5) Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for:

      (a) The amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter’s shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation; or

      (b) The fair value, plus accrued interest, of the dissenter’s after-acquired shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under ORS 60.584. [1987 c.52 §136]

 

      60.594 Court costs and counsel fees. (1) The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under ORS 60.591 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding payment under ORS 60.587.

      (2) The court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts of the respective parties in amounts the court finds equitable:

      (a) Against the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 60.561 to 60.587; or

      (b) Against either the corporation or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter.

      (3) If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amount awarded the dissenters who were benefited.

      (3) A corporation administratively dissolved continues the corporation’s corporate existence but may not carry on any activities except activities that are necessary or appropriate to wind up and liquidate the corporation’s business and affairs under ORS 60.637, and notify claimants under ORS 60.641 and 60.644.

      (A) The corporation filed articles of incorporation with fraudulent intent, with fraudulent information or in a manner that otherwise indicates fraud;

      (B) The corporation has continued to exceed or abuse the authority conferred upon the corporation by law; or

      (C) The corporation is a shell entity. For purposes of this subparagraph:

      (i) A court may find that a corporation is a shell entity if the court determines that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency; and

      (ii) The Attorney General may make a prima facie showing that a corporation is a shell entity by stating in an affidavit that:

      (I) The corporation did not provide a name or address required by the Secretary of State, or the name or address the corporation provided was false, fraudulent or inadequate;

      (II) The corporation’s articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep under ORS 60.771, or the corporation’s annual report is false, fraudulent or inadequate;

      (III) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, attempted to communicate with, or serve legal process upon, the corporation at the address or by means of other contact information the corporation provided to the Secretary of State, but the corporation failed to respond; or

      (IV) The Attorney General has other evidence that shows that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency.

      (b) In a proceeding by a shareholder in a corporation that has shares that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are regularly traded in a market maintained by one or more members of a national or affiliated securities association, if the court finds that:

      (A) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock and irreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered, or the business and affairs of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders generally, because of the deadlock;

      (B) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent;

      (B) The corporation has admitted in writing that the creditor’s claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent.

      (d) In a proceeding by the corporation to have the corporation’s voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision.

      (2) In addition to subjecting a corporation to dissolution under subsection (1)(a)(C) of this section, a finding that a corporation is a shell entity has the following effects:

      (a) A court may rebuttably presume that the corporation’s filings with the Secretary of State constitute a false claim, as defined in ORS 180.750, in any action the Attorney General brings against the corporation under ORS 180.760 and may award to the Attorney General reasonable attorney fees and the costs of investigation, preparation and litigation if the Attorney General prevails in the action; and

      (3) A corporation may affirmatively defend against an allegation that the corporation is a shell entity by showing that the corporation, within 60 days after receiving a request to provide or correct a name, address or other information required for a filing or in articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep or an annual report, or within 60 days after the date of a request to respond to a communication or service of process, provided or corrected the name, address or other information or responded to the communication or service of process.

      (A) Merge the benefit company with an entity that is not a benefit company, if the surviving entity would not be a benefit company;

      (2)(a) The articles of incorporation or articles of organization for a benefit company may identify a specific public benefit for the benefit company in addition to the purposes described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, a presumption of control shall not apply where a person holds voting shares in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing ORS 60.801 to 60.816 as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian or trustee for one or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of the corporation.

      (4)(a) “Control share acquisition” means the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by any acquiring person, including a member of an acquiring group, of ownership of, or the power to direct the voting of, voting shares of an issuing public corporation in a transaction that causes the total voting power of the acquiring person or any acquiring group of which the acquiring person is a member in the election of directors of the issuing public corporation to exceed one-fifth, one-third or one-half of the total voting power of all the voting shares.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, voting shares of an issuing public corporation acquired within 90 days of a control share acquisition by the acquiring person or members of the acquiring group making the control share acquisition shall be considered to have been acquired in the same control share acquisition.

      (c) For purposes of this subsection, a person who acquires voting shares in the ordinary course of business for the benefit of others in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing ORS 60.801 to 60.816 has ownership and voting power only of voting shares in respect of which that person would be able to exercise or direct the exercise of votes without further instruction from others.

      (d) For purposes of this subsection, if two or more persons enter into a binding agreement that is not immediately revocable with respect to the voting of their voting shares, in addition to those persons thereby becoming an acquiring group:

      (B) Any group of persons who thereby obtain the right to determine how any parties to the agreement must vote their shares shall collectively be deemed to be a separate acquiring person who has acquired the power to direct the voting of all voting shares held by such parties to the agreement. The group of persons shall include all parties to the agreement if all parties share in the decision or if the agreement specifies how the shares must be voted.

      (e) The acquisition of any voting shares of an issuing public corporation does not constitute a control share acquisition if the acquisition is consummated in any of the following circumstances:

      (A) At a time when the corporation was not subject to ORS 60.801 to 60.816.

      (B) Pursuant to a contract entered into at a time when the corporation was not subject to ORS 60.801 to 60.816.

      (F) Pursuant to a merger or plan of share exchange effected in compliance with ORS 60.470 to 60.501, if the issuing public corporation is a party to the agreement of merger or plan of share exchange.

      (G) Pursuant to a transfer of voting shares between or among affiliates or immediate family members unless the voting shares are control shares that have not had their voting rights restored under ORS 60.807.

      (H) In a transaction in which voting power is acquired solely by receipt of an immediately revocable proxy or by any other agreement or understanding that is not binding on the person transferring such voting power.

      (5)(a) “Control shares” means voting shares of an issuing public corporation that are acquired in a control share acquisition. “Control shares” does not include voting shares acquired in a control share acquisition that are subsequently transferred, or whose voting power is subsequently transferred, other than a transfer of voting power by termination of a binding voting agreement, to a person that is not an affiliate of the transferor or a member of an acquiring group of which the transferor is a member in a transaction that is not a control share acquisition. “Control shares” also does not include voting shares acquired in a control share acquisition whose voting power is subsequently transferred pursuant to the termination of a binding voting agreement if, assuming the parties to the agreement had never entered into the agreement but had been members of an acquiring group during the term of the agreement, the voting shares would not have been control shares.

      (b) If an acquiring person or any member of an acquiring group transfers control shares in a transaction that causes the control shares to cease to be control shares without reducing the total voting power of the acquiring person or acquiring group to less than one-fifth of the total voting power of all the voting shares, and within 90 days before or after such transfer the transferor or any member of an acquiring group of which the transferor is a member acquires ownership of, or the power to direct the voting of, any voting shares, all such voting shares up to the number of voting shares having total voting power equal to the total voting power of the control shares transferred shall be considered control shares.

      (B) Any officer of the issuing public corporation.

      (C) Any employee of the issuing public corporation who is also a director of the corporation.

      (8)(a) “Issuing public corporation” means a corporation incorporated or existing pursuant to the provisions of this chapter that has:

      (A) One hundred or more record or beneficial shareholders;

      (4) Upon request by any person, a corporation shall inform the person whether or not the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that ORS 60.801 to 60.816 do not apply to acquisitions of its voting shares. [1989 c.4 §2; 1991 c.7 §2]

      60.952 Court proceeding by shareholder in close corporation; conditions; court-ordered remedies; share purchase; expenses. (1) In a proceeding by a shareholder in a corporation that does not have shares that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are regularly traded in a market maintained by one or more members of a national or affiliated securities association, the circuit court may order one or more of the remedies listed in subsection (2) of this section if it is established that:

      (a) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock and irreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered, or the business and affairs of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders generally, because of the deadlock;

      (b) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent;

      (c) The shareholders are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired; or

      (d) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted.

      (2) The remedies that the court may order in a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section include but are not limited to the following:

      (a) The performance, prohibition, alteration or setting aside of any action of the corporation or of its shareholders, directors or officers or any other party to the proceeding;

      (b) The cancellation or alteration of any provision in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws;

      (c) The removal from office of any director or officer;

      (d) The appointment of any individual as a director or officer;

      (e) An accounting with respect to any matter in dispute;

      (f) The appointment of a custodian to manage the business and affairs of the corporation, to serve for the term and under the conditions prescribed by the court;

      (g) The appointment of a provisional director to serve for the term and under the conditions prescribed by the court;

      (h) The submission of the dispute to mediation or another form of nonbinding alternative dispute resolution;

      (i) The issuance of distributions;

      (j) The award of damages to any aggrieved party;

      (k) The purchase by the corporation or one or more shareholders of all of the shares of one or more other shareholders for their fair value and on the terms determined under subsection (5) of this section;

      (L) The retention of jurisdiction of the case by the court for the protection of the shareholder who filed the proceeding; or

      (m) The dissolution of the corporation if the court determines that no remedy specified in paragraphs (a) to (L) of this subsection or other alternative remedy is sufficient to resolve the matters in dispute. In determining whether to dissolve the corporation, the court shall consider among other relevant evidence the financial condition of the corporation but may not refuse to dissolve the corporation solely because it has accumulated earnings or current operating profits.

      (3) The remedies set forth in subsection (2) of this section shall not be exclusive of other legal and equitable remedies that the court may impose. Except as provided in this subsection, the shareholders of a corporation may, pursuant to an agreement described in ORS 60.265, agree to limit or eliminate any of the remedies set forth in subsection (2) of this section. The remedies set forth in subsection (2)(e), (j) and (m) of this section may not be eliminated.

      (4) In determining the appropriate remedies to order under subsection (2) of this section, the court may take into consideration the reasonable expectations of the corporation’s shareholders as they existed at the time the corporation was formed and developed during the course of the shareholders’ relationship with the corporation and with each other. The court shall endeavor to minimize the harm to the business of the corporation.

      (5)(a) If the court orders a share purchase, the court shall:

      (A) Determine the fair value of the shares, with or without the assistance of appraisers, taking into account any impact on the value of the shares resulting from the actions giving rise to a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section;

      (B) Consider any financial or legal constraints on the ability of the corporation or the purchasing shareholder to purchase the shares;

      (C) Specify the terms of the purchase, including, if appropriate, terms for installment payments, interest at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, subordination of the purchase obligation to the rights of the corporation’s other creditors, security for a deferred purchase price and a covenant not to compete or other restriction on the seller;

      (D) Require the seller to deliver all of the seller’s shares to the purchaser upon receipt of the purchase price or the first installment of the purchase price; and

      (E) Retain jurisdiction to enforce the purchase order by, among other remedies, ordering the corporation to be dissolved if the purchase is not completed in accordance with the terms of the purchase order.

      (b) The share purchase ordered under this subsection shall be consummated within 20 days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to dissolve and articles of dissolution are properly filed with the Secretary of State within 50 days after filing the notice with the court.

      (c) After the purchase order is entered and before the purchase price is fully paid, any party may petition the court to modify the terms of the purchase, and the court may do so if the court finds that the modifications are equitable.

      (d) Unless the purchase order is modified by the court, the selling shareholder shall have no further rights as a shareholder from the date the seller delivers all of the shareholder’s shares to the purchaser or such other date specified by the court.

      (e) If the court orders shares to be purchased by one or more other shareholders, in allocating the shares to be purchased by the other shareholders, unless equity requires otherwise, the court shall attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights and other designations, preferences, qualifications, limitations, restrictions and special or relative rights among the holders of the class or classes of shares and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes not participate in the purchase.

      (6) At any time within 90 days after the filing of a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, or at such time determined by the court to be equitable, the corporation or one or more shareholders may elect to purchase all of the shares owned by the shareholder who filed the proceeding for their fair value. An election to purchase under this subsection shall state in writing the amount that the electing party will pay for the shares. The following apply:

      (a) The election to purchase shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.

      (b) If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders. The notice shall state the name of the shareholder who filed the proceeding under subsection (1) of this section and the number of shares owned by that shareholder, the name of each electing shareholder and the number of shares owned by that electing shareholder and the amount that each electing shareholder will pay for the shares. The notice also must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares. Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the election to purchase not later than 30 days after the date of the notice to them or at such time as the court in its discretion may allow. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding under subsection (1) of this section and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless the shareholders otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs.

      (c) The court in its discretion may allow the corporation and shareholders to file an election to purchase the shares of the shareholder who filed the proceeding under subsection (1) of this section at a price higher than the amount previously offered. If the court does so, it shall allow other shareholders an opportunity to join in the election to purchase at the higher price in accordance with their proportionate ownership interest.

      (d) After an election to purchase has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding filed under subsection (1) of this section may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the shareholder who filed the proceeding sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholder’s shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit the discontinuance, settlement, sale or other disposition. In considering whether equity exists to approve any settlement, the court may take into consideration the reasonable expectations of the shareholders as referred to in subsection (4) of this section, including any existing agreement among the shareholders.

      (e) If, within 30 days of the filing of the latest election to purchase allowed by the court, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the shares of the shareholder who filed the proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.

      (f) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as described in paragraph (e) of this subsection, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceeding under subsection (1) of this section and shall, under subsection (5) of this section, determine the fair value and terms of purchase of the shares of the shareholder who filed the proceeding as of the day before the date on which the proceeding was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.

      (7) In any proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall allow reasonable compensation to the custodian, provisional director, appraiser or other such person appointed by the court for services rendered and reimbursement or direct payment of reasonable costs and expenses. Amounts described in this subsection shall be paid by the corporation. [2001 c.315 §60]
