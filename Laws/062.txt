      (1) A member, shareholder or director against the cooperative to enjoin any act or transfer of property to or by the cooperative. If the unauthorized acts or transfer sought to be enjoined are being, or are to be, performed or made pursuant to any contract to which the cooperative is a party, the court may, if all of the parties to the contract are parties to the proceeding and if it deems the same to be equitable, set aside and enjoin the performance of the contract, and in so doing may allow to the cooperative or to the other parties to the contract, as the case may be, compensation for the loss or damage sustained by either of them which may result from the action of the court in setting aside and enjoining the performance of the contract but anticipated profits to be derived from the performance of the contract shall not be awarded by the court as a loss or damage sustained.

      (2) A cooperative, its legal representative, or through its members or shareholders in a representative suit, against the officers or directors or former officers or directors of the cooperative.

      62.175 Capital stock; membership stock. (1) Any cooperative, including a cooperative which requires a membership fee rather than the holding of membership stock as a prerequisite of membership, has power to issue the number of shares of capital stock stated in its articles. Such shares may be divided into more than one class with such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights as shall be stated in the articles, except that capital stock as such shall have no voting power except as specifically authorized in this chapter.

      (2) The articles may require that members own one or more shares of membership stock, and may provide limitations on the issuance and transferability of such stock. Unless restricted by the articles, stock other than membership stock may be issued or transferred without limitation.

      (3) Shares having a par value may be issued for such consideration expressed in dollars, not less than the par value thereof, as shall be fixed from time to time by the board. Shares without par value, may be issued for such consideration expressed in dollars as may be fixed for such shares by the board.

      62.195 Voting by shareholders. (1) A shareholder may vote in person, by electronic means or by a proxy that the shareholder or the duly authorized attorney-in-fact of the shareholder executes in writing. A proxy is not valid after 11 months from the date of execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. The following provisions, relating to voting of shares, apply to shareholders of cooperatives and shares of the capital stock of cooperatives other than membership stock:

      (a) Shares standing in the name of another domestic or foreign cooperative may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of the cooperative may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of the cooperative may determine.

      (b) An administrator, executor, guardian or conservator holding shares may vote the shares, in person, by electronic means or by a proxy, without transferring the shares into the name of the administrator, executor, guardian or conservator. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, in person, by electronic means or by a proxy, but a trustee may not vote shares held by the trustee without transferring the shares into the trustee’s name.

      (c) Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by the receiver, and shares held by or under control of a receiver may be voted by the receiver without transferring the shares into the receiver’s name if an appropriate order of the court by which the receiver was appointed authorizes the receiver to vote the shares.

      (d) A shareholder whose shares are pledged may vote the shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee may vote the shares so transferred.

      (2) For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at meetings, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, the bylaws may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. The date must be not more than 50 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken. If a record date is not fixed by the bylaws, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed, or the date on which the resolution of the board of directors declaring such dividend is adopted, is the record date for such determination of shareholders. A determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting made under this subsection applies to any adjournment of that meeting.

      (3) As used in this section, “electronic means” means a method of voting that complies with ORS 84.001 to 84.061. [1957 c.716 §15; 1987 c.94 §81; 2016 c.2 §1]

      62.205 Subscription agreement for shares or agreement to pay a membership fee; default. (1) A subscription agreement for shares, including membership stock, of a cooperative, where the subscription is entered into before incorporation, or an agreement entered into before incorporation to pay a membership fee is irrevocable for six months unless:

      (a) Otherwise provided by the subscription agreement or the agreement to pay a membership fee; or

      (b) All subscribers or parties to all the agreements to pay a membership fee consent to the revocation.

      (2) If a subscriber defaults in payment of money or property under a subscription agreement entered into before incorporation, or if a party to an agreement to pay a membership fee defaults in the payment of money or property under an agreement to pay a membership fee entered into before incorporation, the cooperative may collect the amount owed as any other debt. Alternatively, unless the subscription agreement or agreement to pay a membership fee provides otherwise, the cooperative may rescind the agreement if the debt remains unpaid more than 20 days after the cooperative sends written demand for payment to the subscriber or the party. [1957 c.716 §16; 1995 c.195 §3]

 

      62.210 [Repealed by 1957 c.716 §76]

 

      62.215 Limitation of liability of members and shareholders. Except for debts lawfully contracted between a member or shareholder and the cooperative, no member or shareholder is liable for the acts or debts of the cooperative to an amount exceeding the sum remaining unpaid on the subscription of the member or shareholder for shares of the cooperative, and the sum remaining unpaid on such member’s membership fee if such fee is required by the cooperative.

      62.225 Dividends on capital stock. A cooperative organized with capital stock may pay a dividend upon capital stock as is authorized by its articles. A payment under this section shall not be made if the result of the payment would be to bring the value of the cooperative’s remaining assets below the aggregate of the cooperative’s indebtedness. [1957 c.716 §18; 1995 c.195 §5]

 

      62.230 [Repealed by 1957 c.716 §76]

 

      62.235 Recall, exchange or redemption of stock or other evidence of equity by cooperative. (1) Unless the articles provide otherwise, a cooperative may recall membership stock upon termination of membership, acquire, exchange, redeem, and reissue its own shares or other evidences of equity. Consideration paid for shares of membership stock recalled by the cooperative shall be the par value thereof and accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, except that if such shares have no par value the consideration paid therefor shall be the consideration in dollars for which the shares were issued plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The cooperative may set off obligations to it of the holder of membership stock or other stock or other evidence of equity, including capital credits or accounts representing capital credits. The cooperative shall have a continuing perfected security interest in the evidence of equity, capital credits or accounts representing capital credits to secure payment of any indebtedness, whenever incurred, owed to the cooperative by the holder. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the security interest shall take priority over all other perfected security interests. No such acquisition, recall or redemption of stock or other evidence of equity shall be made if the result thereof would be to bring the value of the remaining assets of the cooperative below the aggregate of its indebtedness. The articles may provide other limitations on the right of a cooperative to acquire, recall, exchange or redeem its shares or other evidences of equity.

      (2) When shares are acquired, recalled, exchanged or redeemed by the cooperative, such shares shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares. [1957 c.716 §14; 1993 c.428 §1]

      (2) When records showing ownership of membership in a cooperative or of a share or shares of membership or capital stock in a cooperative, or of the apportionment, distribution and payment of net proceeds or savings of the cooperative, or of any indebtedness or other equity interest in a cooperative, are missing and if the information which is missing is necessary to a proposed redemption of any of the items described in this subsection, the cooperative may give notice and redeem the items as follows:

      (a) The cooperative shall set aside an amount equal to the value of the items to be redeemed.

      (b) The cooperative shall give notice of the redemption to all owners of items of which the cooperative has knowledge.

      (c) If there are items the ownership of which is unknown to the cooperative, it shall publish notice of the redemption at least once a month for four months in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the registered office of the cooperative is located.

      (d) After the completion of the publication, any unclaimed outstanding items represented by the missing records may then be terminated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter dealing with unclaimed distributions, redemptions or proceeds. [1957 c.716 §19; 1995 c.195 §6]

 

      62.250 [Repealed by 1957 c.716 §76]

 

      62.251 Notice to directors, members and shareholders. (1) Notice under this chapter must be in writing unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws permit oral notice under specific circumstances.

      (3) A cooperative shall give a notice required under this chapter to the cooperative’s directors, members and shareholders in writing. A cooperative’s or foreign cooperative’s notice to a director, member or shareholder is effective, if the notice is in a comprehensible form:

      (a) Upon deposit in the United States mail, if the notice is mailed postpaid and is correctly addressed to the director’s, member’s or shareholder’s address, as shown in the cooperative’s current record of director, member and shareholder addresses; or

      (b) When communicated to the director, member or shareholder by electronic transmission using a method that the director, member or shareholder authorizes in writing.

      (4) Written notice to a cooperative, or foreign cooperative that is authorized to do business in this state under this chapter, may be addressed to the cooperative’s or foreign cooperative’s registered agent at the registered agent’s office or to an officer of the cooperative at the cooperative’s principal office or at the mailing address shown for the cooperative in the cooperative’s records.

      (5) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, written notice to a person other than a director, member or shareholder is effective:

      (a) When received;

      (b) Five days after deposit in the United States mail, as shown by the postmark on the notice, if the notice is mailed postpaid and correctly addressed; or

      (c) On the date shown on a return receipt, if the notice is sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested and if the addressee or a representative of the addressee signs the return receipt.

      (6) Oral notice is effective when communicated, if communicated in a comprehensible manner.

      (7)(a) To the extent that a section of this chapter prescribes notice requirements for particular circumstances that differ from the requirements set forth in this section, the notice requirements for the particular circumstances control over the notice requirements set forth in this section.

      (b) To the extent that the articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe notice requirements that are consistent with this section, the notice requirements in the articles of incorporation or bylaws control over the notice requirements set forth in this section. [2015 c.113 §2]

 

      62.255 Meetings of members. (1) Meetings of members may be held either within or without this state as may be provided in the bylaws, and in the absence of a bylaw provision such meetings shall be held at the principal place of business of the cooperative.

      (2) An annual meeting of the members shall be held at such time or within such time as may be provided in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not fix a time for such meeting, the annual meeting shall be held in each calendar year at such time as the board shall determine. Failure to hold the annual meeting at the designated time does not work a forfeiture or dissolution of the cooperative.

      (3) Special member meetings may be called by the president or the board; or the secretary shall call such a meeting upon the filing of a petition stating the business to be brought before the meeting signed by not less than 10 percent of the members of the cooperative.

      (4) Written or printed notice, stating the place, day and hour, and in case of a special member meeting the purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given to each member and each shareholder, if shareholders are entitled to vote at such meeting, either personally or by mail not less than seven or more than 30 days before the meeting by direction of the person calling the meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the member or shareholder at the address of the member or shareholder as it appears on the records of the cooperative with postage thereon prepaid. At any meeting at which the members are to be represented by delegates, notice to the members may be given by notifying the delegates and their alternates if any.

      (5) A cooperative may provide in its bylaws:

      (a) For the formation of districts and the holding of member meetings by districts and that elections of directors may be held at district meetings.

      (b) That district meetings may elect delegates who shall represent their districts in annual and special meetings of the members. Notice of district meetings shall be given in the same manner as prescribed in this section for member meetings. [1957 c.716 §20]

 

      62.260 [Repealed by 1957 c.716 §76]

 

      62.265 Voting by members. (1) Each member is entitled to one vote with respect to a matter that is subject to a vote at any member meeting, except that bylaws may authorize voting according to actual, estimated or potential patronage, or a combination of voting according to actual, estimated or potential patronage. Shares of stock do not have voting power except in the specific instances authorized by this chapter.

      (2) Members may not vote by proxy, except that a member that is a corporation, association or partnership may designate a representative to cast the member’s vote. In the absence of written notice that a member has designated a person other than a natural person to represent the member, the member’s principal officers may represent the member. If the bylaws of a cooperative provide for forming districts and electing delegates at district meetings to represent the districts in member meetings, such representation is not voting by proxy and the delegates shall cast the votes to which the members that the delegates represent are entitled on matters that mail ballots submitted to all members do not cover.

      (3)(a) If the bylaws so provide and a member consents, the board may submit to the member for a vote by written ballot or by electronic means any question, including the election of directors, that is subject to a vote at a member meeting. The ballot must be mailed or, if the member consents to receive a ballot by electronic means, communicated by electronic transmission, along with the notice of the meeting. The ballot may be cast if the member’s signature authenticates the ballot. A vote cast by this method must be counted as if the member were present and voting in person.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “electronic means” means a method of voting that complies with ORS 84.001 to 84.061.

      (4) The bylaws may set forth provisions with respect to the methods and procedures for voting that are consistent with this chapter. [1957 c.716 §21; 2015 c.113 §4; 2016 c.2 §2]

 

      62.270 [Repealed by 1957 c.716 §76]

 

      62.275 Quorum of members. (1) Those members present at any annual or special member meeting of a cooperative constitute a quorum at the meeting, unless the bylaws of that cooperative provide that a greater number constitutes a quorum.

      (2) Any action taken at a member meeting of a cooperative subsequent to December 31, 1953, and prior to January 1, 1958, which would have been effective except for the absence of a quorum shall be deemed effective in all respects if there were present at such meeting a quorum of members as provided in the bylaws of that cooperative which were in effect at the time of that meeting. [1957 c.716 §22]

 

      62.280 Board of directors. (1) The corporate powers of a cooperative shall be exercised by or under the authority of the board of directors, and the business and affairs of a cooperative shall be managed under the direction of the board of directors. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, each director, at all times during the director’s term of office, shall be a member or a representative of a member which is other than a natural person. Unless the bylaws otherwise provide, directors need not be residents of this state.

      (2) If authorized by the bylaws of the cooperative, a cooperative other than a telecommunications cooperative or electric cooperative may have one or more directors who are not members or representatives of members that are other than natural persons. A majority of the directors of a cooperative described in this subsection must be members or representatives of members that are not natural persons.

      (3) The bylaws may prescribe any other qualifications for directors and may provide that directors be from specified territorial districts. The bylaws may also provide that voting on the election of directors from specified territorial districts may be limited to members from the respective districts without the obligation to hold district meetings.

      (4) The number of directors of a cooperative shall be not less than three, unless the number of members of the cooperative is less than three. If the number of members of the cooperative is less than three, the number of directors shall not be less than the number of members of the cooperative. Subject to this limitation, the number of directors shall be fixed or determined by the bylaws, except as to the number constituting the initial board, which number shall be fixed by the articles.

      (5) Directors constituting the initial board named in the articles shall hold office until the first annual meeting of the members and until their successors are elected and take office. At that meeting and thereafter, directors shall be elected by the members in the manner and for the term of office, not to exceed three years, provided in the bylaws. Each director shall begin immediately to discharge the duties of director and, subject to resignation or removal, shall hold office for the term for which the director was elected and until a successor takes office.

      (6) A director may be removed upon a majority vote of all members voting in person thereon at a duly called member meeting if written reasons for removal of the director are included in the notice of the meeting and the director whose removal is sought has had an opportunity to answer the reasons at the meeting. The written statement of reasons for removal shall be filed with the minutes of the meeting. The bylaws may contain such other provisions for the removal of a director as may be consistent with the provisions of this subsection.

      (7) Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, any vacancy occurring in the board may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the board. The director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of the director’s predecessor in office. [1957 c.716 §23; 1981 c.542 §2; 1995 c.195 §7; 2007 c.336 §1]

 

      62.283 Standard of conduct for directors; permissible reliance on opinions and reports of others; limitation of liability. (1) A director shall discharge the duties of a director, including the duties as a member of a committee, in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the cooperative.

      (2) In discharging the duties of a director, a director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:

      (a) One or more officers or employees of the cooperative whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

      (b) Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert competence; or

      (c) A committee of the board of directors of which the director is not a member if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

      (3) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection (2) of this section unwarranted.

      (4) A director is not liable for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, if the director performed the duties of the director’s office in compliance with this section.

      (5) When evaluating any offer of another party to make a tender or exchange offer for any equity security of the cooperative or any proposal to merge or consolidate the cooperative with another corporation or cooperative or to purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all the properties and assets of the corporation or cooperative, the directors of the cooperative may, in determining what they believe to be in the best interests of the cooperative, give due consideration to the social, legal and economic effects on employees, customers and suppliers of the cooperative and on the communities and geographical areas in which the cooperative and its subsidiaries operate, the economy of the state and nation, the long term as well as short term interests of the cooperative and its members, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the cooperative, and other relevant factors. [1981 c.542 §3; 1995 c.195 §8]

 

      62.284 Director conflict of interest. (1) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the cooperative, other than in the ordinary course of business for which the cooperative is organized, whether or not on a patronage basis, in which a director of the cooperative has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the cooperative solely because of the director’s interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true:

      (a) The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors, and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;

      (b) The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the members entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or

      (c) The transaction was fair to the cooperative.

      (2) For purposes of this section, a director of the cooperative has an indirect interest in a transaction if:

      (a) Another entity in which the director has a material financial interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or

      (b) Another entity of which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the cooperative.

      (3) For purposes of subsection (1)(a) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. A transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director, unless only one director is authorized to serve pursuant to ORS 62.280. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (1)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the member votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. Any director who is a member who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and any votes by a member under the control of an entity described in subsection (2)(a) of this section may be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (1)(b) of this section. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section. [1995 c.195 §9]

 

      62.285 Meetings of board of directors. (1) Regular or special meetings of the board may be held either within or without this state.

      (2) Regular meetings of the board may be held with or without notice as prescribed in the bylaws. Special meetings of the board shall be held upon such notice as is prescribed in the bylaws. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

      (3) Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, the purposes of any meeting of the board need not be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting.

      (4) Unless a greater number is required in the bylaws, a majority of the number of directors fixed by or determined pursuant to the bylaws, or in the absence of a bylaw fixing the number of directors, then of the number stated in the articles, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Unless a greater number is required in the bylaws, an act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the board. [1957 c.716 §24]

 

      62.286 Loans to or guarantees for directors. (1) Except as provided by subsection (3) of this section, a cooperative may not lend money to or guarantee the obligation of a director of the cooperative unless:

      (a) The particular loan or guarantee is approved by a majority of the votes of all the members excluding the votes of any member who is a benefited director; or

      (b) The cooperative’s board of directors determines that the loan or guarantee benefits the cooperative and either approves the specific loan or guarantee or a general plan authorizing the loans and guarantees.

      (2) The fact that a loan or guarantee is made in violation of this section does not affect the borrower’s liability on the loan.

      (3) This section does not apply to loans and guarantees authorized by statute regulating any special class of cooperatives. [1995 c.195 §10]

 

      62.287 Directors’ meeting by conference telephone or similar communications equipment.

At least one principal officer must be a director of the cooperative. The manager of a cooperative may hold the office of president or any other office.

      (2) The bylaws may provide for a chairperson of the board of directors. The offices of chairperson and president may be combined in one person. However, notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a person who is not a director may not serve as chairperson of the board of directors.

      (a) Alleges in the complaint that the member or shareholder was a member or shareholder of record when any part of the transaction of which complained took place, or that the membership or stock thereafter devolved upon the member or shareholder by operation of law from a member or shareholder at such time.

      (b) Alleges in the complaint with particularity the efforts of the member or shareholder to secure from the board such action as desired. The member or shareholder shall further allege that the member or shareholder has either informed the cooperative or board in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each director or delivered to the cooperative or board a copy of the complaint proposed to be filed. The member or shareholder shall state the reasons for failure to obtain such action or the reasons for not making such effort.

      (4) In an action brought in the right of a cooperative by fewer than three percent of the members or by holders of less than three percent of any class of stock outstanding, the defendants may require the plaintiff to give security for the reasonable expenses of defending the action, including attorney fees.

      62.355 Cooperative contracts. (1) Contracts for any of the following purposes, whether contained in the bylaws or separately written, are valid when made between a cooperative and any member in which such member agrees to:

      (a) Sell, market or deliver to or through the cooperative or any facilities furnished by it, all or any specified part of products produced or to be produced either by the member or under the control of the member.

      (b) Authorize the cooperative or any facilities furnished by it to act for the member in any manner with respect to all or any specified part of such products.

      (c) Buy or procure from or through the cooperative or any facilities furnished by it, all or any specified part of goods or services to be bought or procured by the member.

      (d) Authorize the cooperative or any facilities furnished by it to act for the member in any manner in the procurement of goods or the procurement or performance of services.

      (2) The contract referred to in subsection (1) of this section may fix and require liquidated damages to be paid by the member to the cooperative in the event of breach of the contract by the member. Liquidated damages may be a percentage of the value or a specific amount per unit of the products, goods or services involved by the breach, or a specific sum.

      (3) Two or more cooperatives may contract and act in association, corporate or otherwise, to perform collectively any of their powers or purposes authorized by this chapter. [1957 c.716 §32]

 

      62.360 Recording cooperative contracts. (1) A cooperative may record any contract authorized by ORS 62.355 in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the member resides or in which products covered by that contract have been or are to be produced. If the cooperative has substantially uniform contracts with more than one member residing or producing such products in any county, it may, in lieu of recording the original contracts, record:

      (a) A true copy of the uniform contract; and

      (b) A sworn list or sworn lists of the names of members who have executed such contract and who reside or produce such products in that county, and the effective date of the contract as to each such member.

      (2) The county clerk shall record each such contract, and shall record alphabetically in the Cooperative Contract Record the name of each party to that contract. For recording such contract the fee is the same as for recording a contract under ORS 205.320.

      (3) Recording pursuant to this section shall operate as constructive notice to all persons of the existence and contents of the contract. Any right, title, interest or lien created as to the products covered by the contract subsequent to such recording is subject to the cooperative’s right, title or interest under that contract. If the member creates any mortgage upon or other security interest in any such products subsequent to such contract recording, and if the member and the mortgagee or secured party jointly notify the cooperative in writing of the existence and amount of the mortgage or other security interest, all payments which after such notice become due from the cooperative to that member by reason of the cooperative’s sale or other handling of those products shall be paid by the cooperative to the mortgagee or other secured interest until the amount of the mortgage or secured party has been paid, and the balance thereafter shall be paid to the member.

      (4) When a contract recorded under this section has been terminated in any manner, the cooperative shall give, upon demand, a statement of termination to the member party to the contract, who may record the statement in the office of the county clerk where the contract was originally filed or recorded. The county clerk shall record the termination and index the name of the member in the Cooperative Contract Record. A cooperative may record at any time in the office of the county clerk where the contract was originally filed or recorded, a sworn list of the names of all persons whose contracts have been terminated in any manner other than by expiration of their term, and the county clerk shall record the termination and index the name of each of those persons in the Cooperative Contract Record. The fee for recording and indexing a document under this section is the fee established in ORS 205.320. [1957 c.716 §33; 1965 c.632 §6; 1971 c.621 §12; 1975 c.607 §14; 1979 c.833 §15; 1981 c.835 §5; 1999 c.654 §3]

 

      62.365 Relief against breach or threatened breach of contract; penalty for interference. (1) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of a cooperative contract authorized by ORS 62.355, the cooperative is entitled to an injunction to prevent the breach or any further breach thereof, and to a judgment of specific performance thereof. Upon filing of a verified complaint showing the breach or threatened breach, and upon filing a sufficient bond, the cooperative is entitled to a temporary restraining order.

      (2) Any person who, with knowledge that a contract exists, induces or attempts to induce any member to breach the contract with the cooperative, or who in any manner aids a breach of the contract, is liable to the cooperative for damages caused by such interference. The cooperative is also entitled to an injunction to prevent any interference or further interference with the contract. [1957 c.716 §34; 2003 c.576 §324]

 

      62.370 Civil action for inducing breach of contract with cooperative or spreading false reports about cooperative. In addition to the remedies provided in ORS 62.365 (2), any person who knowingly and maliciously induces or attempts to induce any member of a cooperative to breach a contract of the member with the cooperative authorized by ORS 62.355, or who knowingly and maliciously spreads any false report about the finances or management of a cooperative is liable, in a civil action, to the cooperative aggrieved, in the penal sum of $500 for each offense. [1957 c.716 §72]

 

      62.410 [Repealed by 1957 c.716 §76]

 

      62.415 Apportionment and distribution of net proceeds or savings or net losses. (1) The net proceeds or savings of a cooperative shall be apportioned, distributed and paid periodically to those persons entitled to receive them, at such times and in such reasonable manner as the bylaws shall provide; except that net proceeds or savings on patronage of the cooperative by its members shall be apportioned and distributed among those members in accordance with the ratio which each member’s patronage during the period involved bears to total patronage by all members during that period. The bylaws may contain any reasonable provisions for the apportionment and charging of net losses. For the purposes of this section work performed as a member of a workers’ cooperative shall be deemed to be patronage of that cooperative.

      (2) The apportionment, distribution and payment of net proceeds or savings required by subsection (1) of this section may be in cash, credits, capital stock, certificates of interest, revolving fund certificates, letters of advice or written evidence of indebtedness or other equity interest issued by the cooperative or by any affiliated domestic or foreign cooperative association whether or not incorporated under this chapter.

      (3) Apportionment and distribution of its net proceeds or savings or net losses may be separately determined for, and be based upon patronage of, single or multiple pools, particular departments of the cooperative, or as to particular commodities, supplies or services, or such apportionment and distribution may be based upon classification of patronage according to the type thereof.

      (4) A cooperative may provide in its bylaws:

      (a) The minimum amount of any single patronage transaction; and

      (b) The minimum aggregate amount of patronage transactions by any patron during the fiscal year of the cooperative.

      (5) Any amount described in subsection (4) of this section shall be taken into account for the purpose of participation in allocation and distribution of net proceeds or savings or net losses under this section.

      (6) For the purposes of this section net proceeds or savings or net losses shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to cooperative corporations, and after deducting from gross proceeds or savings any dividends paid upon capital stock. [1957 c.716 §36; 1963 c.156 §2; 1995 c.79 §15; 1995 c.195 §12]

 

      62.420 [Repealed by 1957 c.716 §76]

 

      62.425 Unclaimed distribution, redemptions or payments. (1) Any distribution of net margins by a cooperative or any redemption of or payment based upon any indebtedness, capital stock of a cooperative or other equity interest which remains unclaimed four years after the date authorized for payment, redemption or retirement may be forfeited by the board. Any amount forfeited may revert to the cooperative, if, at least six months prior to the declared date of forfeiture, notice that the payment is available has been mailed to the last-known address of the person shown by the cooperative’s records to be entitled thereto or, if the address is unknown, is published as provided by ORS 62.245.

      (2) This section applies to payments authorized before or after January 1, 1958, except that this section does not authorize the forfeiture prior to January 1, 1959, of any right to any such amount which would not otherwise have been barred prior to January 1, 1959. [1957 c.716 §37; 1987 c.341 §1; 1995 c.195 §13]

 

      62.430 Payments in name of deceased owner of capital credits or retains in cooperative. (1) If authorized by the bylaws, a cooperative may pay the following persons up to $10,000 in redemption or refund of capital credits or retains recorded on the books and records of the cooperative in the name of a deceased owner thereof:

      (a) The surviving spouse of the deceased owner;

      (b) If there is no surviving spouse, the deceased owner’s surviving children 18 years of age or older;

      (c) If the deceased owner left no surviving spouse or surviving children 18 years of age or older, the deceased owner’s surviving parents; or

      (d) If there is no surviving spouse, surviving children 18 years of age or older or surviving parent, the deceased owner’s surviving brothers and sisters 18 years of age or older.

      (2) The affidavit of the person claiming payment shall:

      (a) State where and when the deceased owner died;

      (b) State that the total face value of the capital credits or retains of the deceased owner in the cooperative does not exceed $10,000 and that they are free and clear of any security interest or other lien or encumbrance;

      (c) Show the relationship of the affiant or affiants to the deceased owner;

      (d) Embody a promise to pay the expenses of last sickness, funeral expenses and just debts of the deceased owner out of the capital credits or retains to be redeemed or refunded to the full extent thereof if necessary, and to distribute any balance to those persons entitled thereto by law; and

      (e) State any other information deemed appropriate by the cooperative.

      (3) A cooperative is under no obligation to determine the relationship of the affiant to the deceased owner, or to determine other than from its books and records whether the deceased owner’s capital credits or retains are subject to a security interest or other lien or encumbrance. Payment made in good faith to the person making the affidavit is a full acquittance and release of the cooperative for the amount so paid.

      (4) A probate proceeding is not necessary to establish the right of the surviving spouse, surviving children, surviving parent or surviving brothers and sisters to obtain payment of the capital credits or retains as provided by this section. However, if a personal representative is appointed in an estate of a deceased member or patron whose capital credits or retains have been redeemed or refunded under this section, the person or persons signing the affidavit shall account for them to the personal representative.

      (5) Nothing in this section shall abrogate the rights of a cooperative set forth in ORS 62.235, and a cooperative’s right to set off from a deceased owner’s capital credits or retains any debts owed to the cooperative by the deceased owner. This section shall not require that redemption or refund of capital credits or retains be made in accordance with this section, or otherwise limit or affect the manner in which a cooperative may pay, redeem, refund, administer or distribute its net savings, or any retains thereof, capital credits or other equity interests, nor shall it be deemed or construed to impose any further obligation or liability on a cooperative in its payment or redemption of retains in excess of $10,000.

      (6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, if the cooperative’s books and records reflect that the deceased owner’s capital credits or retains are subject to a security interest or other encumbrance, the cooperative shall not be relieved of any liability arising from the security interest or the encumbrance if the redemption or refund of capital credits is made to the person making the affidavit under this section. [1995 c.195 §31; 1999 c.377 §1]

 

      62.435 Sale or other disposition of entire assets. (1) A sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of a cooperative’s property and assets, if made in the cooperative’s usual and regular course of business, may occur under terms and conditions and for consideration that consists in whole or in part of money or property, real or personal, including shares of any other cooperative, corporation or association, domestic or foreign, as the cooperative’s board authorizes. A sale, lease, exchange or other disposition in accordance with this subsection does not require authorization or consent from members or shareholders.

      (2) If a sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the cooperative’s property and assets, with or without goodwill, does not occur in the usual and regular course of the cooperative’s business, the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition may occur under terms and for consideration that consists, in whole or in part, of money or property, real or personal, including shares of any other cooperative, corporation or association, if the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition is authorized in the following manner:

      (a) The board shall adopt a resolution that recommends the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition and submits the recommendation to a vote at a meeting of members, which may be either an annual or a special meeting. If the cooperative has shareholders, the board shall submit the recommendation to a joint meeting of members and shareholders.

      (b) The board shall give written or printed notice to each member and to each shareholder within the time and in the manner provided in ORS 62.255 for giving notice of meetings of members. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the recommendation for the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition.

      (c) At the meeting, the members and shareholders may approve the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the cooperative’s property and assets and may fix, or may authorize the board to fix, any or all of the terms of and consideration for the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition by an affirmative vote of:

      (A) Two-thirds of all the members and two-thirds of all the shareholders of an electric cooperative that are entitled to vote;

      (B) A majority of all the members and a majority of all the shareholders of a telephone cooperative that are entitled to vote, unless the telephone cooperative’s bylaws require a greater number; or

      (C) A majority of all the members and a majority of all the shareholders of any other cooperative that are entitled to vote.

      (3) After the members and shareholders vote in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, the board nevertheless, in the board’s discretion, may abandon the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition subject to the rights of third parties under any contracts that relate to the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition, without further action or approval by members or shareholders. [1957 c.716 §48; 2015 c.113 §5]

At any reasonable time, any member or shareholder, or the agent or attorney of any member or shareholder, upon written notice stating the purposes thereof, may examine for any proper purpose any books or records pertinent to the purpose specified in the notice and may make extracts therefrom, all in accordance with any reasonable conditions prescribed by the board restricting the disclosure, dissemination or use by any member or shareholder, or any agent or attorney of any member or shareholder, of any information therein contained. The board may deny a request to examine books and records if the board determines that the purpose is not directly related to the business or affairs of the cooperative and is contrary to the best interests of the cooperative.

      (2) In any action or proceeding to enforce the rights of members or shareholders provided in this section, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. [1957 c.716 §31; 1981 c.897 §16; 1995 c.195 §14; 1995 c.618 §39]

 

      62.455 Annual report; form; effect of error; update of information. (1) A cooperative shall by the cooperative’s anniversary deliver to the office of the Secretary of State for filing an annual report that sets forth:

      (3) The Secretary of State shall mail the annual report form to any address shown for the cooperative in the current records of the office of the Secretary of State.

      (4) If an annual report does not contain the information this section requires, the Secretary of State shall notify the reporting cooperative in writing and return the report to the cooperative for correction.

      (b) This subsection applies only to a change that is not required to be made by an amendment to the articles of incorporation.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS

 

      62.462 Definitions for ORS 62.462 to 62.482. As used in ORS 62.462 to 62.482:

      (1) “Cooperative” includes any domestic or foreign predecessor entity of a cooperative in a merger or other transaction in which the predecessor’s existence ceased upon consummation of the transaction.

      (2) “Director” means an individual who is or was a director of a cooperative or an individual who, while a director of a cooperative, is or was serving at the cooperative’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic cooperative, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the cooperative’s request if the director’s duties to the cooperative also impose duties on or otherwise involve services by the director to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.

      (3) “Expenses” includes counsel fees.

      (4) “Liability” means the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement, penalty or fine, including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan or reasonable expenses incurred with respect to a proceeding.

      (5) “Officer” means an individual who is or was an officer of a cooperative or an individual who, while an officer of a cooperative, is or was serving at the cooperative’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic cooperative, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. An officer is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the cooperative’s request if the officer’s duties to the cooperative also impose duties on or include services by the officer to the employee benefit plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Officer” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of an officer.

      (6) “Party” includes an individual who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.

      (7) “Proceeding” means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal. [1995 c.195 §15]

 

      62.464 Authority to indemnify director; report to members. (1) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a cooperative may indemnify an individual against liability incurred in a proceeding to which the individual was made a party because the individual is or was a director if:

      (a) The conduct of the individual was in good faith;

      (b) The individual reasonably believed that the individual’s conduct was in the best interests of the cooperative, or at least was not opposed to the cooperative’s best interests; and

      (c) In the case of a criminal proceeding, the individual did not have reasonable cause to believe the individual’s conduct was unlawful.

      (2) A director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (3) Terminating a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or the equivalent of nolo contendere does not, of itself, determine that the director did not meet the standard of conduct described in this section.

      (4) A cooperative may not indemnify a director under this section in connection with:

      (a) A proceeding by or in the right of the cooperative in which the director was adjudged liable to the cooperative; or

On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice the court considers necessary may order indemnification if it determines:

      (1) The director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 62.466, in which case the court shall also order the cooperative to pay the director’s reasonable expenses incurred to obtain court-ordered indemnification; or

      (2) The director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 62.464 or was adjudged liable as described in ORS 62.464 (4), whether the liability is based on a judgment, settlement or proposed settlement or otherwise.

      (2) A determination that indemnification of a director is permissible shall be made:

      (a) By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

      (b) If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by a majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding. However, directors who are parties to the proceeding may participate in designation of the committee;

      (d) By the members.

      (3) Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under subsection (2)(c) of this section to select counsel.

      (2) The cooperative may indemnify and advance expenses under ORS 62.462 to 62.482 to an officer, employee or agent of the cooperative to the same extent as to a director. [1995 c.195 §21]

A cooperative may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual against liability asserted against or incurred by the individual who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the cooperative or who, while a director, officer, employee or agent of the cooperative, is or was serving at the request of the cooperative as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic cooperative, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

      (a) Any director as authorized by the articles of incorporation, any bylaws approved, adopted or ratified by the members or any resolution or agreement approved, adopted or ratified, before or after such indemnification or agreement is made, by the members, provided that no such indemnification shall indemnify any director from or on account of acts or omissions for which liability could not be eliminated under ORS 62.513 (4)(e); and

      (b) Any officer, employee or agent who is not a director as authorized by its articles of incorporation or bylaws, general or specific action of its board of directors or agreement. Unless the articles of incorporation, or any such bylaws, agreement or resolution provide otherwise, any determination as to any further indemnity under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with ORS 62.474.

      (2) If articles of incorporation limit indemnification or advance of expenses, any indemnification or advance of expenses is valid only to the extent consistent with the articles of incorporation.

      (3) ORS 62.462 to 62.482 do not limit a cooperative’s power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director in connection with the director’s appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the director has not been made a named defendant or respondent to a proceeding.

      (1) The cooperative shall proceed to collect its assets, convey and dispose of such of its properties as are not to be distributed in kind to its members or shareholders, pay, satisfy and discharge its liabilities and obligations and do all other acts required to liquidate its business and affairs, and, after paying or adequately providing for the payment of all its obligations, distribute the remainder of its assets either in cash or in kind, among the persons entitled to the same by law, the articles and the bylaws.

      (2) The cooperative, at any time during the liquidation of its business and affairs, may make application to a court of competent jurisdiction within the state and judicial subdivision in which the registered office or principal place of business of the cooperative is situated, to have the liquidation continued under the supervision of the court as provided in this chapter.

      62.685 Effect of filing articles of dissolution. When the Secretary of State has filed the articles of dissolution, the existence of the cooperative ceases, except for the purpose of suits, other proceedings and appropriate corporate action, including adopting a plan of merger, by members, shareholders, directors and officers as provided in this chapter.

      (B) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted.

      (b) In an action by a creditor:

      (A) When the claim of the creditor has been reduced to judgment and an execution thereon returned unsatisfied and it is established that the cooperative is insolvent; or

      (B) When the cooperative has admitted in writing that the claim of the creditor is due and owing and it is established that the cooperative is insolvent.

      (c) Upon application by a cooperative which has commenced voluntary dissolution proceedings as provided in this chapter, to have its liquidation continued under the supervision of the court.

      (d) When an action has been filed by the Attorney General to dissolve a cooperative and it is established that liquidation of its business and affairs should precede the entry of a judgment of dissolution.

      (2) Venue for a proceeding by the Attorney General to dissolve a corporation lies in Marion County.

      (4) The court during a receivership may redesignate the receiver a custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver, if doing so is in the best interests of the cooperative, its members, shareholders, creditors and any holders of other equity interest in the cooperative.
