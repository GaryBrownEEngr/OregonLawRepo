      (3) A corporate name shall be written in the alphabet used to write the English language but may include Arabic and Roman numerals and incidental punctuation.

      (4) Except as authorized by subsection (5) of this section, a corporate name shall be distinguishable upon the records of the Office of the Secretary of State from any other corporate name, professional corporate name, business corporate name, cooperative name, limited partnership name, business trust name, reserved name, registered corporate name or assumed business name of active record with the Office of the Secretary of State.

      (5) The corporate name need not satisfy the requirement of subsection (4) of this section if the applicant delivers to the Office of the Secretary of State a certified copy of a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that finds that the applicant has a prior or concurrent right to use the corporate name in this state.

      (6) The provisions of this section do not prohibit a corporation from transacting business under an assumed business name.

      (7) The provisions of this section do not:

      (2) If the Secretary of State finds that the corporate name applied for conforms to ORS 65.094, the Secretary of State shall reserve the name for the applicant for a 120-day period, following which the applicant may reapply for it on the same basis as other applicants.

      (3) A person may transfer the reservation of a corporate name to another person by delivering to the Office of the Secretary of State a notice of the transfer executed by the person for whom the name was reserved and specifying the name and address of the transferee. [1989 c.1010 §33]

      65.144 Differences in rights and obligations of members.

[1989 c.1010 §45]

 

      65.157 Creditor’s action against member.

      (2) All creditors of the corporation, with or without reducing their claims to judgment, may intervene in any creditor’s proceeding brought under subsection (1) of this section to reach and apply unpaid amounts due the corporation. Any or all members who owe amounts to the corporation arising from membership may be joined in such proceeding. [1989 c.1010 §46]

 

(Resignation and Termination)

 

      65.164 Resignation. (1) A member may resign at any time.

      (2) The resignation of a member does not relieve the member from any obligations the member may have to the corporation as a result of obligations incurred or commitments made prior to resignation. [1989 c.1010 §47]

 

      65.167 Termination, expulsion or suspension. (1) No member of a public benefit or mutual benefit corporation may be expelled or suspended, and no membership or memberships in such corporations may be terminated or suspended, except pursuant to a procedure that is fair and reasonable and is carried out in good faith.

      (2) A procedure is fair and reasonable when either:

      (a) The articles or bylaws set forth a procedure that provides:

      (A) Not less than 15 days’ prior written notice of the expulsion, suspension or termination and the reasons therefor; and

      (B) An opportunity for the member to be heard, orally or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension or termination by a person or persons authorized to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination or suspension not take place; or

      (b) It is fair and reasonable taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances.

      (3) Any written notice given by mail must be given by first class or certified mail sent to the last address of the member shown on the corporation’s records.

      (4) Any proceeding challenging an expulsion, suspension or termination, including a proceeding in which defective notice is alleged, must be commenced within one year after the effective date of the expulsion, suspension or termination.

      (5) A member who has been expelled or suspended, or whose membership has been suspended or terminated, may be liable to the corporation for dues, assessments or fees as a result of obligations incurred by the member prior to expulsion, suspension or termination.

      (3) No acquisition of memberships shall be made in violation of ORS 65.551 or 65.554. [1989 c.1010 §49]

 

(Derivative Suits)

 

      65.174 Derivative suits. (1) A proceeding may be brought in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by:

      (a) Any member or members having two percent or more of the voting power or by 20 members, whichever is less; or

      (b) Any director.

      (2) In any such proceeding, each member complainant shall have been a member when the transaction complained of occurred.

      (3) A complaint in a proceeding brought in the right of a corporation must allege with particularity the demand made, if any, to obtain action by the board of directors and either that the demand was refused or ignored or why a demand was not made. Whether or not a demand for action was made, if the corporation commences an investigation of the charges made in the demand or complaint, the court may stay any proceeding until the investigation is completed.

      (4) The complainants shall notify the Attorney General within 10 days after commencing any proceeding under this section if the proceeding involves a public benefit corporation or assets held in charitable trust by a mutual benefit corporation.

      (5) A proceeding commenced under this section may not be discontinued or settled without the court’s approval.

(Delegates)

 

      65.177 Delegates. (1) A corporation may provide in its articles or bylaws for delegates having some or all of the authority of members.

      (2) The articles or bylaws may set forth provisions relating to:

      (a) The characteristics, qualifications, rights, limitations and obligations of delegates including their selection and removal;

      (4) A special meeting of members may be held in or out of this state at the place stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws or at a place the board of directors specifies, provided that the board’s specification is not inconsistent with the bylaws.

      (2) If not otherwise determined under ORS 65.207 or 65.221, the record date for determining members entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first member signs the consent under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) A consent signed under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. [1989 c.1010 §55]

 

      65.214 Notice of meeting. (1) A corporation shall give notice consistent with its bylaws of meetings of members in a fair and reasonable manner.

      (3) Notice is fair and reasonable if:

      (a) The corporation notifies its members of the place, date and time of each annual, regular and special meeting of members no fewer than seven days, or if notice is mailed by other than first class or registered mail, no fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the meeting;

      (b) Consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the member objects to considering the matter when it is presented. [1989 c.1010 §57]

 

      65.221 Record date. (1) The bylaws may fix or provide the manner of fixing the record date in order to determine the members entitled to notice of a members’ meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other lawful action. A determination of members must be made as of the time of close of transactions on the record date unless another time for doing so is specified at the time the record date is fixed. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board of directors may fix a future date as the record date. If a record date is not fixed, then:

      (a) To determine the members entitled to notice of a members’ meeting, the record date is the day before the day on which first notice is mailed or otherwise transmitted to members in accordance with ORS 65.034, or if notice is waived, the day preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

      (b) To determine the members entitled to demand a special meeting, the record date is as set forth in ORS 65.204 (2).

      (c) To determine the members entitled to take action without a meeting, the record date is as set forth in ORS 65.211 (2).

      (d) To determine the members entitled to vote at a members’ meeting, the record date is the date of the meeting.

      (e) To determine the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect to any other lawful action, the record date is the day on which the board adopts the resolution that relates to the other action, or the 60th day before the date of the other action, whichever is later.

      (2) A record date fixed under this section may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action that requires a determination of members.

      (3) A determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at a membership meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date, which the board must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

      (4) If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, the court may provide that the original record date continues in effect or the court may fix a new record date. [1989 c.1010 §58; 2013 c.158 §28; 2013 c.274 §10]

 

      65.222 Action by written ballot.

      (a) Set forth each proposed action; and

      (b) Provide an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action.

      (3) Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section shall be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds any quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.

      (4) All solicitations for votes by written ballot shall:

      (a) Indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements;

      (b) State the percentage of approvals necessary to approve each matter other than election of directors; and

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, a written ballot may not be revoked. [1989 c.1010 §59]

 

(Voting)

 

      65.224 Members’ list for meeting; attorney fees. (1) A corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names, addresses and membership dates of all its members. If there are classes of members, the list must show the address and number of votes each member is entitled to vote at the meeting. The corporation shall prepare on a current basis through the time of the membership meeting a list of members, if any, who are entitled to vote at the meeting, but are not part of the main list of members.

      (2) The list of members must be available for inspection by any member for the purpose of communication with other members concerning the meeting, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation’s principal office or at a reasonable place identified in the meeting notice in the city or other location where the meeting will be held. A member, the member’s agent or the member’s attorney is entitled, on written demand setting forth a proper purpose, to inspect and, subject to the requirements of ORS 65.774 and 65.782, to copy the list at a reasonable time and at the member’s expense, during the period it is available for inspection.

      (3) The corporation shall make the list of members available at the meeting, and any member, the member’s agent or the member’s attorney is entitled to inspect the list for any proper purpose at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

      (4) If the corporation refuses to allow a member, the member’s agent or the member’s attorney to inspect the list of members before or at the meeting or copy the list as permitted by subsection (2) of this section, on application of the member, the circuit court of the county where the corporation’s principal office, or if the principal office is not in this state, where its registered office is or was last located, may enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction pursuant to ORCP 79 ordering the inspection or copying at the corporation’s expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this subsection. The party initiating such a proceeding shall not be required to post an undertaking pursuant to ORCP 82 A.

      (5) Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the membership list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.

      (6) The articles or bylaws of a religious corporation may limit or abolish the rights of a member under this section to inspect and copy any corporate record.

      (7) The articles of a public benefit corporation organized primarily for political or social action, including but not limited to political or social advocacy, education, litigation or a combination thereof, may limit or abolish the right of a member or the member’s agent or attorney to inspect or copy the membership list if the corporation provides a reasonable means to mail communications to the other members through the corporation at the expense of the member making the request.

      65.227 Voting entitlement of members. (1) Unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, each member is entitled to one vote on each matter on which the members vote, including each matter on which a member may vote under this chapter or the articles or bylaws. Except as expressly prohibited in this chapter, the articles or bylaws may provide for different allocations of votes among member classes or exclude the members or some or all member classes from voting on any issue on which they would otherwise be entitled to vote under this chapter. A person that does not retain a right to vote on more than one occasion to elect a director or directors is not a member.

      (2) Unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, if a membership stands of record in the names of two or more persons, with respect to voting the persons’ acts have the following effect:

      (a) If only one person votes, the person’s act binds all; and

      (b) If more than one person votes, the vote is divided on a pro rata basis.

      (3) If a class is entitled to vote as a class for directors, a determination of the voting power of the class must be based on the percentage of the number of directors the class may elect out of the total number of authorized directors. [1989 c.1010 §61; 1991 c.231 §3; 2013 c.158 §29; 2013 c.274 §11]

      (2) An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form.

      (3) An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member.

      (4) The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy’s authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment.

      (5) Appointment of a proxy is revoked by the person appointing the proxy:

      (a) Attending any meeting and voting in person; or

      (6) Subject to ORS 65.237 and any express limitation on the proxy’s authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy’s vote or other action as that of the member making the appointment. [1989 c.1010 §64]

 

      65.234 Adjournment. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a majority of votes represented at a meeting of members, whether or not a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time to a different time and place without further notice to any member of any adjournment, except as such notice may be required by ORS 65.214 (4). At the adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting originally held. [1989 c.1010 §68]

 

      65.237 Corporation’s acceptance of votes. (1) If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a member, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member.

      (2) If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the record name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member if:

      (a) The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity;

      (b) The name signed purports to be that of an attorney-in-fact of the member and if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory’s authority to sign for the member has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment;

      (d) In the case of a mutual benefit corporation:

      (A) The name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the member and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment; or

      (4) The corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section are not liable in damages to the member for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.

      (5) Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise. [1989 c.1010 §67]

 

      65.241 Quorum requirements. (1) Unless the articles or bylaws provide for a higher quorum, those votes represented at a meeting of members shall constitute a quorum.

      (3) An amendment to the articles or bylaws to increase the quorum required for any member action must be approved by the members. [1989 c.1010 §62]

 

      65.244 Voting requirements. (1) Unless this chapter, the articles or the bylaws require a greater vote or voting by class, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes represented and voting is the act of the members.

      (2) An amendment to the articles or bylaws to add to, change or delete the vote required for any member action must be approved by the members. [1989 c.1010 §63]

 

      65.247 Cumulative voting for directors. (1) If the articles or bylaws provide for cumulative voting by members, members may so vote, by multiplying the number of votes the members are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote, and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates.

      (2) Cumulative voting is not authorized at a particular meeting unless:

      (a) The meeting notice or statement accompanying the notice states that cumulative voting will take place; or

      (b) A member gives notice during the meeting and before the vote is taken of the member’s intent to cumulate votes, and if one member gives this notice all other members participating in the election are entitled to cumulate their votes without giving further notice.

      (3) A director elected by cumulative voting may be removed by the members without cause if the requirements of ORS 65.324 are met unless the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast or, if such action is taken by written ballot, all memberships entitled to vote were voted and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director’s most recent election were then being elected.

      (4) Members may not cumulatively vote if the directors and members are identical. [1989 c.1010 §65]

 

      65.251 Other methods of electing directors. A corporation may provide in its articles or bylaws for election of directors by members or delegates:

      (1) On the basis of chapter or other organizational unit;

[1989 c.1010 §70]

If a variable range is established, the number of directors may be fixed or changed periodically, within the minimum and maximum, by the members or the board of directors. If the articles of incorporation establish a fixed or a variable range for the size of the board of directors and the corporation has members entitled to vote for directors, then only the members may change the range for the size of the board or change from a fixed or a variable-range size board. [1989 c.1010 §72]

 

      65.311 Election, designation and appointment of directors.

      (2) If the corporation does not have members entitled to vote for directors, all the directors, except the initial directors, shall be elected, appointed or designated as provided in the articles or bylaws.

      65.314 Terms of directors generally. (1) The articles or bylaws may specify the terms of directors.

      (2) A decrease in the number of directors or term of office does not shorten an incumbent director’s term.

      (3) Except as provided in the articles or bylaws:

      (a) The term of a director filling a vacancy in the office of an elected director expires at the next election of directors; and

      (b) The term of a director filling any other vacancy expires at the end of the unexpired term which such director is filling.

      (4) Despite the expiration of a director’s term, the director continues to serve until the director’s successor is elected, designated or appointed and qualifies, or until there is a decrease in the number of directors. [1989 c.1010 §74]

 

      65.317 Staggered terms for directors. The articles or bylaws may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into groups. The terms of office of the several groups need not be uniform. [1989 c.1010 §75]

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, a director may be removed under subsection (1) or (2) of this section only if the number of votes cast to remove the director would be sufficient to elect the director at a meeting to elect directors.

      (4) If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes, or if the director was elected by a class, chapter, unit or grouping of members, the number of votes of that class, chapter, unit or grouping, sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the director’s removal.

      (5) An elected director may be removed by the members only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing the director and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director.

      (6) In computing whether a director is protected from removal under subsections (2) to (4) of this section, it should be assumed that the votes against removal are cast in an election for the number of directors of the class to which the director to be removed belonged on the date of that director’s election.

      (7) An entire board of directors may be removed under subsections (1) to (5) of this section.

      (8) A director elected by the board of directors may be removed with or without cause, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that directors may be removed only for cause, by the vote of two-thirds of the directors then in office or such greater number as is set forth in the articles or bylaws. However, a director elected by the board to fill the vacancy of a director elected by the members may be removed by the members, but not the board.

      (9) If at the beginning of a director’s term on the board, the articles or bylaws provide that the director may be removed for reasons set forth in the articles or bylaws, the board may remove the director for such reasons.

      (a) Limit the application of this section; and

      (b) Set forth the vote and procedures by which the board or any person may remove with or without cause a director elected by the members or the board. [1989 c.1010 §77]

      (a) The director engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct, or gross abuse of authority or discretion, with respect to the corporation, or the director has violated a duty set forth in ORS 65.357 to 65.367; and

      (b) Removal is in the best interest of the corporation.

      (2) The court that removes a director may bar the director from serving on the board for a period prescribed by the court.

      (3) If members or the Attorney General commence a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, the corporation shall be made a party defendant.

      (b) The board of directors may fill the vacancy; or

      (c) If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board of directors, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office.

      (2) Unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, if a vacant office was held by an appointed director, only the person who appointed the director may fill the vacancy.

      (3) If a vacant office was held by a designated director, the vacancy shall be filled as provided in the articles or bylaws. In the absence of an applicable article or bylaw provision, the vacancy may not be filled by the board.

      (4) A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, by reason of a resignation effective at a later date under ORS 65.321 (2) or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. [1989 c.1010 §80]

      (b) Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert competence;

      (c) A committee of the board of which the director is not a member, as to matters within its jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence; or

      (d) In the case of religious corporations, religious authorities and ministers, priests, rabbis or other persons whose position or duties in the religious organization the director believes justify reliance and confidence and whom the director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.

      (3) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection (2) of this section unwarranted.

      (4) A director is not liable to the corporation, any member or any other person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this section. The liability of a director for monetary damages to the corporation and its members may be eliminated or limited in the corporation’s articles to the extent provided in ORS 65.047 (2)(c).

      (5) A director shall not be deemed to be a trustee with respect to the corporation or with respect to any property held or administered by the corporation, including without limit, property that may be subject to restrictions imposed by the donor or transferor of such property. [1989 c.1010 §88]

 

      65.361 Director conflict of interest. (1) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director if the transaction is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into or is approved as provided in subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

      (2) A transaction in which a director of a public benefit or religious corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved:

      (a) By the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors if the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest are disclosed or known to the board of directors or committee of the board of directors; or

      (b) By obtaining approval of the:

      (A) Attorney General; or

      (B) The circuit court in an action in which the Attorney General is joined as party.

      (3) A transaction in which a director of a mutual benefit corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved:

      (a) In advance by the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors if the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors; or

      (b) If the material facts of the transactions and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction.

      (4) For the purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if:

      (a) Another entity in which the director has a material interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or

      (b) Another entity of which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction, and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.

      (5) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors or on the committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. A transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise approved as provided in subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

      (6) For purposes of subsection (3)(b) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by the members if it receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and votes cast by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (4) of this section may be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (3)(b) of this section. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

      (7) The articles, bylaws or a resolution of the board may impose additional requirements on conflict of interest transactions. [1989 c.1010 §89]

 

      65.364 Loans to or guarantees for directors and officers. (1) Public benefit and religious corporations may not make a loan, guarantee an obligation or modify a preexisting loan or guarantee to or for the benefit of a director or officer of the corporation, except as stated in this section. Unless prohibited by its articles or bylaws, a public benefit or religious corporation may make a loan, guarantee an obligation or modify a preexisting loan or guarantee to or for the benefit of a director or officer as part of a recruitment package, for a total period not to exceed three years, provided that:

      (2) A mutual benefit corporation may not lend money to or guarantee the obligation of a director of the corporation unless:

      (a) The particular loan or guarantee is approved by a majority of the votes of members entitled to vote, excluding the votes of members under the control of the benefited director; or

      (b) The corporation’s board of directors determines that the loan or guarantee benefits the corporation and either approves the specific loan or guarantee or a general plan authorizing the loans and guarantees.

      (3) The fact that a loan or guarantee is made in violation of this section does not affect the borrower’s liability on the loan. [1989 c.1010 §90; 1991 c.231 §6]

 

      65.367 Liability for unlawful distributions. (1) Unless a director complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in ORS 65.357, a director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of this chapter or the articles of incorporation is personally liable to the corporation for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating this chapter.

      (2) A director held liable for an unlawful distribution under subsection (1) of this section is entitled to contribution:

      (a) From every other director who voted for or assented to the distribution without complying with the applicable standards of conduct described in ORS 65.357; and

      (b) From each person who received an unlawful distribution for the amount of the distribution whether or not the person receiving the distribution knew it was made in violation of this chapter or the articles of incorporation. [1989 c.1010 §91]

 

      65.369 Liability of qualified directors. (1) The civil liability of a qualified director for the performance or nonperformance of the director’s duties shall be limited to gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

(Indemnification)

 

      65.387 Definitions for ORS 65.387 to 65.414. As used in ORS 65.387 to 65.414:

A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation’s request if the director’s duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, the director to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.

      (3) “Expenses” include attorney fees.

      (4) “Liability” means the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement, penalty, fine, including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan, or reasonable expenses actually incurred with respect to a proceeding.

      (5) “Officer” means an individual who is or was an officer of a corporation or an individual who, while an officer of a corporation, is or was serving at the corporation’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. An officer is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation’s request if the officer’s duties to the corporation also impose duties on or include services by the officer to the employee benefit plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Officer” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of an officer.

      (6) “Party” includes an individual who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.

      (7) “Proceeding” means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal. [1989 c.1010 §98]

 

      65.391 Authority to indemnify. (1) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a corporation may indemnify an individual against liability incurred in a proceeding to which the individual was made a party because the individual is or was a director if:

      (c) In the case of a criminal proceeding, the individual did not have reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the individual was unlawful.

      (2) A director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (3) Terminating a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or the equivalent of nolo contendere does not, of itself, determine that the director did not meet the standard of conduct described in this section.

      (4) A corporation may not indemnify a director under this section in connection with:

      (a) A proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in which the director was adjudged liable to the corporation; or

      (b) A proceeding that charged the director with and adjudged the director liable for improperly receiving a personal benefit.

      (5) Indemnification permitted under this section in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation is limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.

      (6)(a) A corporation that provides indemnification to a director in accordance with the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws may not amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws so as to eliminate or impair the director’s right to indemnification after an act or omission occurs that subjects the director to a proceeding or to liability for which the director seeks indemnification under the terms of the articles of incorporation or bylaws.

      (b) Notwithstanding the prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a corporation may eliminate or impair a director’s right to indemnification if at the time the act or omission occurred the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws explicitly authorized the corporation to eliminate or impair the right after an act or omission occurs. [1989 c.1010 §99; 2011 c.227 §5]

 

      65.394 Mandatory indemnification. Unless limited by its articles of incorporation, a corporation shall indemnify a director who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which the director was a party because of being a director of the corporation, against reasonable expenses actually incurred by the director in connection with the proceeding. [1989 c.1010 §100; 2005 c.22 §46]

 

      65.397 Advance for expenses. (1) A corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if:

      (3) An authorization of payments under this section may be made by provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, by a resolution of the members or board of directors or by contract.

      (4)(a) A corporation that authorizes payments in accordance with subsection (3) of this section may not amend or rescind the articles of incorporation, bylaws or resolution that authorizes the payments so as to eliminate or impair a director’s right to payments after an act or omission occurs that subjects the director to a proceeding for which the director seeks payment.

      (b) Notwithstanding the prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a corporation may eliminate or impair a director’s right to payments if at the time the act or omission occurred the corporation’s articles of incorporation, bylaws or resolution explicitly authorized the corporation to eliminate or impair the right after an act or omission occurs. [1989 c.1010 §101; 2011 c.227 §6]

 

      65.401 Court-ordered indemnification. Unless the corporation’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director of the corporation who is a party to a proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice the court considers necessary may order indemnification in the amount it considers proper if it determines:

      (1) The director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 65.394, in which case the court shall also order the corporation to pay the director’s reasonable expenses incurred to obtain court-ordered indemnification; or

      (2) The director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 65.391 (1) or was adjudged liable as described in ORS 65.391 (4), whether the liability is based on a judgment, settlement or proposed settlement or otherwise. [1989 c.1010 §102]

 

      65.404 Determination and authorization of indemnification. (1) A corporation may not indemnify a director under ORS 65.391 unless authorized in the specific case after a determination has been made that indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 65.391.

      (2) A determination that indemnification of a director is permissible shall be made:

      (a) By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

      (b) If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by a majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors, consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

      (c) By special legal counsel selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection or, if a quorum of the board cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the special legal counsel shall be selected by majority vote of the full board of directors including directors who are parties to the proceeding; or

      (d) By the members of a mutual benefit corporation, but directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not vote on the determination.

      (3) Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under subsection (2)(c) of this section to select counsel.

      (4) A director of a public benefit corporation may not be indemnified until 20 days after the effective date of written notice to the Attorney General of the proposed indemnification. [1989 c.1010 §103]

      (1) An officer of the corporation is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 65.394, and is entitled to apply for court-ordered indemnification under ORS 65.401 in each case, to the same extent as a director under ORS 65.394 and 65.401.

      (2) The corporation may indemnify and advance expenses under ORS 65.387 to 65.411 an officer, employee or agent of the corporation who is not a director to the same extent as to a director. [1989 c.1010 §104]

 

      65.411 Insurance. A corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual against liability asserted against or incurred by the individual who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or who, while a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic business or nonprofit corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The corporation may purchase and maintain the insurance even if the corporation has no power to indemnify the individual against the same liability under ORS 65.391 or 65.394. [1989 c.1010 §105]

 

      65.414 Application of ORS 65.387 to 65.411. (1) The indemnification and provisions for advancement of expenses provided by ORS 65.387 to 65.411 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which directors, officers, employees or agents may be entitled under the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, any agreement, general or specific action of its board of directors, vote of members or otherwise, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Specifically and not by way of limitation, a corporation shall have the power to make or agree to make any further indemnification, including advancement of expenses, of:

      (a) Any director as authorized by the articles of incorporation, any bylaws approved, adopted or ratified by the members or any resolution or agreement approved, adopted or ratified, before or after such indemnification or agreement is made, by the members, provided that no such indemnification shall indemnify any director from or on account of acts or omissions for which liability could not be eliminated under ORS 65.047 (2)(c); and

      (b) Any officer, employee or agent who is not a director as authorized by its articles of incorporation or bylaws, general or specific action of its board of directors or agreement. Unless the articles of incorporation, or any such bylaws, agreement or resolution provide otherwise, any determination as to any further indemnity under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with ORS 65.404.

      (2) If articles of incorporation limit indemnification or advance of expenses, any indemnification and advance of expenses are valid only to the extent consistent with the articles of incorporation.

      (3) ORS 65.387 to 65.411 do not limit a corporation’s power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director in connection with the director’s appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the director has not been made a named defendant or respondent to a proceeding.

      (4) A report of indemnification must be made in accordance with ORS 65.784. [1989 c.1010 §106; 1991 c.231 §9]

      (3) When effective, the reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on the corporation’s activities as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred.

      (4) The Secretary of State may waive the requirement under subsection (1) of this section that the corporation apply for reinstatement within five years after the date of administrative dissolution if the corporation requests the waiver and provides evidence of the corporation’s continued existence as an active concern during the period of administrative dissolution.

      (a) The receiver:

      (A) May dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court, provided, however, that the receiver’s power to dispose of the assets of the corporation is subject to any trust and other restrictions that would be applicable to the corporation; and

      (5) The court periodically during the receivership or custodianship may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the receiver or custodian and the receiver’s or custodian’s attorney from the assets of the corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets.

      (6) If applicable under ORS 37.040, the Oregon Receivership Code controls over conflicting provisions of this section. [1989 c.1010 §144; 2017 c.358 §47]

 

      65.671 Judgment of dissolution. (1) If after a hearing the court determines that one or more grounds for judicial dissolution described in ORS 65.661 exist, it may enter a judgment dissolving the corporation and specifying the effective date of the dissolution. The clerk of the court shall deliver a certified copy of the judgment to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing.

      (2) After entering the judgment of dissolution, the court shall direct the winding up and liquidation of the corporation’s affairs in accordance with ORS 65.637 and the notification of claimants in accordance with ORS 65.641 and 65.644. [1989 c.1010 §145; 2003 c.576 §329]

      65.674 Deposit with Department of State Lands. Assets of a dissolved corporation which should be transferred to a creditor, claimant or member of the corporation who cannot be found or who is not competent to receive them shall be reduced to cash unless they are subject to known trust restrictions and deposited with the Department of State Lands for safekeeping. However, in the discretion of the Director of the Department of State Lands, property of unusual historic or aesthetic interest may be received and held in kind. The receiver or other liquidating agent shall prepare in duplicate and under oath a statement containing the names and last-known addresses of the persons entitled to such funds. One of the statements shall be filed with the Department of State Lands and another shall be delivered to the Secretary of State for filing. The funds shall then escheat to and become the property of the State of Oregon and shall become part of the Common School Fund of the state. The owner, heirs or personal representatives of the owner, may reclaim any funds so deposited in the manner provided for estates which have escheated to the state. [1989 c.1010 §146]

      (2) If the foreign corporation does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State, within 45 days after notice is given, that each ground for revocation determined by the Secretary of State does not exist, the Secretary of State shall administratively revoke the foreign corporation’s authority, and in the case of a foreign corporation that would have been a public benefit corporation had it been incorporated in this state, shall notify the Attorney General in writing.

      (A) The corporation obtained its authority to transact business in this state through fraud;

      (B) The corporation has exceeded or abused the authority conferred upon it by law;

      (C) The corporation would have been a public benefit corporation had it been incorporated in this state and its corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted;

      (E) An incorporator, director, officer or agent of the corporation signed a document knowing it was false in any material respect with the intent that the document be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing; or

      (b) Except as provided in the articles or bylaws of a foreign corporation that would have been a religious corporation had it been incorporated in this state, in a proceeding by 50 members or members holding five percent or more of the voting power, whichever is less, or by a director or any person specified in the articles, if it is established that:

      (A) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, and the members, if any, are unable to break the deadlock;

      (B) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent;

      (C) The members are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired;

      (B) The corporation has admitted in writing that the creditor’s claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent.

      (2) Prior to revoking a corporation’s authority, the court shall consider whether:

      (a) There are reasonable alternatives to revocation of authority;

      (b) Revocation of authority is in the public interest, if the corporation is a foreign corporation that would have been a public benefit corporation had it been incorporated in this state; or

      (c) Revocation of authority is the best way to protect the interests of members, if the corporation is a foreign corporation that would have been a mutual benefit corporation had it been incorporated in this state. [1989 c.1010 §161]

 

      65.754 Procedure for judicial revocation of authority. (1) Venue for a proceeding by the Attorney General to revoke a foreign corporation’s authority lies in Marion County.

      (2) It is not necessary to make directors or members parties to a proceeding to revoke the authority of a corporation.

      (3) A court in a proceeding brought to revoke a corporation’s authority may issue injunctions, appoint a receiver or custodian pendente lite with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the corporate assets located in Oregon and carry on the corporation’s Oregon activities until a full hearing can be held.

      (4) A person other than the Attorney General who brings a revocation proceeding for a foreign corporation that would have been a public benefit or religious corporation had it been incorporated in this state, shall forthwith give written notice of the proceeding to the Attorney General who may intervene.

The clerk of the court shall deliver a certified copy of the judgment to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing.

      (2) The authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in Oregon ceases as of the date of the judgment of revocation.

      (3) The judgment of revocation of a foreign corporation’s authority to transact business in this state appoints the Secretary of State the foreign corporation’s agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time the foreign corporation was authorized to transact business in this state.

      (4) Revocation of a foreign corporation’s authority to transact business in this state terminates the authority of the registered agent of the corporation. [1989 c.1010 §163; 2003 c.576 §330]
