      (5) The corporate name need not satisfy the requirement of subsection (4) of this section if the applicant delivers to the Secretary of State a certified copy of a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that finds that the applicant has a prior or concurrent right to use the corporate name in this state.

      (6) The provisions of this section do not prohibit a corporation from transacting business under an assumed business name.

      65.137 No requirement for members. A corporation does not need to have members and does not have members unless the corporation’s articles of incorporation state that the corporation has members. [1989 c.1010 §41; 2019 c.174 §30]

 

(Members’ Rights and Obligations)

 

      65.144 Rights and obligations of members. (1) Unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, members of the corporation have the same rights and obligations. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may establish classes of membership with different rights or obligations.

A provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or a resolution the board of directors adopts to authorize or impose dues, assessments or fees does not, of itself, create liability to pay the obligation, but nonpayment may constitute grounds for expelling or suspending the member or suspending or terminating the membership without a hearing. [1989 c.1010 §45; 2019 c.174 §33]

 

      65.157 Creditor’s action against member.

      (2) All creditors of the corporation, with or without reducing their claims to judgment, may intervene in any creditor’s proceeding brought under subsection (1) of this section to reach and apply unpaid amounts due the corporation. Any or all members who owe amounts to the corporation arising from membership may be joined in such proceeding. [1989 c.1010 §46]

 

(Resignation and Termination)

 

      65.164 Resignation. (1) A member may resign at any time.

      65.167 Termination, expulsion or suspension. (1) A member of a public benefit corporation or mutual benefit corporation may not be expelled or suspended, and a membership or memberships in such corporations may not be terminated or suspended, except in accordance with a procedure that is fair and reasonable and is carried out in good faith.

      (b) Provides an opportunity not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension or termination for the member to be heard, orally or in writing by a person or persons authorized to withdraw the proposed expulsion, termination or suspension.

      (3) Any proceeding challenging an expulsion, suspension or termination, including a proceeding in which defective notice is alleged, must be commenced within one year after the effective date of the expulsion, suspension or termination.

      (4) A member who has been expelled or suspended, or whose membership has been suspended or terminated, may be liable to the corporation for dues, assessments or fees as a result of obligations incurred by the member before expulsion, suspension or termination.

      (3) An acquisition of memberships may not be made in violation of ORS 65.551 or 65.554. [1989 c.1010 §49; 2019 c.174 §35]

Whether or not a demand for action was made, if the corporation commences an investigation of the charges made in the demand or complaint, the court may stay any proceeding until the investigation is completed.

      (4) The complainants shall notify the Attorney General within 10 days after commencing any proceeding under this section if the proceeding involves a public benefit corporation or religious corporation or assets held in charitable trust by a mutual benefit corporation.

      (5) A proceeding commenced under this section may not be discontinued or settled without the court’s approval. If the court determines that a proposed discontinuance or settlement will substantially affect the interest of the corporation’s members or a class of members, the court shall direct that notice be given the members affected.

      (2) The court may fix the time and place of the meeting, determine the members entitled to participate in the meeting, specify a record date for determining members entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting, prescribe the form and content of the meeting notice, fix the quorum required for specific matters to be considered at the meeting or direct that the votes represented at the meeting constitute a quorum for action on those matters, and enter other orders necessary to accomplish the purpose or purposes of the meeting.

      (3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this section.

      (b) The court may not award attorney fees to the state or a political subdivision of the state if the state or political subdivision prevails in an action under this section.

      (4) The request must be set for hearing at the earliest possible time and must take precedence over all matters, except matters of the same character and hearings on preliminary injunctions under ORCP 79 B(3). A court may not issue an order under this section without notice to the corporation at least five days in advance of the time specified for the hearing unless the court fixes a different period in the order. [1989 c.1010 §54; 1995 c.696 §14; 2019 c.174 §39; 2019 c.325 §24a]

 

      65.211 Action without meeting. (1) Unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws specify that a members’ meeting is necessary to take an action, action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a members’ meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the members entitled to vote on the action. The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by all the members entitled to vote on the action, and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Action taken under this section is effective when the last member signs the consent, unless the consent specifies an earlier or later effective date. If in taking an action without a meeting the corporation complies with the requirements of ORS 65.212, the requirements in this subsection that all members entitled to vote on the action must take the action and must sign a written consent describing the action do not apply.

      (2) If not otherwise determined under ORS 65.207 or 65.221, the record date for determining members entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first member signs the consent under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) A consent signed under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as a meeting vote in any document. [1989 c.1010 §55; 2019 c.174 §40]

 

      65.212 Use of electronic mail or other electronic means to discuss issues or take action. (1) Unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise:

      (a) The corporation’s board of directors may, without a meeting, use electronic mail or other electronic means to take action that this chapter otherwise requires or permits the board of directors to take at a board of directors’ meeting if the corporation complies with this section.

      (b) The board of directors may, without complying with all of the requirements of this section, use electronic mail to discuss, but not take action on, an issue that comes before the board.

      (2)(a) Before taking an action under subsection (1) of this section, a corporation shall send to the electronic mail address that each director provided to the corporation for receiving communications from the corporation an electronic mail announcement that states that the board of directors will take the action.

      (b) The electronic mail announcement the corporation sends under paragraph (a) of this subsection must include a description of the matter on which the board of directors will take action. The electronic mail announcement must specify a deadline of not less than 48 hours after the time the corporation sends the announcement in which a director may record the director’s vote.

      (c) The corporation shall include the electronic mail announcement described in this subsection and a record of the directors’ votes in the minutes for the directors’ meeting or shall file the announcement and record of the directors’ votes in documents that reflect the action that the board took.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a corporation’s board of directors may not use electronic mail or other electronic means to take action if the corporation does not have a record of an electronic mail address for a director.

      (4) A director may change the director’s vote at any time before the deadline set forth in the electronic mail announcement described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) An affirmative vote of the majority of the directors who hold office at the time the board of directors takes an action by means of electronic mail or by other electronic means is an act of the board, unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws require an affirmative vote of a greater number of directors. The board’s action under this subsection has the effect of a meeting vote and the corporation may describe the action as a meeting vote in any document.

      (6) The board of directors’ action under subsection (5) of this section is effective on the deadline specified in the electronic mail announcement described in subsection (2) of this section, unless the announcement specifies a different effective date or time. [2019 c.174 §4]

 

      65.214 Notice of meeting. (1) A corporation shall give notice of membership meetings in a fair and reasonable manner that is consistent with the corporation’s bylaws. The corporation must give notice to members entitled to vote at the meeting and to any other person specified in this chapter, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.

      (2) Any notice that conforms to the requirements of subsection (3) of this section is fair and reasonable, but other means of giving notice may also be fair and reasonable when all the circumstances are considered, provided, however, that notice of matters referred to in subsection (3)(b) of this section must be given as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) Notice is fair and reasonable if:

      (a) The corporation notifies the corporation’s members of the place, date and time of each meeting in accordance with ORS 65.034 no fewer than seven days before the meeting;

      (b) Notice of an annual or regular meeting includes a description of any matter or matters that the members must approve under ORS 65.361, 65.404, 65.414 (1)(a), 65.437, 65.464, 65.487, 65.534 or 65.624; and

      (c) Notice of a special meeting includes a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

      (4) Unless the bylaws require otherwise, if a meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place, if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under ORS 65.221, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given under this section to the persons who are members as of the new record date. [1989 c.1010 §56; 1991 c.231 §2; 2019 c.174 §41]

 

      65.217 Waiver of notice. (1) A member may at any time waive any notice required by this chapter, the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The waiver must be in writing, be signed by the member entitled to the notice and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.

      (2) A member’s attendance at a meeting waives objection to:

      (a) Lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the member at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and

      (b) Consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the member objects to considering the matter when the matter is presented. [1989 c.1010 §57; 2019 c.174 §42]

 

      65.221 Record date. (1) The bylaws may fix or provide the manner of fixing the record date in order to determine the members entitled to notice of a members’ meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other lawful action. A determination of members must be made as of the time of close of transactions on the record date unless another time for doing so is specified at the time the record date is fixed. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board of directors may fix a future date as the record date. If a record date is not fixed, then:

      (a) To determine the members entitled to notice of a members’ meeting, the record date is the day before the day on which first notice is mailed or otherwise transmitted to members in accordance with ORS 65.034, or if notice is waived, the day preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

      (b) To determine the members entitled to demand a special meeting, the record date is as set forth in ORS 65.204 (2).

      (c) To determine the members entitled to take action without a meeting, the record date is as set forth in ORS 65.211 (2).

      (d) To determine the members entitled to vote at a members’ meeting, the record date is the date of the meeting.

      (e) To determine the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect to any other lawful action, the record date is the day on which the board adopts the resolution that relates to the other action, or the 60th day before the date of the other action, whichever is later.

      (2) A record date fixed under this section may not be more than 70 days before the meeting or action that requires a determination of members.

      (3) A determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at a membership meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date, which the board must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

      (4) If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, the court may provide that the original record date continues in effect or the court may fix a new record date. [1989 c.1010 §58; 2013 c.158 §28; 2013 c.274 §10]

 

      65.222 Action by written ballot. (1) Unless prohibited or limited by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, any action that may be taken at any annual, regular or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the corporation delivers a written ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter.

      (2) A written ballot must:

      (a) Set forth each proposed action; and

      (b) Provide an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action.

      (3)(a) Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section is valid only when:

      (A) The number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds any quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action; and

      (B) The number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.

      (b) For the purposes of this subsection, the number of votes cast by ballot constitutes a quorum if the number of members who attend a meeting constitutes a quorum.

      (4) All solicitations for votes by written ballot must:

      (a) Indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements;

      (b) State the percentage of approvals necessary to approve each matter other than election of directors; and

      (c) Specify a reasonable time by which a ballot must be received by the corporation in order to be counted.

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a written ballot may not be revoked. [1989 c.1010 §59; 2019 c.174 §43]

 

(Voting)

 

      65.224 Members’ list for meeting; attorney fees. (1) A corporation shall prepare and maintain a list of the names, contact information and membership dates of all of the corporation’s members. If there are classes of members, the list must also show the contact information for each member and number of votes each member may cast at a meeting of members.

      (2) The list of members must be available for inspection by any member for the purpose of communication with other members concerning the meeting, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation’s principal office or at a reasonable place identified in the meeting notice in the city or other location where the meeting will be held. A member, the member’s agent or the member’s attorney is entitled, on written demand setting forth a proper purpose, to inspect and, subject to the requirements of ORS 65.774 and 65.782, to copy the list at a reasonable time and at the member’s expense, during the period the list is available for inspection.

      (3) The corporation shall make the list of members available at the meeting, and any member, the member’s agent or the member’s attorney is entitled to inspect the list for any proper purpose at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

      (4) If the corporation refuses to allow a member, the member’s agent or the member’s attorney to inspect the list of members before or at the meeting or to copy the list as permitted by subsection (2) of this section, on application of the member, the circuit court of the county where the corporation’s principal office, or if the principal office is not in this state, where the corporation’s registered office is or was last located, may enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction pursuant to ORCP 79 ordering the inspection or copying at the corporation’s expense and may postpone a meeting until the inspection or copying is complete. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this subsection. The party initiating such a proceeding need not post an undertaking under ORCP 82 A.

      (5) Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the membership list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.

      (6) The articles of incorporation or bylaws of a religious corporation may limit or abolish the rights of a member under this section to inspect and copy any corporate record.

      (7) The articles of incorporation of a public benefit corporation organized primarily for political or social action, including but not limited to political or social advocacy, education, litigation or a combination of actions, may limit or abolish the right of a member or the member’s agent or attorney to inspect or copy the membership list if the corporation provides a reasonable means to mail communications to the other members through the corporation at the expense of the member making the request. [1989 c.1010 §60; 1995 c.618 §41; 2005 c.22 §45; 2019 c.174 §44]

 

      65.227 Voting entitlement of members. (1) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, each member is entitled to one vote on each matter on which the members vote. Except as expressly prohibited in this chapter, the articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide for different allocations of votes among member classes or exclude the members or some or all member classes from voting on any issue on which a member or class of members would otherwise be entitled to vote under this chapter.

      (2) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, if a membership stands of record in the names of two or more persons, with respect to voting the persons’ acts have the following effect:

      (a) If only one person votes, the person’s act binds all persons in whose names the membership stands; and

      (b) If more than one person votes, the vote is divided on a pro rata basis among the persons in whose names the membership stands.

      (3) If a class is entitled to vote as a class for directors, a determination of the voting power of the class must be based on the percentage of the number of directors the class may elect out of the total number of authorized directors. [1989 c.1010 §61; 1991 c.231 §3; 2013 c.158 §29; 2013 c.274 §11; 2019 c.174 §45]

 

      65.231 Proxies. (1) Unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws prohibit or limit proxy voting, a member may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointment form either personally or by the member’s attorney-in-fact.

      (2) An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form.

      (3) An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member.

      (4) The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy’s authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment.

      (5) Appointment of a proxy is revoked by the person that appoints the proxy:

      (a) Attending any meeting and voting in person; or

      (b) Signing and delivering to the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate proxy votes either a writing stating that the appointment of the proxy is revoked or a subsequent appointment form.

      (6) Subject to ORS 65.237 and any express limitation on the proxy’s authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy’s vote or other action as that of the member that makes the appointment. [1989 c.1010 §64; 2019 c.174 §46]

 

      65.234 Adjournment. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a majority of votes represented at a meeting of members, whether or not a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time to a different time and place without further notice to any member of any adjournment, except as such notice may be required by ORS 65.214 (4). At the adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting originally held. [1989 c.1010 §68]

 

      65.237 Corporation’s acceptance of votes. (1) If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a member, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member.

      (2) If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the record name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member if:

      (a) The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity;

      (b) The name signed purports to be that of an attorney-in-fact of the member and if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory’s authority to sign for the member has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment;

      (c) Two or more persons hold the membership as cotenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the coholders and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the coholders; or

      (d) In the case of a mutual benefit corporation:

      (A) The name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the member and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment; or

      (B) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the member, and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.

      (3) The corporation is entitled to reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory’s authority to sign for the member.

      (4) The corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section are not liable in damages to the member for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.

      (5) Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise. [1989 c.1010 §67]

 

      65.241 Quorum requirements. (1) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide for a higher quorum, votes represented at a meeting of members constitute a quorum.

      (2) An amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws to decrease the quorum for any action of the members may be approved by the members or, unless prohibited by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, by the board of directors.

      (3) An amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws to increase the quorum required for any action of the members must be approved by the members. [1989 c.1010 §62; 2019 c.174 §47]

 

      65.244 Voting requirements. (1) Unless this chapter, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws require a greater vote or voting by class, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes represented and voting is the act of the members.

      (2) An amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws to add to, change or delete the vote required for any action of the members must be approved by the members. [1989 c.1010 §63; 2019 c.174 §48]

 

      65.247 Cumulative voting for directors. (1) If the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide for cumulative voting by members, members may vote cumulatively by multiplying the number of votes the members are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom the members are entitled to vote, and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates.

      (2) Cumulative voting is not authorized at a particular meeting unless:

      (a) The meeting notice or statement accompanying the notice states that cumulative voting will take place; or

      (b) A member gives notice during the meeting and before the vote is taken of the member’s intent to vote cumulatively, and if one member gives this notice all other members participating in the election may vote cumulatively without giving further notice.

      (3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, members may, without cause, remove a director who was elected by cumulative voting if the members act in accordance with ORS 65.324.

      (b) A proposal to remove a director who was elected by cumulative voting fails if the number of votes that members cast against the proposal to remove the director, or that fail to consent in writing to the removal, would have been sufficient to elect the director under these circumstances:

      (A) The members had voted cumulatively at an election that occurred at the time the director was last elected;

      (B) All directors authorized to serve on the board of directors were subject to election at that time; and

      (C) If during the election:

      (i) The members had cast the same total number of votes; or

      (ii) All memberships entitled to vote were voted, if the election was by written ballot.

      (4) Members may not vote cumulatively if the directors and members are identical. [1989 c.1010 §65; 2019 c.174 §49]

 

      65.251 Other methods of electing directors. A corporation may provide in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws for election of directors by members or delegates:

      (2) A voting agreement created under this section is specifically enforceable. [1989 c.1010 §69]

 

CORPORATE ACTIONS

 

      65.260 Definitions for ORS 65.260 to 65.281. As used in ORS 65.260 to 65.281:

      (1) “Corporate action” means an action that a corporation takes or an action that an incorporator, the board of directors, a committee, an officer, an agent or another person takes on the corporation’s behalf.

      (2) “Corrected corporate action” means a corporate action that a corporation ratifies in accordance with ORS 65.260 to 65.281.

      (3) “Date of the defective corporate action” means the date, or the approximate date, on which a corporation took a defective corporate action.

      (4) “Defective corporate action” means an action that, but for a failure of authorization, is within the corporation’s power to take and would have been within the corporation’s power to take at the time the corporation took the action.

      (5) “Effective date of validation” means, irrespective of a filing or the pendency of a judicial proceeding under ORS 65.281 and unless a court orders otherwise, the later of the time at which:

      (a) The members of the corporation approve a ratification of a defective corporate action or, if the ratification does not require member approval, the date on which the notice described in ORS 65.272 becomes effective in accordance with ORS 65.034; or

      (b) Articles of validation filed in accordance with ORS 65.278 become effective.

      (6) “Failure of authorization” means a failure to authorize, approve or otherwise effect a corporate action in compliance with this chapter, the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, a resolution or any plan or agreement to which the corporation is a party if, and to the extent that, the failure renders the corporate action void or voidable. [2019 c.325 §11]

 

      65.263 Defective corporate action; ratification or validation; effective date. (1) A defective corporate action is not void or voidable if the corporation ratifies the defective corporate action in accordance with ORS 65.266 or validates the defective corporate action in accordance with ORS 65.278.

      (2) Ratification under ORS 65.266 or validation under ORS 65.278 is not the exclusive means of ratifying or validating a defective corporate action. An absence or failure to ratify or validate a corporate action in accordance with ORS 65.260 to 65.281 does not:

      (a) Affect the validity or effectiveness of a corporate action that is properly ratified under common law or otherwise; or

      (b) Create a presumption that the corporate action is or was a defective corporate action or is or was void or voidable. [2019 c.325 §12]

 

      65.266 Ratification by board of directors; procedure; submission to shareholders. (1) Except as provided in ORS 65.263 (2), a corporation’s board of directors may ratify a defective corporate action only in accordance with this section. In a notice of a proposal to ratify the defective corporate action, the corporation shall:

      (a) Identify the defective corporate action the proposal seeks to ratify;

      (b) State the date on which the defective corporate action occurred;

      (c) Describe the nature of the failure of authorization that resulted in the corporate action becoming a defective corporate action; and

      (d) State that the board of directors intends to ratify the defective corporate action.

      (2) If the board of directors proposes to ratify a defective corporate action that relates to the election under ORS 65.057 of an initial board of directors, a majority of the individuals who are exercising the powers of the corporation’s directors, in a notice of the proposal to ratify the defective corporate action, shall:

      (a) Identify the person or persons who first took action in the name of the corporation as the initial board of directors;

      (b) State the date on which, as appropriate, the person or persons:

      (A) First took the action; or

      (c) Describe the nature of the failure of authorization that resulted in the corporate action becoming a defective corporate action; and

      (d) State that the board of directors intends to ratify the defective corporate action.

      (3) If the board of directors takes action to ratify a defective corporate action, the board shall submit the ratification to the members of the corporation, if any, for approval in accordance with ORS 65.269 if a provision of this chapter, the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, a resolution or any plan or agreement to which the corporation is a party requires member approval of the ratification or would have required member approval of the defective corporate action on the date of the defective corporate action.

      (4) Unless the proposal for ratification under subsection (1) of this section provides otherwise, after the board of directors ratifies the defective corporate action and the members, if required, approve the ratification, the board of directors may abandon the ratification at any time before the effective date of validation without further action from the members. [2019 c.325 §13]

 

      65.269 Quorum; notice to shareholders of proposed ratification. (1) Quorum and voting requirements that applied to the board of directors at the time a corporation took a defective corporate action apply also to the board of directors in taking an action to ratify the defective corporate action.

      (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if the members of a corporation must, under ORS 65.266 (3), approve a ratification of a defective corporate action at a meeting, the corporation shall send notice of the meeting to each person, whether or not the person may vote, that is a member of the corporation on:

      (A) The record date for notice of the meeting; and

      (B) The date of the defective corporate action.

      (3) A corporation’s ratification, validation or other approval of a corporate action under ORS 65.260 to 65.281 and a determination, finding, order or judgment in a proceeding under ORS 65.281 does not affect a cause of action or remedy, other than a cause of action or remedy under ORS 65.281, that relates to the corporate action or the corporation’s ratification, validation or other approval of the corporate action under ORS 65.260 to 65.281.

      (3)(a) If a corporation previously filed a document related to a defective corporate action but the articles of validation a corporation submits for filing under subsection (1) of this section do not need to change any information in the previously filed document to give effect to the corporation’s ratification of the defective corporate action, the articles of validation must have the information required under subsection (2) of this section and must:

      (A) List the name and title or any other method by which the corporation identifies the previously filed document and the filing date for the previously filed document; and

      (B) Include a copy of the previously filed document.

      (4)(a) A person must bring, within 120 days after the later of the effective date of validation or the date of the notice that a corporation gives under ORS 65.269 or 65.272, as applicable, any action that claims that a ratification of a defective corporate action is not valid or effective or that the defective corporate action is valid or effective only under certain conditions.

      (b) A person’s failure to contact a corporation to determine the calendar date by which the person must bring an action under this section does not eliminate or extend the 120-day period specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection. [2019 c.325 §18]

If the articles of incorporation establish a fixed or a variable range for the size of the board of directors and the corporation has members entitled to vote for directors, then only the members may change the range for the size of the board or change from a fixed or a variable-range size board. [1989 c.1010 §72]

      65.317 Staggered terms for directors.

      (5) If at the beginning of a director’s term on the board, the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that the director may be removed for missing more than a specified number of meetings or for reasons set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a majority of the directors may remove the director for such reasons.

      (6) The articles of incorporation or bylaws of a religious corporation may:

      (a) The director engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct, or gross abuse of authority or discretion, with respect to the corporation, or the director has violated a duty set forth in ORS 65.357 to 65.367 or 65.377; and

      (b) Removal is in the best interest of the corporation.

      (2) The court that removes a director may bar the director from serving on the board of directors for a period prescribed by the court.

      (3) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection (2) of this section unwarranted.

      (4) A director is not liable to the corporation, any member or any other person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this section. The liability of a director for monetary damages to the corporation and the corporation’s members may be eliminated or limited in the corporation’s articles of incorporation to the extent provided in ORS 65.047 (2)(c). [1989 c.1010 §88; 2019 c.174 §66]

 

      65.361 Director conflict of interest. (1) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director if the transaction is fair to the corporation at the time the corporation enters into the transaction. A transaction is presumed to be fair if the transaction is approved as provided in subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

      (2) A transaction in which a director of a public benefit corporation or religious corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved:

      (a) By the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors if the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest are disclosed or known to the board of directors or committee of the board of directors; or

      (b) By obtaining approval of:

      (A) The Attorney General; or

      (B) The circuit court in an action in which the Attorney General is joined as a party.

      (3) A transaction in which a director of a mutual benefit corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved:

      (a) In advance by the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors if the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors; or

      (b) If the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the members and the members authorized, approved or ratified the transaction.

      (4) For the purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if:

      (a) Another entity in which the director has a material interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction;

      (b) Another entity of which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction, and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation; or

      (c) A person who is related to the director or a business associate of the director is a party to the transaction.

      (5) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if the transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors or on the committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. A transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise approved as provided in subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

      (6) For purposes of subsection (3)(b) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by the members if the transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and votes cast by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (4) of this section may be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (3)(b) of this section. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

      (7) The articles of incorporation, bylaws or a resolution of the board may impose additional requirements on conflict of interest transactions. [1989 c.1010 §89; 2019 c.174 §67]

 

      65.364 Loans to or guarantees for directors and officers. (1) A public benefit corporation or religious corporation may not make a loan, guarantee an obligation or modify a preexisting loan or guarantee to or for the benefit of a director or officer of the corporation, except as stated in this section. Unless prohibited by the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, a public benefit corporation or religious corporation may make a loan, guarantee an obligation or modify a preexisting loan or guarantee to or for the benefit of a director or officer as part of a recruitment package, for a total period not to exceed three years, provided that:

      (2) A mutual benefit corporation may not lend money to or guarantee the obligation of a director of the mutual benefit corporation unless:

      (a) The particular loan or guarantee is approved by a majority of the votes of members entitled to vote, excluding the votes of members under the control of the benefited director; or

      (b) The mutual benefit corporation’s board of directors determines that the loan or guarantee benefits the mutual benefit corporation and either approves the specific loan or guarantee or a general plan authorizing the loans and guarantees.

      (3) The fact that a loan or guarantee is made in violation of this section does not affect the borrower’s liability on the loan. [1989 c.1010 §90; 1991 c.231 §6; 2019 c.174 §68]

 

      65.367 Liability for unlawful distributions. (1) Unless a director complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in ORS 65.357, a director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of this chapter or the articles of incorporation is personally liable to the corporation for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating this chapter.

      (2) A director held liable for an unlawful distribution under subsection (1) of this section is entitled to contribution:

      (a) From every other director who voted for or assented to the distribution without complying with the applicable standards of conduct described in ORS 65.357; and

      (b) From each person who received an unlawful distribution for the amount of the distribution whether or not the person receiving the distribution knew it was made in violation of this chapter or the articles of incorporation. [1989 c.1010 §91]

 

      65.369 Liability of qualified directors. (1) The civil liability of a qualified director for the performance or nonperformance of the director’s duties shall be limited to gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

      (a) A member of a board or commission of the state or a governmental subdivision for the purpose of setting policy and controlling or otherwise overseeing the activities or functional responsibilities of the board or commission but, notwithstanding ORS 30.265 (5), the entity is not thereby rendered immune from liability;

[1989 c.1010 §§92,92a; 1991 c.64 §4; 1991 c.81 §1; 1991 c.231 §5; 1999 c.677 §64; 2011 c.270 §2]

      65.371 Required officers. (1) A corporation must have a president, a secretary, a treasurer and such other officers as are elected or appointed by the board of directors or by any other person as the articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize, provided that the articles of incorporation or bylaws may designate other titles in lieu of president, secretary and treasurer.

      (2) The bylaws or the board of directors shall delegate to one of the officers responsibility for preparing minutes of the board of directors’ meetings and membership meetings and for authenticating records of the corporation.

      (4) An officer is not liable to the corporation, any member or other person for any action taken or not taken as an officer if the officer acted in compliance with this section. The liability of the officer for monetary damages to the corporation and the corporation’s members may be eliminated or limited in the corporation’s articles of incorporation to the extent provided in ORS 65.047 (2)(c).

      65.384 Contract rights of officers. (1) The appointment of an officer does not itself create contract rights.

(Indemnification)

A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation’s request if the director’s duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, the director to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.

      (3) “Expenses” include attorney fees.

      (4) “Liability” means the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement, penalty, fine, including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan, or reasonable expenses actually incurred with respect to a proceeding.

      (5) “Officer” means an individual who is or was an officer of a corporation or an individual who, while an officer of a corporation, is or was serving at the corporation’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. An officer is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation’s request if the officer’s duties to the corporation also impose duties on or include services by the officer to the employee benefit plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Officer” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of an officer.

      (6) “Party” includes an individual who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.

      65.391 Authority to indemnify. (1) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a corporation may indemnify an individual against liability incurred in a proceeding to which the individual was made a party because the individual is or was a director if:

      (2) A director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (3) Terminating a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or the equivalent of nolo contendere does not, of itself, determine that the director did not meet the standard of conduct described in this section.

      (4) A corporation may not indemnify a director under this section in connection with:

      (a) A proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in which the director was adjudged liable to the corporation; or

      (b) A proceeding that charged the director with and adjudged the director liable for improperly receiving a personal benefit.

      (5) Indemnification permitted under this section in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation is limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.

      (6)(a) A corporation that provides indemnification to a director in accordance with the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws may not amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws so as to eliminate or impair the director’s right to indemnification after an act or omission occurs that subjects the director to a proceeding or to liability for which the director seeks indemnification under the terms of the articles of incorporation or bylaws.

      (b) Notwithstanding the prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a corporation may eliminate or impair a director’s right to indemnification if at the time the act or omission occurred the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws explicitly authorized the corporation to eliminate or impair the right after an act or omission occurs. [1989 c.1010 §99; 2011 c.227 §5]

 

      65.394 Mandatory indemnification. Unless limited by its articles of incorporation, a corporation shall indemnify a director who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which the director was a party because of being a director of the corporation, against reasonable expenses actually incurred by the director in connection with the proceeding. [1989 c.1010 §100; 2005 c.22 §46]

 

      65.397 Advance for expenses. (1) A corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if:

      (b) The director furnishes the corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on the director’s behalf, to repay the advance if the director is ultimately determined not to have met the standard of conduct.

      (2) The undertaking required by subsection (1)(b) of this section must be an unlimited general obligation of the director but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

      (3) An authorization of payments under this section may be made by provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, by a resolution of the members or board of directors or by contract.

      (4)(a) A corporation that authorizes payments in accordance with subsection (3) of this section may not amend or rescind the articles of incorporation, bylaws or resolution that authorizes the payments so as to eliminate or impair a director’s right to payments after an act or omission occurs that subjects the director to a proceeding for which the director seeks payment.

      (b) Notwithstanding the prohibition set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a corporation may eliminate or impair a director’s right to payments if at the time the act or omission occurred the corporation’s articles of incorporation, bylaws or resolution explicitly authorized the corporation to eliminate or impair the right after an act or omission occurs. [1989 c.1010 §101; 2011 c.227 §6]

 

      65.401 Court-ordered indemnification. Unless the corporation’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director of the corporation who is a party to a proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice the court considers necessary may order indemnification in the amount it considers proper if it determines:

      (1) The director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 65.394, in which case the court shall also order the corporation to pay the director’s reasonable expenses incurred to obtain court-ordered indemnification; or

      (2) The director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 65.391 (1) or was adjudged liable as described in ORS 65.391 (4), whether the liability is based on a judgment, settlement or proposed settlement or otherwise. [1989 c.1010 §102]

 

      65.404 Determination and authorization of indemnification. (1) A corporation may not indemnify a director under ORS 65.391 unless authorized in the specific case after a determination has been made that indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 65.391.

      (2) A determination that indemnification of a director is permissible shall be made:

      (a) By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

      (b) If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by a majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors, consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

      (c) By special legal counsel selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection or, if a quorum of the board cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the special legal counsel shall be selected by majority vote of the full board of directors including directors who are parties to the proceeding; or

      (d) By the members of a mutual benefit corporation, but directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not vote on the determination.

      (3) Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under subsection (2)(c) of this section to select counsel.

      (4) A director of a public benefit corporation may not be indemnified until 20 days after the effective date of written notice to the Attorney General of the proposed indemnification. [1989 c.1010 §103]

      (1) An officer of the corporation is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 65.394, and is entitled to apply for court-ordered indemnification under ORS 65.401 in each case, to the same extent as a director under ORS 65.394 and 65.401.

      (2) The corporation may indemnify and advance expenses under ORS 65.387 to 65.411 an officer, employee or agent of the corporation who is not a director to the same extent as to a director. [1989 c.1010 §104]

 

      65.411 Insurance. A corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual against liability asserted against or incurred by the individual who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or who, while a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic business or nonprofit corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The corporation may purchase and maintain the insurance even if the corporation has no power to indemnify the individual against the same liability under ORS 65.391 or 65.394. [1989 c.1010 §105]

 

      65.414 Application of ORS 65.387 to 65.411. (1) The indemnification and provisions for advancement of expenses provided by ORS 65.387 to 65.411 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which directors, officers, employees or agents may be entitled under the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, any agreement, general or specific action of its board of directors, vote of members or otherwise, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Specifically and not by way of limitation, a corporation shall have the power to make or agree to make any further indemnification, including advancement of expenses, of:

      (a) Any director as authorized by the articles of incorporation, any bylaws approved, adopted or ratified by the members or any resolution or agreement approved, adopted or ratified, before or after such indemnification or agreement is made, by the members, provided that no such indemnification shall indemnify any director from or on account of acts or omissions for which liability could not be eliminated under ORS 65.047 (2)(c); and

      (b) Any officer, employee or agent who is not a director as authorized by its articles of incorporation or bylaws, general or specific action of its board of directors or agreement. Unless the articles of incorporation, or any such bylaws, agreement or resolution provide otherwise, any determination as to any further indemnity under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with ORS 65.404.

      (2) If articles of incorporation limit indemnification or advance of expenses, any indemnification and advance of expenses are valid only to the extent consistent with the articles of incorporation.

      (3) ORS 65.387 to 65.411 do not limit a corporation’s power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director in connection with the director’s appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the director has not been made a named defendant or respondent to a proceeding.

      (4) A report of indemnification must be made in accordance with ORS 65.784. [1989 c.1010 §106; 1991 c.231 §9]

(Judicial Dissolution)

 

      65.661 Grounds for judicial dissolution. (1) A circuit court may dissolve a corporation:

      (a) In a proceeding by the Attorney General if the court finds that:

      (A) The corporation filed articles of incorporation with fraudulent intent, with fraudulent information or in a manner that otherwise indicates fraud;

      (B) The corporation has exceeded or abused the authority conferred upon the corporation by law;

      (C) The corporation has fraudulently solicited money or has fraudulently used the money solicited;

      (D) The corporation is a public benefit corporation and the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted;

      (E) The corporation is a public benefit corporation and is no longer able to carry out the public benefit corporation’s purposes or the Internal Revenue Service has revoked the public benefit corporation’s tax exempt status; or

      (F) The corporation is a shell entity. For purposes of this subparagraph:

      (i) A court may find that a corporation is a shell entity if the court determines that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency; and

      (ii) The Attorney General may make a prima facie showing that a corporation is a shell entity by stating in an affidavit that:

      (I) The corporation did not provide a name or address required by the Secretary of State, or the name or address the corporation provided was false, fraudulent or inadequate;

      (II) The corporation’s articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep under ORS 65.771 or the corporation’s annual report is false, fraudulent or inadequate;

      (III) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, attempted to communicate with, or serve legal process upon, the corporation at the address or by means of other contract information the corporation provided to the Secretary of State, but the corporation failed to respond; or

      (IV) The Attorney General has other evidence that shows that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency.

      (b) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a religious corporation, in a proceeding by 50 members or members holding five percent or more of the voting power, whichever is less, or by a director or any person specified in the articles of incorporation, if the court finds that:

      (A) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, and the members, if any, are unable to break the deadlock;

      (B) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent;

      (C) The members are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired;

      (D) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or

      (E) The corporation is a public benefit corporation or religious corporation and is no longer able to carry out the public benefit corporation’s or religious corporation’s purposes;

      (c) In a proceeding by a creditor if the court finds that:

      (A) The creditor’s claim has been reduced to judgment, the execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied and the corporation is insolvent; or

      (B) The corporation has admitted in writing that the creditor’s claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent; or

      (a) Reasonable alternatives to dissolution exist;

      (b) Dissolution is in the public interest, if the corporation is a public benefit corporation; or

      (c) Dissolution is the best way of protecting the interests of members, if the corporation is a mutual benefit corporation.

      (3) In addition to subjecting a corporation to dissolution under subsection (1)(a)(F) of this section, a finding that a corporation is a shell entity has the following effects:

      (a) A court may rebuttably presume that the corporation’s filings with the Secretary of State constitute a false claim, as defined in ORS 180.750, in any action the Attorney General brings against the corporation under ORS 180.760 and may award to the Attorney General reasonable attorney fees and the costs of investigation, preparation and litigation if the Attorney General prevails in the action; and

      (b) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, in any proceeding against the corporation, may move to enjoin a director, officer or other person that exercises significant direction or control over the corporation from engaging in commercial activity in this state, including but not limited to incorporating or organizing an entity in this state.

      (4) A corporation may affirmatively defend against an allegation that the corporation is a shell entity by showing that the corporation, within 60 days after receiving a request to provide or correct a name, address or other information required for a filing or in articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep or an annual report, or within 60 days after the date of a request to respond to a communication or service of process, provided or corrected the name, address or other information or responded to the communication or service of process.

      65.664 Procedure for judicial dissolution. (1) Venue for a proceeding by the Attorney General to dissolve a corporation lies in Marion County, in Multnomah County or in the county where a corporation’s principal office is located or, if the principal office is not in this state, where the corporation’s registered office is or was last located. A party named in ORS 65.661, other than the Attorney General, must bring a proceeding to dissolve a corporation in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located or, if the principal office is not in this state, in the county where the corporation’s registered office is or was last located.

      (2) Directors or members are not necessary parties to a proceeding to dissolve a corporation unless relief is sought against a director or member individually.

      (3) A court in a proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation may issue injunctions, appoint a receiver or custodian pendente lite with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the corporate assets wherever located and carry on the activities of the corporation until a full hearing can be held.

      (4) A person other than the Attorney General who brings a judicial dissolution proceeding for a public benefit corporation or religious corporation shall give immediate written notice of the proceeding to the Attorney General, who may intervene. [1989 c.1010 §143; 2019 c.174 §96]

 

      65.667 Receivership or custodianship. (1) A court, at the Attorney General’s request or in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a public benefit corporation or mutual benefit corporation, may appoint one or more receivers or custodians to manage the affairs of the corporation or to wind up and liquidate the corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the corporation and all of the corporation’s property wherever located.

      (2) The court may appoint as a receiver or custodian an individual, a domestic business corporation or foreign business corporation authorized to transact business in this state or a nonprofit corporation. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.

      (3) The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in the court’s appointing order, which may be amended periodically. Among other powers:

      (a) The receiver:

      (A) May dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court, provided, however, that the receiver’s power to dispose of the assets of the corporation is subject to any trust and other restrictions that would be applicable to the corporation; and

      (B) May sue and defend in the receiver’s own name as receiver of the corporation in all courts of this state.

      (b) The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of the corporation’s board of directors or officers, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs of the corporation in the best interests of the corporation and the corporation’s members and creditors.

      (4) The court during a receivership may redesignate the receiver a custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver, if doing so is in the best interest of the corporation and the corporation’s members and creditors.

      (5) The court periodically during the receivership or custodianship may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the receiver or custodian and the receiver’s or custodian’s attorney from the assets of the corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets.

      (6) If applicable under ORS 37.040, the Oregon Receivership Code controls over conflicting provisions of this section. [1989 c.1010 §144; 2017 c.358 §47; 2019 c.174 §97]

 

      65.671 Judgment of dissolution. (1) If after a hearing a court determines that one or more grounds for judicial dissolution described in ORS 65.661 exist, the court may enter a judgment dissolving the corporation and specifying the effective date of the dissolution. The clerk of the court shall deliver a certified copy of the judgment to the Secretary of State for filing.

      (2) After entering the judgment of dissolution, the court shall direct the winding up and liquidation of the corporation’s affairs in accordance with ORS 65.637 and the notification of claimants in accordance with ORS 65.641 and 65.644. [1989 c.1010 §145; 2003 c.576 §329; 2019 c.174 §98]

      (5) The Secretary of State receives a duly authenticated certificate from the official having custody of corporate records in the state or country under whose law the foreign corporation is incorporated stating that the foreign corporation has been dissolved or disappeared as the result of a merger. [1989 c.1010 §158; 2005 c.22 §50]

 

      65.741 Procedure for and effect of administrative revocation.

      (2) If the Secretary of State determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (1) of this section, that the information is correct and that the corporation’s name satisfies the requirements of ORS 65.717, the Secretary of State shall reinstate the authority.

      (3) When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative revocation of authority and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the administrative revocation of authority had never occurred.

(Judicial Revocation of Authority)

 

      65.751 Grounds for judicial revocation. (1) A circuit court may revoke the authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in this state:

      (a) In a proceeding by the Attorney General if the court finds that:

      (A) The foreign corporation obtained authority to transact business in this state with fraudulent intent, with fraudulent information or in a manner that otherwise indicates fraud;

      (B) The foreign corporation has exceeded or abused the authority conferred upon the foreign corporation by law;

      (C) The foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state and the foreign corporation’s corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted;

      (D) The foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state and the foreign corporation is no longer able to carry out the foreign corporation’s purposes;

      (E) An incorporator, director, officer or agent of the foreign corporation signed a document knowing that the document was false in any material respect with the intent that the document be delivered to the Secretary of State for filing;

      (F) The foreign corporation has fraudulently solicited money or has fraudulently used the money solicited; or

      (G) The foreign corporation is a shell entity. For purposes of this subparagraph:

      (i) A court may find that a foreign corporation is a shell entity if the court determines that the foreign corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency; and

      (ii) The Attorney General may make a prima facie showing that a foreign corporation is a shell entity by stating in an affidavit that:

      (I) The foreign corporation did not provide a name or address required by the Secretary of State, or the name or address the foreign corporation provided was false, fraudulent or inadequate;

      (II) The foreign corporation’s application for authority to transact business in this state, a record the foreign corporation must keep under ORS 65.771 or the foreign corporation’s annual report is false, fraudulent or inadequate;

      (III) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, attempted to communicate with, or serve legal process upon, the foreign corporation at the address or by means of other contact information the foreign corporation provided to the Secretary of State, but the foreign corporation failed to respond; or

      (IV) The Attorney General has other evidence that shows that the foreign corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or governmental agency.

      (b) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a foreign corporation that would have been a religious corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state, in a proceeding by 50 members or members holding five percent or more of the voting power, whichever is less, or by a director or any person specified in the articles of incorporation, if the court finds that:

      (A) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, and the members, if any, are unable to break the deadlock;

      (B) The directors or those in control of the foreign corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent;

      (C) The members are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired;

      (D) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or

      (E) The foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation or religious corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state, and is no longer able to carry out the foreign corporation’s purposes.

      (c) In a proceeding by a creditor if the court finds that:

      (A) The creditor’s claim has been reduced to judgment, the execution on the judgment returned unsatisfied and the foreign corporation is insolvent; or

      (B) The foreign corporation has admitted in writing that the creditor’s claim is due and owing and the foreign corporation is insolvent.

      (2) Before revoking a foreign corporation’s authority, the court shall consider whether:

      (a) Reasonable alternatives to revocation of authority exist;

      (b) Revocation of authority is in the public interest, if the foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state; or

      (c) Revocation of authority is the best way to protect the interests of members, if the foreign corporation would have been a mutual benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state.

      (3) In addition to subjecting a foreign corporation to revocation of the foreign corporation’s authority to transact business in this state under subsection (1)(a)(G) of this section, a finding that a foreign corporation is a shell entity has the following effects:

      (a) A court may rebuttably presume that the foreign corporation’s filings with the Secretary of State constitute a false claim, as defined in ORS 180.750, in any action the Attorney General brings under ORS 180.760 and may award to the Attorney General reasonable attorney fees and the costs of investigation, preparation and litigation if the Attorney General prevails in the action; and

      (b) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, in any proceeding against the foreign corporation, may move to enjoin a director, officer or other person that exercises significant direction or control over the foreign corporation from engaging in commercial activity in this state including, but not limited to, incorporating or organizing an entity in this state.

      (4) A foreign corporation may affirmatively defend against an allegation that the foreign corporation is a shell entity by showing that the foreign corporation, within 60 days after receiving a request to provide or correct a name, address or other information required for a filing or in an application for authority to transact business in this state, a record the foreign corporation must keep or an annual report, or within 60 days after the date of a request to respond to a communication or service of process, provided or corrected the name, address or other information or responded to the communication or service of process. [1989 c.1010 §161; 2019 c.174 §105]

 

      65.754 Procedure for judicial revocation of authority. (1) Venue for a proceeding by the Attorney General to revoke a foreign corporation’s authority lies in Marion County. Venue for a proceeding brought by any other person named in ORS 65.751 lies in the county where a corporation’s principal Oregon office is located or where its registered office is or was last located.

      (2) It is not necessary to make directors or members parties to a proceeding to revoke the authority of a corporation.

      (3) A court in a proceeding brought to revoke a corporation’s authority may issue injunctions, appoint a receiver or custodian pendente lite with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the corporate assets located in Oregon and carry on the corporation’s Oregon activities until a full hearing can be held.

      (4) A person other than the Attorney General who brings a revocation proceeding for a foreign corporation that would have been a public benefit or religious corporation had it been incorporated in this state, shall forthwith give written notice of the proceeding to the Attorney General who may intervene. [1989 c.1010 §162]

 

      65.757 Judgment of revocation. (1) If after a hearing a court determines that one or more grounds for judicial revocation of authority described in ORS 65.751 exists, the court may enter a judgment revoking a foreign corporation’s authority to transact business in Oregon and specifying the effective date of the revocation. The clerk of the court shall deliver a certified copy of the judgment to the Secretary of State for filing.

      (2) The authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in Oregon ceases as of the date of the judgment of revocation.

      (3) The judgment of revocation of a foreign corporation’s authority to transact business in this state appoints the Secretary of State the foreign corporation’s agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time the foreign corporation was authorized to transact business in this state.

      (4) Revocation of a foreign corporation’s authority to transact business in this state terminates the authority of the foreign corporation’s registered agent. [1989 c.1010 §163; 2003 c.576 §330; 2019 c.174 §106]
