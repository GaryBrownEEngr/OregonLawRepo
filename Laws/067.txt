      67.055 Creation of partnership. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit creates a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to create a partnership.

      (2) A partnership may be created under this chapter, a predecessor statute or a comparable law of another jurisdiction.

      (3) An association or entity created under a law other than the laws described in subsection (2) of this section is not a partnership.

      (4) In determining whether a partnership is created, the following rules apply:

      (a) Factors indicating that persons have created a partnership include:

      (A) Their receipt of or right to receive a share of profits of the business;

      (B) Their expression of an intent to be partners in the business;

      (C) Their participation or right to participate in control of the business;

      (D) Their sharing or agreeing to share losses of the business or liability for claims by third parties against the business; and

      (E) Their contributing or agreeing to contribute money or property to the business.

      (b) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property or part ownership does not by itself create a partnership, even if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property.

      (c) The sharing of gross returns does not by itself create a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived.

      (d) It is a rebuttable presumption that a person who receives a share of the profits of a business is a partner in the business, unless the profits were received in payment of:

      (A) A debt by installments or otherwise;

      (B) Wages or other compensation to an employee or independent contractor;

      (C) Rent;

      (D) Amounts owing to a former partner, a beneficiary, representative or designee of a deceased partner or a partner with a disability, or a transferee of a partnership interest;

      (E) Interest or other charge on a loan, whether or not the amount of payment varies with the profits of the business, and whether or not the loan agreement or instrument includes a direct or indirect present or future ownership interest in collateral or rights to income, proceeds or increase in value derived from collateral; or

      (F) Consideration for the sale of a business, including goodwill, or other property by installments or otherwise.

      (e) An agreement to share losses by the owners of a business is not necessary to create a partnership. [1997 c.775 §7; 2007 c.70 §16]

 

      67.060 Partnership property. Property acquired by a partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners individually. [1997 c.775 §8]

 

      67.065 When property is partnership property. (1) Property is partnership property if acquired in the name of:

      (a) The partnership; or

      (b) One or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person’s capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership but without an indication of the name of the partnership.

      (2) Property is acquired in the name of the partnership by a transfer to:

      (a) The partnership in its name; or

      (b) One or more partners in their capacity as partners in the partnership, if the name of the partnership is indicated in the instrument transferring title to the property.

      (3) It is a rebuttable presumption that property is partnership property if purchased with partnership assets, even if not acquired in the name of the partnership or of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person’s capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership.

      (4) It is a rebuttable presumption that property acquired in the name of one or more of the partners, without an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person’s capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership and without use of partnership assets, is separate property, even if used for partnership purposes. [1997 c.775 §9]

 

      67.070 General powers of partnership. Unless restricted by applicable law, a partnership has the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary or convenient to carry on its business and affairs. [1997 c.775 §10]

 

(Relations of Partners to Persons Dealing With Partnership)

 

      67.090 Partner agent of partnership. (1) Each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business. An act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument in the name of the partnership, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner had no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner was dealing knew or had received a notification that the partner lacked authority.

      (2) An act of a partner that is not for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership, binds the partnership only if the act was authorized by the other partners. [1997 c.775 §11]

 

      67.095 Transfer of partnership property. (1) Partnership property may be transferred as follows:

      (a) Partnership property held in the name of the partnership may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by a partner in the name of the partnership.

      (b) Partnership property held in the name of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

      (c) Partnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

      (2) A partnership may recover partnership property from a transferee only if it proves that execution of the instrument of initial transfer did not bind the partnership under ORS 67.090 and:

      (a) As to a subsequent transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section, proves that prior to the transfer to the subsequent transferee, the subsequent transferee knew or had received a notification that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership; or

      (b) As to a transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection (1)(c) of this section, proves that prior to the transfer to the transferee, the transferee knew or had received a notification that the property was partnership property and that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.

      (3) A partnership may not recover partnership property from a subsequent transferee if the partnership would not have been entitled to recover the property, under subsection (2) of this section, from any earlier transferee of the property.

      (4) If a person holds all the partners’ interests in the partnership, all the partnership property vests in that person. The person may execute a document in the name of the partnership to evidence vesting of the property in that person and may file or record the document. [1997 c.775 §12]

 

      67.100 Partnership liable for partner’s actionable conduct. (1) A partnership is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, including a partner, or for a penalty incurred as a result of a wrongful act or omission or other actionable conduct of a partner acting in the ordinary course of business of the partnership or with authority of the partnership.

      (2) If, in the course of the partnership’s business or while acting with authority of the partnership, a partner receives or causes the partnership to receive money or property of a person not a partner, and the money or property is misapplied by a partner, the partnership is liable to such person for the loss. [1997 c.775 §13]

      67.105 Partner’s liability. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.

      (2) A person admitted as a partner into an existing partnership is not personally liable for any partnership obligation incurred before the person’s admission as a partner.

      (3)(a) An obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, a partner of a limited liability partnership shall continue to be liable for any obligation of the partnership for which the partner was liable before the partnership became a limited liability partnership.

      (c) Nothing in this subsection shall in any way affect or impair the ability of a partner to be released from any such obligation. This subsection applies to a partner’s liability notwithstanding anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the vote required to become a limited liability partnership under ORS 67.600 (3).

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, the partners of a limited liability partnership who are professionals shall be personally liable in their capacity as partners to the same extent and in the same manner as provided for shareholders of a domestic professional corporation under ORS 58.185 and 58.187 and as otherwise provided in this chapter. [1997 c.775 §14]

 

      67.110 Actions by and against partnership and partners. (1) A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership.

      (2) An action may be brought against the partnership and, to the extent not inconsistent with ORS 67.105, any or all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions.

      (3) A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner.

      (4) Except as provided by subsection (5) of this section, a creditor may proceed against one or more partners or their property to satisfy a judgment based on a claim that could have been successfully asserted against the partnership only if:

      (a) The partner is personally liable for the claim under ORS 67.105;

      (b) A judgment is also obtained against the partner; and

      (c) A judgment based on the same claim is obtained against the partnership that:

      (A) Has not been reversed or vacated; and

      (B) Remains unsatisfied for 90 days after:

      (i) The date of entry of the judgment; or

      (ii) The date of expiration or termination of the stay, if the judgment is contested by appropriate proceedings and execution on the judgment has been stayed.

      (5) Subsection (4) of this section does not prohibit a creditor from proceeding directly against one or more partners who are personally liable for the claim under ORS 67.105 or against their property without first seeking satisfaction from partnership property if:

      (a) The partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;

      (b) The creditor and the partnership agreed that the creditor is not required to comply with subsection (4) of this section;

      (c) A court orders otherwise, based on a finding that partnership property subject to execution within the state is clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment or that compliance with subsection (4) of this section is excessively burdensome; or

      (d) Liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independently of the person’s status as a partner. [1997 c.775 §15]

      67.115 Liability of purported partner. (1) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner or consents to being represented by another as a partner in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made if that person relying on the false representation enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the false representation is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon it even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.

      (2) A person falsely represented to be a partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, persons who are not partners to each other are not liable as partners to other persons. [1997 c.775 §16]

(Relations of Partners to Each Other and to Partnership)

 

      67.140 Partner’s rights and duties. (1) Each partner is deemed to have an account that is:

      (a) Credited with an amount equal to the money plus the value of any other property, net of the amount of any liabilities, the partner contributes to the partnership and the partner’s share of the partnership profits; and

      (b) Charged with an amount equal to the money plus the value of any other property, net of the amount of any liabilities, distributed by the partnership to the partner and the partner’s share of the partnership losses.

      (2) Each partner is entitled to an equal share of the partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the partner’s share of the profits.

      (3) A partnership shall reimburse a partner for payments made and indemnify a partner for liabilities incurred by the partner in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or for the preservation of its business or property.

      (4) A partnership shall reimburse a partner for an advance to the partnership beyond the amount of capital the partner agreed to contribute.

      (5) A payment or advance made by a partner which gives rise to a partnership obligation under subsection (3) or (4) of this section constitutes a loan to the partnership that accrues interest from the date of the payment or advance.

      (6) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, a partner shall not receive interest on the amount of capital contributed to the partnership.

      (7) Each partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the partnership business.

      (8) A partner may use or possess partnership property only on behalf of the partnership.

      (9) A partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for the partnership except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of the partnership.

      (10) A person may become a partner only with the consent of all the partners.

      (11) A difference arising as to a matter in the ordinary course of business of a partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners. An act outside the ordinary course of business of a partnership and an amendment to the partnership agreement may be undertaken only with the consent of all the partners.

      (12) A written partnership agreement may establish classes or groups of one or more partners having certain relative rights, powers and duties, including voting rights, and may provide for the future creation of additional classes or groups of one or more partners having certain relative rights, powers and duties, including voting rights. The rights, powers or duties of a class or group of partners may be senior to those of one or more existing classes or groups of partners.

      (13) This section does not affect the obligations of a partnership to other persons under ORS 67.090. [1997 c.775 §17]

 

      67.145 Distributions in kind. A partner has no right to receive, and may not be required to accept, a distribution in kind. [1997 c.775 §18]

 

      67.150 Partner’s rights and duties with respect to information. (1) A partnership shall keep its books and records, if any, at its principal office from which the partnership conducts its business.

      (2) A partnership shall provide partners and their agents and attorneys access to its books and records. It shall provide former partners and their agents and attorneys access to books and records pertaining to the period during which they were partners. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy books and records during ordinary business hours. A partnership may impose a reasonable charge covering the costs of labor and material for copies of documents furnished.

      (3) Each partner, to the extent of the partner’s knowledge or possession of information, and the partnership shall furnish to a partner and to the legal representative of a deceased partner or partner under legal disability:

      (a) Without demand, any information concerning the partnership’s business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or under this chapter; and

      (b) On demand, any other information concerning the partnership’s business and affairs, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances. [1997 c.775 §19]

 

      67.155 General standards of partner’s conduct. (1) The only fiduciary duties a partner owes to the partnership and the other partners are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

      (2) A partner’s duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other partners includes the following:

      (a) To account to the partnership and hold for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity;

      (b) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, to refrain from dealing with the partnership in a manner adverse to the partnership and to refrain from representing a person with an interest adverse to the partnership, in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business; and

      (c) To refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business before the dissolution of the partnership.

      (3) A partner’s duty of care to the partnership and the other partners in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.

      (4) A partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and the other partners under this chapter or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistent with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.

      (5) A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely because the partner’s conduct furthers the partner’s own interest.

      (6) A partner may lend money to or transact other business with the partnership, provided that any loan or transaction between a partner and the partnership must be:

      (a) Fair to the partnership;

      (b) Authorized by the partnership agreement; or

      (c) Authorized or ratified by a majority of the disinterested partners or by a number or percentage of partners specified in the partnership agreement, after full disclosure of all material facts.

      (7) Loans and other transactions between the partnership and a partner are binding on the parties in the same manner as transactions between the partnership and persons who are not partners, subject to other applicable law.

      (8) This section also applies to a person winding up the partnership business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving partner as if the person were a partner. [1997 c.775 §20]

 

      67.160 Actions by partnership and partners. (1) A partner is liable to a partnership and the other partners for a breach of the partnership agreement or for a violation of a duty to the partnership or the other partners under this chapter.

      (2) A partnership may maintain an action against a partner for a breach of the partnership agreement or for the violation of a duty to the partnership.

      (3) A partner may maintain an action against the partnership or another partner for legal or equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to partnership business, to:

      (a) Enforce the partner’s rights under the partnership agreement;

      (b) Enforce the partner’s rights under this chapter, including:

      (A) The partner’s rights under ORS 67.140, 67.150 or 67.155;

      (B) The partner’s right on dissociation to have the partner’s interest in the partnership purchased pursuant to ORS 67.250 or enforce any other right under ORS 67.220 to 67.265; or

      (C) The partner’s right to compel a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under ORS 67.290 or enforce any other right under ORS 67.290 to 67.315; or

      (c) Enforce the rights and otherwise protect the interests of the partner, including rights and interests arising independently of the partnership relationship.

      (4) The accrual of and any time limitation on a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law. [1997 c.775 §21]

 

      67.165 Continuation of partnership beyond definite term or particular undertaking. (1) If a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking is continued without an express agreement after the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at the expiration or completion so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.

      (2) If the partners, or those of them who habitually acted in the business during the term or undertaking, continue the business without any settlement or liquidation of the partnership and all partners have notice of such continuation, there is a rebuttable presumption that the partners have agreed that the partnership will continue. [1997 c.775 §22]

 

(Transferees and Creditors of Partner)

 

      67.190 Partner not co-owner of partnership property. A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in partnership property that can be transferred either voluntarily or involuntarily. [1997 c.775 §23]

 

      67.195 Partner’s transferable interest in partnership. The only transferable interest of a partner in the partnership is the partner’s share of the profits and losses of the partnership and the partner’s right to receive distributions. The interest is personal property. [1997 c.775 §24]

 

      67.200 Transfer of whole or part of partner’s transferable interest. (1) A transfer, in whole or in part, of a partner’s transferable interest in the partnership:

      (a) Is permissible;

      (b) Does not by itself cause the partner’s dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business; and

      (c) Does not, as against the other partners or the partnership, entitle the transferee, during the continuance of the partnership, to participate in the management or conduct of the partnership business, to require access to information concerning partnership transactions or to inspect or copy the partnership books or records.

      (2) A transferee of a partner’s transferable interest in the partnership has a right:

      (a) To receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled;

      (b) To receive upon the dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, in accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; and

      (c) To seek under ORS 67.290 (6) a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business.

      (3) In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee is entitled to an account of partnership transactions only from the date of the latest account agreed to by all the partners.

      (4) Upon transfer, the transferor retains the rights and duties of a partner other than the transferred interest in profits and losses of the partnership and the right to receive distributions.

      (5) A partnership need not give effect to a transferee’s rights under this section until it has notice of the transfer. Upon request, a transferee must furnish to the partnership reasonable proof of the transfer.

      (6) A transfer of a partner’s transferable interest in the partnership in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in the partnership agreement is ineffective as to a person having notice of the restriction at the time of transfer. [1997 c.775 §25]

 

      67.205 Partner’s transferable interest subject to charging order. (1) On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or of a partner’s transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the partnership and make all other orders, directions, accounts and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or that the circumstances of the case may require.

      (2) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor’s transferable interest in the partnership. The court may order a foreclosure of the interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.

      (3) At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be redeemed:

      (a) By the judgment debtor;

      (b) With property other than partnership property, by one or more of the other partners; or

      (c) With partnership property, by one or more of the other partners with the consent of all the partners whose interests are not so charged.

      (4) This chapter does not deprive a partner of a right under exemption laws with respect to the partner’s interest in the partnership.

      (5) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or partner’s transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor’s transferable interest in the partnership. [1997 c.775 §26]

      (b) The partner’s duty of loyalty under ORS 67.155 (2)(c) terminates; and

      (c) The partner’s duty of loyalty under ORS 67.155 (2)(a) and (b) and duty of care under ORS 67.155 (3) continue only with regard to matters arising and events occurring before the partner’s dissociation, unless the partner participates in winding up the partnership’s business pursuant to ORS 67.300. [1997 c.775 §29]

 

(Partner’s Dissociation When Business Not Wound Up)

 

      67.250 Purchase of dissociated partner’s interest. (1) If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under ORS 67.290, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner’s interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) The buyout price of a dissociated partner’s interest is an amount equal to the fair value of the dissociated partner’s interest in the partnership on the date of the dissociation. If the dissociated partner has a minority interest in the partnership, the buyout price of the dissociated partner’s interest shall not be discounted as a result of such minority interest. Interest must be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.

      (3) Damages for wrongful dissociation under ORS 67.225 (2) and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, must be offset against the buyout price. Interest must be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.

      (4) A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under ORS 67.255. On application by the partnership or a partner made within 120 days after the date of dissociation, a court may determine that indemnification of the dissociated partner against all partnership liabilities incurred before the dissociation is not equitable based on either:

      (a) The financial condition of the partnership on the date of dissociation; or

      (b) The dissolution of the partnership within 60 days after the date of dissociation.

      (5) If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner’s interest is reached within 120 days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8) of this section, the partnership shall tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection (3) of this section, stating the time of payment and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.

      (7) The payment or tender required by subsection (5) or (6) of this section must be accompanied by the following:

      (a) A statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation;

      (b) The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any;

      (c) An explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated; and

      (d) Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within 120 days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection (3) of this section or other terms of the obligation to purchase.

      (8) A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment bears interest but need not be secured unless the dissociated partner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that security for the deferred payment is appropriate.

      (9) A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to ORS 67.160 (3)(b)(B), to determine the buyout price of that partner’s interest, any offsets under subsection (3) of this section or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within 120 days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay, or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner’s interest and any offset due under subsection (3) of this section and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8) of this section, the court shall also determine whether security for deferred payment is appropriate and the other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership’s failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection (7) of this section. [1997 c.775 §30]

 

      67.255 Dissociated partner’s power to bind and liability to partnership. (1) If a partner dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, the partnership, including a converted or surviving business entity under ORS 67.340 to 67.365, is bound by an act of the dissociated partner only if:

      (a) The act occurs within six months after the date of dissociation;

      (b) The act would have bound the partnership under ORS 67.090 before dissociation;

      (c) At the time of entering into the transaction, the other party reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner and did not have notice of the partner’s dissociation; and

      (d) At the time of entering into the transaction, the dissociation had not been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the place, or in each place if more than one, at which the partnership business is regularly carried on.

      (2) A dissociated partner is liable to the partnership for any damage caused to the partnership arising from an obligation incurred by the dissociated partner after dissociation for which the partnership is liable under subsection (1) of this section. [1997 c.775 §31; 1999 c.362 §51]

 

      67.260 Dissociated partner’s liability to other persons. (1) A partner’s dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner’s liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership, or a converted or surviving business entity under ORS 67.340 to 67.365, within six months after the partner’s dissociation only if the partner is personally liable for the obligation under ORS 67.105 and, at the time of entering into the transaction:

      (a) The other party reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner;

      (b) The other party did not have notice of the partner’s dissociation; and

      (c) The dissociation had not been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the place, or in each place if more than one, at which the partnership business is regularly carried on.

      (3) By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.

      (4) A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner’s dissociation but without the partner’s consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation. [1997 c.775 §32; 1999 c.362 §52]

 

      67.265 Continued use of partnership name. Continued use of a partnership name, or a dissociated partner’s name as part thereof, by partners continuing the business does not of itself make the dissociated partner liable for an obligation of the partners or the partnership continuing the business. [1997 c.775 §33]

 

(Winding Up Partnership Business)

 

      67.290 Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership business. A partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

      (1) In a partnership at will, the express will of a majority of the partners, excluding any dissociated partner;

      (2) In a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking:

      (a) The express will of all the partners, excluding any dissociated partner, to wind up the partnership business; or

      (b) The expiration of the term or the completion of the undertaking;

      (3) An event agreed to in the partnership agreement resulting in the winding up of the partnership business;

      (4) An event that makes it unlawful for all or substantially all of the business of the partnership to be continued, but a cure of illegality within 90 days after notice to the partnership of the event is effective retroactively to the date of the event for purposes of this section;

      (5) On application by a partner, a judicial determination that:

      (a) The economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated;

      (b) Another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with that partner;

      (c) It is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the partnership business in conformity with the partnership agreement; or

      (d) Other circumstances render a dissolution of the partnership and a winding up of its business equitable;

      (6) On application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest, a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business:

      (a) After the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, if the partnership was for a definite term or particular undertaking at the time of the transfer or entry of the charging order that gave rise to the transfer; or

      (b) At any time, if the partnership was a partnership at will at the time of the transfer or entry of the charging order that gave rise to the transfer; or

      (7) There are no longer two or more partners carrying on as co-owners the business of the partnership for profit. [1997 c.775 §34]

 

      67.295 Partnership continues after dissolution. (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, a partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. The partnership is terminated when the winding up of its business is completed.

      (2) At any time after the dissolution of a partnership and before the winding up of its business is completed, all the partners, excluding any dissociated partner, may waive the right to have the partnership’s business wound up and the partnership terminated. In that event:

      (a) The partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never occurred; and

      (b) The rights of a third party accruing under ORS 67.305 (1) or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver may not be adversely affected. [1997 c.775 §35]

 

      67.300 Right to wind up partnership business. (1) After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership’s business, but on application of any partner, partner’s legal representative or transferee, the circuit court, for good cause shown, may order judicial supervision of the winding up.

      (2) The legal representative of the last surviving partner may wind up a partnership’s business.

      (3) A person winding up a partnership’s business may preserve the partnership business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, settle and close the partnership’s business, dispose of and transfer the partnership’s property, discharge the partnership’s liabilities, distribute the assets of the partnership pursuant to ORS 67.315, settle disputes by mediation, arbitration or otherwise, and perform other necessary acts. [1997 c.775 §36]

 

      67.305 Partner’s power to bind partnership after dissolution. A partnership is bound by a partner’s act after dissolution that:

      (1) Is appropriate for winding up the partnership business; or

      (2) Would have bound the partnership under ORS 67.090 before dissolution, if:

      (a) The other party to the transaction did not have notice of the dissolution; and

      (b) The dissolution had not been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the place, or in each place if more than one, at which the partnership business is regularly carried on. [1997 c.775 §37]

 

      67.310 Partner’s liability to other partners after dissolution. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section and ORS 67.105, after dissolution a partner is liable to the other partners for the partner’s share of any partnership liability incurred under ORS 67.305.

      (2) A partner who, with knowledge of the dissolution, incurs a partnership liability under ORS 67.305 (2) by an act that is not appropriate for winding up the partnership business is liable to the partnership for any damage caused to the partnership arising from the liability. [1997 c.775 §38]

 

      67.315 Settlement of accounts and contributions among partners. (1) In winding up a partnership’s business, the assets of the partnership, including the contributions of the partners required by this section, must be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including, to the extent permitted by law, partners who are creditors. Any surplus must be applied to pay in cash the net amount distributable to partners in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) Each partner is entitled to a settlement of all partnership accounts upon winding up the partnership business. In settling accounts among the partners, the profits and losses that result from the liquidation of the partnership assets must be credited and charged to the partners’ accounts. The partnership shall make a distribution to a partner in an amount equal to any excess of the credits over the charges in the partner’s account. A partner shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to any excess of the charges over the credits in the partner’s account, but excluding from the calculation of such excess, charges attributable to an obligation for which the partner is not personally liable under ORS 67.105.

      (3) If a partner fails to contribute the full amount the partner is personally obligated to contribute under subsection (2) of this section, all the other partners shall contribute, in the proportions in which those partners share partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy the partnership obligations for which they are personally liable under ORS 67.105. A partner or partner’s legal representative may recover from the other partners any contributions the partner makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner’s share of the partnership obligations for which the partner is personally liable under ORS 67.105.

      (4) After the settlement of accounts, each partner shall contribute, in the proportion in which the partner shares partnership losses, the amount necessary to satisfy partnership obligations that were not known at the time of the settlement for which the partner is personally liable under ORS 67.105.

      (5) The estate of a deceased partner is liable for the partner’s obligation to contribute to the partnership.

      (6) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a partnership or a partner, or a person appointed by a court to represent creditors of a partnership or a partner, may enforce a partner’s obligation to contribute to the partnership. [1997 c.775 §39]

      (c) All obligations of each of the business entities that were parties to the merger, including, without limitation, contractual, tort, statutory and administrative obligations, are obligations of the surviving business entity;

      (d) An action or proceeding pending against each of the business entities or its owners that were parties to the merger may be continued as if the merger had not occurred, or the surviving business entity may be substituted as a party to the action or proceeding;

      (e) If a partnership is the surviving business entity, its partnership agreement is amended to the extent provided in the plan of merger;

      (f) The shares or other ownership interests of each partner or other owner that are to be converted into shares or other ownership interests or obligations of the surviving business entity or any other business entity, or into cash or other property, are converted as provided in the plan of merger;

      (g) Liability of an owner for obligations of a business entity, including, without limitation, contractual, tort, statutory and administrative obligations, shall be determined:

      (A) As to obligations incurred prior to merger, according to the laws applicable prior to merger, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this subsection; and

      (B) As to obligations incurred after merger, according to the laws applicable after merger, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this subsection;

      (i) If prior to merger an owner of a business entity was a partner of a partnership or general partner of a limited partnership or a foreign limited partnership, and was personally liable for the business entity’s obligations, and after merger is an owner normally protected from personal liability, then such owner shall continue to be personally liable for the business entity’s obligations incurred during the 12 months following merger, if the other party or parties to the transaction reasonably believed that the owner would be personally liable and had not received notice of the merger.

      (2) Owners of the business entity that merged are entitled to the rights provided in the plan of merger and:

      (a) Any partner who did not vote in favor of the merger is deemed to have dissociated from the partnership effective immediately before the merger unless, within 60 days after the later of the effective date of the merger or the date the partner receives notice of the merger, the partner notifies the partnership of the partner’s desire not to dissociate. A dissociation under this paragraph is not a wrongful withdrawal; and

      (b) In the case of owners of business entities other than partnerships, the rights provided in the statutes applicable to the business entity prior to merger, including, without limitation, any rights to dissent, to dissociate, to withdraw, to recover for breach of any duty or obligation owed by the other owners, and to obtain an appraisal or payment for the value of an owner’s interest.

      (3) The registration of an assumed business name of a business entity under ORS chapter 648 shall not be affected by the merger. [1997 c.775 §45; 1999 c.362 §49]

      (4) If an annual report does not contain the information this section requires, the Secretary of State shall notify the reporting limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership in writing and return the report to the limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership for correction. The limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership must correct the error within 45 days after the Secretary of State gives the notice.

      67.660 Procedure for and effect of administrative revocation. (1) If the Secretary of State determines that one or more grounds exist under ORS 67.655 for revoking the registration of a limited liability partnership, the Secretary of State shall give the limited liability partnership written notice of the determination.

      (2) If the limited liability partnership does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State within 45 days after notice is given that each ground determined by the Secretary of State does not exist, the Secretary of State shall revoke the registration of the partnership as a limited liability partnership. [1997 c.775 §64]

 

      67.665 Reinstatement following administrative revocation. (1) A limited liability partnership for which the Secretary of State has administratively revoked the limited liability partnership’s registration as a limited liability partnership may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement within five years from the date of revocation.

      (2) If the Secretary of State determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (1) of this section, that the information is correct and that the limited liability partnership’s name satisfies the requirements of ORS 67.625, the Secretary of State shall reinstate the registration of the limited liability partnership.

      (3) When effective, the reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative revocation and the partnership’s status as a limited liability partnership continues as if the administrative revocation had never occurred.

      (4) The Secretary of State may waive the requirement under subsection (1) of this section that the limited liability partnership apply for reinstatement within five years after the date of administrative revocation if the limited liability partnership requests the waiver and provides evidence of the limited liability partnership’s continued existence as an active concern during the period of administrative revocation. [1997 c.775 §65; 2011 c.147 §19]

 

      67.670 Appeal from denial of reinstatement. (1) If the Secretary of State denies a limited liability partnership’s application for reinstatement following administrative revocation of its registration as a limited liability partnership, the Secretary of State shall give written notice to the limited liability partnership that explains the reason or reasons for denial.
