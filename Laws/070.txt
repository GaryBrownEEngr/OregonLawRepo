Due diligence is satisfied when it appears from the affidavit that the defendant cannot be found at the last-known address as shown by the records of the Office of Secretary of State, if it appears from the affidavit that inquiry at such address was made within a reasonable time preceding service on the Secretary of State. When due diligence is proved to the court by such an affidavit, the service upon the Secretary of State shall be sufficient valid personal service upon the defendant notwithstanding that the defendant did not actually receive a notice of the service because of the defendant’s failure to notify the Secretary of State of a change in address as required by this chapter.

For purposes of this section, the fair value of the withdrawing partner’s interest in the limited partnership shall be determined by assuming that any distribution to which the withdrawing partner is otherwise entitled by reason of this section has been made. [1985 c.677 §35]

 

      70.265 Rights of partner regarding distribution; remedies. (1) Except as provided in writing in the partnership agreement, a partner has no right to demand and receive any distribution from a limited partnership in any form other than cash, regardless of the nature of the partner’s contribution. Except as provided in writing in the partnership agreement, a partner may not be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in kind from a limited partnership to the extent that the percentage of the asset distributed to the partner exceeds a percentage of that asset that is equal to the percentage in which the partner shares in distributions from the limited partnership.

      (2) When a partner becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the partner has the status of and is entitled to all remedies available to a creditor of the limited partnership with respect to the distribution. [1985 c.677 §§36,37; 1987 c.543 §24]

A partner may not receive a distribution from a limited partnership to the extent that, after giving effect to the distribution, the liabilities of the limited partnership exceed the fair value of the partnership assets.

      (2) If a partner has received the return of any part of the partner’s contribution in violation of the partnership agreement or this chapter, the partner is liable to the limited partnership for a period of six years after receipt of the return for the amount of the contribution wrongfully returned.

      (3) A partner receives a return of the partner’s contribution to the extent that a distribution to the partner reduces the partner’s share of the fair value of the net assets of the limited partnership below the value of the partner’s contribution, as set forth in the partnership records required to be kept pursuant to ORS 70.050, that has not been distributed to the partner.

      70.290 Assignability of partnership interest. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all the partner’s partnership interest. [1985 c.677 §41]

 

      70.295 Rights of judgment creditor of partner. On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the partnership interest. This chapter does not deprive any partner of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the partner’s partnership interest. [1985 c.677 §42]

 

      70.300 Assignee of partnership interest as limited partner. (1) An assignee of a partnership interest, including an assignee of a general partner, may become a limited partner if and to the extent that:

      (a) The assignor gives the assignee that right in accordance with authority described in the partnership agreement; or

      (b) All other partners consent.

      (2) An assignee who has become a limited partner has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a limited partner under the partnership agreement and this chapter. An assignee who becomes a limited partner also is liable for the obligations of the assignor to make and return contributions as provided in ORS 70.225 to 70.275. However, the assignee is not obligated for liabilities that were unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a limited partner and that could not be ascertained from the certificate of limited partnership.

      (3) If an assignee of a partnership interest becomes a limited partner, the assignor is not released from the assignor’s liability to the limited partnership under ORS 70.105 and 70.230. [1985 c.677 §43; 1987 c.543 §26]

 

      70.305 Death, incompetency, dissolution or termination of partner. (1) If a partner who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges the partner to be incompetent to manage the partner’s person or property, the partner’s executor, administrator, guardian, conservator or other legal representative may exercise all the partner’s rights for the purpose of settling the partner’s estate or administering the partner’s property, including any power the partner held to give an assignee the right to become a limited partner.

      (2) If a partner is a corporation, trust or other entity and is dissolved or terminated, the powers of that partner may be exercised by its legal representative or successor. [1985 c.677 §44]

 

DISSOLUTION

 

      70.325 When dissolution occurs. A limited partnership is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up when the first of any of the following events occurs:

      (1) Upon reaching the time for dissolution specified in the certificate of limited partnership.

      (2) Upon the happening of events specified in writing in the partnership agreement.

      (3) By the vote or such other action of the partners as is provided in writing in the partnership agreement, or if the partnership agreement does not so provide in writing, by the written consent of all partners.

      (4) An event of withdrawal of a general partner unless at the time there is at least one other general partner and the written provisions of the partnership agreement permit the business of the limited partnership to be carried on by the remaining general partner and that partner does so. However, a limited partnership is not dissolved under this subsection and is not required to be wound up by reason of any event of withdrawal if, not later than the 90th day after the withdrawal, all partners agree in writing to continue the business of the limited partnership and to the appointment of one or more additional general partners if necessary or desired.

      (5) Entry of a judgment or judicial order of involuntary dissolution under ORS 70.330. [1985 c.677 §45; 1987 c.543 §27]

 

      70.330 Judgment of dissolution. On application by or for a partner, the circuit court may enter a judgment for the dissolution of a limited partnership whenever it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity with the partnership agreement. [1985 c.677 §46; 2003 c.576 §332]

 

      70.335 Who may wind up partnership affairs. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, the general partners who have not wrongfully dissolved a limited partnership or, if no such general partners, the limited partners, may wind up the limited partnership’s affairs. However, the circuit court upon cause shown may wind up the limited partnership’s affairs upon application of any partner, or the partner’s legal representative or assignee. [1985 c.677 §47]

      (b) The limited partnership need not file with the Secretary of State a certificate of amendment that would cause its certificate of limited partnership to comply with this chapter until the occurrence of an event that, under this chapter, requires the filing of a certificate of amendment. If any limited partnership formed before July 1, 1986, fails to file such a certificate of amendment required under this chapter, the limited partnership nevertheless shall be governed by this chapter. [Formerly 70.455]

      (5) If the Secretary of State finds that the report conforms to the requirements of this chapter and all fees have been paid, the Secretary of State shall file the report.
