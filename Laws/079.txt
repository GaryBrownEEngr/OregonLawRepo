      (a) Value has been given;

      (b) The debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party; and

      (c) One of the following conditions is met:

      (B) Collect, compromise, enforce or otherwise deal with collateral;

      (a) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.

      (b) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.

      (A) The security interest in proceeds is perfected;

      (B) The proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and

      (5) Subsection (4) of this section applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property or letter-of-credit rights.

      (6) Subsections (1) to (5) of this section are subject to:

      (a) Subsection (7) of this section and the other provisions of ORS 79.0301 to 79.0342;

(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, for purposes of determining the priority of a perfected security interest under ORS 79.0322 (1)(a), perfection of the security interest dates from the time an advance is made to the extent that the security interest secures an advance that:

      (a) Is made while the security interest is perfected only:

      (A) Under ORS 79.0309 when it attaches; or

      (B) Temporarily under ORS 79.0312 (5), (6) or (7); and

      (a) Without knowledge of the lien; or

      (b) Pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lien.

      (3) Subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not apply to a security interest held by a secured party that is a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles or promissory notes or a consignor.

      (3) Subsection (2)(b) to (d) of this section applies only if the holder of the conflicting security interest had filed a financing statement covering the same types of inventory:

      (a) If the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing; or

      (b) If the purchase-money security interest is temporarily perfected without filing or possession under ORS 79.0312 (6), before the beginning of the 20-day period thereunder.

      (a) The purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the livestock;

      (b) The purchase-money secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting security interest;

      (c) The holder of the conflicting security interest receives the notification within six months before the debtor receives possession of the livestock; and

      (7) If more than one security interest qualifies for priority in the same collateral under subsection (1), (2), (4) or (6) of this section:

      (a) A security interest securing an obligation incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral has priority over a security interest securing an obligation incurred for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of collateral; and

      (b) In all other cases, ORS 79.0322 (1) applies to the qualifying security interests. [2001 c.445 §44]

      (b) Arose solely under ORS 72.7110 (3) or 72A.5080 (5). [2001 c.445 §45]

      (2) The other provisions of ORS 79.0301 to 79.0342 determine the priority among conflicting security interests in the same collateral perfected by filed financing statements described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) The chattel paper does not indicate that it has been assigned to an identified assignee other than the purchaser.

      (2) A purchaser of chattel paper has priority over a security interest in the chattel paper which is claimed other than merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest if the purchaser gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper under ORS 79.0105 in good faith, in the ordinary course of the purchaser’s business, and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party.

(1) This chapter does not limit the rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated or a protected purchaser of a security. These holders or purchasers take priority over an earlier security interest, even if perfected, to the extent provided in ORS chapters 73, 77 and 78.

      (2) This chapter does not limit the rights of or impose liability on a person to the extent that the person is protected against the assertion of a claim under ORS chapter 78.

      79.0334 UCC 9-334. Priority of security interests in fixtures and crops. (1) A security interest under this chapter may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this chapter in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.

      (2) This chapter does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.

      (3) In cases not governed by subsections (4) to (8) of this section, a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8) of this section, a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:

      (a) The security interest is a purchase-money security interest;

      (b) The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and

      (c) The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter.

      (A) Is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and

      (B) Has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;

      (b) Before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this chapter and the fixtures are readily removable:

      (A) Factory or office machines;

      (B) Equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or

      (C) Replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;

      (d) The security interest is:

      (A) Created in a manufactured structure in a manufactured-structure transaction; and

      (B) Perfected pursuant to ORS 446.611 or by recording in a county deed record as provided in ORS 446.626.

      (6) A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:

      (a) The encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or

      (b) The debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.

      (7) The priority of the security interest under subsection (6)(b) of this section continues for a reasonable time if the debtor’s right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.

      (8) A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.

      (9) A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property. [2001 c.445 §54; 2003 c.655 §53]

 

      79.0335 UCC 9-335. Accessions. (1) A security interest may be created in an accession and continues in collateral that becomes an accession.

      (2) If a security interest is perfected when the collateral becomes an accession, the security interest remains perfected in the collateral.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (4) and (7) of this section, the other provisions of ORS 79.0301 to 79.0342 determine the priority of a security interest in an accession.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7) of this section, a security interest in an accession is subordinate to a security interest in the whole which is perfected by compliance with ORS 79.0311 (2), 446.611 or 446.626.

      (5) After default, subject to ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628, a secured party may remove an accession from other goods if the security interest in the accession has priority over the claims of every person having an interest in the whole.

      (6) A secured party that removes an accession from other goods under subsection (5) of this section shall promptly reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or of the other goods, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods. The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse.

      (7) A security interest in an accession has priority over a security interest in the whole which is perfected by compliance with the requirements of ORS 79.0311 (2) or with ORS 446.611 or 446.626 if the security interest in the accession is a purchase money security interest that is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the accession or within 20 days thereafter. [2001 c.445 §55; 2003 c.655 §54; 2012 c.12 §9]

 

      79.0336 UCC 9-336. Commingled goods. (1) As used in this section, “commingled goods” means goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that their identity is lost in a product or mass.

      (2) A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such. However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods.

      (3) If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass.

      (4) If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (3) of this section is perfected.

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6) of this section, the other provisions of ORS 79.0301 to 79.0342 determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) If more than one security interest attaches to the product or mass under subsection (3) of this section, the following rules determine priority:

      (a) A security interest that is perfected under subsection (4) of this section has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods.

      (b) If more than one security interest is perfected under subsection (4) of this section, the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods. [2001 c.445 §56]

 

      79.0337 UCC 9-337. Priority of security interests in goods covered by certificate of title. If, while a security interest in goods is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction, this state issues a certificate of title or manufactured structure ownership document or records a manufactured structure in a county deed record and the certificate, document or record does not show that the goods are subject to the security interest or contain a statement that they may be subject to security interests not shown on the certificate, document or record:

      (1) A buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate of title or manufactured structure ownership document or recording in the deed record and without knowledge of the security interest; and

      (2) The security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under ORS 79.0311 (2), 446.611 or 446.626, after issuance of the certificate of title or manufactured structure ownership document or recording in the deed record and without the conflicting secured party’s knowledge of the security interest. [2001 c.445 §57; 2003 c.655 §55]

 

      79.0338 UCC 9-338. Priority of security interest or agricultural lien perfected by filed financing statement providing certain incorrect information. Except for information on the jurisdiction of organization for an organization that is not a registered organization, if a security interest or agricultural lien is perfected by a filed financing statement providing information described in ORS 79.0516 (2)(e) which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed:

      (1) The security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to a conflicting perfected security interest in the collateral to the extent that the holder of the conflicting security interest gives value in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information; and

      (2) A purchaser, other than a secured party, of the collateral takes free of the security interest or agricultural lien to the extent that, in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments or a security certificate, receives delivery of the collateral. [2001 c.445 §58; 2009 c.181 §101]

 

      79.0339 UCC 9-339. Priority subject to subordination. This chapter does not preclude subordination by agreement by a person entitled to priority. [2001 c.445 §59]

 

(Rights of Bank)

 

      79.0340 UCC 9-340. Effectiveness of right of recoupment or setoff against deposit account. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a bank with which a deposit account is maintained may exercise any right of recoupment or setoff against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the application of this chapter to a security interest in a deposit account does not affect a right of recoupment or setoff of the secured party as to a deposit account maintained with the secured party.

      (3) The exercise by a bank of a setoff against a deposit account is ineffective against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account which is perfected by control under ORS 79.0104 (1)(c), if the setoff is based on a claim against the debtor. [2001 c.445 §60]

 

      79.0341 UCC 9-341. Bank’s rights and duties with respect to deposit account. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0340 (3), and unless the bank otherwise agrees in an authenticated record, a bank’s rights and duties with respect to a deposit account maintained with the bank are not terminated, suspended, or modified by:

      (1) The creation, attachment or perfection of a security interest in the deposit account;

      (2) The bank’s knowledge of the security interest; or

      (3) The bank’s receipt of instructions from the secured party. [2001 c.445 §61]

 

      79.0342 UCC 9-342. Bank’s right to refuse to enter into or disclose existence of control agreement. This chapter does not require a bank to enter into an agreement of the kind described in ORS 79.0104 (1)(b), even if its customer so requests or directs. A bank that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another person unless requested to do so by its customer. [2001 c.445 §62]

 

RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

 

      79.0401 UCC 9-401. Alienability of debtor’s rights. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section and ORS 79.0406, 79.0407, 79.0408 and 79.0409, whether a debtor’s rights in collateral may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred is governed by law other than this chapter.

      (2) An agreement between the debtor and secured party which prohibits a transfer of the debtor’s rights in collateral or makes the transfer a default does not prevent the transfer from taking effect. [2001 c.445 §63]

 

      79.0402 UCC 9-402. Secured party not obligated on contract of debtor or in tort. The existence of a security interest, agricultural lien, or authority given to a debtor to dispose of or use collateral, without more, does not subject a secured party to liability in contract or tort for the debtor’s acts or omissions. [2001 c.445 §64]

 

      79.0403 UCC 9-403. Agreement not to assert defenses against assignee. (1) As used in this section, “value” has the meaning provided in ORS 73.0303 (1).

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by an assignee that takes an assignment:

      (a) For value;

      (b) In good faith;

      (c) Without notice of a claim of a property or possessory right to the property assigned; and

      (d) Without notice of a defense or claim in recoupment of the type that may be asserted against a person entitled to enforce a negotiable instrument under ORS 73.0305 (1).

      (3) Subsection (2) of this section does not apply to defenses of a type that may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under ORS 73.0305 (2).

      (4) In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor’s obligation, law other than this chapter requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the rights of an assignee are subject to claims or defenses that the account debtor could assert against the original obligee, and the record does not include such a statement:

      (a) The record has the same effect as if the record included such a statement; and

      (b) The account debtor may assert against an assignee those claims and defenses that would have been available if the record included such a statement.

      (5) This section is subject to law other than this chapter which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

      (6) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, this section does not displace law other than this chapter which gives effect to an agreement by an account debtor not to assert a claim or defense against an assignee. [2001 c.445 §65]

 

      79.0404 UCC 9-404. Rights acquired by assignee; claims and defenses against assignee. (1) Unless an account debtor has made an enforceable agreement not to assert defenses or claims and subject to subsections (2) to (5) of this section, the rights of an assignee are subject to:

      (a) All terms of the agreement between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the transaction that gave rise to the contract; and

      (b) Any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives a notification of the assignment authenticated by the assignor or the assignee.

      (2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section and except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, the claim of an account debtor against an assignor may be asserted against an assignee under subsection (1) of this section only to reduce the amount the account debtor owes.

      (3) This section is subject to law other than this chapter which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

      (4) In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor’s obligation, law other than this chapter requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the account debtor’s recovery against an assignee with respect to claims and defenses against the assignor may not exceed amounts paid by the account debtor under the record, and the record does not include such a statement, the extent to which a claim of an account debtor against the assignor may be asserted against an assignee is determined as if the record included such a statement.

      (5) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. [2001 c.445 §66]

 

      79.0405 UCC 9-405. Modification of assigned contract. (1) A modification of or substitution for an assigned contract is effective against an assignee if made in good faith. The assignee acquires corresponding rights under the modified or substituted contract. The assignment may provide that the modification or substitution is a breach of contract by the assignor. This subsection is subject to subsections (2) to (4) of this section.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies to the extent that:

      (a) The right to payment or a part thereof under an assigned contract has not been fully earned by performance; or

      (b) The right to payment or a part thereof has been fully earned by performance and the account debtor has not received notification of the assignment under ORS 79.0406 (1).

      (3) This section is subject to law other than this chapter which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

      (4) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. [2001 c.445 §67]

 

      79.0406 UCC 9-406. Discharge of account debtor; notification of assignment; identification and proof of assignment; restrictions on assignment of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles and promissory notes ineffective. (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (9) of this section, an account debtor on an account, chattel paper or a payment intangible may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor until, but not after, the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated by the assignor or the assignee, that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee. After receipt of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not discharge the obligation by paying the assignor.

      (2) Subject to subsection (8) of this section, notification is ineffective under subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) If it does not reasonably identify the rights assigned;

      (b) To the extent that an agreement between an account debtor and a seller of a payment intangible limits the account debtor’s duty to pay a person other than the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this chapter; or

      (c) At the option of an account debtor, if the notification notifies the account debtor to make less than the full amount of any installment or other periodic payment to the assignee, even if:

      (A) Only a portion of the account, chattel paper or payment intangible has been assigned to that assignee;

      (B) A portion has been assigned to another assignee; or

      (C) The account debtor knows that the assignment to that assignee is limited.

      (3) Subject to subsection (8) of this section, if requested by the account debtor, an assignee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section and ORS 72A.3030 and 79.0407, and subject to subsection (8) of this section, a term in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a promissory note is ineffective to the extent that it:

      (a) Prohibits, restricts or requires the consent of the account debtor or person obligated on the promissory note to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in, the account, chattel paper, payment intangible or promissory note; or

      (b) Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible or promissory note.

      (5) Subsection (4) of this section does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under ORS 79.0610 or an acceptance of collateral under ORS 79.0620.

      (7) Subject to subsection (8) of this section, an account debtor may not waive or vary its option under subsection (2)(c) of this section.

      (9)(a) This section does not apply to the assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable.

The limitation in this paragraph is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in such cases. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in such cases and may continue to apply established approaches.

      (c) Subsections (4) and (6) of this section do not apply to the following:

      (d) Subsection (6) of this section does not apply to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in, a right when the transfer of the right is prohibited or restricted by ORS 147.325, 461.250 (8) or 656.234, to the extent that ORS 147.325, 461.250 (8) or 656.234 is inconsistent with subsection (6) of this section.

      (10) Except to the extent otherwise provided in subsection (9) of this section, this section prevails over any inconsistent provision of an existing or future statute unless the provision refers expressly to this section and states that the provision prevails over this section.

      (3) The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor’s interest under the lease contract or the lessor’s residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee’s prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of ORS 72A.3030 (4) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor. [2001 c.445 §69]

      79.0502 UCC 9-502. Contents of financing statement; record of mortgage as financing statement; time of filing financing statement. (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, a financing statement is sufficient only if it:

      (a) Provides the name of the debtor;

      (b) Provides the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party; and

      (c) Indicates the collateral covered by the financing statement.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0501 (2), to be sufficient, a financing statement that covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, or which is filed as a fixture filing and covers goods that are or are to become fixtures, must satisfy subsection (1) of this section and also:

      (a) Indicate that it covers this type of collateral;

      (b) Indicate that it is to be filed for record in the real property records;

      (c) Provide a description of the real property to which the collateral is related sufficient to give constructive notice of a mortgage under the law of this state if the description were contained in a record of the mortgage of the real property; and

      (d) If the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real property, provide the name of a record owner.

      (3) A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if:

      (a) The record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers;

      (b) The goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut;

      (c) The record satisfies the requirements for a financing statement in this section except that:

      (A) The record need not indicate that the record is to be filed in the real property records; and

      (B) If the record provides the name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor, even if the debtor is an individual to whom ORS 79.0503 (1)(d) applies, the record sufficiently provides the name of a debtor; and

      (d) The record is duly recorded.

      (4) A financing statement may be filed before a security agreement is made or a security interest otherwise attaches. [2001 c.445 §73; 2015 c.538 §1]

 

      79.0503 UCC 9-503. Name of debtor and secured party. (1) A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:

      (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization’s name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization’s jurisdiction of organization that purports to state, amend or restate the registered organization’s name;

      (b) Subject to subsection (6) of this section, if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative;

      (c) If the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:

      (A) Provides, as the name of the debtor:

      (i) If the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified; or

      (ii) If the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator; and

      (B) In a separate part of the financing statement:

      (i) If the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph, indicates that the collateral is held in trust; or

      (ii) If the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, provides additional information sufficient to distinguish the trust from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors or the same testator and indicates that the collateral is held in a trust, unless the additional information so indicates;

      (d) Subject to subsection (7) of this section, if the debtor is an individual to whom this state has issued a driver license or identification card that has not expired, only if the financing statement provides the name of the individual that is indicated on the driver license or identification card;

      (e) If the debtor is an individual to whom paragraph (d) of this subsection does not apply, only if the financing statement provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor; and

      (f) In other cases:

      (A) If the debtor has a name, only if the financing statement provides the organizational name of the debtor; and

      (B) If the debtor does not have a name, only if the financing statement provides the names of the partners, members, associates or other persons comprising the debtor in a manner that each name provided would be sufficient if the person named were the debtor.

      (2) A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (1) of this section is not rendered ineffective by the absence of:

      (a) A trade name or other name of the debtor; or

      (b) Unless required under subsection (1)(f)(B) of this section, names of partners, members, associates or other persons comprising the debtor.

      (3) A financing statement that provides only the debtor’s trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.

      (4) Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.

      (5) A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party.

      (6) The name of the decedent indicated on the order appointing the personal representative of the decedent issued by the court having jurisdiction over the collateral is sufficient as the name of the decedent under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (7) If this state has issued to an individual more than one driver license or identification card of a kind described in subsection (1)(d) of this section, the one that was issued most recently is the one to which subsection (1)(d) of this section refers.

      (8) As used in this section, “name of the settlor or testator” means:

      (a) If the settlor is a registered organization, the name that is stated to be the settlor’s name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the settlor’s jurisdiction of organization that purports to state, amend or restate the settlor’s name; or

      (b) In other cases, the name of the settlor or testator indicated in the trust’s organic record. [2001 c.445 §74; 2012 c.12 §12; 2015 c.538 §2]

 

      79.0504 UCC 9-504. Indication of collateral. A financing statement sufficiently indicates the collateral that it covers if the financing statement provides:

      (1) A description of the collateral pursuant to ORS 79.0108; or

      (2) An indication that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal property. [2001 c.445 §75]

 

      79.0505 UCC 9-505. Filing and compliance with other statutes and treaties for consignments, leases, other bailments and other transactions. (1) A consignor, lessor or other bailor of goods, a licensor or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in ORS 79.0311 (1), using the terms “consignor,” “consignee,” “lessor,” “lessee,” “bailor,” “bailee,” “licensor,” “licensee,” “owner,” “registered owner,” “buyer,” “seller” or words of similar import, instead of the terms “secured party” and “debtor.”

      (2) ORS 79.0501 to 79.0528 apply to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (1) of this section and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under ORS 79.0311 (2), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance. [2001 c.445 §76]

 

      79.0506 UCC 9-506. Effect of errors or omissions. (1) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of ORS 79.0501 to 79.0528 is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with ORS 79.0503 (1) is seriously misleading.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, if a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor’s correct name, using the filing office’s standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with ORS 79.0503 (1), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.

      (4) If the filing office’s standard search logic so changes that a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor’s correct name, using the changed search logic, would not disclose a financing statement previously deemed not to be seriously misleading by reason of subsection (3) of this section, the financing statement is effective except against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon a search using the changed search logic.

      (5) For purposes of ORS 79.0508 (2), the “debtor’s correct name” in subsections (3) and (5) of this section means the correct name of the new debtor. [2001 c.445 §77]

 

      79.0507 UCC 9-507. Effect of certain events on effectiveness of financing statement. (1) A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section and ORS 79.0506 (4) and 79.0508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under ORS 79.0506.

      (3) If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under ORS 79.0503 (1) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under ORS 79.0506:

      (a) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and

      (b) The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the financing statement becomes seriously misleading. [2001 c.445 §78; 2012 c.12 §13]

 

      79.0508 UCC 9-508. Effectiveness of financing statement if new debtor becomes bound by security agreement. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a filed financing statement naming an original debtor is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights to the extent that the financing statement would have been effective had the original debtor acquired rights in the collateral.

      (2) If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed financing statement that is effective under subsection (1) of this section to be seriously misleading under ORS 79.0506:

      (a) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under ORS 79.0203 (4); and

      (b) The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor more than four months after the new debtor becomes bound under ORS 79.0203 (4) unless an initial financing statement providing the name of the new debtor is filed before the expiration of that time.

      (3) This section does not apply to collateral as to which a filed financing statement remains effective against the new debtor under ORS 79.0507 (1). [2001 c.445 §79]

 

      79.0509 UCC 9-509. Persons entitled to file a record. (1) A person may file an initial financing statement, amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement, or amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if:

      (a) The debtor authorizes the filing in an authenticated record or pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section; or

      (b) The person holds an agricultural lien that has become effective at the time of filing and the financing statement covers only collateral in which the person holds an agricultural lien.

      (2) By authenticating or becoming bound as debtor by a security agreement, a debtor or new debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering:

      (a) The collateral described in the security agreement; and

      (b) Property that becomes collateral under ORS 79.0315 (1)(b), whether or not the security agreement expressly covers proceeds.

      (3) By acquiring collateral in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues under ORS 79.0315 (1)(a), a debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering the collateral and property that becomes collateral under ORS 79.0315 (1)(b).

      (4) A person may file an amendment other than an amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement or an amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if:

      (a) The secured party of record authorizes the filing; or

      (b) The amendment is a termination statement for a financing statement as to which the secured party of record has failed to file or send a termination statement as required by ORS 79.0513 (1) or (3), the debtor authorizes the filing, and the termination statement indicates that the debtor authorized it to be filed.

      (5) If there is more than one secured party of record for a financing statement, each secured party of record may authorize the filing of an amendment under subsection (4) of this section. [2001 c.445 §80]

 

      79.0510 UCC 9-510. Effectiveness of filed record. (1) A filed record is effective only to the extent that it was filed by a person that may file it under ORS 79.0509.

      (2) A record authorized by one secured party of record does not affect the financing statement with respect to another secured party of record.

      (3) A continuation statement that is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by ORS 79.0515 (4) is ineffective. [2001 c.445 §81]

 

      79.0511 UCC 9-511. Secured party of record. (1) A secured party of record with respect to a financing statement is a person whose name is provided as the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party in an initial financing statement that has been filed. If an initial financing statement is filed under ORS 79.0514 (1), the assignee named in the initial financing statement is the secured party of record with respect to the financing statement.

      (2) If an amendment of a financing statement which provides the name of a person as a secured party or a representative of a secured party is filed, the person named in the amendment is a secured party of record. If an amendment is filed under ORS 79.0514 (2), the assignee named in the amendment is a secured party of record.

      (3) A person remains a secured party of record until the filing of an amendment of the financing statement which deletes the person. [2001 c.445 §82]

 

      79.0512 UCC 9-512. Amendment of financing statement. (1) Subject to ORS 79.0509, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or, subject to subsection (5) of this section, otherwise amend the information provided in, a financing statement by filing an amendment that:

      (a) Identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which the amendment relates; and

      (b) If the amendment relates to an initial financing statement filed or recorded in a filing office described in ORS 79.0501 (1)(a), provides the information specified in ORS 79.0502 (2).

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0515, the filing of an amendment does not extend the period of effectiveness of the financing statement.

      (3) A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds collateral is effective as to the added collateral only from the date of the filing of the amendment.

      (4) A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds a debtor is effective as to the added debtor only from the date of the filing of the amendment.

      (5) An amendment is ineffective to the extent it:

      (a) Purports to delete all debtors and fails to provide the name of a debtor to be covered by the financing statement; or

      (b) Purports to delete all secured parties of record and fails to provide the name of a new secured party of record. [2001 c.445 §83; 2003 c.14 §27]

 

      79.0513 UCC 9-513. Termination statement. (1) A secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to file a termination statement for the financing statement if the financing statement covers consumer goods and:

      (a) There is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; or

      (b) The debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement.

      (b) If earlier, within 20 days after the secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor.

      (3) In cases not governed by subsection (1) of this section, within 20 days after a secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor, the secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to send to the debtor a termination statement for the financing statement or file the termination statement in the filing office if:

      (a) Except in the case of a financing statement covering accounts or chattel paper that has been sold or goods that are the subject of a consignment, there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value;

      (b) The financing statement covers accounts or chattel paper that has been sold but as to which the account debtor or other person obligated has discharged its obligation;

      (c) The financing statement covers goods that were the subject of a consignment to the debtor but are not in the debtor’s possession; or

      (d) The debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0510, upon the filing of a termination statement with the filing office, the financing statement to which the termination statement relates ceases to be effective. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0510, for purposes of ORS 79.0519 (7), 79.0522 (1) and 79.0523 (3), the filing with the filing office of a termination statement relating to a financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a transmitting utility also causes the effectiveness of the financing statement to lapse. [2001 c.445 §84]

 

      79.0514 UCC 9-514. Assignment of powers of secured party of record. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, an initial financing statement may reflect an assignment of all of the secured party’s power to authorize an amendment to the financing statement by providing the name and mailing address of the assignee as the name and address of the secured party.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a secured party of record may assign of record all or part of its power to authorize an amendment to a financing statement by filing in the filing office an amendment of the financing statement which:

      (a) Identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which it relates;

      (b) Provides the name of the assignor; and

      (c) Provides the name and mailing address of the assignee.

      (3) An assignment of record of a security interest in a fixture covered by a record of a mortgage which is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under ORS 79.0502 (3) may be made only by an assignment of record of the mortgage in the manner provided by law of this state other than the Uniform Commercial Code. [2001 c.445 §85]

 

      79.0515 UCC 9-515. Duration and effectiveness of financing statement; effect of lapsed financing statement; renewal notice; rules. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2), (5), (6) and (7) of this section, a filed financing statement is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5), (6) and (7) of this section, an initial financing statement filed in connection with a public-finance transaction is effective for a period of 30 years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a public-finance transaction.

      (3) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (4) of this section. Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

      (4) A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (1) of this section or the 30-year period specified in subsection (2) of this section, whichever is applicable.

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0510, upon timely filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years commencing on the day on which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (3) of this section, unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (4) of this section. Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.

      (6) If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed.

      (7) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under ORS 79.0502 (3) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.

      (8) The Secretary of State upon request shall provide a renewal notice report to a secured party by electronic mail or other electronic means. The renewal notice report must include:

      (a) The file number and expiration date for each financing statement or effective financing statement, as defined in ORS 80.100, or a continuation of the financing statement or effective financing statement, that:

      (A) Lists the secured party; and

      (B) Will expire within a period that begins 90 days after the date of the notice and ends one year after the date of the notice;

      (b) The name of the debtor;

      (c) A statement that to continue the financing statement or effective financing statement, the secured party may file a continuation statement or an initial financing statement under section 191 or 192, chapter 445, Oregon Laws 2001; and

      (d) Other information that the Secretary of State specifies by rule. [2001 c.445 §§86,86a; 2003 c.655 §56; 2009 c.597 §1; 2012 c.12 §14]

 

      79.0516 UCC 9-516. What constitutes filing; effectiveness of filing. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, communication of a record to and receipt by a filing office and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office constitutes filing.

      (2) Filing does not occur with respect to a record that a filing office refuses to accept because:

      (a) The record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the filing office;

      (b) An amount equal to or greater than the applicable filing fee is not tendered;

      (c) The filing office is unable to index the record because:

      (A) In the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the debtor;

      (B) In the case of an amendment or information statement, the record:

      (i) Does not identify the initial financing statement as required by ORS 79.0512 or 79.0518, as applicable; or

      (ii) Identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under ORS 79.0515, and the filing office is that described in ORS 79.0501 (1)(b);

      (C) In the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does not identify the debtor’s surname; or

      (D) In the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in ORS 79.0501 (1)(a), the record does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which it relates;

      (d) In the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a secured party of record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the secured party of record;

      (e) In the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the record does not:

      (A) Provide a mailing address for the debtor, unless the initial financing statement or amendment is included in a mortgage and the filing office is that described in ORS 79.0501 (1)(a); or

      (B) Indicate whether the name provided as the name of the debtor is the name of an individual or an organization, unless the initial financing statement or amendment is included in a mortgage and the filing office is that described in ORS 79.0501 (1)(a);

      (f) In the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under ORS 79.0514 (1) or an amendment filed under ORS 79.0514 (2), the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee;

      (g) In the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by ORS 79.0515 (4) and the filing office is that described in ORS 79.0501 (1)(b); or

      (h) In the case of a record presented for filing at the filing office described in ORS 79.0501 (1)(b), the record on its face reveals, based on factors such as whether the debtor and the secured party are the same person or whether the collateral described is within the scope of this chapter, that the record is being filed for a purpose other than a transaction that is within the scope of this chapter.

      (3) For purposes of subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) A record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information; and

      (b) A record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by ORS 79.0512, 79.0514 or 79.0518, is an initial financing statement.

      (4) A record that is communicated to and received by the filing office with tender of the filing fee under subsection (1) of this section, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (2) of this section, is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files. [2001 c.445 §87; 2003 c.14 §28; 2003 c.267 §2; 2012 c.12 §15]

 

      79.0517 UCC 9-517. Effect of indexing errors. The failure of the filing office to index a record correctly does not affect the effectiveness of the filed record. [2001 c.445 §88]

 

      79.0518 UCC 9-518. Claim concerning inaccurate or wrongfully filed record. (1) A person may file in the filing office an information statement with respect to a record indexed there under the person’s name if the person believes that the record is inaccurate or was wrongfully filed.

      (2) An information statement under subsection (1) of this section must:

      (a) Identify the record to which it relates by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates;

      (b) Indicate that it is an information statement;

      (a) Under the names of the debtor and of each owner of record shown on the financing statement as if they were the mortgagors under a mortgage of the real property described; and

      (b) To the extent that the law of this state provides for indexing of records of mortgages under the name of the mortgagee, under the name of the secured party as if the secured party were the mortgagee thereunder, or, if indexing is by description, as if the financing statement were a record of a mortgage of the real property described.

      (5) If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index an assignment filed under ORS 79.0514 (1) or an amendment filed under ORS 79.0514 (2):

      (a) Under the name of the assignor as grantor; and

If the secured party files a timely request for a hearing, the communication must remain indexed until the case is finally concluded.

      (3) A filed financing statement satisfying ORS 79.0502 (1) and (2) is effective, even if the filing office is required to refuse to accept it for filing under subsection (1) of this section.

(Noncompliance With Chapter)

 

      79.0625 UCC 9-625. Remedies for secured party’s failure to comply with article. (1) If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this chapter, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions.

      (2) Subject to subsections (3), (4) and (6) of this section, a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this chapter. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor’s inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0628:

      (a) A person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may, in an individual action only, recover damages under subsection (2) of this section for its loss;

      (b) If the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628 may, in an individual action only, recover an amount not less than $1,000; and

      (c) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this subsection.

      (4) A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under ORS 79.0626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus. However, a debtor or secondary obligor whose deficiency is eliminated or reduced under ORS 79.0626 may not otherwise recover under subsection (2) of this section for noncompliance with the provisions of ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628 relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance.

      (5) Regarding a transaction that is a consumer transaction or in which the collateral is consumer goods, in addition to any damages recoverable under subsection (2) of this section, the debtor, consumer obligor, or person named as a debtor in a filed record, as applicable, may, in an individual action only, recover $500 for each instance from a person that:

      (a) Fails to comply with ORS 79.0208;

      (b) Fails to comply with ORS 79.0209;

      (c) After July 1, 2001, files a record that the person is not entitled to file under ORS 79.0509 (1) if the record is not released or terminated within 10 days after receipt by the secured party of an authenticated request from the debtor that explains the basis for the request;

      (d) Fails to cause the secured party of record to file or send a termination statement as required by ORS 79.0513 (1) or (3); or

      (e) Fails to comply with ORS 79.0616 (2) and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance.

      (6) A debtor or consumer obligor may recover damages under subsection (2) of this section and, in addition, $500 in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with a request under ORS 79.0210. A recipient of a request under ORS 79.0210 which never claimed an interest in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under ORS 79.0210 has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within the meaning of this subsection.

      (7) If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under ORS 79.0210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure. [2001 c.445 §123]

 

      79.0626 UCC 9-626. Action in which deficiency or surplus is in issue. (1) In an action arising from a transaction, other than a consumer transaction, in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply:

      (a) A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628 relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party’s compliance in issue.

      (b) If the secured party’s compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628.

      (c) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 79.0628, if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628 relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney fees exceeds the greater of:

      (A) The proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance; or

      (B) The amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628 relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (c)(B) of this subsection, the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum.

      (e) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under ORS 79.0615 (6), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.

      (2) The limitation of the rules in subsection (1) of this section to transactions other than consumer transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer transactions and may continue to apply established approaches. [2001 c.445 §124]

 

      79.0627 UCC 9-627. Determination of whether conduct was commercially reasonable. (1) The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.

      (2) A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made:

      (a) In the usual manner on any recognized market;

      (b) At the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition; or

      (c) Otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.

      (3) A collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved:

      (a) In a judicial proceeding;

      (b) By a bona fide creditors’ committee;

      (c) By a representative of creditors; or

      (d) By an assignee for the benefit of creditors.

      (4) Approval under subsection (3) of this section need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is not commercially reasonable. [2001 c.445 §125]

 

      79.0628 UCC 9-628. Nonliability and limitation on liability of secured party; liability of secondary obligor. (1) Unless a secured party knows that a person is a debtor or obligor, knows the identity of the person and knows how to communicate with the person:

      (a) The secured party is not liable to the person, or to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against the person, for failure to comply with this chapter; and

      (b) The secured party’s failure to comply with this chapter does not affect the liability of the person for a deficiency.

      (2) A secured party is not liable because of its status as secured party:

      (a) To a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows:

      (A) That the person is a debtor or obligor;

      (B) The identity of the person; and

      (C) How to communicate with the person; or

      (b) To a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against a person, unless the secured party knows:

      (A) That the person is a debtor; and

      (B) The identity of the person.

      (3) A secured party is not liable to any person, and a person’s liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission arising out of the secured party’s reasonable belief that a transaction is not a consumer-goods transaction or a consumer transaction or that goods are not consumer goods, if the secured party’s belief is based on its reasonable reliance on:

      (a) A debtor’s representation concerning the purpose for which collateral was to be used, acquired or held; or

      (b) An obligor’s representation concerning the purpose for which a secured obligation was incurred.

      (4) A secured party is not liable to any person under ORS 79.0625 (3)(b) for its failure to comply with ORS 79.0616.

      (5) A secured party is not liable under ORS 79.0625 (3)(b) more than once with respect to any one secured obligation. [2001 c.445 §126]
