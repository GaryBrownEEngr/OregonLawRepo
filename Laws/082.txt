INTEREST

 

      82.010 Legal rate of interest; effect of violation. (1) The rate of interest for the following transactions, if the parties have not otherwise agreed to a rate of interest, is nine percent per annum and is payable on:

      (a) All moneys after they become due; but open accounts bear interest from the date of the last item thereof.

      (b) Money received to the use of another and retained beyond a reasonable time without the owner’s express or implied consent.

      (c) Money due or to become due where there is a contract to pay interest and no rate specified.

      (2) Except as provided in this subsection, the rate of interest on judgments for the payment of money is nine percent per annum. The following apply as described:

      (a) Interest on a judgment under this subsection accrues from the date of the entry of the judgment unless the judgment specifies another date.

      (b) Interest on a judgment under this subsection is simple interest, unless otherwise provided by contract.

      (c) Interest accruing from the date of the entry of a judgment shall also accrue on interest that accrued before the date of entry of a judgment.

      (d) Interest under this subsection shall also accrue on attorney fees and costs entered as part of the judgment.

      (e) A judgment on a contract bearing more than nine percent interest shall bear interest at the same rate provided in the contract as of the date of entry of the judgment.

      (f) The rate of interest on a judgment rendered in favor of a plaintiff in a civil action to recover damages for injuries resulting from the professional negligence of a person licensed by the Oregon Medical Board under ORS chapter 677 or the Oregon State Board of Nursing under ORS 678.010 to 678.410 is the lesser of five percent per annum or three percent in excess of the discount rate in effect at the Federal Reserve Bank in the Federal Reserve district where the injuries occurred.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 82.025, no person shall:

      (a) Make a business or agricultural loan of $50,000 or less at an annual rate of interest exceeding the greater of 12 percent, or five percent in excess of the discount rate, including any surcharge on the discount rate, on 90-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal Reserve Bank in the Federal Reserve district where the person making the loan is located, on the date the loan or the initial advance of funds under the loan is made; or

      (b) Make a loan of $50,000 or less, except a loan made under paragraph (a) of this subsection, at an annual rate of interest exceeding the greater of 12 percent, or five percent in excess of the discount rate on 90-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal Reserve Bank in the Federal Reserve district where the person making the loan is located, on the date the loan or the initial advance of funds under the loan is made.

      (4) Any person who violates subsection (3) of this section shall forfeit the right to collect or receive any interest upon any loan for which a greater rate of interest or consideration than is permitted by subsection (3) of this section has been charged, contracted for or received. The borrower upon such loan shall be required to repay only the principal amount borrowed.

      (2) In computing interest for the purposes of ORS 82.010, any bona fide commission paid or sustained by the borrower shall be computed for the contract term and not for any accelerated period or prepayment.
