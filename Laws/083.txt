      (13) “Time balance” means the principal balance plus the service charge. [1963 c.489 §1]

 

      83.020 Retail installment contract requirements; exceptions. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, every retail installment contract shall be contained in a single document which shall contain the entire agreement of the parties including any promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness between the parties relating to the transaction, except as provided in ORS 83.040, 83.050 and 83.140.

      (2) Where the buyer’s obligation to pay the time balance is represented by a promissory note secured by a chattel mortgage, the promissory note may be a separate instrument if the mortgage recites the amount and terms of payment of such note and the promissory note recites that it is secured by a mortgage.

      (3) In a transaction involving the repair, alteration or improvement upon or in connection with real property, the contract may be secured by a mortgage on the real property contained in a separate document. Home improvement retail sales transactions which are financed or insured by the Federal Housing Administration are not subject to ORS 83.010 to 83.190.

      (4) The contract shall be dated, signed by the retail buyer and completed as to all essential provisions, except as otherwise provided in ORS 83.050 and 83.060. The printed or typed portion of the contract, other than instructions for completion, shall be in a size equal to at least 8-point type. [1963 c.489 §2]

 

      83.030 Contents of contract. The retail installment contract shall contain the names of the seller and the buyer, the place of business of the seller, the residence or other address of the buyer as specified by the buyer and a description or identification of the goods sold or to be sold, or services furnished or rendered or to be furnished or rendered. The contract also shall contain the following items, which shall be set forth in the sequence appearing below; however, additional items may be included to explain the calculations involved in determining the balance to be paid by the buyer:

      (1) The cash sale price of each item of goods or services;

      (2) The amount of the buyer’s down payment, identifying the amounts paid in money and allowed for goods traded in;

      (3) The difference between subsections (1) and (2) of this section;

      (4) The aggregate amount, if any, included for insurance, specifying the type or types of insurance and the terms of coverage;

      (5) The aggregate amount of official fees;

      (6) The principal balance, which is the sum of subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section;

      (7) The dollar amount or rate of the service charge;

      (8) The amount of the time balance owed by the buyer to the seller, which is the sum of subsections (6) and (7) of this section, if subsection (7) is stated in a dollar amount; and

      (9) The maximum number of installment payments required, the amount of each installment and the due date of each payment necessary to pay such balance. However, if installment payments other than the final payment are stated as a series of equal scheduled amounts and if the amount of the final installment payment does not substantially exceed the scheduled amount of each preceding installment payment, the maximum number of payments and the amount and due date of each payment need not be separately stated and the amount of the scheduled final installment payment may be stated as the remaining unpaid balance. The due date of the first installment payment may be fixed by a day or date or may be fixed by reference to the date of the contract or to the time of delivery or installation. [1963 c.489 §4]

 

      83.040 Subsequent purchases under original contract. A retail installment contract may be contained in more than one document, provided that one such document shall be an original document signed by the retail buyer, stated to be applicable to purchases of goods or services to be made by the retail buyer from time to time. In such case such document, together with the sales slip, account book or other written statement relating to each purchase, shall set forth all of the information required by ORS 83.030 and shall constitute the retail installment contract for each purchase. On each succeeding purchase pursuant to such original document, the sales slip, account book or other written statement may at the option of the seller constitute the memorandum required by ORS 83.140. [1963 c.489 §5]

 

      83.050 Contracts completed by mail and based on catalog of seller. (1) Retail installment contracts negotiated and entered into by mail without personal solicitation by salesmen or other representatives of the seller and based upon a catalog of the seller, or other printed solicitation of business, if such catalog or other printed solicitation clearly sets forth the cash sale prices and other terms of sales to be made through such medium, may be made as provided in this section. The provisions of ORS 83.010 to 83.190 with respect to retail installment contracts shall be applicable to such sales, except that the retail installment contract, when completed by the buyer need not contain the items required by ORS 83.030.

      (2) When the contract is received from the retail buyer, the seller shall prepare a written memorandum containing all of the information required by ORS 83.030 to be included in a retail installment contract. In lieu of delivering a copy of the contract to the retail buyer as provided in ORS 83.070, the seller shall deliver to the buyer a copy of such memorandum prior to the due date of the first installment payable under the contract. However, if the catalog or other printed solicitation does not set forth all of the other terms of sales in addition to the cash sale prices, such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer prior to or at the time of delivery of the goods or services. [1963 c.489 §6]

 

      83.060 Filling blanks. The seller shall not obtain the signature of the buyer to any contract when it contains blank spaces of items which are essential provisions of the transaction except as provided in ORS 83.050. However, if delivery of the goods is not made at the time of the execution of the contract, the identifying numbers or marks of the goods or similar information and the due date of the first installment may be inserted by the seller in the seller’s counterpart of the contract after it has been signed by the buyer. [1963 c.489 §7]

 

      83.070 Delivery of copy of contract to buyer. The retail seller shall deliver to the retail buyer, or mail to the retail buyer at the address shown on the retail installment contract, a copy of the contract as accepted by the seller. Until the seller does so, the buyer shall be obligated to pay only the cash sale price. Any acknowledgment by the buyer of delivery of a copy of the contract shall be in a size equal to at least 10-point bold type and, if contained in the contract, shall appear directly above the buyer’s signature. [1963 c.489 §3]

 

      83.080 Informing buyer of service charge and right to prepay; monthly statement. (1) At or prior to the time a retail charge agreement is made the seller shall advise the buyer in writing, on the application form or otherwise, or orally, that a service charge will be computed on the outstanding balance for each month (which need not be a calendar month) or other regular period agreed upon, the schedule or rate by which the service charge will be computed, and that the buyer may at any time pay the total unpaid balance. If this information is given orally, the seller shall, upon approval of the buyer’s credit, deliver to the buyer or mail to the buyer at the address of the buyer, a memorandum setting forth this information.

      (2) The seller or holder of a retail charge agreement shall promptly supply the buyer with a statement as of the end of each monthly period (which need not be a calendar month) or other regular period agreed upon, in which there is any unpaid balance thereunder, which statement shall set forth the following:

      (a) The unpaid balance under the retail charge agreement at the beginning and at the end of the period;

      (b) Unless otherwise furnished by the seller to the buyer by sales slip, memorandum, or otherwise, a description or identification of the goods or services purchased during the period, the cash sale price and the date of each purchase;

      (c) The payments made by the buyer to the seller and any other credits to the buyer during the period;

      (d) The amount, if any, of any service charge for such period; and

      (e) A legend to the effect that the buyer may at any time pay the total unpaid balance. [1963 c.489 §12]

 

      83.090 Service charge; other fees. The service charge shall be inclusive of all charges incident to investigating and making the retail installment contract or charge agreement and for the privilege of making the installment payments thereunder and no other fee, expense or charge whatsoever shall be taken, received, reserved or contracted therefor. [1963 c.489 §13]

 

      83.095 Service charge computed by actuarial method. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 83.010 to 83.190 and 83.820 to 83.895, a retail seller in a retail installment contract may contract for and charge, receive and collect a service charge computed by the actuarial method.

      (2) When a retail installment contract provides for a service charge computed by the actuarial method:

      (a) The retail installment contract may provide for any other charge, cost or fee allowed under ORS 83.010 to 83.190 and 83.820 to 83.895, in addition to the service charge.

      (b) The amount to be disclosed as the service charge and used as the service charge component of the other amounts disclosed pursuant to ORS 83.010 to 83.190 and 83.820 to 83.895 shall be the amount of the service charge to be paid assuming all payments are made exactly as agreed.

      (c) The refund credit provisions of ORS 83.130 shall not apply. [1983 c.432 §4]

 

      83.100 Extra charges; miscellaneous provisions of contract. (1) Except as provided in ORS 20.082, the holder of any retail installment contract or retail charge agreement may not collect any delinquency or collection charges, including any attorney’s fee and court costs and disbursements, unless the contract or charge agreement so provides. In such cases, the charges shall be reasonable, and no attorney’s fee may be recovered unless the contract or charge agreement is referred for collection to an attorney not a salaried employee of the holder.

      (2) The contract or charge agreement may contain other provisions not inconsistent with the purposes of ORS 83.010 to 83.190, including but not limited to provisions relating to refinancing, transfer of the buyer’s equity, construction permits and title reports. [1963 c.489 §9; 2001 c.542 §7]

 

      83.110 Insurance. (1) If the cost of any insurance is included in the retail installment contract or retail charge agreement:

      (a) The contract or agreement shall state the nature, purpose, term and amount of such insurance.

      (b) The contract or agreement shall state whether the insurance is to be procured by the buyer or the seller.

      (c) The amount included for such insurance shall not exceed the premiums chargeable in accordance with the rate fixed for such insurance by the insurer, except where the amount is less than $1.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 743.377, if the insurance is to be procured by the seller or holder, the seller or holder shall, within 45 days after delivery of the goods or furnishing of the services under the contract, deliver, mail or cause to be mailed to the buyer, at the address as specified in the contract, a notice thereof or a copy of the policy or policies of insurance or a certificate or certificates of the insurance so procured. [1963 c.489 §14; 1967 c.359 §676]

 

      83.120 Receipts; schedule of payments. A buyer shall be given a written receipt for any payment when made in cash. Upon written request of the buyer, the holder of a retail installment contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written statement of the dates and amounts of payments and the total amount unpaid under the contract. Such a statement shall be given the buyer once without charge. If any additional statement is requested by the buyer, it shall be supplied by the holder at a charge not in excess of $1 for each additional statement so supplied. [1963 c.489 §10]

 

      83.130 Voluntary prepayment by buyer; refund. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any retail installment contract to the contrary, and if the rights of the purchaser have not been terminated or forfeited under the terms of the contract, any buyer may prepay in full the unpaid time balance thereof at any time before its final due date. If the buyer does so, and if the contract is not in default more than two months under any term or condition of the contract, the buyer shall receive a refund credit of the unearned portion of the service charge for the prepayment. The amount of the refund credit shall be not less than the total service charge contracted for to maturity, less the greater of:

      (a) Ten percent of the amount financed or $75, whichever is less; or

      (b) Either of the following, at the discretion of the seller or holder:

      (A) The service charge earned to the date of prepayment, computed by applying the effective rate on the contract to the actual principal balances outstanding, for the periods of time the balances were actually outstanding. In determining the effective rate, the holder may apply to the scheduled payments the actuarial method by which each scheduled payment is applied first to the accrued and unpaid service charges and any amount remaining is applied to the reduction of the principal balance.

      (B) The service charge earned to the installment due date nearest the date of prepayment, computed by applying the effective rate on the contract to the actual principal balances outstanding, for the periods of time the balances were actually outstanding. For purposes of rebate computations under this subparagraph, the installment due date preceding the date of prepayment shall be considered to be nearest if prepayment occurs 15 days or less after that installment date. If prepayment occurs more than 15 days after the preceding installment due date, the next succeeding installment due date shall be considered to be nearest to the date of prepayment. In determining the effective rate, the seller may apply to the scheduled payments the actuarial method, by which each scheduled payment is applied first to the accrued and unpaid service charges and any amount remaining is applied to reduction of the principal balance.

      (2) When the amount of the refund credit is less than $2, no refund need be made. [1963 c.489 §8; 1981 c.910 §1; 1983 c.432 §1]

 

      83.140 Consolidation of purchases with prior contract. (1) If, in a retail installment transaction, a retail buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods or services from a retail seller from whom the buyer has previously purchased goods or services under one or more retail installment contracts, and the amounts under such previous contract or contracts have not been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may, at the seller’s option, be included in and consolidated with one or more of the previous contracts. All the provisions of ORS 83.010 to 83.190 with respect to retail installment contracts shall be applicable to such subsequent purchases except as otherwise provided in this subsection. In the event of such consolidation, in lieu of the buyer’s executing a retail installment contract respecting each subsequent purchase, as provided in this section, it shall be sufficient if the seller shall prepare a written memorandum of each such subsequent purchase, in which case the provisions of ORS 83.020, 83.030 and 83.070 shall not be applicable. Unless previously furnished in writing to the buyer by the seller, by sales slip, memorandum or otherwise, such memorandum shall set forth, with respect to each subsequent purchase, items required in ORS 83.030 (1) to (7), and in addition, the amount of the time balance owed by the buyer to the seller for the subsequent purchase, the outstanding balance of the previous contract or contracts, the consolidated time balance, and the revised installments applicable to the consolidated time balance, if any, in accordance with ORS 83.030. The seller shall deliver to the buyer a copy of such memorandum prior to the due date of the first installment of such consolidated contract.

      (2) When such subsequent purchases are made, if the seller has retained title or taken a lien or other security interest in any of the goods purchased under any one of the contracts included in the consolidation:

      (a) The entire amount of all payments made prior to such subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied on the previous purchases; and

      (b) The amount of any down payment on the subsequent purchase shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase.

      (3) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to cases where such previous and subsequent purchases involve equipment, parts or other goods attached or affixed to goods previously purchased and not fully paid, or to services in connection therewith rendered by the seller at the buyer’s request. [1963 c.489 §11]

 

      83.150 Unenforceable contract provisions. No provision of a retail installment contract or retail charge agreement shall be valid:

      (1) By which the buyer agrees not to assert against the seller or against an assignee a claim or defense arising out of the sale.

      (2) That provides for a wage assignment. [1963 c.489 §15; 1971 c.232 §1]

 

      83.160 Waiver of ORS 83.010 to 83.190. No act or agreement of the retail buyer before or at the time of the making of a retail installment contract, retail charge agreement or purchases thereunder shall constitute a valid waiver of any of the provisions of ORS 83.010 to 83.190 or of any remedies granted to the buyer by law. [1963 c.489 §16]

 

      83.170 Effect of violation of ORS 83.010 to 83.190 by seller. Any seller who enters into any contract or agreement which does not comply with the provisions of ORS 83.010 to 83.190 or who violates any provision of ORS 83.010 to 83.190 except as a result of an accidental or bona fide error shall be barred from the recovery of any service charge, official fees or any delinquency or collection charge under or in connection with the related retail installment contract or purchases under a retail charge agreement; but the seller may nevertheless recover from the buyer an amount equal to the cash price of the goods or services and the cost to the seller of any insurance included in the transaction. [1963 c.489 §18]

 

      83.180 Enforcement of ORS 83.010 to 83.190. The Attorney General of the State of Oregon or a district attorney may bring an action in the name of the state against any person to restrain and prevent any violation of ORS 83.010 to 83.190. [1963 c.489 §§19,20; 1975 c.437 §6]

 

      83.190 Civil penalties. Any person who violates any order or injunction issued pursuant to ORS 83.010 to 83.190 shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than $1,000. For the purpose of this section the circuit court issuing any injunction shall retain jurisdiction, and the cause shall be continued, and in such cases the Attorney General acting in the name of the state may petition for the recovery of civil penalties. [1963 c.489 §21]

      (a) Ten percent of the amount financed or $75, whichever is less; or

      (b) Either of the following, at the discretion of the motor vehicle dealer or holder:

      (A) The finance charge earned to the date of prepayment, computed by applying the effective rate on the contract to the actual principal balances outstanding, for the periods of time such balances were actually outstanding. In determining the effective rate, the holder may apply to the scheduled payments the actuarial method by which each scheduled payment is applied first to the accrued and unpaid finance charges and any amount remaining is applied to the reduction of the principal balance.

      (B) The finance charge earned to the installment due date nearest the date of prepayment, computed by applying the effective rate on the contract to the actual principal balances outstanding, for the periods of time the balances were actually outstanding. For purposes of rebate computations under this subparagraph, the installment due date preceding the date of prepayment shall be considered to be nearest if prepayment occurs 15 days or less after that installment date. If prepayment occurs more than 15 days after the preceding installment due date, the next succeeding installment due date shall be considered to be nearest to the date of prepayment. In determining the effective rate, the holder may apply to the scheduled payments the actuarial method, by which each scheduled payment is applied first to the accrued and unpaid finance charges and any amount remaining is applied to reduction of the principal balance.

      (2) When the amount of the credit for premature payment is less than $2, no refund need be made.

      (3) This section does not prohibit the holder of a retail installment contract from collecting any charge, cost or fee under ORS 83.590. [1957 c.625 §24; 1977 c.692 §1; 1981 c.910 §2; 1983 c.432 §2; 2001 c.117 §10]

      83.650 Effect of negotiation of notes on rights against motor vehicle dealer. (1) No retail installment contract shall require or entail the execution, by the buyer, of any note or series of notes, which when separately negotiated will cut off as against third parties any right of action or defense which the buyer may have against the motor vehicle dealer.

      (2) The rights of a holder in due course of any negotiable instrument executed contrary to subsection (1) of this section are not impaired by reason of the violation of subsection (1) of this section, but the buyer may bring an action against the motor vehicle dealer for the recovery of any loss or expense incurred by reason of the violation of subsection (1) of this section. The buyer’s action may be joined with any other right of action the buyer has against the motor vehicle dealer arising out of the installment sale. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this section. [1957 c.625 §9; 1995 c.618 §47; 2001 c.117 §11]

 

      83.660 Acceleration provision. No provision in a retail installment contract by which, in the absence of the buyer’s default, the holder may, arbitrarily and without reasonable cause, accelerate the maturity of any part or all of the time balance is enforceable. This section does not prohibit provisions in a retail installment contract accelerating any part or all of the time balance in the event of sale or transfer, or removal outside the state of the motor vehicle covered by the contract.

      (3) No provision in a retail installment contract by which the buyer waives any right of action against the motor vehicle dealer or holder of the contract, or other person acting on the behalf of the motor vehicle dealer or holder, for any illegal act committed in the collection of payments under the contract or in the repossession of the motor vehicle is enforceable.

      (4) No provision in a retail installment contract by which the buyer executes a power of attorney appointing the motor vehicle dealer or holder of the contract, or other person acting on the behalf of the motor vehicle dealer or holder, as the buyer’s agent in collection of payments under the contract or in the repossession of the motor vehicle, is enforceable.

      (5) No provision in a retail installment contract relieving the motor vehicle dealer from liability for any legal remedies that the buyer may have had against the motor vehicle dealer under the contract, or any separate instrument executed in connection therewith, is enforceable. [1957 c.625 §§14,15,16,17,18; 2001 c.117 §12]

 

      83.680 Waiver of provisions of ORS 83.510 to 83.680. Any waiver of the provisions of ORS 83.510 to 83.680 shall be unenforceable and void. [1957 c.625 §28]

(1) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, in addition to any other right to revoke an offer or rescind a transaction that the buyer may have, the buyer has the right to cancel a home solicitation sale until 12 midnight of the third business day after the day on which the buyer signs an agreement or offer to purchase that complies with ORS 83.710 to 83.750 or pays by cash or check.

      (2) Cancellation occurs when the buyer gives written notice of cancellation to the seller at the address stated in the agreement or offer to purchase.

      (3) Notice of cancellation, if given by mail, is given when it is deposited in a mailbox properly addressed and postage prepaid.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (c) The seller must provide the buyer, by a method chosen by the seller, with a duplicate copy of the notice of the buyer’s right to cancel described in subsection (2) of this section so that, if the buyer cancels the transaction, the buyer can retain a complete copy of the written agreement or offer to purchase. If both copies of the notice are not attached to the written agreement or offer to purchase, the seller shall change the last sentence in the statement required under paragraph (b)(D) of this subsection to conform to the actual location of the copies of the notice.

      (b) You may either make available to the seller at your residence, in substantially as good condition as when received, any goods delivered to you under the sales contract or you may comply with the seller’s instructions regarding the return shipment of the goods at the seller’s expense and risk.

      (c) If you make the goods available to the seller at your residence and the seller does not pick up the goods within 20 days of the date of your notice of cancellation, you may keep or discard the goods without further obligation.

      (3) In a home solicitation sale subject to federal rules under 16 C.F.R. part 429, the seller may provide the notice required by the federal rules in lieu of the notice required under subsection (2) of this section if the notice required under federal rules contains the information specified in subsection (1)(c) of this section.

      (4) Until the seller has complied with this section the buyer may cancel the home solicitation sale by notifying the seller in any manner and by any means of an intention to cancel. [1971 c.744 §21(3); 1977 c.170 §2; 2005 c.223 §3]

 

      83.740 Duties of seller upon cancellation of sale or revocation of offer to purchase. (1) The seller must tender to the buyer any payments made by the buyer and any note or other evidence of indebtedness within 10 days after a home solicitation sale has been canceled or an offer to purchase has been revoked.

      (2) If the down payment includes goods traded in, the goods must be tendered in substantially as good condition as when received by the seller. If the seller fails to tender the goods as provided by this section, the buyer may elect to recover an amount equal to the trade-in allowance stated in the agreement.

      (3) The buyer may retain possession of goods delivered to the buyer by the seller, and has a lien on the goods in the possession or control of the buyer for any recovery to which the buyer is entitled, until the seller has complied with the obligations imposed by this section.

If the seller fails to demand possession of goods within a reasonable time after cancellation or revocation, the goods become the property of the buyer without obligation to pay for them. For the purpose of this subsection, 20 days is presumed to be a reasonable time.

      (2) The buyer has a duty to take reasonable care of the goods in the possession of the buyer before cancellation or revocation and for a reasonable time thereafter, during which time the goods are otherwise at the seller’s risk.

      (3) If the seller has performed any services pursuant to a home solicitation sale prior to its cancellation, the seller is entitled to no compensation. [1971 c.744 §21(5); 1977 c.170 §4]

If a motor vehicle dealer or retail seller does not meet these numerical standards in the preceding calendar year, the numerical standards shall be applied to the current calendar year. [1991 c.296 §1; 1999 c.240 §2; 2001 c.117 §13]

 

      Note: 83.811 and 83.813 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 83 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      83.813 Exemption from certain disclosure requirements for assignee of retail installment contract. (1) The disclosure provisions of ORS 83.010 to 83.680 and 83.990 shall not apply to the assignee of any retail installment contract when:

      (2) The assignee of a motor vehicle dealer or retail seller regularly extends credit to natural persons primarily for personal, family or household purposes only if the assignee extended credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or more than five times in the preceding calendar year for transactions secured by a dwelling. If the assignee does not meet these numerical standards in the preceding calendar year, the numerical standards shall be applied to the current calendar year. [1991 c.296 §2; 1999 c.240 §3; 2001 c.117 §14]

 

      Note: See note under 83.811.

 

      83.820 Consumer paper; negotiability; exception; rights and liabilities of assignees. (1) In any contract for the sale or lease of motor vehicles on any form of credit, or of consumer goods or services on credit, entered into between a motor vehicle dealer, retail seller or retail lessor and a retail buyer or retail lessee, such contract, note or any instrument or evidence of indebtedness of the buyer or lessee shall have printed on the face thereof the words “consumer paper,” and such contract, note, instrument or evidence of indebtedness with the words “consumer paper” printed thereon shall not be a negotiable instrument within the meaning of ORS chapter 73. However, this section shall have no force or effect on the negotiability of any contract, promissory note, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness owned or guaranteed or insured by any state or federal governmental agency even though said contract, note, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain the wording required by this subsection.

      (2) Notwithstanding the absence of such notice on a contract, note, instrument or evidence of indebtedness arising out of a consumer credit sale, consumer lease or the sale or lease of a motor vehicle on any form of credit as described in this section, an assignee of the rights of the motor vehicle dealer, seller or lessor is subject to all claims and defenses of the buyer or lessee against the motor vehicle dealer, seller or lessor arising out of the sale or lease. Any agreement to the contrary shall be of no force or effect in limiting the rights of a consumer under this section. The assignee’s liability under this section may not exceed the amount owing to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against the assignee. The restrictions imposed hereby shall not apply with respect to any promissory note, contract, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness owned or guaranteed or insured by any state or federal governmental agency even though said note, contract, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain the words required by subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) An assignee of “consumer paper” who in good faith enforces a security interest in property held by the buyer or lessee shall not be liable to such buyer or lessee for punitive damages in an action for wrongful repossession. The fact that a motor vehicle dealer, seller or lessor has broken the warranties of the motor vehicle dealer, seller or lessor with regard to the property sold or leased shall not, of itself, make an assignee’s repossession wrongful.

      (4) Notwithstanding the absence of notice as provided in subsection (1) of this section, an assignee of the rights of the motor vehicle dealer, seller or lessor who lends money to the buyer or lessee for the purpose of paying off the amount owing to the assignee under the contract, note, instrument or evidence of indebtedness is subject to all claims and defenses of the buyer or lessee against the motor vehicle dealer, seller or lessor arising out of the sale or lease. The assignee’s liability under this subsection may not exceed the amount that would be owing to the motor vehicle dealer, seller or lessor under the contract, note, instrument or evidence of indebtedness at the time the claim or defense is asserted had the obligation not been paid off. Assignee shall include a parent, subsidiary or other business entity similarly related to the assignee, and the assignee’s liability shall extend to anyone who holds the buyer’s or lessee’s new instrument or evidence of indebtedness.
