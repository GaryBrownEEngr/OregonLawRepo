REAL PROPERTY MORTGAGES

 

      86.010 Nature of mortgagee’s interest. A mortgage of real property is not a conveyance so as to enable the owner of the mortgage to recover possession of the property without a foreclosure and sale. This section is not intended as a limitation upon the right of the owner of real property to mortgage or pledge the rents and profits thereof, nor as prohibiting the mortgagee or pledgee of such rents and profits, or any trustee under a mortgage or trust deed from entering into possession of any real property, other than farmlands or the homestead of the mortgagor or successor in interest, for the purpose of operating the same and collecting the rents and profits thereof for application in accordance with the provisions of the mortgage or trust deed or other instrument creating the lien, nor as any limitation upon the power of a court of equity to appoint a receiver to take charge of the property and collect the rents and profits thereof.

 

      86.020 Covenant to pay money not implied. No mortgage shall be construed as implying a covenant for the payment of the sum thereby secured. When there is no express covenant for such payment contained in the mortgage, and no bond or other separate instrument to secure such payment shall have been given, the remedies of the mortgagee shall be confined to the lands mentioned in the mortgage.

 

      86.030 Absolute deed as a mortgage. When a deed purports to be an absolute conveyance in terms, but is made or intended to be made defeasible by a deed of defeasance or other instrument, the original conveyance shall not be thereby defeated or affected as against any person other than the maker of the defeasance, or the heirs or devisees of the maker, or persons having actual notice thereof, unless the instrument of defeasance is recorded with the recording officer of the county where the lands lie.

 

      86.040 Improvements on mortgaged lands. No person shall sell, dispose of, remove or damage any building or other improvements upon mortgaged lands. All such improvements are deemed a part of the mortgaged property and are subject to the mortgage lien. When any improvements are removed from the mortgaged premises in violation of this section, the mortgagee may follow and regain possession of such improvements wherever found or may recover the reasonable value thereof from the person removing them.

 

      86.050 Payment of taxes and other charges by mortgagee. Whenever a mortgagor fails to pay when due any taxes, assessments, interest on prior mortgages, insurance premiums or other charges necessary to be paid for the protection of the lien of a mortgagee, the mortgagee may pay the same, and such payments shall be added to the mortgage debt and secured by the mortgage held by the mortgagee, and shall bear interest at the same rate as specified in the mortgage. This section applies only to mortgages executed after June 3, 1929, and does not affect the right of parties to specifically contract otherwise than as provided in this section.

 

      86.060 Assignment of mortgage. Mortgages may be assigned by an instrument in writing, executed and acknowledged with the same formality as required in deeds and mortgages of real property, and recorded in the records of mortgages of the county where the land is situated.

 

86.070 [Repealed by 1965 c.252 §1]

 

      86.080 Record of assignment not notice to mortgagor. The recording of the assignment of a mortgage is not of itself notice of such assignment to the mortgagor, or the heirs or personal representatives of the mortgagor, so as to invalidate a payment made by any of them to the mortgagee.

 

86.090 [Repealed by 1965 c.252 §1]

 

      86.095 Acts not affecting priority of lien of credit instrument. (1) Actions that do not affect the priority granted to the lien of a credit instrument at the time it is first received for recordation shall include but shall not be limited to:

      (a) Renegotiation or adjustment of the initial interest rate provided in the note or the credit instrument, upward or downward, which may increase or decrease the amount of periodic payments or may extend or shorten the term of the credit instrument, or both;

      (b) An increase in the underlying obligation secured by the credit instrument during any part of the term of the credit instrument as a result of deferment of all or a portion of the interest payments and the addition of such payments to the outstanding balance of the obligation;

      (c) Execution of new notes at designated intervals during the term of the credit instrument that reflect changes made pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection;

      (d) Extension of the term of the credit instrument;

      (e) Substitution of a note if there is no increase in the principal amount to be paid under the note;

      (f) Modification of periodic payments required under the note if there is no increase in the principal amount due under the note; or

      (g) Advances made under ORS 86.155.

      (2) As used in this section, the addition of accrued interest to the principal amount of the underlying obligation is not an increase in the principal amount.

      (3) As used in this section, “credit instrument” includes a mortgage, a line of credit instrument, a deed of trust and a contract for sale of real property. [1981 c.304 §2; 1987 c.716 §2; 1991 c.246 §1; 2001 c.20 §1]

 

      86.100 Discharge of mortgage. Any mortgage shall be discharged of record whenever there is presented to the recording officer a certificate executed by the mortgagee, or the personal representatives or assigns of the mortgagee, acknowledged or proved and certified as prescribed by law to entitle conveyances to be recorded, specifying that such mortgage has been paid or otherwise discharged. Every such certificate, and the proof or acknowledgment thereof, shall be recorded at full length. [Amended by 1965 c.252 §2]

 

      86.110 Discharge of record by owner and holder of mortgage note who is not the mortgagee of record. (1) Whenever a promissory note secured by mortgage on real property is transferred by indorsement without a formal assignment of the mortgage, and the mortgage is recorded, the mortgage, upon payment of the promissory note, may be discharged of record by the owner and holder of the promissory note making and filing with the appropriate recording officer a certificate, verified by oath, proving the satisfaction of mortgage and declaring, in substance, that the owner and holder is the owner and holder of the note secured by the mortgage by indorsement of the mortgagee and that the note has been fully paid and proving that fact to the satisfaction of the recording officer.

      (2) Upon receiving the certificate, the recording officer shall record the document and index the document as a satisfaction of mortgage. The record shall have the same effect as a deed of release of the mortgagee duly acknowledged and recorded. [Amended by 1965 c.252 §3; 2001 c.577 §1]

 

      86.120 Discharge of mortgage on real property; effect of discharge. No mortgage upon real property shall be discharged except as provided in ORS 86.110 or by the person appearing upon the records of the county where the mortgage is recorded to be the owner thereof. A discharge of the mortgage by such person shall operate to free the land described in the mortgage from the lien of the mortgage as against all subsequent purchasers and incumbrances for value and without notice.

 

      86.130 Discharge by foreign executors, administrators, conservators and guardians. Foreign executors, administrators, conservators and guardians may discharge mortgages upon the records of any county upon recording with the recording officer of the county in which the mortgage is recorded a certified copy of their letters testamentary, or of administration, or of guardianship or of conservatorship. The certificate shall include a statement that the letters are in effect, and the certificate shall be recorded in the mortgage records. [Amended by 1973 c.506 §§2,44]

 

      86.140 Liability of mortgagee for failure to discharge mortgage. If any mortgagee or the personal representative or assignee of the mortgagee, after full performance of the condition of the mortgage before or after a breach thereof, shall, within 30 days after being thereto requested, and after tender of reasonable charges, fail to discharge the same, or to execute and acknowledge a certificate of discharge or release thereof, that person shall be liable to the mortgagor, or the heirs or assigns of the mortgagor, in the sum of $500 damages and also for all actual damages occasioned by such failure, to be recovered in an action at law. The owner and holder of the promissory note referred to in ORS 86.110 is deemed the personal representative of the mortgagee for the purposes of this section. [Amended by 1955 c.29 §1; 1955 c.512 §1; 1993 c.648 §1]

 

      86.150 Loan agreements and promissory notes to state maximum prepayment privilege penalty. (1) Any person making a loan having a loan period of more than three years secured by a mortgage or by a trust deed on real property located in this state shall, with respect to such loan, expressly and clearly state on the loan agreement and promissory note any maximum prepayment privilege penalty. The statement shall include the maximum prepayment penalty applicable for prepayment during the first year of the loan period and for each year thereafter.

      (2) Violation of subsection (1) of this section with respect to a loan agreement or promissory note shall render any prepayment privilege penalty provision in the agreement void.

      (3) “Loan agreement” as used in this section means a written document issued in connection with a particular loan which sets forth the terms upon which the loan will be made. “Loan agreement” does not include a mortgage or trust deed which secures a promissory note. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require a lender to issue a loan agreement.

      (4) This section does not apply to any loan agreement executed on or before September 13, 1967, or any loan not primarily for personal, family or household use. [1967 c.336 §§1,2; 1987 c.716 §3]

 

      86.155 Priority of line of credit instrument as to certain advances; procedure to limit indebtedness in residential line of credit instrument. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Credit agreement” means any promissory note, loan agreement or other agreement that provides for advances subsequent to the date of recording of the line of credit instrument that secures the note or agreement.

      (b) “Line of credit instrument” means a mortgage or trust deed that secures a consumer or commercial credit agreement and creates a lien on specified real property up to a stated amount, provided that the front page of the mortgage or trust deed, or a memorandum thereof:

      (A) Contains the legend “line of credit mortgage,” “line of credit trust deed” or “line of credit instrument” either in capital letters or underscored above the body of the mortgage or trust deed;

      (B) States the maximum principal amount to be advanced pursuant to the credit agreement; and

      (C) States the term or maturity date, if any, of the credit agreement exclusive of any option to renew or extend the term or maturity date.

      (c) “Residential line of credit instrument” means any line of credit instrument creating a lien on real property upon which are situated or will be constructed four or fewer residential units, one of which, at the time the credit agreement is entered into, is the borrower’s residence or is intended, following construction, to be a residence of the borrower.

      (2) A line of credit instrument shall have priority, regardless of the knowledge of the lienholder of any intervening lien, as of its date of recording as to the following advances whether the advances are optional or obligatory advances:

      (a) Principal advances made any time pursuant to the credit agreement, to the extent the total outstanding advances do not exceed the maximum principal amount stated in the line of credit instrument under subsection (1)(b)(B) of this section;

      (b) Interest, lawful charges and advances made any time pursuant to the credit agreement for the reasonable protection of the real property including, but not limited to, advances to pay real property taxes, hazard insurance premiums, maintenance charges imposed under a declaration or restrictive covenant and reasonable attorney fees, whether or not the interest, lawful charges or advances exceed the maximum principal amount stated in the line of credit instrument under subsection (1)(b)(B) of this section; and

      (c) Advances made any time after the date of recording and pursuant to a credit agreement that is not secured by a residential line of credit instrument to complete construction of previously agreed-upon improvements on the real property, whether or not the advances exceed the maximum principal amount stated in the line of credit instrument under subsection (1)(b)(B) of this section provided, however, that the front page of the instrument states that the maximum principal amount to be advanced pursuant to the credit agreement may be exceeded by advances to complete construction pursuant to this subsection.

      (3) Actions that do not affect the priority granted to the advances set forth in subsection (2) of this section shall include, but not be limited to, those actions set forth in ORS 86.095 (1). If any modification to a credit agreement increases the maximum principal amount to be advanced pursuant to the credit agreement, then principal advances that are made that exceed the original maximum principal amount stated in the line of credit instrument shall have priority as of the date of recording an amendment to the line of credit instrument that states the increased maximum principal amount.

      (4) In the case of a residential line of credit instrument, the debtor may limit the indebtedness secured by that line of credit instrument to the amount of the credit outstanding by delivering a notice by personal service upon the lienholder or trust deed beneficiary or by mailing a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the lienholder or trust deed beneficiary at the address given for payment or, if none, to the address of the lienholder or trust deed beneficiary indicated in the line of credit instrument or deed of trust. To be sufficient to limit indebtedness under this subsection, the notice must:

      (a) State that it is made under this section;

      (b) Contain the legal description in the line of credit instrument or the street address of the real property;

      (c) Provide the information necessary to locate the line of credit instrument in the public record;

      (d) State the debtor’s intention to limit the amount of credit secured by the line of credit instrument to the amount owed at the time the notice is received;

      (e) State the date sent; and

      (f) Be signed and acknowledged by all debtors obligated under the line of credit instrument.

      (5) Not later than the 20th day after receipt of the notice described in subsection (4) of this section, the lienholder or trust deed beneficiary shall:

      (a) Indorse on the notice, or on an addendum to the notice, the principal amount of the indebtedness secured by the line of credit instrument on the date the lienholder or trust deed beneficiary received notice;

      (b) Sign and acknowledge the notice or the addendum, if applicable; and

      (c) Record the notice and addendum in the public record where the line of credit instrument was originally recorded.

      (6) If the lienholder or trust deed beneficiary fails to record the notice and addendum, if applicable, within the time period specified in subsection (5) of this section, the debtor may record the notice in the public record where the line of credit instrument was originally recorded, together with proof of receipt by, or personal delivery to, the lienholder or trust deed beneficiary.

      (7) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, the line of credit instrument shall continue to have priority as of its date of recording as to:

      (a) Principal advances, including any advance the creditor is required to honor, that were made before a notice under subsection (4) of this section is received;

      (b) Interest, lawful charges and advances described in subsection (2)(b) and (c) of this section; and

      (c) All advances made after a notice under subsection (4) of this section is received that are within the amount owed at the time the notice under subsection (4) of this section is given. [1987 c.716 §4; 1989 c.198 §1; 1991 c.313 §1; 1991 c.438 §1; 1997 c.152 §1; 2001 c.20 §2; 2007 c.71 §18]

 

      86.157 Action for residual debt after short sale of residential property; payoff statements. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Borrower” means an individual who, directly or indirectly and individually or together with another person, is obligated on a real estate loan agreement, including but not limited to a mortgagor or a grantor, as defined in ORS 86.705, or an assignee or successor in interest.

      (b) “Lender” means a person that makes, extends or holds a real estate loan agreement, including but not limited to a mortgagee or a beneficiary, as defined in ORS 86.705, or an assignee or successor in interest.

      (c) “Payoff statement” means a written statement that sets forth, as of the date the lender prepares the statement, amounts a borrower must pay in order to fully satisfy the borrower’s obligation under a real estate loan agreement.

      (d) “Real estate loan agreement” means an arrangement between a lender and a borrower, including but not limited to a mortgage or a trust deed, by means of which the lender agrees to extend a loan and the borrower agrees to secure the loan in whole or in part with residential property, or an interest in residential property, that is located in this state.

      (e) “Residential property” means real property upon which is situated four or fewer improvements designed for residential use, one of which a borrower occupies as the borrower’s residence.

      (f) “Residual debt” means an amount due on a loan, evidence of which exists in a real estate loan agreement, note, bond, contract or similar written agreement, that a borrower is unable to pay out of the proceeds from a sale of the residential property that secures the loan.

      (g) “Short sale” means a sale of residential property that is subject to foreclosure under ORS 86.705 to 86.815 or ORS chapter 88 for an amount that is less than the remaining amount due on the loan that the residential property secures.

      (2) If a lender reports to the Internal Revenue Service that as a consequence of or in conjunction with a short sale of residential property the lender has canceled all or a portion of a borrower’s obligation under a real estate loan agreement and the lender provides to the borrower written evidence of the lender’s report to the Internal Revenue Service, the lender or an assignee of the lender may not bring an action or otherwise seek payment for the residual debt following the short sale.

      (3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a borrower or an agent of the borrower may rely on a payoff statement for the purpose of establishing the amount the borrower must pay to satisfy the borrower’s obligation under a real estate loan agreement other than a real estate loan agreement for a construction loan.

      (b) A borrower or an agent of the borrower may not rely on a payoff statement after a lender prepares and delivers an amended payoff statement to the borrower or borrower’s agent. For purposes of this paragraph, a lender delivers an amended payoff statement to the borrower or borrower’s agent if the lender provides the amended payoff statement by electronic means in accordance with ORS chapter 84, sends the amended payoff statement by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to the borrower or borrower’s agent at all addresses on file with the lender for the borrower or borrower’s agent, including post office boxes, or sends the amended payoff statement by facsimile, provided that the borrower or borrower’s agent receives the amended payoff statement before the borrower disburses funds for the purpose of satisfying the obligation in accordance with subsection (5) of this section.

      (4) If an amount that a borrower owes under a real estate loan agreement, other than a real estate loan agreement for a construction loan, does not appear on a payoff statement or amended payoff statement and the borrower or an agent of the borrower satisfies the obligation set forth in the payoff statement in accordance with subsection (5) of this section, the lender may recover the amount only as an unsecured obligation or only by foreclosing a mortgage, trust deed or security agreement for any other property that secures the obligation.

      (5) To satisfy an obligation set forth in a payoff statement or an amended payoff statement, a borrower must submit the amount shown in the payoff statement or amended payoff statement, instruct the lender to close any line of credit that is related to the obligation and request a certificate described in ORS 86.100 or a reconveyance under ORS 86.720 before any deadline, expiration date or maturity date specified in the payoff statement or amended payoff statement. A borrower that disburses funds to a lender in the amount shown in the payoff statement or an amended payoff statement has discharged a mortgage for the purpose of requesting a certificate under ORS 86.100 or performed the borrower’s obligation for the purpose of requesting a reconveyance under ORS 86.720. [2011 c.480 §1; 2015 c.431 §1; 2017 c.251 §1]

 

      Note: 86.157 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 86 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (8) Subsection (2) of this section does not excuse the beneficiary or trustee from compliance with subsection (1) of this section.

      (9) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a title insurance company or insurance producer preparing, executing or recording a release of trust deed shall be liable to any party for damages that the party sustains by reason of the negligence or willful misconduct of the title insurance company or insurance producer in connection with the issuance, execution or recording of the release pursuant to this section. Except as provided in subsection (10) of this section, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this section.

      (b)(A) The requirement to request or participate in a resolution conference with a grantor in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) of this section does not apply to a beneficiary if the beneficiary submits to the Attorney General a sworn affidavit that states that during the preceding calendar year the beneficiary did not commence or cause an affiliate, subsidiary or agent of the beneficiary to commence more than 175 actions to foreclose a residential trust deed by advertisement and sale under ORS 86.752 or by suit under ORS 88.010. A beneficiary that is a trustee shall include as part of the total number of foreclosure actions that the beneficiary commenced in the previous calendar year all foreclosure actions that the beneficiary commenced under ORS 86.752 or 88.010 in the beneficiary’s capacity as a trustee. A beneficiary that intends to claim an exemption under this subparagraph shall submit the affidavit in a form and with the contents the Attorney General specifies by rule either:

      (i) Not later than January 31 in any calendar year in which the beneficiary intends to claim the exemption for the remainder of the calendar year; or

      (d) This subsection does not apply to a beneficiary that has submitted an affidavit and is exempt under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (4) A beneficiary that submitted an affidavit in accordance with subsection (1)(b) of this section may, without waiving the exemption the beneficiary claimed in the affidavit, request a resolution conference with a grantor. The beneficiary shall submit a request under this subsection in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsection (2) of this section, except that submitting the request does not require a processing fee.

      (5) The requirement to request or participate in a resolution conference with a grantor in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) of this section does not apply to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs in its capacity as a beneficiary of loans made under ORS 407.125.

      (3) A notice served by mail under subsection (1) of this section is effective when the notice is mailed.

      (4)(a) The disability, insanity or death of a person to whom the notice required under this section must be given does not delay or impair in any way the trustee’s right under a trust deed to foreclose under the deed. If the disability, insanity or death occurs before the notice of default is recorded, the notice required under this section must be given instead to the guardian, the conservator of the estate of the person or the administrator or personal representative of the person in the manner and by the time set forth in this section.

      (b) If the disability, insanity or death of a person to whom the notice required under this section must be given occurs on or after the notice of default is recorded, the trustee shall, if and when the trustee has knowledge of the disability, insanity or death, promptly give the guardian, the conservator of the estate or the administrator or personal representative the required notice by sending the notice by first class and certified mail with return receipt requested to all addresses on file with the trustee for the guardian, conservator or administrator or personal representative, including post office boxes.

      86.767 Failure to give notice of sale; action by omitted person; defense; pleading and proving knowledge of sale; attorney fees; exclusive remedy. (1) If the trustee fails to give notice of the sale to a person entitled to notice under ORS 86.764 (2)(c), and the person did not have actual notice of the sale at least 25 days before the date on which the trustee conducted the sale, the omitted person has the same rights that the holder of a junior lien or interest who was omitted as a party defendant in a judicial foreclosure proceeding possesses, and the purchaser at the trustee’s sale or the purchaser’s heirs, assigns or transferees, have the same rights that a purchaser at a sheriff’s sale following a judicial foreclosure possesses.

      (2) The omitted person may also commence an action against the trustee in the circuit court in the county where the real property is located. In an action against the trustee, the omitted person is entitled to damages if the omitted person proves that:

      (a) The trustee did not give notice of the sale to the omitted person in the manner required by ORS 86.764 (2)(c) and 86.774;

      (b) A search of the record under the name of the grantor as the grantor’s name appears on the trust deed, or as the name of the grantor’s successor in interest appears, would have revealed the omitted person’s interest;

      (c) The omitted person could and would have cured the default under ORS 86.778; and

      (d) The omitted person sustained actual damages as a result of the person’s loss of the opportunity to cure the default under ORS 86.778 (1).

      (3) In an action against the trustee under subsection (2) of this section, a defendant or third party defendant may move for dismissal on the ground that the omitted person would not or could not have cured the default and reinstated the trust deed if the omitted person had received the notice required by ORS 86.764 (2)(c). The court shall hold a hearing on the motion before a hearing on a motion for summary judgment, and before trying the action. The court shall deny the motion only if the omitted person produces affidavits or other evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find, applying a standard of clear and convincing evidence, that the omitted person had the financial ability to cure the default under ORS 86.778 before the date of the trustee’s sale, and that the omitted person would have done so had the omitted person received the notice required by ORS 86.764 (2)(c). If the court grants the motion to dismiss, the court shall award attorney fees under subsection (5) of this section.

      (4) In an action against the trustee or another party under this section the omitted person shall plead that the omitted person did not have actual knowledge of the sale at least 25 days prior to the date the trustee conducted the sale, but thereafter the defendant has the burden of proving that the omitted person did have notice.

      (5) In an action brought under this section, the applicable court may, upon entering judgment, allow to the prevailing party as a part of the costs a reasonable amount for attorney fees at trial and on appeal.

      (6) The remedies described in subsections (1) to (5) of this section are the sole remedies available to a person entitled to notice of foreclosure by advertisement and sale under ORS 86.764 (2)(c), who failed to receive notice. The person’s failure to redeem or to commence an action against the trustee within five years of the date of a trustee’s sale under ORS 86.782 bars any action under this section or any other applicable law.

      (9) Include language that reads substantially as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

      Without limiting the trustee’s disclaimer of representations or warranties, Oregon law requires the trustee to state in this notice that some residential property sold at a trustee’s sale may have been used in manufacturing methamphetamines, the chemical components of which are known to be toxic. Prospective purchasers of residential property should be aware of this potential danger before deciding to place a bid for this property at the trustee’s sale.

      If the new owner wants to move in and use this property as a primary residence, the new owner can give you written notice and require you to move out after 30 days, even though you have a fixed term lease with more than 30 days left.

      You must be provided with at least 30 days’ written notice after the foreclosure sale before you can be required to move.

      A bona fide tenant is a residential tenant who is not the borrower (property owner) or a child, spouse or parent of the borrower, and whose rental agreement:

      • Is the result of an arm’s-length transaction;

      • Requires the payment of rent that is not substantially less than fair market rent for the property, unless the rent is reduced or subsidized due to a federal, state or local subsidy; and

      • Was entered into prior to the date of the foreclosure sale.

 

ABOUT YOUR TENANCY

BETWEEN NOW AND THE FORECLOSURE SALE: RENT

      YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PAY RENT TO YOUR LANDLORD UNTIL THE PROPERTY IS SOLD OR UNTIL A COURT TELLS YOU OTHERWISE. IF YOU DO NOT PAY RENT, YOU CAN BE EVICTED. BE SURE TO KEEP PROOF OF ANY PAYMENTS YOU MAKE.

 

SECURITY DEPOSIT

      You may apply your security deposit and any rent you paid in advance against the current rent you owe your landlord as provided in ORS 90.367. To do this, you must notify your landlord in writing that you want to subtract the amount of your security deposit or prepaid rent from your rent payment. You may do this only for the rent you owe your current landlord. If you do this, you must do so before the foreclosure sale. The business or individual who buys this property at the foreclosure sale is not responsible to you for any deposit or prepaid rent you paid to your landlord.

 

ABOUT YOUR TENANCY

AFTER THE FORECLOSURE SALE

      The new owner that buys this property at the foreclosure sale may be willing to allow you to stay as a tenant instead of requiring you to move out after 30 or 60 days. After the sale, you should receive a written notice informing you that the sale took place and giving you the new owner’s name and contact information. You should contact the new owner if you would like to stay. If the new owner accepts rent from you, signs a new residential rental agreement with you or does not notify you in writing within 30 days after the date of the foreclosure sale that you must move out, the new owner becomes your new landlord and must maintain the property. Otherwise:

      • You do not owe rent;

      • The new owner is not your landlord and is not responsible for maintaining the property on your behalf; and

      • You must move out by the date the new owner specifies in a notice to you.

      The new owner may offer to pay your moving expenses and any other costs or amounts you and the new owner agree on in exchange for your agreement to leave the premises in less than 30 or 60 days. You should speak with a lawyer to fully understand your rights before making any decisions regarding your tenancy.

      IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON TO TRY TO FORCE YOU TO LEAVE YOUR DWELLING UNIT WITHOUT FIRST GIVING YOU WRITTEN NOTICE AND GOING TO COURT TO EVICT YOU. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT A LAWYER. If you believe you need legal assistance, contact the Oregon State Bar and ask for the lawyer referral service. Contact information for the Oregon State Bar is included with this notice. If you do not have enough money to pay a lawyer and are otherwise eligible, you may be able to receive legal assistance for free. Information about whom to contact for free legal assistance is included with this notice.

      86.778 Discontinuance of foreclosure proceedings after cure of default. (1) Where a trustee has commenced foreclosure of a trust deed by advertisement and sale, the grantor, the grantor’s successor in interest to all or any part of the trust property, any beneficiary under a subordinate trust deed, or any person having a subordinate lien or encumbrance of record on the property, may cure the default or defaults at any time prior to five days before the date last set for the sale. If the default consists of a failure to pay, when due, sums secured by the trust deed, the default may be cured by paying the entire amount due at the time of cure under the terms of the obligation, other than such portion as would not then be due had no default occurred. Any other default of the trust deed obligation that is capable of being cured may be cured by tendering the performance required under the obligation or trust deed. In any case, and in addition to paying the sums or tendering the performance necessary to cure the default, the person effecting the cure shall pay to the beneficiary all costs and expenses actually incurred in enforcing the obligation and trust deed, together with trustee’s and attorney fees in the amount of:

      (a) A total of $1,000 for both trustee’s fees and attorney fees, or the amount actually charged by the trustee and attorney, whichever is less, if the trust deed is a residential trust deed; or

      (b) Reasonable attorney fees and trustee’s fees actually charged by the trustee and attorney if the trust deed is not a residential trust deed. Any person entitled to cure the default may, either before or after reinstatement, request any court of competent jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the fee demanded or paid as a condition of reinstatement. The court may award attorney fees to the prevailing party. An action to determine reasonable attorney fees or trustee’s fees under this section shall not forestall any sale or affect its validity.

      (2) After cure of the default under subsection (1) of this section, all proceedings under ORS 86.764 to 86.782 shall be dismissed by the trustee, and the obligation and trust deed shall be reinstated and shall remain in force the same as if no acceleration had occurred. [Formerly 86.753]

 

      86.780 [1959 c.625 §15; 1983 c.719 §12; 1985 c.565 §8; 2009 c.229 §2; renumbered 86.803 in 2013]

The designated time of the trustee’s sale must be after 9 a.m. and before 4 p.m., based on the standard of time set forth in ORS 187.110, and the designated place of the trustee’s sale must be in the county or one of the counties in which the property is situated. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the trustee may sell the property in one parcel or in separate parcels and shall sell the parcel or parcels at auction to the highest bidder for cash. Any person, including the beneficiary under the trust deed, but excluding the trustee, may bid at the trustee’s sale. An attorney for the trustee, or an agent that the trustee or the attorney designates, may conduct the sale and act in the sale as the trustee’s auctioneer.

      (b) If the trustee sells property upon which a single residential unit that is subject to an affordable housing covenant is situated, the eligible covenant holder may purchase the property from the trustee at the trustee’s sale for cash or cash equivalent in an amount that is the lesser of:

      (A) The sum of the amounts payable under ORS 86.794 (1) and (2); or

      (B) The highest bid received for the property other than a bid from the eligible covenant holder.

      (c)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, if an eligible covenant holder purchases the property in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subsection, the sale forecloses and terminates all other interests in the property as provided in ORS 86.797 (1).

      (B) If an interest in the property exists that is prior to the eligible covenant holder’s interest, other than the interest set forth in the trust deed that was the subject of the foreclosure proceeding under ORS 86.752, notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 86.797 (1) the sale does not foreclose and terminate the prior interest and the eligible covenant holder’s title to the property is subject to the prior interest.

      (2)(a) The trustee or the attorney for the trustee, or an agent that the trustee or the attorney designates, may postpone the sale for one or more periods that total not more than 180 days from the original sale date, giving notice of each postponement by public proclamation made at the time and place set for sale. The trustee, the attorney or an agent that the trustee or the attorney designates may make the proclamation.

      (b) If a person postpones the sale date as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the trustee, in the manner provided for the notice of sale under ORS 86.764 (1), shall provide written notice of the new time, date and place for the sale to the grantor and to any person to whom notice of the sale was given under ORS 86.771. The notice must be given at least 15 days before the new sale date. The person may postpone the sale once, for not more than two calendar days, without giving notice as provided in this paragraph. The person may not postpone the sale for more than two calendar days or more than once without giving notice as provided in this paragraph.

      (i) Setting, advertising or otherwise specifying the opening bid amount for the property that is the subject of the trustee’s sale;

      (ii) Providing a correct legal description of the property that is the subject of the trustee’s sale; or

      (C) The beneficiary accepted funds to reinstate the trust deed and obligation in accordance with ORS 86.778, even if the beneficiary did not have a legal duty to do so.

      (b) Within 10 calendar days after the date of the trustee’s sale that the trustee rescinded under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the trustee shall provide notice of the rescission of the trustee’s sale to any person to whom notice of the sale was given. The trustee shall mail or serve notice of the rescission in the manner provided for serving or mailing the notice of sale under ORS 86.764 (1). The notice of rescission must:

The affidavit must identify the trust deed that was subject to the rescinded trustee’s sale and the voided trustee’s deed.

      (e) The trustee’s deed conveys to the purchaser the interest in the property that the grantor had, or had the power to convey, at the time the grantor executed the trust deed, together with any interest the grantor or the grantor’s successors in interest acquire after the execution of the trust deed.

      (5)(a) If property purchased at the trustee’s sale includes one or more dwelling units that are subject to ORS chapter 90, the purchaser must provide written notice of the change in ownership to the occupants of each unit within 30 days after the date of sale and before or concurrently with service of a written termination notice authorized by subsection (6)(c)(B) of this section.

      (b) The notice required by this subsection must:

______________________________________________________________________________

NOTICE TO RESIDENTIAL TENANTS OF CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP

      The property in which you are living has gone through foreclosure and was sold to a new owner on ________ (date). The contact information for the new owner or the owner’s representative is _____________ (name, address, telephone number).

 

      IF YOU ARE A BONA FIDE TENANT RENTING THIS PROPERTY AS A RESIDENTIAL DWELLING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE LIVING IN THIS PROPERTY AFTER THE FORECLOSURE SALE FOR:

      • 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU ARE GIVEN A WRITTEN TERMINATION NOTICE, IF YOU HAVE A FIXED TERM LEASE; OR

      • AT LEAST 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU ARE GIVEN A WRITTEN TERMINATION NOTICE, IF YOU HAVE A MONTH-TO-MONTH OR WEEK-TO-WEEK RENTAL AGREEMENT.

      If the new owner wants to move in and use this property as a primary residence, the new owner can give you written notice and require you to move out after 30 days, even though you have a fixed term lease with more than 30 days left.

      You must be provided with at least 30 days’ written notice after the foreclosure sale before you can be required to move.

      A bona fide tenant is a residential tenant who is not the borrower (property owner), or a child, spouse or parent of the borrower, and whose rental agreement:

      • Is the result of an arm’s-length transaction;

      • Requires the payment of rent that is not substantially less than fair market rent for the property, unless the rent is reduced or subsidized due to a federal, state or local subsidy; and

      • Was entered into prior to the date of the foreclosure sale.

      IMPORTANT:

      YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE NEW OWNER OR THE OWNER’S REPRESENTATIVE AT THE ADDRESS LISTED ON THIS NOTICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO LET THE NEW OWNER KNOW IF YOU ARE A BONA FIDE TENANT. YOU SHOULD PROVIDE WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF YOUR RENTAL AGREEMENT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A FIXED TERM RENTAL AGREEMENT OR LEASE WITH MORE THAN 30 DAYS LEFT. Written evidence of your rental agreement can be a copy of your lease or rental agreement, or other documentation of the existence of your rental agreement. Keep your original documents and a record of any information you give to the new owner.

 

YOUR TENANCY BETWEEN NOW AND THE MOVE-OUT DATE

      The new owner may be willing to allow you to stay as a tenant instead of requiring you to move out after 30 or 60 days. You should contact the new owner if you would like to stay. If the new owner accepts rent from you, signs a new residential rental agreement with you or does not notify you in writing within 30 days after the date of the foreclosure sale that you must move out, the new owner becomes your new landlord and must maintain the property. Otherwise:

      • You do not owe rent;

      • The new owner is not your landlord and is not responsible for maintaining the property; and

      • You must move out by the date the new owner specifies in a notice to you.

      The new owner may offer to pay your moving expenses and any other costs or amounts you and the new owner agree on in exchange for your agreement to leave the premises in less than 30 or 60 days. You should speak with a lawyer to fully understand your rights before making any decisions regarding your tenancy.

      IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON TO TRY TO FORCE YOU TO LEAVE YOUR DWELLING UNIT WITHOUT FIRST GIVING YOU WRITTEN NOTICE AND GOING TO COURT TO EVICT YOU. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT A LAWYER. If you believe you need legal assistance, contact the Oregon State Bar and ask for the lawyer referral service. Contact information for the Oregon State Bar is included with this notice. If you do not have enough money to pay a lawyer and are otherwise eligible, you may be able to receive legal assistance for free. Information about whom to contact for free legal assistance is included with this notice.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (6)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection, the purchaser at the trustee’s sale is entitled to possession of the property on the 10th day after the sale. A person that remains in possession after the 10th day under any interest, except an interest prior to the trust deed, or an interest the grantor or a successor of the grantor created voluntarily, is a tenant at sufferance. The purchaser may obtain possession of the property from a tenant at sufferance by following the procedures set forth in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 or other applicable judicial procedure.

      (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, at any time after the trustee’s sale the purchaser may follow the procedures set forth in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 or other applicable judicial procedure to obtain possession of the property from a person that holds possession under an interest that the grantor or a successor of the grantor created voluntarily if, not earlier than 30 days before the date first set for the sale, the person was served with not less than 30 days’ written notice of the requirement to surrender or deliver possession of the property.

      (c) If the property purchased at the trustee’s sale includes a dwelling unit that is subject to ORS chapter 90 and an individual occupies the unit under a bona fide tenancy, the purchaser may obtain possession by following the procedures set forth in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 and by using the complaint form provided in ORS 105.124 or 105.126:

      (A) At least 60 days after service of a written termination notice, if the bona fide tenancy is a fixed term tenancy as defined in ORS 90.100; or

      (B) At least 30 days after service of a written termination notice if the bona fide tenancy is:

      (i) A fixed term tenancy and the purchaser intends to occupy, as the purchaser’s primary residence, the dwelling unit that is subject to the fixed term tenancy; or

      (ii) A month-to-month tenancy or week-to-week tenancy, as those terms are defined in ORS 90.100.

      (d) If a purchaser gives a 30-day written termination notice pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection, the purchaser may include in the notice a request that a tenant with a fixed term tenancy provide written evidence of the existence of the tenancy to the purchaser at an address described in the notice. Written evidence includes a copy of the rental agreement or another document that shows the existence of the fixed term tenancy. The tenant’s failure to provide the requested written evidence before the purchaser files an action for possession based on a 30-day notice:

      (A) Does not prevent the tenant from asserting the existence of the fixed term tenancy as a defense to the action.

      (B) Prevents the tenant from recovering prevailing party attorney fees or costs and disbursements pursuant to subsection (11)(b) of this section. The 30-day notice must describe the provisions of this paragraph.

      (e) A purchaser may not commence a proceeding under ORS 105.105 to 105.168 that is authorized under this subsection before the later of:

      (A) The 10th day after the trustee’s sale;

      (B) The date specified in a written notice of the requirement to surrender or deliver possession of the property if the notice is required by and is given to the person in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subsection;

      (C) The date specified in a written notice of the purchaser’s intent to terminate a tenancy if the notice is required by and is given to the person in accordance with paragraph (c) of this subsection; or

      (D) The date on which the term of a fixed term tenancy ends, if the property is a dwelling unit and the purchaser has not terminated the tenancy in accordance with paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (f) A purchaser that seeks to obtain possession pursuant to ORS 105.105 to 105.168 must attach proof of service of a written termination notice required by paragraph (c) of this subsection to the pleadings.

      (g) In an action to obtain possession, violation of the procedures required by subsection (5) of this section or paragraph (c) of this subsection is a defense for a bona fide tenant seeking to retain possession.

      (h) As used in this subsection, “bona fide tenancy” means tenancy of a dwelling unit that is subject to ORS chapter 90 that results from an arm’s-length transaction that occurred before the date of a foreclosure sale in which:

      (A) The mortgagor or the child, spouse or parent of the mortgagor under the contract is not the tenant; and

      (B) The rent required is not substantially less than fair market rent for the dwelling unit, unless the rent is reduced or subsidized due to a federal, state or local subsidy.

      (7) A purchaser shall serve a notice under subsection (6) of this section by one or more of the following methods:

      (a) Personal delivery to the tenant.

      (b) First class mail to the tenant at the dwelling unit.

      (c) First class mail to the tenant at the dwelling unit and attachment of a second notice copy. The second notice copy must be attached in a secure manner to the main entrance to the portion of the premises in the possession of the tenant.

      (8) If the notice under subsection (6) of this section is served by mail pursuant to subsection (7)(b) of this section, the minimum period for compliance must be extended by three days and the notice must include the extension in the period stated in the notice.

      (9)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (6)(c) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the purchaser is not a landlord subject to the provisions of ORS chapter 90 unless the purchaser:

      (A) Accepts rent from the individual who possesses the property under a tenancy described in subsection (6)(c) of this section;

      (B) Enters into a new rental agreement with the individual who possesses the property under a tenancy described in subsection (6)(c) of this section; or

      (C) Fails to terminate the tenancy as provided in subsection (6)(c) of this section within 30 days after the date of the sale.

      (b) The purchaser may act as a landlord for purposes of terminating a tenancy in accordance with the provisions of ORS 90.396.

      (c) The purchaser is subject to the provisions of ORS 90.322, 90.375, 105.165, 659A.421 and 659A.425. The application of ORS 90.375 to a purchaser that does not become a landlord does not impose an affirmative duty to pay for or provide services. For the purpose of damages pursuant to this paragraph, “rent” refers to the amount the tenant pays to the landlord for the right to occupy the unit before the foreclosure.

      (10)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the purchaser is not liable to the individual who possesses the property under a tenancy described in subsection (6)(c) of this section for:

      (A) Damage to the property or diminution in rental value; or

      (B) Returning a security deposit.

      (b) A purchaser that is a landlord under the provisions of subsection (9)(a) of this section is liable to the individual who possesses the property under a tenancy described in subsection (6)(c) of this section for:

      (A) Damage to the property or diminution in rental value that occurs after the date of the trustee’s sale; or

      (B) Returning a security deposit the individual pays after the date of the trustee’s sale.

      (11)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection and notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary, in an action or defense arising pursuant to subsection (6)(c), (d), (f) or (g), (7) or (9)(c) of this section, reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal may be awarded to the prevailing party together with costs and disbursements.

      (b) If a tenant asserts a successful defense to an action for possession pursuant to subsection (6)(c), (d), (f) or (g) of this section, the tenant is not entitled to prevailing party fees, attorney fees or costs and disbursements if the purchaser:

      (A) Did not know, and did not have reasonable cause to know, of the existence of a fixed term tenancy when commencing the action for possession; and

      (B) Promptly dismissed the action upon becoming aware of the existence of a fixed term tenancy.

      (c) As used in this subsection, “prevailing party” means the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered.

      (12)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (2)(a) of this section, except when a beneficiary has participated in obtaining a stay, foreclosure proceedings that are stayed by order of the court, by proceedings in bankruptcy or for any other lawful reason shall, after release from the stay, continue as if uninterrupted, if within 30 days after release the trustee sends amended notice of sale by registered or certified mail to the persons listed in ORS 86.764 and 86.774 (1).

      (b) In addition to the notice required under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the trustee shall send amended notice of sale:

      (ii) The address provided by each member of the Oregon State Bar who by registered or certified mail requests the amended notice of sale and includes with the request the notice of default or an identification number for the trustee’s sale that would assist the trustee in identifying the property subject to the trustee’s sale and a self-addressed, stamped envelope measuring at least 8.5 by 11 inches in size; or

      (B) By posting a true copy or a link to a true copy of the amended notice of sale on the trustee’s Internet website.

      (c) The amended notice of sale must:

      (A) Be given at least 15 days before the amended date of sale;

      (B) Set an amended date of sale that may be the same as the original sale date, or date to which the sale was postponed, provided the requirements of this paragraph and ORS 86.764 and 86.774 are satisfied;

      (C) Specify the time and place for sale;

      (D) Conform to the requirements of ORS 86.771; and

      (E) State that the original sale proceedings were stayed and the date the stay terminated.

      (d) If the publication of the notice of sale was not completed before the date the foreclosure proceedings were stayed by order of the court, by proceedings in bankruptcy or for any other lawful reason, after release from the stay, in addition to complying with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, the trustee shall complete the publication by publishing an amended notice of sale that states that the notice has been amended following release from the stay and that contains the amended date of sale. The amended notice must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the counties in which the property is situated once a week for four successive weeks, except that the required number of publications must be reduced by the number of publications that were completed before the effective date of the stay. The last publication must be made more than 20 days before the date the trustee conducts the sale.

      (e) If a portion of the defaults specified in the original notice of default or in the original notice of sale was cured during the time the foreclosure proceedings were stayed, or if additional defaults have occurred during that time, the trustee shall describe in the amended notice of sale only those defaults that existed on the date on which the stay was terminated.

      (f) After a release from a stay of proceedings, the trustee or the attorney for the trustee, or an agent that the trustee or the attorney designates, may postpone a sale for one or more periods that total not more than the greater of 60 days or the portion of the 180-day period allowed for postponement under subsection (2)(a) of this section that remained on the day before the stay began. A postponement under this paragraph must comply with the procedural and notice requirements specified in subsection (2) of this section.

      86.790 [1959 c.625 §3; 1967 c.359 §680; 1975 c.618 §2a; 1979 c.879 §5; 1981 c.192 §1; 1983 c.719 §9; 1989 c.190 §7; 1997 c.70 §1; 1997 c.631 §388; 2003 c.364 §50; 2013 c.125 §2; 2013 c.465 §6; renumbered 86.713 in 2013]

 

      86.794 Disposition of proceeds of sale. The trustee shall apply the proceeds of the trustee’s sale as follows:

      (1) To the expenses of the sale, including the compensation of the trustee, and a reasonable charge by the attorney.

      86.795 [1959 c.625 §19; 1961 c.616 §7; 1965 c.457 §10; renumbered 86.809 in 2013]

 

      86.797 Effect of sale; actions for deficiency; restrictions. (1) If, under ORS 86.705 to 86.815, a trustee sells property covered by a trust deed, the trustee’s sale forecloses and terminates the interest in the property that belongs to a person to which notice of the sale was given under ORS 86.764 and 86.774 or to a person that claims an interest by, through or under the person to which notice was given. A person whose interest the trustee’s sale foreclosed and terminated may not redeem the property from the purchaser at the trustee’s sale. A failure to give notice to a person entitled to notice does not affect the validity of the sale as to persons that were notified.

      (2) Except in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, an action for a deficiency may not be brought after a trustee’s sale under ORS 86.705 to 86.815 or after a judicial foreclosure of a residential trust deed, and a judgment to foreclose a residential trust deed under ORS 88.010 may not include a money award for the amount of the debt against the grantor, the grantor’s successor in interest or another person obligated on:

      (a) The note, bond or other obligation secured by the trust deed for the property that was subject to the trustee’s sale or the judicial foreclosure; or

      (b) Any other note, bond or other obligation secured by a residential trust deed for, or mortgage on, the property that was subject to the trustee’s sale or the judicial foreclosure when the debt, of which the note, bond or other obligation is evidence:

      (A) Was created on the same day as, and used as part of the same purchase or repurchase transaction as, the note, bond or other obligation secured by the foreclosed residential trust deed; and

      (B) Is owed to or was originated by the beneficiary or an affiliate of the beneficiary in the residential trust deed that was subject to the trustee’s sale or the foreclosure.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 88.103, if a judicial foreclosure of a trust deed that is not a residential trust deed results in a judgment that includes a money award, the judgment must provide that execution may issue for the amount by which the unpaid balance of the money award exceeds the net sale proceeds that are payable to the judgment creditor from the sale of the property that is subject to the foreclosure if:

      (a) The net sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the money award; and

      (b) The plaintiff requests the provision in the complaint.

      (4) This section does not preclude:

      (a) An action that forecloses, judicially or nonjudicially:

      (A) Other property covered by the trust deed that is the subject of the foreclosure; or

      (B) Another trust deed, mortgage, security agreement, consensual or nonconsensual security interest or lien that covers other real or personal property that is also used as security for the note, bond or other obligation that is secured by the trust deed for the property that was sold.

      (b) An action against a guarantor for a deficiency that remains after a judicial foreclosure.

      (5) A guarantor of an obligation secured by a residential trust deed may not recover a deficiency from the grantor or a successor in interest of the grantor. [Formerly 86.770; 2015 c.291 §3]

 

      86.800 Contents of trustee’s deed to purchaser. The trustee’s deed to the purchaser at the trustee’s sale shall contain, in addition to a description of the property conveyed, a recital of the facts concerning the default, the notice given, the conduct of the sale and the receipt of the purchase money from the purchaser. [Formerly 86.775]

 

      86.803 Recitals in trustee’s deed and certain affidavits as prima facie or conclusive evidence. When the trustee’s deed is recorded in the deed records of the county or counties where the property described in the deed is situated, the recitals contained in the deed and in the affidavits required under ORS 86.774 (3) and (4) shall be prima facie evidence in any court of the truth of the matters set forth therein, but the recitals shall be conclusive in favor of a purchaser for value in good faith relying upon them. [Formerly 86.780]

 

      86.806 Requests for copies of notice of default or notice of sale. At any time subsequent to the recordation of a trust deed and prior to a recording of notice of default under the deed, any person desiring a copy of any notice of default or any notice of sale under a trust deed as provided in ORS 86.764 (1) may cause to be filed for record in the county clerk’s office of the county or counties in which any part or parcel of the real property is situated, a duly acknowledged request for a copy of any notice of sale or default where service is made upon the trustee. The request shall contain the name and address of the person requesting copies of the notice or notices and shall identify the trust deed by stating the names of the parties to the deed, the date of recordation of the deed and the book and page where the deed is recorded. The county clerk shall immediately make a cross-reference of the request to the trust deed, either on the margin of the page where the trust deed is recorded or in some other suitable place. No request, statement or notation placed on the record pursuant to this section shall affect title to the property or be deemed notice to any person that any person so recording the request has any right, title, interest in, lien or charge upon the property referred to in the trust deed. [Formerly 86.785]

 

      86.809 Compensation of trustee. The charge of a trustee for the performance of powers and duties of foreclosure by advertisement and sale imposed under ORS 86.705 to 86.815 shall not exceed 50 percent of the compensation allowable to a personal representative under ORS 116.173 (3) or a minimum charge of $100. Such compensation shall be based upon the amount due on the obligation, both principal and interest, at the time of the trustee’s sale. [Formerly 86.795; 2017 c.169 §43]

 

      86.812 Impermissible conditions for approving short sale or sale of note; exceptions. (1) As used in this section, “nonprofit entity” means a nonprofit corporation that is organized in this state and that is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a subsidiary or agent of the nonprofit corporation.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a beneficiary may not, as a condition of offering or approving a short sale as an alternative to foreclosing a residential trust deed, require a nonprofit entity that purchases property that is subject to the residential trust deed from a grantor in a short sale, or that purchases a note from the beneficiary that secures the grantor’s obligation to the beneficiary by means of the residential trust deed, to enter into an agreement with the beneficiary or the grantor that limits or bars the grantor, after the short sale or the sale of the note, from owning or occupying the property that is subject to the residential trust deed.

      (3) Subsection (2) of this section does not apply if:

      (a) The beneficiary does not receive notice before the short sale that the nonprofit entity or the grantor intends for the grantor to continue after the short sale to own or occupy the property that is the subject of the short sale;

      (b) The grantor does not allow the beneficiary reasonable access to the property that is the subject of the short sale for the purpose of inspecting or appraising the property;

      (c) Offering or approving the short sale would require the beneficiary to breach a contractual obligation to another person with respect to a residential trust deed that was recorded before July 19, 2013; or

      (d) Offering or approving the short sale would require the beneficiary to breach a legal obligation that is not based on a contract. [2013 c.625 §2]

 

      86.815 Time within which foreclosure must be commenced. The foreclosure of a trust deed by advertisement and sale or the foreclosure of a trust deed by judicial procedure shall be commenced within the time, including extensions, provided by ORS 88.110 and 88.120 for the foreclosure of a mortgage on real property. [Formerly 86.725]
