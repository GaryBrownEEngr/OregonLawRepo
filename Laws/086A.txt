      (1) May make such public or private investigations within or outside this state as the director deems necessary to determine whether a person has violated any provision of ORS 86A.095 to 86A.198 or any rule or order of the director, or to aid in the enforcement of ORS 86A.095 to 86A.198 or in the formulation of rules and forms thereunder;

      (4) If the director has reasonable cause to believe that any person has been engaged, is engaging or is about to engage in any violation of any provision of ORS 86A.095 to 86A.198, may issue an order, subject to ORS 86A.139, directed to the person, and to any other person directly or indirectly controlling the person, to cease and desist from the violation or threatened violation. [Formerly 59.885]

 

      86A.130 Enjoining violations; fine; appointment of receiver; attorney fees; damages to private parties. (1) Whenever the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services has reasonable cause to believe that a person has been engaged or is engaging in any violation of any provision of ORS 86A.095 to 86A.198 or any rule or order of the director, the director may bring suit in the name and on behalf of the State of Oregon in the circuit court of any county of this state to enjoin the violation and to enforce compliance with any provision of ORS 86A.095 to 86A.198 or such rule or order. Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order or writ of mandamus shall be granted. The court may fine the person against whom the order is entered not more than $5,000 for each violation, which shall be entered as a judgment and paid to the General Fund of the State Treasury. Each violation is a separate offense. In the case of a continuing violation, each day’s continuance is a separate violation, but the maximum penalty for any continuing violation shall not exceed $20,000 for each offense. If the court finds that the defendant has violated any provision of ORS 86A.095 to 86A.198 or any such rule or order, the court may appoint a receiver, who may be the director, for the defendant or the defendant’s assets. The court may not require the director to post a bond. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the director if the director prevails in an action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the director had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

      (2) The director may include in any action authorized by subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) A claim for restitution or damages under ORS 86A.151 on behalf of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting the subject matter of the action.

      (b) A claim for disgorgement of illegal gains or profits derived. Any recovery under this paragraph shall be turned over to the General Fund of the State Treasury unless the court requires other disposition. [Formerly 59.890]

 

      86A.133 Procedures where assets or capital of mortgage banker or mortgage broker found impaired; involuntary liquidation.

The director shall inventory the assets and liabilities of the mortgage banker or mortgage broker. The director shall file one copy of the inventory in the office of the director and one copy in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the principal place of business of the mortgage banker or mortgage broker is located, and shall mail one copy to each shareholder or partner of the mortgage banker or mortgage broker at the last-known address of the shareholder or partner. The clerk of the court shall file the inventory as a pending proceeding and give it a case number.

      (2) If any mortgage banker or mortgage broker refuses to permit the director to take possession under this section, the director may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the principal place of business of the mortgage banker or mortgage broker is located for an order appointing a receiver, who may be the director, to take possession.

      (3) If the deficiency in assets or capital has not been made good or the unsound condition remedied within 60 days from the date when the director or receiver took possession, the property, business and assets of the mortgage banker or mortgage broker located in this state shall be liquidated. If a receiver has not been appointed, the director shall apply for such appointment by the court in which the inventory was filed. The liquidation shall proceed as provided by law for liquidation of a private corporation in receivership.

      (4) The expenses of the receiver and compensation of counsel, as well as all expenditures required in the liquidation proceedings, shall be fixed by the director, subject to the approval of the court, and, upon certification by the director, shall be paid out of the funds in the hands of the director as such receiver.

The summary must, at a minimum, disclose these provisions of the reverse mortgage loan contract to the extent that the contract includes the provision:

      (A) At the conclusion of the term of the reverse mortgage loan contract, some or all of the equity in the property that is the subject of the reverse mortgage no longer belongs to the person and the person may need to sell or transfer the property to repay the proceeds of the reverse mortgage from the proceeds of the sale or transfer or the person must otherwise repay the reverse mortgage with interest from the person’s other assets.

      (B) The lender will charge an origination fee, a mortgage insurance premium, closing costs or servicing fees for the reverse mortgage, all or any of which the lender will add to the balance of the reverse mortgage loan.

      (C) The balance of the reverse mortgage loan grows over time and the lender charges interest on the outstanding loan balance.

      (D) The person retains title to the property that is the subject of the reverse mortgage until the person sells or transfers the property and is therefore responsible for paying property taxes, insurance, maintenance and related taxes. Failing to pay these amounts may cause the reverse mortgage loan to become due immediately and may subject the property to a tax lien or other encumbrance or to possible foreclosure.

      (E) Interest on a reverse mortgage is not deductible from the person’s income tax return until the person repays all or part of the reverse mortgage loan.

      (ii) Spoken in a volume and cadence that is sufficient to enable a reasonable person to hear and understand.

      (B) “Reverse mortgage” means a residential mortgage transaction in which the lender provides loan proceeds to a borrower in a lump sum or in monthly installments with the expectation that the borrower will repay the loan from the proceeds of a sale or transfer of the real property that secures the loan.

      (3)(a) A lender who has a contract with a person for a reverse mortgage each year shall send a notice with the information specified in subsection (2)(a)(D) of this section to the person or to any escrow agent, title insurance company or other agent that pays property taxes from an escrow account on the person’s behalf. The lender shall send the notice to the person at the person’s last-known address or to the escrow agent, title insurance company or other agent at the address the lender has in the lender’s records for the escrow agent, title insurance company or other agent. The lender shall send the notice at least 60 calendar days before property taxes are due for the property that is subject to the reverse mortgage.

      (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to a contract for a reverse mortgage that includes a reserve account for taxes.
