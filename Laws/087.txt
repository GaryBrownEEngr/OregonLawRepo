      (B) Satisfies the claim of lien or obtains a release from the claim of lien on the property that is the subject of the sale.

      (8) A violation of subsection (2) or (3) of this section does not occur with respect to a lien described in ORS 87.010 during the period that the validity of the lien is disputed in a judicial proceeding or a proceeding described in ORS chapter 701.

      (9) Nothing in this section requires the payment of a lien that is not otherwise valid.

(1) The site together with the land that may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the improvement constructed on the site, to be determined by the court at the time of the foreclosure of the lien, shall also be subject to the liens created under ORS 87.010 (1), (4) and (5) if, at the time of the commencement of the improvement, the person who caused the improvement to be constructed was the owner of that site and land. If the person owned less than a fee-simple estate in the site and land, then only the interest of the person therein shall be subject to the lien.

      (2) If a lien created under ORS 87.010 (1), (4) and (5) is claimed against a unit as defined in ORS 100.005 to 100.910, the Oregon Condominium Act, the common elements appertaining to that unit are also subject to the lien.

      (3) When the interest of the person who caused the improvement to be constructed is a leasehold interest, and that person has forfeited the rights of the person thereto, the purchaser of the improvement and leasehold term at any sale under the provisions of ORS 87.001 to 87.060 and 87.075 to 87.093, is deemed to be the assignee of the leasehold term, and may pay the lessor all arrears of rent or other money and costs due under the lease. If the lessor regains possession of the property, or obtains judgment for the possession thereof prior to the commencement of construction of the improvement, the purchaser may remove the improvement within 30 days after the purchaser purchases it, and the owner of the land shall receive the rent due the owner, payable out of the proceeds of the sale, according to the terms of the lease, down to the time of removal. [Amended by 1975 c.466 §4]

 

      87.018 Delivery of notices. (1) Except as provided in ORS 87.093, all notices required under ORS 87.001 to 87.060 and 87.075 to 87.093 must be in writing and be delivered in person or by registered or certified mail.

      (2) A notice that must be given under ORS 87.001 to 87.060 or 87.075 to 87.093 to a mortgagee must be delivered to the mortgagee only if the name and address of the mortgagee appear in a mortgage of record or a trust deed of record as required under ORS 205.234 (1)(b) or in the instrument that assigns a mortgage or trust deed as required under ORS 205.234 (1)(g). [1975 c.466 §5; 1981 c.757 §2; 2007 c.648 §15; 2011 c.505 §2]

 

      87.020 [Amended by 1965 c.446 §1; 1967 c.600 §1; 1967 c.602 §1; repealed by 1975 c.466 §6 (87.021 enacted in lieu of 87.020)]

 

      87.021 Notice to owners; notice from owner to original contractor; effect of failure to give notice. (1) Except when material, equipment, services or labor described in ORS 87.010 (1) to (3), (5) and (6) is furnished at the request of the owner, a person furnishing any materials, equipment, services or labor described in ORS 87.010 (1) to (3), (5) and (6) for which a lien may be perfected under ORS 87.035 shall give a notice of right to a lien to the owner of the site. The notice of right to a lien may be given at any time during the progress of the improvement, but the notice only protects the right to perfect a lien for materials, equipment and labor or services provided after a date which is eight days, not including Saturdays, Sundays and other holidays as defined in ORS 187.010, before the notice is delivered or mailed. However, no lien is created under ORS 87.010 (5) or (6) for any services provided for an owner-occupied residence at the request of an agent of the owner.

      (2) The notice required by subsection (1) of this section shall be substantially in the form set forth in ORS 87.023.

      (3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a lien created under ORS 87.010 (1) to (3), (5) or (6) may be perfected under ORS 87.035 only to the extent that the notice required by subsection (1) of this section is given.

      (b) A person who performs labor upon a commercial improvement or provides labor and material for a commercial improvement or who rents equipment used in the construction of a commercial improvement need not give the notice required by subsection (1) of this section in order to perfect a lien created under ORS 87.010. As used in this paragraph:

      (A) “Commercial improvement” means any structure or building not used or intended to be used as a residential building, or other improvements to a site on which such a structure or building is to be located.

      (B) “Residential building” means a building or structure that is or will be occupied by the owner as a residence and that contains not more than four units capable of being used as residences or homes.

      (4) Unless otherwise agreed or the lien claimant who is required to give the notice under subsection (1) of this section is in privity with the original contractor, when a provision in an agreement for the construction of a commercial improvement requires the original contractor to hold an owner harmless or to indemnify an owner for a lien created under ORS 87.010 and perfected under ORS 87.035, that provision is not enforceable as to any lien which requires that a notice under this section be given to the owner unless a copy of the notice is delivered pursuant to ORS 87.018 to the original contractor not later than 10 days after its receipt by the owner. [1975 c.466 §7 (enacted in lieu of 87.020); 1981 c.757 §3; 1983 c.674 §1; 1983 c.757 §1; 1987 c.662 §1; 2001 c.311 §1; 2002 s.s.1 c.6 §§1,4; 2003 c.778 §10]

 

      87.023 Notice of right to lien; form of notice. The notice of right to a lien required under ORS 87.021 shall include, but not be limited to, the following information and shall be substantially in the following form:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

FOR YOUR PROTECTION

      Under Oregon’s laws, those who work on your property or provide labor, equipment, services or materials and are not paid have a right to enforce their claim for payment against your property. This claim is known as a construction lien.

      If your contractor fails to pay subcontractors, material suppliers, rental equipment suppliers, service providers or laborers or neglects to make other legally required payments, the people who are owed money can look to your property for payment, even if you have paid your contractor in full.

      The law states that all people hired by a contractor to provide you with materials, equipment, labor or services must give you a notice of right to a lien to let you know what they have provided.

WAYS TO PROTECT

YOURSELF ARE:

      - RECOGNIZE that this notice of right to a lien may result in a lien against your property unless all those supplying a notice of right to a lien have been paid.

      - LEARN more about the lien laws and the meaning of this notice by contacting the Construction Contractors Board, an attorney or the firm sending this notice.

      - ASK for a statement of the labor, equipment, services or materials provided to your property from each party that sends you a notice of right to a lien.

      - WHEN PAYING your contractor for materials, equipment, labor or services, you may make checks payable jointly to the contractor and the firm furnishing materials, equipment, labor or services for which you have received a notice of right to a lien.

      - OR use one of the methods suggested by the “Information Notice to Owners.” If you have not received such a notice, contact the Construction Contractors Board.

      - GET EVIDENCE that all firms from whom you have received a notice of right to a lien have been paid or have waived the right to claim a lien against your property.

      - CONSULT an attorney, a professional escrow company or your mortgage lender.

      87.025 Priority of perfected liens; right to sell improvements separately from land; notice to mortgagee; list of materials or supplies. (1) A lien created under ORS 87.010 (2) or (6) and perfected under ORS 87.035 upon any lot or parcel of land shall be preferred to any lien, mortgage or other encumbrance which attached to the land after or was unrecorded at the time of commencement of the improvement.

      (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (6) of this section, a lien created under ORS 87.010 (1), (4) or (5) and perfected under ORS 87.035 upon any improvement shall be preferred to all prior liens, mortgages or other encumbrances upon the land upon which the improvement was constructed. To enforce such lien the improvement may be sold separately from the land; and the purchaser may remove the improvement within a reasonable time thereafter, not to exceed 30 days, upon the payment to the owner of the land of a reasonable rent for its use from the date of its purchase to the time of removal. If such removal is prevented by legal proceedings, the 30 days shall not begin to run until the final determination of such proceedings in the court of first resort or the appellate court if appeal is taken.

      (3) No lien for materials or supplies shall have priority over any recorded mortgage or trust deed on either the land or improvement unless the person furnishing the material or supplies, not later than eight days, not including Saturdays, Sundays and other holidays as defined in ORS 187.010, after the date of delivery of material or supplies for which a lien may be claimed delivers to the mortgagee either a copy of the notice given to the owner under ORS 87.021 to protect the right to claim a lien on the material or supplies or a notice in any form that provides substantially the same information as the form set forth in ORS 87.023.

      (4) A mortgagee who has received notice of delivery of materials or supplies in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, may demand a list of those materials or supplies including a statement of the amount due by reason of delivery thereof. The list of materials or supplies shall be delivered to the mortgagee within 15 days, not including Saturdays, Sundays and other holidays as defined in ORS 187.010, of receipt of demand, as evidenced by a receipt or a receipt of delivery of a registered or certified letter containing the demand. Failure to furnish the list or the amount due by the person giving notice of delivery of the materials or supplies shall constitute a waiver of the preference provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

      (5) Upon payment and acceptance of the amount due to the supplier of materials or supplies, and upon demand of the person making payment, the supplier shall execute a waiver of all lien rights as to materials or supplies for which payment has been made.

      (6) Unless the mortgage or trust deed is given to secure a loan made to finance the alteration or repair, a lien created under ORS 87.010 and perfected under ORS 87.035 for the alteration and repair of an improvement commenced and made subsequent to the date of record of a duly executed and recorded mortgage or trust deed on that improvement or on the site shall not take precedence over the mortgage or trust deed.

      (7) The perfection of a lien under ORS 87.035 relates to the date of commencement of the improvement as defined in ORS 87.005. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the date of creation of the lien under ORS 87.010 and the date of perfection of the lien under ORS 87.035 do not affect the priorities under this section, the equal priority of perfected lien claimants, or the distribution of proceeds to perfected lien claimants under ORS 87.060 (6). [Amended by 1965 c.446 §2; 1967 c.602 §2; 1975 c.466 §8; 1981 c.757 §6; 1983 c.513 §1; 1983 c.674 §3; 1985 c.513 §1; 1987 c.662 §3]

 

      87.027 Right of owner to demand list of services, materials, equipment and labor; penalty for failure to provide list. An owner who receives a notice of right to a lien in accordance with the provisions of ORS 87.021 may demand, in writing, from the person providing materials, equipment, services or labor a list of materials or equipment or description of labor or services supplied or a statement of the contractual basis for supplying the materials, equipment, services or labor, including the percentage of the contract completed, and the charge therefor to the date of the demand. The supplier’s statement shall be delivered to the owner within 15 days, not including Saturdays, Sundays and other holidays as defined in ORS 187.010, of receipt of the owner’s written demand, as evidenced by a receipt or a receipt of delivery of a certified or registered letter containing the demand. Failure of the supplier to furnish the information requested constitutes a loss of attorney fees and costs otherwise allowable in a suit to foreclose a lien. [1981 c.757 §8; 1985 c.513 §2; 1987 c.662 §4]

 

      87.030 Effect of owner’s knowledge of improvement; notice of nonresponsibility. (1) Every improvement except an improvement made by a person other than the landowner in drilling or boring for oil or gas, constructed upon lands with the knowledge of the owner shall be deemed constructed at the instance of the owner, and the interest owned shall be subject to any lien perfected pursuant to the provisions of ORS 87.001 to 87.060 and 87.075 to 87.093, unless the owner shall, within three days after the owner obtains knowledge of the construction, give notice that the owner will not be responsible for the same by posting a notice in writing to that effect in some conspicuous place upon the land or the improvement situated thereon.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a lien prohibited under ORS 87.037. [Amended by 1975 c.466 §9; 1987 c.662 §5; 2007 c.648 §9]

 

      87.035 Perfecting lien; filing claim of lien; contents of claim. (1) Every person claiming a lien created under ORS 87.010 (1) or (2) shall perfect the lien not later than 75 days after the person has ceased to provide labor, rent equipment or furnish materials or 75 days after completion of construction, whichever is earlier. Every other person claiming a lien created under ORS 87.010 shall perfect the lien not later than 75 days after the completion of construction. All liens claimed shall be perfected as provided by subsections (2) to (4) of this section.

      (2) A lien created under ORS 87.010 shall be perfected by filing a claim of lien with the recording officer of the county or counties in which the improvement, or some part thereof, is situated.

      (3) A claim of lien shall contain:

      (a) A true statement of demand, after deducting all just credits and offsets;

      (b) The name of the owner, or reputed owner, if known;

      (c) The name of the person by whom the claimant was employed or to whom the claimant furnished the materials or rented the equipment or by whom contributions are owed; and

      (d) A description of the property to be charged with the lien sufficient for identification, including the address if known.

      (4) The claim of lien shall be verified by the oath of the person filing or of some other person having knowledge of the facts, subject to the criminal penalties for false swearing provided under ORS 162.075. [Amended by 1961 c.609 §1; 1973 c.671 §3; 1975 c.466 §10; 1983 c.517 §1; 1985 c.596 §1; 1987 c.662 §6]

 

      87.036 Subcontractor’s perfection of claim of lien; notice; fee; rules. (1) A subcontractor or a person that provides labor, materials or equipment for a project to renovate, remodel, repair or otherwise alter an existing owner-occupied residence may not perfect a claim of lien against the owner’s property under ORS 87.035 if the subcontractor or the person provided or contracted to provide services, labor, materials or equipment to a contractor that was unlicensed at the earlier of the following times:

      (a) The time the subcontractor or the person first contracted with the contractor for the project; or

      (b) The time the person first delivered labor, materials or equipment to the project site.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply if the services, labor, materials or equipment is purchased with cash or consumer credit.

      (3) The Construction Contractors Board may notify a person at the person’s request of the status of a contractor’s license using any means the board uses to notify a contractor of the contractor’s license status. The board may charge the person a fee in an amount the board specifies by rule for the cost of providing the notice to the person. [2010 c.77 §3]

 

      Note: 87.036 was added to and made a part of the Construction Lien Law by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      87.037 Prohibition against claim of lien. An original contractor may not claim a lien arising from the improvement of real property if a written contract for the work is required by ORS 701.305 and the contractor does not have a written contract. [2007 c.648 §5]

 

      Note: 87.037 was added to and made a part of 87.001 to 87.060 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

(1) A person filing a claim of lien pursuant to ORS 87.035 shall mail to the owner and to the mortgagee a notice in writing that the claim has been filed. A copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the notice. The notice shall be mailed not later than 20 days after the date of filing. Notice mailed to the owner who received the notice of right to a lien as provided by ORS 87.021 shall be deemed in compliance with the requirement of this subsection, unless the person giving notice has actual knowledge of changed ownership. Notice mailed by any person to the mortgagee who received the notice required under ORS 87.025 shall be deemed in compliance with this subsection unless the person giving the notice has actual knowledge of a change of mortgagee.

      (2) No costs, disbursements or attorney fees otherwise allowable as provided by ORS 87.060 shall be allowed to any party failing to comply with subsection (1) of this section. [1975 c.466 §14; 1983 c.674 §4; 1985 c.513 §3; 1987 c.662 §7]

      87.050 Recording. The recording officer of each county shall record all notices and claims of lien required to be filed by the provisions of ORS 87.001 to 87.060 and 87.075 to 87.093 in the statutory lien record.

[Amended by 1975 c.466 §12; 1987 c.662 §9; 2001 c.577 §2]

 

      87.055 Duration of lien; when suit to enforce lien commences. No lien created under ORS 87.010 shall bind any improvement for a longer period than 120 days after the claim of lien is filed unless suit is brought in a proper court within that time to enforce the lien, or if extended payment is provided and the terms thereof are stated in the claim of lien, then 120 days after the expiration of such extended payment, but no lien shall be continued in force for a longer time than two years from the time the claim of lien is filed under ORS 87.035 by any agreement to extend payment. For purposes of this section:

      (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, a suit to enforce the lien shall be deemed commenced as provided in ORS 12.020.

      (2) With regard to other parties who are construction lien claimants under ORS 87.035, a suit to enforce the lien shall be deemed to commence when the complaint is filed, whether or not summons or service with regard to such parties is completed within the time required by ORS 12.020. [Amended by 1975 c.466 §13; 1985 c.341 §1; 1985 c.513 §4; 1987 c.662 §10]

 

      87.057 Notice of intent to foreclose; list of materials furnished and statement of prices; effect of failure to give notice. (1) A person intending to foreclose a lien shall deliver to the owner of the property upon which the lien is claimed and to the mortgagee a notice in writing not later than 10 days prior to commencement of the suit stating that such person, or others, intends to commence suit to foreclose the lien. Notice delivered to the mortgagee who received the notice required by ORS 87.025 shall be deemed in compliance with this subsection, unless the person giving notice has actual knowledge of a change of mortgagee.

      (2) Where a notice of intent to foreclose a lien has been given as provided by subsection (1) of this section, the sender of the notice upon demand of the owner shall furnish to the owner within five days after the demand a list of the materials and supplies with the charge therefor, or a statement of a contractual basis for the owner’s obligation, for which a claim will be made in the suit to foreclose.

      (3) A plaintiff or cross-complainant seeking to foreclose a lien in a suit to foreclose shall plead and prove compliance with subsections (1) and (2) of this section. No costs, disbursements or attorney fees otherwise allowable as provided by ORS 87.060 shall be allowed to any party failing to comply with the provisions of this section.

      87.059 [2011 c.630 §56; repealed by 2016 c.99 §15]

 

      87.060 Foreclosure; right to jury trial; distribution of proceeds of foreclosure sale. (1) A suit to enforce a lien perfected under ORS 87.035 shall be brought in circuit court, and the pleadings, process, practice and other proceedings shall be the same as in other cases.

      (2) In a suit to enforce a lien perfected under ORS 87.035, evidence of the actual costs of the labor, equipment, services and material provided by the lien claimant establishes a rebuttable presumption that those costs are the reasonable value of that labor, equipment, services and material.

      (3) In a suit to enforce a lien perfected under ORS 87.035, the court shall allow or disallow the lien. If the lien is allowed, the court shall proceed with the foreclosure of the lien and resolve all other pleaded issues. If the lien is disallowed, and a party has made a demand for a jury trial as provided for in subsection (4) of this section, the court shall impanel a jury to decide any issues triable of right by a jury. All other issues in the suit shall be tried by the court.

      (4) A party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury after the lien is disallowed, if that party serves a demand therefor in writing upon the other parties at any time prior to commencement of the trial to foreclose the lien. The demand shall be filed with the court. The failure of a party to serve a demand as required by this subsection shall constitute a waiver by the party of trial by jury. A demand for trial by jury made as provided in this subsection may not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties.

      (5) When notice of intent to foreclose the lien has been given, pleaded and proven as provided for in ORS 87.057, the court, upon entering judgment for the lien claimant, shall allow as part of the costs all moneys paid for the filing or recording of the lien and all moneys paid for title reports required for preparing and foreclosing the lien. In a suit to enforce a lien perfected under ORS 87.035 the court shall allow a reasonable amount as attorney fees at trial and on appeal to the party who prevails on the issues of the validity and foreclosure of the lien.

      (6) In case the proceeds of any sale under ORS 87.001 to 87.060 and 87.075 to 87.093 are insufficient to pay all lienholders claiming under such statutes, the liens of all persons shall be paid pro rata. Each claimant is entitled to execution for any balance due the claimant after the distribution of the proceeds, and that execution shall be issued by the clerk of the court, upon demand, after the return of the sheriff or other officer making the sale showing the balance due.

      (7) All suits to enforce any lien perfected under ORS 87.035 shall have preference on the calendar of the court over every civil suit, except suits to which the state is a party, and shall be tried by the court without unnecessary delay. In such a suit, all persons personally liable, and all lienholders whose claims have been filed for record pursuant to ORS 87.035, shall, and all other persons interested in the matter in controversy, or in the property sought to be charged with the lien, may be made parties; but persons not made parties are not bound by the proceedings. The proceedings upon the foreclosure of the liens perfected under ORS 87.035 shall, as nearly as possible, conform to the proceedings of a foreclosure of a mortgage lien upon real property.

      87.070 Amount of recovery by contractor; respective rights of contractor and owner. Any contractor may recover, upon a lien perfected by the contractor, only the amount due to the contractor according to the terms of the contract, after deducting all claims of other parties for work done and materials furnished for which a lien is perfected under ORS 87.035. Where a claim of lien is filed pursuant to ORS 87.035 for work done or material or equipment furnished to any contractor, the contractor shall defend any action brought thereupon at the expense of the contractor, and during the pendency of such action the owner may withhold from the contractor the amount of money for which such claim of lien is filed. In case of judgment against the owner or the property of the owner upon the lien, the owner may deduct from any amount due or to become due by the owner to the contractor the amount of such judgment and costs; and if the amount of the judgment and costs exceeds the amount due by the owner to the contractor, or if the owner has settled with the contractors in full, the owner may recover back from the contractor any amount so paid in excess of the contract price, and for which the contractor was originally the party liable.

If the lien is not released within 10 days after the demand and notice is delivered and the lien claimant or an assignor of the lien claimant does not bring a suit to foreclose the lien within the time provided in ORS 87.055, and if the person who made the demand has complied with this section and ORS 87.078 and 87.081, then the lien claimant or assignor of the lien claimant who fails to release or foreclose the lien is liable to the person for the actual costs the person incurred in complying with this section and ORS 87.078 and 87.081 or the sum of $500, whichever is greater, in addition to any other remedy provided by law or equity.

      (b) In an action to recover damages under this subsection in which the plaintiff prevails, the court, at trial and on appeal, shall allow and fix a reasonable amount for attorney fees for prosecution of the action, if the court finds that a written demand for payment of the claim was made on the defendant not less than 20 days before commencement of the action. However, the court may not allow attorney fees to the plaintiff, but shall allow attorney fees to the defendant, if the court finds that the defendant tendered to the plaintiff prior to commencement of the action an amount not less than the damages awarded to the plaintiff.

The notice shall state the location and time of the filing or deposit.

      (2) If a person does not notify the lien claimant as required by subsection (1) of this section, the filing of the bond or the deposit of money is of no effect and the provisions of ORS 87.083 shall not apply in a suit to foreclose the lien for which the filing or deposit is made.

The property described in the claim of lien is thereafter entirely free of the lien and is not involved in subsequent proceedings.

      (2) The county or an officer or employee of the county may not be named or otherwise made a party to a suit described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) When a bond is filed or money is deposited, if, in a suit to enforce the lien for which the filing or deposit is made, the court allows the lien, the lien must be satisfied out of the bond or money. The court shall include as part of the court’s judgment an order that specifies the amount the treasurer must release to the judgment creditor and the amount of the remaining balance that the treasurer must release to the person who deposited the money.

The lien claimant shall state in detail the reasons for the inadequacy. Not later than two days after the filing of the petition with the court, the lien claimant shall send a notice of the filing and a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail to the person who filed the bond.

      (B) Based on probable cause but that the lien amount does not accurately reflect the reasonable charges authorized and accruing under subsection (1) of this section, then the court shall enter an order modifying the lien amount to accurately state the reasonable charges authorized and accruing under subsection (1) of this section, award reasonable attorney fees to the respondents and direct the foreclosure to proceed.

      (C) Without probable cause, then the court may enter an order striking the lien created under subsection (1) of this section and may, but only if a final judgment is entered in the defendant’s favor in the criminal case related to the impoundment under ORS 167.345, order an impounded animal returned to its lawful owner. To prevent the lawful owner or any other claimant from being unjustly enriched while having been relieved of the duty to provide an impounded animal with minimum care, any court order directing return of an impounded animal shall include an award to the respondents of the full costs of providing care to the animal.

      (d) A person’s failure to file a written petition within 30 days of impoundment of an animal or animals shall constitute a waiver of the right to file a petition under this subsection and the foreclosure shall proceed without judicial review in the manner provided in ORS 87.172 to 87.212. The court may extend the 30-day period to file a written petition by an additional 15 days only if the petitioner did not have actual notice of the impoundment and the court makes findings, on the record and in writing, that there are exceptional and compelling circumstances justifying the extension.

Except as provided in ORS 87.156 and 90.120, a landlord has a lien on all chattels, except wearing apparel as defined in ORS 18.345 (1), owned by a tenant or occupant legally responsible for rent, brought upon the leased premises, to secure the payment of rent and such advances as are made on behalf of the tenant. The landlord may retain the chattels until the amount of rent and advances is paid. [1975 c.648 §5; 1981 c.258 §1; 1997 c.374 §8]

 

      87.165 [Repealed by 1975 c.648 §72]

 

      87.166 Attachment of liens. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the liens created by ORS 87.152 to 87.162 attach to the chattels described in those sections when:

      (a) The services or labor are performed or the materials or money are furnished by the lien claimant to the lien debtor; and

      (b) The charges for the services or labor performed and materials or money furnished are due and the lien debtor either knows or should reasonably know that the charges are due.

      (2) The lien created by ORS 87.162 attaches to the chattels described in that section on the 20th day after rents or advances occur or attaches when the occupant or tenant attempts to remove the chattels from the premises while there are unpaid rents or advances. A person claiming a lien under ORS 87.162 may take the chattels subject to that lien into the possession of the person when the lien attaches or at any time thereafter. [1975 c.648 §6]

 

      87.170 [Repealed by 1975 c.648 §72]

 

      87.172 Time period before foreclosure allowed. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person claiming a lien under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 must retain the chattel that is subject to the lien for at least 60 days after the lien attaches to the chattel before foreclosing the lien.

      87.176 Fees for storage of chattel; notice to lien debtor; effect of failure to comply. (1) When the lien claimed under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 is for other than the storage of a chattel, if the lien claimant incurs expenses in storing the chattel prior to foreclosure, the lien claimant may charge reasonable fees for the storage of the chattel for a period not exceeding six months from the date that the lien attaches to the chattel. A lien claimant seeking to recover storage fees for storage expenses incurred prior to foreclosure shall send a written notice, within 20 days from the date that the storage fees began to accrue, to the lien debtor and every other person that requires notification under ORS 87.196. The claimant shall transmit the notice by certified mail. A person notified under ORS 87.196 need not receive the notice within the 20-day period, but within a reasonable time. If the lien claimant fails to comply with the notice requirements of this subsection, the lien claimant is limited to recovering reasonable fees for the storage of the chattel prior to foreclosure for a period of time not exceeding 20 days from the date that the lien attached to the chattel.

      (2) When the lien claimed under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 is for the storage of a chattel, the lien claimant shall send a written notice stating that storage fees are accruing, within 20 days after the chattel has been placed in storage, to the lien debtor and every other person that requires notification under ORS 87.196. The claimant shall transmit the notice by certified mail. A person notified under ORS 87.196 need not receive the notice within the 20-day period, but within a reasonable time. If the claimant fails to comply with the notice requirements of this subsection, the amount of the claimant’s lien shall be limited to a sum equal to the reasonable storage expenses incurred within the 20-day period.

      87.177 Bond or deposit of money for lien for storage of chattel; amount; notice to lien claimant; filing affidavit with county officer. (1) When a lien claimed under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 is for the storage of a chattel and the amount of the lien claimed is $750 or more, the lien debtor, or any other interested person, may file with the recording officer of the county in which the lien claimant obtained possession of the chattel subject to the lien from the lien debtor a bond executed by a corporation authorized to issue surety bonds in the State of Oregon to the effect that the principal or principals on the bond shall pay the amount of the claim and all costs and attorney fees that are awarded against the chattel on account of the lien. The bond shall be in an amount not less than 200 percent of the amount claimed under the lien for the storage of the chattel.

      (2)(a) In lieu of the surety bond provided for in subsection (1) of this section, when a lien claimed under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 is for the storage of a chattel and the amount of the lien claimed is $750 or more, the lien debtor, or any other interested person, may deposit with the treasurer of the county in which the lien claimant obtained possession of the chattel subject to the lien from the lien debtor a sum of money or its equivalent equal in value to 200 percent of the amount claimed under the lien for the storage of the chattel.

      (b) The court in which any proceeding to foreclose the lien for the storage of the chattel may be brought may, upon notice and upon motion by a person who makes a deposit under paragraph (a) of this subsection, order the money invested in such manner as the court may direct. A person who makes a deposit under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be entitled to any income from the investments and the treasurer of the county shall pay the income when received to the depositor without order.

      (3) A bond or money may be filed or deposited under subsection (1) or (2) of this section at any time after a lien for the storage of a chattel is claimed under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 and the amount of the lien claimed is $750 or more.

      (4) A person who files a bond or deposits money under subsections (1) to (3) of this section shall cause to be served upon the lien claimant a notice of the filing or deposit. If the person files a bond, the notice shall include a copy of the bond. The notice shall be filed not later than 20 days after the filing or deposit and shall state the location and time of the filing or deposit.

      (5) If a person does not notify the lien claimant as required by subsection (4) of this section, the filing of the bond or the deposit of money is of no effect and the provisions of subsections (1) to (3) of this section do not apply in a suit to foreclose the lien for which the filing or deposit is made.

      (6) When a person files a bond with the recording officer of a county under subsections (1) to (3) of this section and serves notice of the filing upon the lien claimant under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the person shall file with the same recording officer an affidavit stating that the notice was served.

      (7) When a person deposits money with the treasurer of a county under subsections (1) to (3) of this section and serves notice of the deposit upon the lien claimant under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the person shall file with the recording officer of the same county an affidavit stating that the deposit was made and notice was served.

      87.178 Foreclosure after filing of bond or deposit of money; effect of filing or deposit; disposition of bond or money. (1) When a lien claimed under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 is for the storage of a chattel and the amount of the lien claimed is $750 or more, any suit to foreclose the lien that is commenced or pending after the filing of a bond or deposit of money under ORS 87.177 (1) to (3) shall proceed as if no filing or deposit had been made except that the lien shall attach to the bond or money upon the filing or deposit and the service of notice of the filing or deposit upon the lien claimant. The chattel described in the claim of lien shall thereafter be entirely free of the lien and shall in no way be involved in subsequent proceedings.

      (2) When a bond is filed or money is deposited and, in a suit to enforce the lien for which the filing or deposit is made, the court allows the lien, the lien shall be satisfied out of the bond or money. The court shall include as part of its judgment an order for the return to the person who deposited the money of any amount remaining after the lien for the storage of the chattel is satisfied.

      (3) When a bond is filed or money is deposited and, in a suit to enforce the lien for which the filing or deposit is made, the court disallows the lien, the court shall include as part of its judgment an order for the return of the bond or money to the person who filed the bond or deposited the money.

(1) If a lien claimant considers the bond filed with a recording officer of a county under ORS 87.177 (1) to (3) inadequate to protect the claim of the lien claimant for some reason other than the amount of the bond, the lien claimant may petition the court in which the suit to foreclose the lien for the storage of the chattel may be brought for a determination of the adequacy of the bond. The petition must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the notice of the filing of the bond under ORS 87.177 (4) and (5). The petition must describe in detail the reasons for the inadequacy.

      (2) Not later than two days after the filing of the petition with the court, the lien claimant shall send a notice of the filing and a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail to the person who filed the bond. After a hearing, if the court determines that the bond is inadequate for one or more of the reasons described by the lien claimant, the court shall order such action as shall make the bond adequate to protect the claim of lien.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, liens created by ORS 87.152 to 87.162 may be foreclosed by suit as provided in ORS chapter 88, or by sale of the chattel subject to the lien at public auction to the highest bidder for cash. [1975 c.648 §9]

      (c) If a lien claimant fails to give notice in accordance with this subsection to a lien debtor concerning chattel described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the lien claimant is liable to the lien debtor for a sum equal to the fair market value of the chattel sold at the foreclosure sale. The lien debtor may bring an action to recover the sum and reasonable attorney fees.

      (2) The lien claimant shall give public notice of the foreclosure sale by posting notice of the foreclosure sale in a public place at or near the front door of the county courthouse of the county in which the sale is to be held and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, in a public place at the location where the lien claimant obtained possession of the chattel to be sold from the lien debtor.

(1)(a) A lien claimant that forecloses by sale a lien created under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 shall give notice of the foreclosure sale by first class, registered or certified mail. The following apply:

      (A) The lien claimant shall give notice to all persons that have filed a financing statement in the office of the Secretary of State, or in the office of the appropriate county officer of the county in which the sale is held, to perfect a security interest in the chattel to be sold.

      (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, if the chattel to be sold at the foreclosure sale is a chattel, other than part of the motor vehicle inventory of a dealer issued a vehicle dealer certificate under ORS 822.020, for which the Department of Transportation has issued a certificate of title under ORS 803.045, for which the State Marine Board requires a certificate of title under ORS 830.810 or for which the Oregon Department of Aviation requires a certificate of registration under ORS 837.040, the lien claimant needs to give notice only to persons that the certificate of title or certificate of registration indicates have a security interest or lien in the chattel.

      (C) The lien claimant shall give notice under this paragraph at least 30 days before the foreclosure sale, but if the lien claimant claims a lien under ORS 87.152, the lien claimant shall give the notice required by this subsection:

      (i) Not later than the 20th day after the date on which the storage charges begin;

      (ii) Not later than the 30th day after the date on which the services provided are completed, if no storage charges are imposed; or

      (iii) At least 15 days before the foreclosure sale if the lien is for the cost of removing, towing or storing a vehicle that a person who holds a certificate issued under ORS 819.480 has appraised at a value of $1,000 or less.

      (2) A person who is entitled to receive notice under subsection (1) of this section may discharge the lien and preserve the person’s security interest in the chattel by paying the lien claimant the amount of the lien claim and reasonable expenses the lien claimant actually incurs in foreclosing the lien claim. If the person does not discharge the lien before the day of the foreclosure sale, the foreclosure sale extinguishes the person’s security interest in the chattel even if the person does not receive notice under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) If a lien claimant does not give notice in accordance with subsection (1) of this section to a person that claims a security interest or lien on the chattel sold at a foreclosure sale, the lien claimant is liable to the person for a sum equal to the fair market value of the chattel sold at the foreclosure sale or the amount due to the person under the security agreement or lien at the time of the foreclosure sale, whichever amount is less. The secured party or other lien claimant may recover the sum and reasonable attorney fees by an action at law.

The person foreclosing the lien may require the holder of the subordinate lien or security interest to furnish reasonable proof of the existence of the security interest or lien. If the person foreclosing the lien does not receive proof of the existence of the subordinate security interest or lien, the person is not required to apply proceeds of the sale to satisfy the indebtedness secured by the subordinate security interest or lien.

      (3) If a county treasurer receives proceeds under subsection (1) of this section, the county treasurer shall credit the proceeds to the general revenue fund of the county, subject to the right of the lien debtor or the representative of the lien debtor, to reclaim the proceeds at any time within three years of the date of deposit with the treasurer.

      (2) When the lien claimant delivers a certified copy of a court’s order and a certified copy of the notice of claim of lien to a sheriff under subsection (1) of this section, the lien claimant, not later than the 30th day before the foreclosure sale, shall also send a copy of that order and notice by registered or certified mail to each person with a lien on the chattel to be sold recorded in the county of sale or with a security interest in the chattel to be sold who has filed a financing statement perfecting that security interest in the office of the Secretary of State or in the office of the appropriate county officer of the county in which the sale is held. If the chattel to be sold at the foreclosure sale is a chattel for which a certificate of title is required by the laws of this state, the lien claimant shall also so notify those persons whom the certificate of title indicates have a security interest or lien in the chattel.

      87.312 Effect of notice of foreclosure sale to secured parties; failure to give notice. (1) A person who claims a lien or has a security interest in a chattel to be sold at a foreclosure sale and who is notified under ORS 87.306 (2) may discharge the foreclosing lien claimant’s lien and preserve the security interest or lien claim of the person by paying the foreclosing lien claimant the amount of the lien claim and the expenses actually incurred in foreclosing it. If the person does not so discharge the lien before the day of the foreclosure sale, the security interest or lien claim of the person is extinguished.

      (2) If the chattel to be sold at a foreclosure sale is a chattel for which a certificate of title is required by the laws of this state and if the lien claimant does not notify a person whom the certificate of title indicates has a security interest or lien in the chattel as required by ORS 87.306 (2), the chattel remains subject to that security interest or lien and the buyer of the chattel at a foreclosure sale held under ORS 9.370, 87.142 to 87.490, 87.705, 87.710, 87.910 and 90.120 takes the chattel subject to the security interest or lien.

The secured party or other lien claimant shall recover that sum by an action at law. [1975 c.648 §34]

(1) The proceeds of a sale to foreclose a lien created by ORS 87.216 to 87.232 shall first be applied to the payment of the expenses incurred by the sheriff in obtaining possession of the chattel and advertising and conducting the foreclosure sale, and secondly to the discharge of the lien.

      (2) After the payment of expenses and the discharge of the lien, any amount remaining shall be paid by the sheriff to the treasurer of the county in which the foreclosure sale is held. The remainder shall be accompanied by a statement of the lien claim and the sheriff’s costs in foreclosing the lien, a copy of the published or posted notice and a statement of the amount received for the chattel sold at the sale. The county treasurer shall credit the remainder to the general revenue fund of the county, subject to the right of the lien debtor, or the representative of the lien debtor, to reclaim the remainder at any time within three years of the date of deposit with the treasurer. If the remainder is not demanded and claimed within such period, it shall become the property of the county. [1975 c.648 §35]

When a lien created by ORS 87.216 is junior and subordinate to a prior duly perfected security interest, that lien shall be foreclosed by suit under ORS chapter 88. In such a suit to foreclose, the holder of the prior security interest shall be made a party defendant to the foreclosure proceeding. The person holding the prior security interest may extinguish the lien created by ORS 87.216 by either a foreclosure proceeding under ORS chapter 88 or a nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding under ORS 79.0601 to 79.0628.

If the individual or an authorized representative of that individual refuses to pay the long term care facility for the costs of care within 30 days after the services are rendered and any portion thereof are billed to the individual or the authorized representative of the individual, the unpaid amount plus interest thereon at the legal rate of interest provided for in ORS 82.010 shall be a lien in favor of the long term care facility against the real property of the individual receiving care. The lien shall attach to the real property on the day, whichever is later, that is:

The written statement shall describe the procedures, process and rights and responsibilities of the individual receiving care and the long term care facility under ORS 87.501 to 87.542. Notwithstanding ORS 87.507 and 87.522, if a long term care facility does not provide such written statement as required by this subsection to an individual or an authorized representative, the lien created by this section for the contracted costs of care provided to the individual may not be perfected and may not be foreclosed.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, real and personal property held in trust by a trustee for an individual receiving care are subject to the laws of this state applicable to trusts. [1995 c.749 §2; 1997 c.744 §2]

      (1) “Agricultural produce” means horticultural products, viticultural products, fruit, berries, vegetables, hops, mint oil, hazelnuts or other nuts, dairy products, bee products, vermiculture products, hay or straw baled and prepared for market, meat animals and Christmas trees as defined in ORS 571.505.

      87.705 Agricultural produce lien; date lien attaches. (1) An agricultural producer that delivers or transfers agricultural produce for consideration to a purchaser has a lien for the contract price of that produce, or for the reasonable value of the produce if there is no contract price. The lien created by this section attaches to all agricultural produce, whether in a raw or processed condition, delivered or transferred to the purchaser by any agricultural producer and to all other inventory of the purchaser. The lien also attaches to proceeds received by the purchaser from the sale by the purchaser to a third party of any raw or processed agricultural produce. If the agricultural produce that an agricultural producer delivers to the purchaser consists of meat animals, the lien also attaches to all accounts receivable by the purchaser from the sale of any agricultural produce to a third party. The lien on the agricultural produce, inventory, proceeds or accounts receivable attaches on the date physical possession of the agricultural produce is delivered or transferred by the agricultural producer to the purchaser or an agent of the purchaser.

      (2) An agricultural producer that claims a lien under subsection (1) of this section need not file any notice in order to perfect the lien. The agricultural producer must file a notice of lien as provided in ORS 87.710 or a notice of claim of lien as provided in ORS 87.242 to extend the lien beyond the normal expiration date.

      (3) The lien created by this section is subject to the provisions of ORS 79.0320 (1).

      (4) An agreement by an agricultural producer purporting to waive the right to file notice under ORS 87.242 or 87.710 of a lien created by this section is void as contrary to public policy. [1973 c.647 §3; 1975 c.648 §53; 1999 c.612 §2; 2001 c.301 §11; 2007 c.71 §21; 2011 c.359 §2]

 

      87.710 Filing notice of lien; duration of lien; contents of notice; notice to secured parties; effect of failure to give notice to secured parties. (1) A lien created under ORS 87.705 expires no later than the end of the 45th day after the date that the final payment to the agricultural producer is originally due, unless the producer extends the lien as provided in subsection (2) of this section or ORS 87.242. If the agricultural producer extends the lien, the lien expires no later than the 225th day after the date that the final payment to the producer is originally due.

      (2) An agricultural producer may extend a lien created under ORS 87.705 by filing a notice of lien with the Secretary of State or by filing a notice of claim of lien under ORS 87.242. If a notice of lien is filed under this subsection, the agricultural producer may file the notice only during the period after the date that payment for the agricultural produce is originally due and no later than the 45th day after the date that the final payment for the produce is due. The notice must be supported by affidavit and contain:

      (a) A true statement of the agricultural producer’s demand after deducting all credits and offsets;

      (b) The name of the purchaser that received the agricultural produce to be charged with the lien;

      (c) A description of the produce delivered or transferred by the producer sufficient to identify the basis for the lien;

      (d) A statement that the amount claimed is a true and bona fide existing debt as of the date of the filing of the notice of lien;

      (e) The date that the final payment to the producer was originally due; and

      (f) Such other information as the Secretary of State may require.

      (3) If an agricultural producer files a notice of lien under this section, the producer shall send notice to all persons that have filed a financing statement under ORS chapter 79 that perfects a security interest in all or part of the same inventory, proceeds or accounts receivable. The notice to those persons must provide the same information contained in the notice of lien required by subsection (2) of this section and be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.

      (4) The agricultural producer must send notice to other persons as required by subsection (3) of this section no later than the 20th day after filing the notice of lien. If the agricultural producer does not send a person notice within the required time, the lien created under ORS 87.705 becomes subordinate to that person’s perfected security interest in the agricultural produce, proceeds or accounts receivable of the purchaser.

      (5) For purposes of this section, final payment to the agricultural producer for agricultural produce is due:

      (a) On the date specified for payment in the contract between the purchaser and the producer; or

      (b) If there is no contract or no date of payment is specified in the contract, two business days after the purchaser takes delivery of the produce.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 174.120, for purposes of this section and ORS 87.730 and 87.735, if the last day of the period for performing an act is a Saturday, or a legal holiday as specified in ORS 187.010 and 187.020, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday or legal holiday. [1973 c.647 §4; 1975 c.648 §54; 1975 c.703 §7; 1999 c.612 §3; 2001 c.301 §12; 2011 c.359 §3]

 

      87.715 Priority. Except for tax liens, and except as provided in ORS 87.146 (1)(c) and 87.710 (4), the class of lien created by ORS 87.705 is prior and superior to all other classes of lien or any classes of security interest in the inventory, proceeds or accounts receivable of a purchaser, without regard to whether those other liens or security interests attached to the inventory, proceeds or accounts receivable before or after a lien created by ORS 87.705 attaches. Except as provided in ORS 87.710 (4), all liens of the class created under ORS 87.705, regardless of the date of attachment or the date of notice of lien, are of equal priority and payable pro rata in proportion to the size of each lien. This section does not prohibit an unequal pro rata recovery between agricultural producers supplying meat animals and other agricultural producers if the inequality results from a lien on accounts receivable created under ORS 87.705. [1973 c.647 §5; 2001 c.301 §13]

 

      87.720 [1973 c.647 §6; 1991 c.230 §22; repealed by 2001 c.301 §25]

[1973 c.647 §7; 1981 c.897 §26]

 

      87.730 Expiration of lien for failure to bring timely foreclosure suit. A lien created under ORS 87.705 expires unless suit to foreclose the lien is brought in an appropriate court no later than the 45th day after the date final payment to the agricultural producer is originally due or, if the producer extends the lien by filing a notice of lien under ORS 87.710, no later than the 225th day after the date final payment to the producer is originally due. [1973 c.647 §8; 2001 c.301 §14]

 

      87.735 Filing certificate of lien satisfaction upon payment for produce; liability of producer for failure to discharge lien. (1) When an agricultural producer receives full payment for agricultural produce, if the producer has filed a notice under ORS 87.710 (2) to extend a lien or under ORS 87.725 to foreclose a lien, the producer shall file with the Secretary of State a certificate declaring that full payment has been received from the purchaser and that the lien is discharged.

      (2) Upon receiving the certificate, the Secretary of State shall enter the certificate in the index maintained by the secretary for filing financing statements pursuant to ORS chapter 79.

      (3) If an agricultural producer that receives full payment for agricultural produce fails to file the certificate described in subsection (1) of this section on or before the 10th day after receiving a request for filing from a purchaser, the producer is liable to the purchaser in the sum of $100 damages and for all actual damages caused by the failure, to be recovered in an action at law.

(1) Notices filed with the Secretary of State under ORS 87.710 and certificates filed with the Secretary of State under ORS 87.735 must be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall include the notices and certificates in the index maintained by the secretary for filing financing statements pursuant to ORS chapter 79. The secretary shall maintain the notices and certificates as public records for a period of time established by the secretary.

      (2) The Secretary of State shall establish fees pursuant to ORS 177.130 for filing notices and certificates and for furnishing copies of notices or certificates. Fees established pursuant to this subsection are nonrefundable. [2001 c.301 §2]

      87.750 Definitions for ORS 87.750 to 87.777. As used in ORS 87.750 to 87.777, unless the context otherwise requires:

      (1) “Agricultural producer” means a person that engages in or has engaged in the business of growing or producing grain for market or for delivery or transfer to others owning or holding title to the grain. “Agricultural producer” includes a landowner, producer, landlord, tenant, sharecropper or other person who participates in the growing of grain and receives a share of the grain.

      (2) “Grain” means wheat, seed corn, corn used for animal feed, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, certified alfalfa seed, agricultural seed as defined in ORS 633.511 (1), vegetable seed as defined in ORS 633.511, the seed of any cereal grain, soybeans, grain sorghum, dry beans and dry peas and any other grain for which standards are established or followed by the State Department of Agriculture.

      (3) “Inventory” means all grain purchased or received from agricultural producers, whether in bulk lots or in blended or packaged form. “Inventory” does not include the equipment or supplies of the person holding or owning the grain.

      (4) “Person” means individual, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, business trust, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, cooperative, government entity, unincorporated organization or other business entity. [1981 c.446 §2; 1983 c.141 §1; 1995 c.371 §10; 2001 c.301 §17]

 

      87.755 Grain producer’s lien; date lien attaches; priority. (1) An agricultural producer that delivers or transfers grain for consideration has a lien on the inventory of the purchaser and proceeds received by the purchaser from the selling of the inventory.

      (2) The lien created by subsection (1) of this section attaches to the inventory and proceeds on the date physical possession of the grain is delivered or transferred by the agricultural producer to the purchaser or an agent of the purchaser. If grain is delivered or transferred by an agricultural producer to a person other than the purchaser for cleaning or storage, the lien attaches when the grain is physically delivered or transferred to the purchaser or an agent of the purchaser for agreed consideration.

      (3) Except as provided under ORS 87.146 (1)(c) and 87.762 (4), the class of lien created by subsection (1) of this section is prior and superior to all other classes of lien or any classes of security interest in the inventory or proceeds, regardless of whether the creditor’s lien or security interest attached to the inventory or proceeds before or after the agricultural producer’s lien attached under subsection (2) of this section. Except as provided in ORS 87.762 (4), all liens of the class created under subsection (1) of this section, regardless of the date of attachment or the date of notice of lien, are of equal priority and payable pro rata in proportion to the size of each lien.

      (4) An agricultural producer who claims a lien under subsection (1) of this section need not file any notice in order to perfect the lien. The agricultural producer must file a notice of lien as provided under ORS 87.762 or a notice of claim of lien under ORS 87.242 to extend the lien beyond the normal expiration date.

      (5) The lien created by subsection (1) of this section is subject to the provisions of ORS 79.0320 (1).

      (6) The lien created by subsection (1) of this section is discharged with regard to inventory that is sold by the purchaser or an agent of the purchaser to a third party. Notwithstanding a discharge with regard to inventory sold to a third party, an agricultural producer continues to hold a lien on the proceeds from the sale to a third party and on all remaining inventory of the purchaser.

      (7) An agreement by an agricultural producer purporting to waive the right to file notice under ORS 87.242 or 87.762 of a lien created by subsection (1) of this section is void as contrary to public policy. An agricultural producer may waive the right to file notice under ORS 87.242 or 87.762 if the purchaser is an association of which the agricultural producer is a member. [1981 c.446 §3; 2001 c.301 §18; 2001 c.445 §163; 2011 c.359 §4]

 

      87.760 [1973 c.145 §2; repealed by 1975 c.648 §72]

 

      87.762 Filing notice of lien; duration of lien; contents of notice; notice to secured parties; effect of failure to give notice to secured parties. (1) A lien created under ORS 87.755 expires no later than the end of the 180th day after the date the lien attaches, unless the agricultural producer extends the lien by filing a notice of lien as provided in this section or by filing a notice of claim of lien under ORS 87.242. If the agricultural producer extends the lien, the lien expires no later than 18 months after the date the lien attaches.

      (2) At any time prior to expiration of the initial lien period, an agricultural producer may extend a lien created under ORS 87.755 by filing a notice of lien with the Secretary of State or by filing a notice of claim of lien under ORS 87.242. If a notice of lien is filed under this subsection, the notice must be supported by affidavit and contain:

      (a) A true statement of the demand of the agricultural producer after deducting all credits and offsets;

      (b) The name of the person that purchased the grain from the producer;

      (c) A description of the grain delivered or transferred by the producer sufficient to identify the basis for the lien;

      (d) A statement that the amount claimed is a true and bona fide existing debt as of the date of filing the notice of lien;

      (e) The date payment to the producer was originally due; and

      (f) Such other information as the Secretary of State may require.

      (3) If an agricultural producer files a notice of lien under this section, the producer shall send notice to all persons that have filed a financing statement under ORS chapter 79 that perfects a security interest in all or part of the inventory of the purchaser or the proceeds from the sale of the inventory. The notice to the secured parties must provide the same information contained in the notice required by subsection (2) of this section and be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.

      (4) The agricultural producer must send notice to other persons as required by subsection (3) of this section no later than the 20th day after filing the notice of lien. If the agricultural producer does not send a person notice within the required time, the lien created under ORS 87.755 becomes subordinate to that person’s perfected security interest in the inventory or proceeds of the purchaser.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 174.120, for purposes of this section and ORS 87.772 and 87.777, if the last day of the period for performing an act is a Saturday, or a legal holiday as specified in ORS 187.010 and 187.020, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday or legal holiday. [1981 c.446 §4; 2001 c.301 §19; 2011 c.359 §5]

The Secretary of State shall include the notice of lien that is filed under ORS 87.762 (2) in the index maintained by the secretary for filing financing statements pursuant to ORS chapter 79. The Secretary of State shall maintain the notices as public records for a period of time established by the secretary.

      (2) The Secretary of State shall establish fees pursuant to ORS 177.130 for filing notices and requests for copies of notices. Fees established pursuant to this subsection are nonrefundable. [1981 c.446 §5; 1999 c.464 §4; 2001 c.301 §20]

 

      87.770 [1973 c.145 §4; repealed by 1975 c.648 §72]

 

      87.772 Expiration of lien for failure to bring timely foreclosure action; manner of foreclosure. (1) A lien created under ORS 87.755 (1) expires unless suit to foreclose the lien is brought in an appropriate court no later than the 180th day after the date that the lien attaches, or if the agricultural producer extends the lien by filing a notice of lien under ORS 87.762, no later than 18 months after the date the lien attaches.

      (2) Regardless of whether the lien created under ORS 87.755 (1) has been extended by filing and giving notice under ORS 87.762, the lien shall be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of liens generally.

      (3) In all suits under ORS 87.750 to 87.777, the court shall, upon entering judgment for the plaintiff, allow as a part of the costs all moneys paid for the filing and recording of the lien and a reasonable amount for attorney fees. [1981 c.446 §6; 2001 c.301 §21]

      87.777 Filing certificate of lien satisfaction upon payment for grain; liability of producer for failure to discharge lien. (1) If an agricultural producer files a notice of lien under ORS 87.762, when the producer receives full payment for the grain, the producer shall file with the Secretary of State a certificate declaring that full payment has been received and that the lien is discharged.

      (2) Upon receiving the certificate, the Secretary of State shall enter it in the index maintained by the secretary for filing financing statements pursuant to ORS chapter 79.

      (3) If an agricultural producer that receives full payment for grain fails to file a certificate described in this section on or before the 10th day after receiving a request for filing from a purchaser, the producer is liable to the purchaser of the grain in the sum of $100 damages and for all actual damages caused by the failure, to be recovered in an action at law.
