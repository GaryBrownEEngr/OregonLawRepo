Each such application shall be accompanied by a tentative plan showing the general design of the proposed subdivision or partition. No plat for any proposed subdivision or partition may be considered for approval by a city or county until the tentative plan for the proposed subdivision or partition has been approved by the city or county. Approval of the tentative plan shall not constitute final acceptance of the plat of the proposed subdivision or partition for recording. However, approval by a city or county of such tentative plan shall be binding upon the city or county for the purposes of the preparation of the subdivision or partition plat, and the city or county may require only such changes in the subdivision or partition plat as are necessary for compliance with the terms of its approval of the tentative plan for the proposed subdivision or partition.

      (2) After September 9, 1995, when a local government makes a decision on a land use application for a subdivision inside an urban growth boundary, only those local government laws implemented under an acknowledged comprehensive plan that are in effect at the time of application shall govern subsequent construction on the property unless the applicant elects otherwise.

      (3) A local government may establish a time period during which decisions on land use applications under subsection (2) of this section apply. However, in no event shall the time period exceed 10 years, whether or not a time period is established by the local government.

(1) The governing body of a county or a city may, as provided in ORS 92.048, when reasonably necessary to accomplish the orderly development of the land within the jurisdiction of such county or city under ORS 92.042 and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the county or city, adopt regulations or ordinances governing approval, by the county or city of proposed partitions. Such regulations or ordinances shall be applicable throughout the area over which the county or city has jurisdiction under ORS 92.042, or over any portion thereof. Such ordinances or regulations may specify the classifications of such partitions which require approval under this section and may establish standards and procedures governing the approval of tentative plans for such partitions. The standards may include all, or less than all, of the same requirements as are provided or authorized for subdivisions under ORS 92.010 to 92.192 and may provide for different standards and procedures for different classifications of such partitions so long as the standards are no more stringent than are imposed by the city or county in connection with subdivisions.

      (2) Such ordinances or regulations may establish the form and contents of the tentative plans of partitions submitted for approval.

      (3)(a) The governing body of a city or county may provide for the delegation of any of its lawful functions with respect to partitions to the planning commission of the city or county or to an official of the city or county appointed by the governing body for such purpose.

      (b) If an ordinance or regulation adopted under this section includes the delegation to a planning commission or appointed official of the power to take final action approving or disapproving a tentative plan for a partition, such ordinance or regulation may also provide for appeal to the governing body from such approval or disapproval and require initiation of any such appeal within 10 days after the date of the approval or disapproval from which the appeal is taken.

      (c) The governing body may establish, by ordinance or regulation, a fee to be charged for an appeal under ORS chapter 197, 215 or 227, except for an appeal under ORS 197.805 to 197.855.

      (4) The governing body may, by ordinance or regulation, prescribe fees sufficient to defray the costs incurred in the review and investigation of and action upon applications for approval of proposed partitions.

      (5) No tentative plan of a proposed partition may be approved unless the tentative plan complies with the applicable zoning ordinances and regulations and the ordinances or regulations adopted under this section that are then in effect for the city or county within which the land described in the tentative plan is situated.

      (6) Any ordinance or regulation adopted under this section shall comply with the comprehensive plan for the city or county adopting the ordinance or regulation. [1955 c.756 §22; 1973 c.696 §10; 1983 c.827 §19f; 1989 c.772 §7; 1993 c.792 §47; 1999 c.348 §13]

 

      92.048 Procedure for adoption of regulations under ORS 92.044 and 92.046. The procedure for adoption of any ordinance or regulation under ORS 92.044 and 92.046 is as follows:

      (1) The planning commission of the county or the city shall hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance or regulation after publishing notice of the hearing 10 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the area in which land to be subject to such ordinance or regulation is situated or, if there is no such newspaper, a newspaper of general circulation published in the county. The notice shall contain the time, place and purpose of the hearing and a description of the land to be subject to the ordinance or regulation.

      (2) Prior to the expiration of 60 days after the date of such hearing, the planning commission may transmit its recommendation regarding the proposed ordinance or regulation to the governing body of the county or city, as the case may be. If the planning commission recommendation has not been received by the governing body of the county or the city prior to the expiration of such 60-day period, the governing body may consider the ordinance or regulation without recommendation of the planning commission thereon.

      (3) Prior to the adoption of such ordinance or regulation, the governing body of the county or the city shall hold a hearing thereon after giving notice of the hearing in the same manner provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) A copy of any regulation or ordinance adopted by the governing body of a county or a city under this section, together with a map of the area subject to the regulation or ordinance and a brief statement of the different classifications, if any, of land partitioning under the ordinance or regulation, shall be filed with the recording officer of the county in which the land subject to the ordinance or regulation is situated. Such ordinance or regulation shall not be effective until so filed. If the ordinance or regulation is applicable throughout all of the area over which the county or city has jurisdiction under ORS 92.042, only an outline map of such area shall be filed with the recording officer of the county.

      (5) The ordinance or regulation may be amended from time to time by following the procedure prescribed in this section. [1955 c.756 §23; 1973 c.314 §1; 1973 c.696 §11; 1983 c.570 §2]

 

      92.050 Requirements of survey and plat of subdivision and partition. (1) A person shall not submit a plat of a subdivision or partition for record, until all the requirements of ORS 209.250 and the plat requirements of the subdivision or partition have been met.

      (2) The survey for the plat of the subdivision or partition shall be done in a manner to achieve sufficient accuracy that measurements may be taken between monuments within one-tenth of a foot or one ten-thousandth of the distance shown on the subdivision or partition plat, whichever is greater.

      (3) The survey and plat of the subdivision or partition shall be made by a registered professional land surveyor.

      (4) The plat of the subdivision or partition shall be of sufficient scale and lettering size, approved by the county surveyor, so that:

      (a) The survey and mathematical information and all other details are clearly and legibly shown on the plat.

      (b) Each lot or parcel is numbered consecutively.

      (c) The lengths and courses of the boundaries of each lot or parcel are shown on the plat.

      (d) Each street is named and shown on the plat.

      (5) The locations and descriptions of all monuments found or set must be carefully recorded upon all plats and the proper courses and distances of all boundary lines, conforming to the surveyor’s certificate, must be shown.

      (6) The location, dimensions and purpose of all recorded and proposed public and private easements must be shown on the subdivision or partition plat along with the county clerk’s recording reference if the easement has been recorded by the county clerk. Private easements become effective upon the recording of the plat.

      (7) The area of each lot or parcel must be shown on the subdivision or partition plat.

      (8) In addition to showing bearings in degrees, minutes and seconds and distances in feet and hundredths of a foot, the following curve information must be shown on the subdivision or partition plat either on the face of the map or in a separate table:

      (a) Arc length;

      (b) Chord length;

      (c) Chord bearing;

      (d) Radius; and

      (e) Central angle.

      (9) A city or county may not require that a final subdivision, condominium or partition plat show graphically or by notation on the final plat any information or requirement that is or may be subject to administrative change or variance by a city or county or any other information unless authorized by the county surveyor. [Amended by 1955 c.756 §10; 1983 c.309 §3; 1989 c.772 §8; 1991 c.763 §10; 1993 c.702 §3; 1995 c.382 §4; 1997 c.489 §2; 1999 c.1018 §1; 2005 c.399 §5]

 

      92.055 Requirements for unsurveyed and unmonumented parcels on plats. (1) A parcel larger than 10 acres that is created outside an urban growth boundary is not required to be surveyed and monumented and shall comply with the following:

      (a) The approximate acreage of each unsurveyed parcel shall be shown; and

      (b) Any unsurveyed parcel shall have the words “unsurveyed” placed in bold letters adjacent to the parcel number.

      (2) Unsurveyed parcels need not comply with ORS 92.050 (5), (7) and (8). [1995 c.382 §2; 1999 c.1018 §2; 2005 c.399 §6]

 

      Note: 92.055 was added to and made a part of 92.010 to 92.192 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      92.060 Marking subdivision, partition or condominium plats with monuments; types of monuments; property line adjustment. (1) The initial point, also known as the point of beginning, of a plat must be on the exterior boundary of the plat and must be marked with a monument that is either galvanized iron pipe or an iron or steel rod. If galvanized iron pipe is used, the pipe may not be less than three-quarter inch inside diameter and 30 inches long. If an iron or steel rod is used, the rod may not be less than five-eighths of an inch in least dimension and 30 inches long. The location of the monument shall be with reference by survey to a section corner, one-quarter corner, one-sixteenth corner, Donation Land Claim corner or to a monumented lot corner or boundary corner of a recorded subdivision, partition or condominium plat. When setting a required monument is impracticable under the circumstances, the county surveyor may authorize the setting of another type of monument.

      (2) In subdivision plats, the intersections, the initial point, also known as the point of beginning, the point of ending, points of curves and points of tangents, or the point of intersection of the curve if the point is within the pavement area of the road, of the centerlines of all streets and roads and all points on the exterior boundary where the boundary line changes direction, must be marked with monuments either of galvanized iron pipe or iron or steel rods. If galvanized iron pipe is used, the pipe may not be less than three-quarter inch inside diameter and 30 inches long. If iron or steel rods are used, the rod may not be less than five-eighths of an inch in least dimension and 30 inches long. When setting a required monument is impracticable under the circumstances:

      (a) The county surveyor may authorize the setting of another type of monument; or

      (b) The county surveyor may waive the setting of the monument.

      (3) All lot and parcel corners except lot corners of cemetery lots must be marked with monuments of either galvanized iron pipe not less than one-half inch inside diameter or iron or steel rods not less than five-eighths inch in least dimension and not less than 24 inches long. When setting a required monument is impracticable under the circumstances:

      (a) The surveyor may set another type of monument; or

      (b) The county surveyor may waive the setting of the monument.

      (4) A surveyor shall set monuments with sufficient accuracy that measurements may be taken between monuments within one-tenth of a foot or within one ten-thousandth of the distance shown on the subdivision or partition plat, whichever is greater.

      (5) A surveyor shall set monuments on the exterior boundary of a subdivision, unless the county surveyor waives the setting of a particular monument, where changes in the direction of the boundary occur and shall reference the monuments on the plat of the subdivision before the plat of the subdivision is offered for recording. However, the surveyor need not set the remaining monuments for the subdivision prior to the recording of the plat of the subdivision if:

      (a) The registered professional land surveyor performing the survey work certifies that the remaining monuments will be set, unless the county surveyor waives the setting of a particular monument, on or before a specified date as provided in ORS 92.070 (2); and

      (b) The person subdividing the land furnishes to the county or city by which the subdivision was approved a bond, cash deposit, irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 or other security as required by the county or city guaranteeing the payment of the cost of setting the remaining monuments for the subdivision as provided in ORS 92.065.

      (6) A surveyor shall set all monuments on the exterior boundary and all parcel corner monuments of partitions, unless the county surveyor waives the setting of a particular monument, before the partition plat is offered for recording. Unless the governing body provides otherwise, any parcels created outside an urban growth boundary that are greater than 10 acres need not be surveyed or monumented.

      (7) Except as provided in subsections (8) and (9) of this section, a property line adjustment must be surveyed and monumented in accordance with subsection (3) of this section and a survey, complying with ORS 209.250, must be filed with the county surveyor.

      (8) Unless the governing body of a city or county has otherwise provided by ordinance, a survey or monument is not required for a property line adjustment when the abutting properties are each greater than 10 acres. Nothing in this subsection exempts a local government from minimum area requirements established in acknowledged comprehensive plans and land use regulations.

      (9) The requirements of subsection (7) of this section do not apply to property transferred through a property line adjustment as described in ORS 92.010 (9)(e). [Amended by 1955 c.756 §11; 1973 c.696 §12; 1983 c.309 §4; 1989 c.772 §9; 1991 c.331 §20; 1991 c.763 §11; 1993 c.702 §4; 1995 c.79 §32; 1995 c.382 §5; 1997 c.268 §2; 1997 c.489 §3; 1997 c.631 §391; 1999 c.1018 §3; 2005 c.230 §3; 2005 c.399 §7a; 2007 c.866 §9; 2008 c.12 §4]

 

      92.065 Monumenting certain subdivision corners after recording plat; bond, cash deposit or other security. (1) Except for exterior monuments described in ORS 92.060 (5), if the remaining corners of a subdivision are to be monumented on or before a specified date after the recording of the plat of the subdivision, the person subdividing the land described in the subdivision plat shall furnish to the county surveyor, prior to approval of the subdivision plat by the county surveyor, a bond, cash deposit, irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 or other security, as required at the option of the city or county, in an amount equal to 120 percent of the estimated cost of performing the work for the remaining monumentation.

      (2) The county surveyor may require that the setting of the remaining corners of the subdivision be delayed, according to the provisions of this section, if the installation of street and utility improvements has not been completed, or if other conditions or circumstances justify the delay.

      (3) The person subdividing the lands described in subsection (1) of this section shall pay the surveyor for performing the remaining monumentation work and notify the county surveyor of the payment. The county surveyor, within three months after the notice, shall release the bond, irrevocable letter of credit or other required security, or return the cash deposit upon a finding that the payment has been made. Upon written request from the person subdividing the land, the governing body may pay the surveyor from moneys within a cash deposit held by it for that purpose and return the excess of the cash deposit, if any, to the person who made the deposit. If the subdivider has not paid the surveyor within 30 days of final approval of the remaining monumentation, the city or county may pay the surveyor from moneys held in a cash deposit, if any, or require payment to be made from other security.

      (4) In the event of the death, disability or retirement from practice of the surveyor charged with the responsibility for setting remaining monuments for a subdivision or upon the failure or refusal of the surveyor to set the monuments, the county surveyor shall cause the monumentation to be completed and referenced for recording as provided in ORS 92.070. If another surveyor completes the remaining monumentation, the surveyor shall submit an affidavit to the county surveyor complying with ORS 92.070 (3)(b). The county surveyor shall note on the original, and on any exact copies filed in accordance with ORS 92.120 (3) the surveyor’s name and business address. Payment of the fees for completing said monumentation shall be made by the subdivider within 30 days of the completion of such work. In the event that the subdivider fails to pay such fees within 30 days, the bond, cash deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or other security may be used to pay such fees; and when such cash or other securities are inadequate to cover the cost incurred by the county surveyor, the balance due will constitute a lien on any lots in the subdivision that are still in the ownership of the subdivider when recorded pursuant to ORS 93.600 to 93.802. [1973 c.696 §14; 1983 c.309 §5; 1989 c.772 §10; 1991 c.331 §21; 1991 c.763 §12; 1995 c.382 §6; 1997 c.631 §392; 1999 c.1018 §4]

 

      92.070 Surveyor’s certificates; procedure for recording monumented corners on plat previously recorded; reestablishing certain monuments. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a subdivision or partition plat designating the location of land in a county in the State of Oregon, offered for record, must include on the face of the plat a surveyor’s certificate, together with the seal and signature of the surveyor having surveyed the land represented on the plat, to the effect that the surveyor has correctly surveyed and marked with proper monuments the lands as represented and has placed a proper monument as provided in ORS 92.060 indicating the initial point of the plat and its location in accordance with ORS 92.060 (1) and accurately describing by metes or bounds, or other description as approved by the county surveyor, the tract of land upon which the lots and blocks or parcels are laid out.

      (2) If the person subdividing any land has complied with ORS 92.065 (1), the surveyor may prepare the plat of the subdivision for recording with only the exterior monuments referenced on the subdivision plat as submitted for recording. The subdivision plat shall include a certification of the surveyor that the remaining corners for the subdivision will be monumented on or before a specified date in accordance with ORS 92.060, noting those monuments to be set on or before said specified date on the subdivision plat as approved by the city or county.

      (3) After the remaining corners for a subdivision have been monumented as provided in the certificate submitted under subsection (2) of this section, the surveyor performing the work shall:

      (a) Within five days after completion of the work, notify the person subdividing the land involved and the county surveyor by whom the subdivision was approved; and

      (b) Upon approval of the work under ORS 92.100 by the county surveyor, submit an affidavit for recording stating that the subdivision plat has been correctly surveyed and marked with proper monuments at the remaining corners of the subdivisions as noted on the original subdivision plat. Any monument that cannot be set shall be separately noted and a reference monument shall be set. The affidavit shall be approved by the county surveyor before recording. The surveyor who prepared the affidavit shall cause the affidavit to be recorded in the office of the county recorder where the subdivision plat is recorded. The county clerk shall promptly provide a recorded copy of the affidavit to the county surveyor. The county surveyor shall note the monuments set and the recorder’s information on the county surveyor’s copy of the subdivision plat and any exact copies filed in accordance with ORS 92.120 (3). The original plat may not be corrected or changed after it is recorded with the county clerk.

      (4) The county surveyor approving the work pursuant to subsection (3) of this section shall reference the approval upon the subdivision plat and tracings previously recorded. A city surveyor approving the work under ORS 92.100 (1) shall reference that surveyor’s approval on the affidavit required under this section prior to approval by the county surveyor.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 209.250, the surveyor who prepared the subdivision or partition plat may reestablish plat monuments within two years of plat recordation without filing a map of the survey as required under ORS 209.250. The surveyor reestablishing any plat monuments shall prepare an affidavit stating that the reestablished corners of the subdivision or partition plat have been correctly surveyed and marked with proper monuments as required under ORS 92.060. The affidavit shall be approved by the county surveyor prior to recordation of the affidavit with the county clerk. The surveyor who prepared the affidavit shall file the affidavit with the county clerk for the county where the subdivision or partition plat is recorded. The county clerk shall promptly provide a certified copy of the recorded affidavit to the surveyor. The county surveyor shall indicate the reestablished monuments on the county surveyor’s copy of the plat of the subdivision or partition and any copies of the plat filed under ORS 92.120 (3). The original plat may not be corrected or changed after it is recorded with the county clerk. The county shall charge a fee for recording the affidavit in the county clerk’s office and the county surveyor’s office. The fee shall be established by the governing body of the county and shall be paid to the county surveyor. [Amended by 1973 c.696 §13; 1983 c.309 §6; 1989 c.772 §11; 1991 c.763 §13; 1995 c.382 §7; 1997 c.489 §4; 1999 c.1018 §5; 2001 c.173 §1; 2005 c.399 §8]

 

      92.075 Declaration required to subdivide or partition property; contents. (1) In order to subdivide or partition any property, the declarant shall include on the face of the subdivision or partition plat, if a partition plat is required, a declaration, taken before a notary public or other person authorized by law to administer oaths, stating that the declarant has caused the subdivision or partition plat to be prepared and the property subdivided or partitioned in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Any dedication of land to public purposes or any public or private easements created, or any other restriction made, shall be stated in the declaration.

      (2) If the declarant is not the fee owner of the property, the fee owner and the vendor under any instrument of sale shall also execute the declaration for the purpose of consenting to the property being subdivided or partitioned.

      (3) If the subdivision or partition plat contains any dedication or donation of land to public purposes, the holder of any mortgage or trust deed shall also execute the declaration for the purpose of consenting to the property being submitted to the provisions of this chapter.

      (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) to (3) of this section, the fee owner, vendor or the mortgage or trust deed holder may record an affidavit consenting to the declaration of property being subdivided or partitioned and to any dedication or donation of property to public purposes. The affidavit must indicate the recorded document by which the interest in the property was acquired and all information required by ORS 93.410 to 93.530 and must be recorded in deed records at the same time as the subdivision or partition plat. The county clerk shall note the recording information of the affidavit on the original and any exact copies of the subdivision or partition plat. [1991 c.763 §3; 1995 c.382 §8; 2005 c.399 §9]

 

      Note: 92.075 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 92 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      92.080 Preparation of plat. Notwithstanding ORS 205.232 and 205.234, all plats subdividing or partitioning land in a county in this state, dedications of streets or roads or public parks and squares and other writings made a part of the subdivision or partition plats offered for record in a county in this state must be made on material that is 18 inches by 24 inches in size with an additional three-inch binding edge on the left side when required by the county clerk or the county surveyor, that is suitable for binding and copying purposes, and that has the characteristics of strength and permanency required by the county clerk and county surveyor. All signatures on the original subdivision or partition plat must be in archival quality black ink. The subdivision or partition plat must be of a scale required by the county surveyor. The lettering of the approvals, the declaration, the surveyor’s certificate and all other information must be of a size or type to be clearly legible, but the information may not come nearer an edge of the sheet than one inch. The subdivision or partition plat may be placed on as many sheets as necessary, but a face sheet and an index page must be included for subdivision or partition plats placed upon three or more sheets. [Amended by 1955 c.756 §12; 1973 c.696 §15; 1985 c.582 §1; 1989 c.772 §12; 1991 c.763 §14; 1993 c.321 §6; 1993 c.702 §5; 1997 c.489 §5; 1999 c.710 §3; 2005 c.399 §10]

 

      92.090 Approval of subdivision plat names; requisites for approval of tentative subdivision or partition plan or plat. (1) Subdivision plat names shall be subject to the approval of the county surveyor or, in the case where there is no county surveyor, the county assessor. No tentative subdivision plan or subdivision plat of a subdivision shall be approved which bears a name similar to or pronounced the same as the name of any other subdivision in the same county, unless the land platted is contiguous to and platted by the same party that platted the subdivision bearing that name or unless the party files and records the consent of the party that platted the contiguous subdivision bearing that name. All subdivision plats must continue the lot numbers and, if used, the block numbers of the subdivision plat of the same name last filed. On or after January 1, 1992, any subdivision submitted for final approval shall not use block numbers or letters unless such subdivision is a continued phase of a previously recorded subdivision, bearing the same name, that has previously used block numbers or letters.

      (2) No tentative plan for a proposed subdivision and no tentative plan for a proposed partition shall be approved unless:

      (a) The streets and roads are laid out so as to conform to the plats of subdivisions and partitions already approved for adjoining property as to width, general direction and in all other respects unless the city or county determines it is in the public interest to modify the street or road pattern.

      (b) Streets and roads held for private use are clearly indicated on the tentative plan and all reservations or restrictions relating to such private roads and streets are set forth thereon.

      (c) The tentative plan complies with the applicable zoning ordinances and regulations and the ordinances or regulations adopted under ORS 92.044 that are then in effect for the city or county within which the land described in the plan is situated.

      (3) No plat of a proposed subdivision or partition shall be approved unless:

      (a) Streets and roads for public use are dedicated without any reservation or restriction other than reversionary rights upon vacation of any such street or road and easements for public or private utilities.

      (b) Streets and roads held for private use and indicated on the tentative plan of such subdivision or partition have been approved by the city or county.

      (c) The subdivision or partition plat complies with any applicable zoning ordinances and regulations and any ordinance or regulation adopted under ORS 92.044 that are then in effect for the city or county within which the land described in the subdivision or partition plat is situated.

      (d) The subdivision or partition plat is in substantial conformity with the provisions of the tentative plan for the subdivision or partition, as approved.

      (e) The subdivision or partition plat contains a donation to the public of all common improvements, including but not limited to streets, roads, parks, sewage disposal and water supply systems, the donation of which was made a condition of the approval of the tentative plan for the subdivision or partition.

      (f) Explanations of all common improvements required as conditions of approval of the tentative plan of the subdivision or partition have been recorded and referenced on the subdivision or partition plat.

      (4) Subject to any standards and procedures adopted pursuant to ORS 92.044, no plat of a subdivision shall be approved by a city or county unless the city or county has received and accepted:

      (a) A certification by a city-owned domestic water supply system or by the owner of a privately owned domestic water supply system, subject to regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon, that water will be available to the lot line of each and every lot depicted in the proposed subdivision plat;

      (b) A bond, irrevocable letter of credit, contract or other assurance by the subdivider to the city or county that a domestic water supply system will be installed by or on behalf of the subdivider to the lot line of each and every lot depicted in the proposed subdivision plat; and the amount of any such bond, irrevocable letter of credit, contract or other assurance by the subdivider shall be determined by a registered professional engineer, subject to any change in such amount as determined necessary by the city or county; or

      (c) In lieu of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, a statement that no domestic water supply facility will be provided to the purchaser of any lot depicted in the proposed subdivision plat, even though a domestic water supply source may exist. A copy of any such statement, signed by the subdivider and indorsed by the city or county, shall be filed by the subdivider with the Real Estate Commissioner and shall be included by the commissioner in any public report made for the subdivision under ORS 92.385. If the making of a public report has been waived or the subdivision is otherwise exempt under the Oregon Subdivision Control Law, the subdivider shall deliver a copy of the statement to each prospective purchaser of a lot in the subdivision at or prior to the signing by the purchaser of the first written agreement for the sale of the lot. The subdivider shall take a signed receipt from the purchaser upon delivery of such a statement, shall immediately send a copy of the receipt to the commissioner and shall keep any such receipt on file in this state, subject to inspection by the commissioner, for a period of three years after the date the receipt is taken.

      (c) In lieu of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, a statement that no sewage disposal facility will be provided to the purchaser of any lot depicted in the proposed subdivision plat, where the Department of Environmental Quality has approved the proposed method or an alternative method of sewage disposal for the subdivision in its evaluation report described in ORS 454.755 (1)(b). A copy of any such statement, signed by the subdivider and indorsed by the city or county shall be filed by the subdivider with the Real Estate Commissioner and shall be included by the commissioner in the public report made for the subdivision under ORS 92.385. If the making of a public report has been waived or the subdivision is otherwise exempt under the Oregon Subdivision Control Law, the subdivider shall deliver a copy of the statement to each prospective purchaser of a lot in the subdivision at or prior to the signing by the purchaser of the first written agreement for the sale of the lot. The subdivider shall take a signed receipt from the purchaser upon delivery of such a statement, shall immediately send a copy of the receipt to the commissioner and shall keep any such receipt on file in this state, subject to inspection by the commissioner, for a period of three years after the date the receipt is taken.

      (6) Subject to any standards and procedures adopted pursuant to ORS 92.044, no plat of a subdivision or partition located within the boundaries of an irrigation district, drainage district, water control district, water improvement district or district improvement company shall be approved by a city or county unless the city or county has received and accepted a certification from the district or company that the subdivision or partition is either entirely excluded from the district or company or is included within the district or company for purposes of receiving services and subjecting the subdivision or partition to the fees and other charges of the district or company. [Amended by 1955 c.31 §1; 1955 c.756 §13; 1965 c.393 §1; 1973 c.696 §16; 1974 c.74 §3; 1983 c.309 §7; 1989 c.772 §13; 1991 c.331 §22; 1991 c.763 §15; 1995 c.164 §1; 2007 c.652 §3]

 

      92.095 Payment of taxes, interest or penalties before subdivision or partition plat recorded.

      (2) After July 1, and before the certification under ORS 311.105 of any year, the subdivider or partitioner shall:

      (a) If the exact amount of taxes, penalties, special assessments, fees and charges can be computed by the assessor, pay the amount to the tax collector. The assessor is authorized to levy and the tax collector is authorized to collect the amount.

      (A) Pay the amount estimated by the assessor to be needed to pay the taxes, penalties, special assessments, fees and other charges to become due; or

      (B) Deposit with the tax collector a bond or irrevocable letter of credit with a good and sufficient undertaking in an amount the assessor considers adequate to ensure payment of the taxes to become due. The bond or irrevocable letter of credit amount may not exceed twice the amount of the previous year’s taxes, special assessments, fees and other charges upon the land.

      (3) Taxes paid or for which security is given under subsection (2)(a) or (b) of this section are entitled to the discount provided by ORS 311.505.

      (4) ORS 311.370 applies to all taxes levied and collected under subsection (2) of this section, except that any deficiency constitutes a personal debt against the person subdividing or partitioning the land and not a lien against the land and must be collected as provided by law for the collection of personal property taxes.

      (5) If a subdivision or partition plat is recorded, any additional taxes, interest or penalties imposed upon land disqualified for any special assessment become a lien upon the land on the day before the plat was recorded.

      (2) When design or supervision of installation of improvements is performed by a registered engineer under subsection (1) of this section, the city, county or special district may elect to establish standards for such improvements, review and approve plans and specifications and inspect the installation of improvements. The city, county or special district may collect a fee for inspection and any other services provided in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of performing the inspection or other services provided.

      92.100 Approval of plat by city or county surveyor; procedures; approval by county assessor and county governing body; fees. (1)(a) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, before a subdivision or partition plat that covers land within the corporate limits of a city may be recorded, the county surveyor must approve the plat.

      (b) Notwithstanding ORS 92.170, the governing body of the city may, by resolution or order, designate the city surveyor to serve in lieu of the county surveyor or, with concurrence of the county surveyor, a contract surveyor to act as city surveyor.

      (c) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, if the land is outside the corporate limits of any city, the subdivision or partition plat must be approved by the county surveyor before it is recorded.

      (d) All subdivision plats must also be approved by the county assessor and the governing body of the county in which the property is located before recording.

      (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this subsection, a county may provide by ordinance for the approval of subdivision plats by:

      (A) The county assessor; and

      (B)(i) The chairperson of the governing body of the county;

      (ii) The vice chairperson of the governing body of the county; or

      (iii) A person designated in lieu of the chairperson or vice chairperson.

      (i) The partition plat includes a dedication of land for public road purposes; or

      (ii) Provided otherwise by ordinance of the governing body.

      (B) The city or county surveyor shall review the partition plat only for compliance with the survey-related provisions of ORS 92.010 to 92.192 and 209.250.

      (2) Before approving the subdivision plat as required by this section, the county surveyor shall check the subdivision site and the subdivision plat and shall take measurements and make computations and other determinations necessary to determine that the subdivision plat complies with the survey-related provisions of ORS 92.010 to 92.192 and 209.250 and with survey-related requirements established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution passed by the governing body of the controlling city or county.

      (3) Before approving the partition plat as required by this section, the county surveyor shall check the partition plat and make computations and other determinations that the partition plat complies with the survey-related provisions of ORS 92.010 to 92.192 and 209.250 and with the survey-related requirements established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution by the governing body of the controlling city or county.

      (4) Before a subdivision or partition plat prepared by the county surveyor in a private capacity may be recorded, the plat must be approved in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) of this section, whichever is applicable, by the surveyor of a county other than the county in which the land is located and who has been designated by the county surveyor.

      (5) For performing the service described:

      (a) In subsection (2) of this section, the county surveyor shall collect from the subdivider or declarant a fee of $100 plus $5 for each lot contained in the subdivision. The governing body of a city or county may establish a higher fee by resolution or order.

      (b) In subsection (3) of this section, the county surveyor shall collect from the partitioner or declarant a fee to be established by the governing body.

      (c) In subsection (4) of this section, the designated county surveyor shall collect the applicable subdivision or partition plat check fee, and any travel expenses incurred, as established by the designated county surveyor’s board of commissioners. The subdivision or partition plat check fee and other expenses must be paid by the subdivider, partitioner or declarant prior to approval of the subdivision or partition plat by the designated county surveyor.

      (6) Nothing in this section prohibits a city, county or special district from requiring engineering review and approval of a subdivision plat to ensure compliance with state and local subdivision requirements that relate to matters other than survey adequacy.

      (7) Granting approval or withholding approval of a final subdivision or partition plat under this section by the county surveyor, the county assessor or the governing body of a city or county, or a designee of the governing body, is not a land use decision or a limited land use decision, as defined in ORS 197.015.

      (b) A condition of approval of the previously approved land use decision requiring consolidation of adjacent lots or parcels was not complied with by a previous owner of the land.

      (2) An application under this section is not subject to ORS 215.780.

      (3) Approval of an application under this section does not affect the legal status of land that is not the subject of the application.

      (a) Decrease the size of a lawfully established unit of land that, before the relocation or elimination of the common property line, is smaller than the minimum lot or parcel size for the applicable zone and contains an existing dwelling or is approved for the construction of a dwelling, if another lawfully established unit of land affected by the property line adjustment would be increased to a size as large as or larger than the minimum lot or parcel size required to qualify the other affected lawfully established unit of land for a dwelling;

UNDEVELOPED SUBDIVISIONS

 

      92.205 Policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that many subdivisions for which plats have been approved and recorded have not been developed and that many such subdivisions were approved prior to the adoption of a comprehensive plan, zoning regulations and ordinances and modern subdivision control standards by the jurisdiction within which the lands described in the subdivision plats are situated.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds, therefore, that it is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the review of undeveloped subdivisions for the purpose of modifying such subdivisions, if necessary, to comply with the current comprehensive plan, zoning ordinances and regulations and modern subdivision control standards, or, if such modification is not feasible, of vacating the nonconforming, undeveloped subdivisions and to vacate any lands dedicated for public use that are described in the plat of each such vacated subdivision. [1973 c.569 §1]

 

      92.210 [1963 c.624 §3; 1965 c.584 §3; repealed by 1973 c.421 §52]

 

      92.215 Review authorized; manner. (1) Each agency or body authorized to approve subdivision plats under ORS 92.040 may:

      (b) Review each subdivision plat approved more than 10 years prior to October 5, 1973.

      (2) Each review conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed in ORS 92.225. [1973 c.569 §2]

 

      92.220 [1963 c.624 §§1,2,25; repealed by 1973 c.421 §52]

 

      92.225 Review of undeveloped or developed subdivision plat lands. (1) The agency or body required to conduct the review under ORS 92.215 shall investigate the status of the lands included within a subdivision to determine whether the subdivision is undeveloped.

      (2) For the purposes of this section, the lands described in the plat of any subdivision under review shall be considered to be developed if any of the following conditions are found by the agency or body conducting the review to exist on such lands:

      (a) Roadways providing access into and travel within the subdivision have been or are being constructed to meet the specifications prescribed therefor by the agency or body that approved the plat of the subdivision;

      (b) Facilities for the supply of domestic or industrial water to lots created by the subdivision have been or are being constructed;

      (c) Sanitary sewerage disposal facilities have been or are being constructed for lots created by the subdivision, or septic tanks have been or are being installed on the land or permits have been issued for their installation on the land;

      (d) Buildings have been or are being constructed upon the land or permits have been issued for the construction of buildings upon the land; and

      (e) One or more lots described in the plat of the subdivision have been sold or otherwise transferred prior to the date of the initiation of such review.

      (3) If the agency or body determines that a subdivision is undeveloped after its investigation of the subdivision under subsection (1) of this section, it shall also determine:

      (a) If the undeveloped subdivision complies with the comprehensive plan, zoning regulations and ordinances and subdivision ordinances and regulations then in effect with respect to lands in the subdivision; and

      (b) If the undeveloped subdivision does not comply with such plan and ordinances and regulations, whether the subdivision may be revised to comply with such plan and ordinances and regulations.

      (4) If the agency or body determines that a subdivision is undeveloped after its investigation of the subdivision under subsection (1) of this section, it shall hold a hearing to determine whether the undeveloped subdivision should be revised and the subdivision replatted or vacated and all lands within the subdivision that have been dedicated for public use vacated. Not later than 30 days before the date of a hearing held by an agency or body under this section, the agency or body shall notify, in writing, each owner of record of land described in the plat of the subdivision under review of the date, place, time and purpose of such hearing. [1973 c.569 §3]

      92.234 Revision, vacation of undeveloped subdivisions; vacation proceedings; effect of initiation by affected landowner. (1) Following a hearing conducted as required under ORS 92.225 (4), the agency or body conducting the hearing may:

      (a) Require the revision of a subdivision and a replat of the subdivision as it considers necessary, if it finds that the subdivision may be revised to comply with the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinances and regulations and other modern subdivision control standards not in existence when the subdivision was initially approved; or

      (b) Initiate proceedings, as provided in subsection (3) of this section, for vacation of the subdivision, if it finds that the subdivision cannot be revised in accordance with the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinances and regulations and other modern subdivision control standards not in existence when the subdivision was initially approved.

      (2) If an agency or body requires the revision and replat of a subdivision under subsection (1)(a) of this section, it shall approve the subdivision only upon the completion of the revisions as required by it and the replat of the subdivision as provided in ORS 92.180 to 92.190.

      (3) If the agency or body determines that it is necessary to vacate a subdivision, the agency or body shall adopt an ordinance vacating the subdivision and providing for the vacation of lands within the subdivision that have been dedicated for public use. Title to lands within a vacated subdivision shall vest as provided in ORS 271.140 and 368.366. Any owner of lands described in the plat of the vacated subdivision who is aggrieved by the action of the agency or body in vacating the subdivision may appeal such action in the manner provided in ORS 34.010 to 34.100. The ordinance adopted by the agency or body for the vacation of the subdivision and the lands therein dedicated to public use shall be filed with the county recording officer as provided in ORS 271.150.

      (4) Nothing in ORS 92.205 to 92.245 shall prevent the owner of any lands within an undeveloped subdivision from seeking vacation of such subdivision under city or county vacation procedures and, if such vacation proceedings are commenced after the date of the notice of review of the subdivision by the agency or body, the review proceeding shall be suspended during such vacation proceedings. If the subdivision is vacated at the initiation of an owner, the review proceedings under ORS 92.205 to 92.245 shall be discontinued; but, if the subdivision is not vacated at the request of an owner, the review proceedings under ORS 92.205 to 92.245 shall be resumed at the termination of the proceedings brought by an owner of lands in the subdivision.

      92.313 Policy; construction; citation. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that the development of new subdivisions and series partitions and the promotion of sales and leases of such property are now largely uncontrolled and unregulated in this state and that a need exists to protect the public from fraud, deceit and misrepresentation.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 92.305 to 92.495 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the existing provisions of ORS 92.010 to 92.192.

      (3) ORS 92.305 to 92.495 may be cited as the Oregon Subdivision and Series Partition Control Law. [1974 c.1 §2; 1975 c.643 §1a; 1983 c.570 §9]

 

      92.315 [1969 c.508 §4; repealed by 1973 c.421 §52]

 

      92.317 Policy; protection of consumers.

It is therefore declared to be the policy of the State of Oregon that the Attorney General protect the rights of such real estate purchasers to the greatest extent practicable through the application of the provisions of ORS 336.184 and 646.605 to 646.652. [1974 c.1 §29; 2005 c.22 §72]

 

      92.320 [1963 c.624 §14; repealed by 1973 c.421 §52]

      (g) Timeshares regulated or otherwise exempt under ORS 94.803 and 94.807 to 94.945;

      (h) Subdivided and series partitioned lands in a city or county which, at the time tentative approval of a subdivision plat and each partition map for those lands is given under ORS 92.040 or an ordinance adopted under ORS 92.046, has a comprehensive plan and implementing ordinances that have been acknowledged under ORS 197.251. The subdivider or series partitioner of such lands shall comply with ORS 92.425, 92.427, 92.430, 92.433, 92.460 and 92.485 in the sale or leasing of such lands; or

Note: Legislative Counsel has substituted “chapter 643, Oregon Laws 1975,” for the words “this 1975 Act” in section 19, chapter 643, Oregon Laws 1975, which amended 92.325. Specific ORS references have not been substituted, pursuant to 173.160. These sections may be determined by referring to the 1975 Comparative Section Table located in Volume 22 of ORS.

[1974 c.1 §12; 1975 c.643 §9; 1977 c.809 §10; 1979 c.242 §7; 1983 c.530 §54; 1983 c.570 §19]

 

      92.427 Cancellation of agreement to buy interest in subdivision or series partition; procedure; effect; waiver; exemptions. (1) A purchaser of a lot, parcel or interest in a subdivision or series partition may cancel, for any reason, any contract, agreement or any evidence of indebtedness associated with the sale of the lot, parcel or interest in the subdivision or series partition within three business days from the date of signing by the purchaser of the first written offer or contract to purchase.

      (2) Cancellation, under subsection (1) of this section, occurs when the purchaser of a lot, parcel or interest gives written notice to the seller at the seller’s address. The three business days cancellation period in subsection (1) of this section does not begin until the seller provides the purchaser with seller’s address for cancellation purposes.

      (3) A notice of cancellation given by a purchaser of a lot, parcel or interest in a subdivision or series partition need not take a particular form and is sufficient if it indicates by any form of written expression the intention of the purchaser not to be bound by the contract or evidence of indebtedness.

      (4) Notice of cancellation, if given by mail, shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, and is effective on the date that such notice is deposited with the United States Postal Service, properly addressed and postage prepaid.

      (5) Upon receipt of a timely notice of cancellation, the seller shall immediately return to the purchaser all payments received from the purchaser. In case of payments made by check, the seller is not required to return the payment to a purchaser until the check is finally paid as provided in ORS 74.2130. Upon return of all such payments the purchaser shall immediately transfer the purchaser’s rights in the lot, parcel or interest to the seller, not subject to any encumbrance created or suffered by the purchaser. In the case of cancellation by a purchaser of any evidence of indebtedness, the purchaser shall return the purchaser’s copy of the executed evidence of indebtedness to the seller, and the seller shall cancel the evidence of indebtedness. Any encumbrances against the purchaser’s interest in the lot, parcel or interest arising by operation of law from an obligation of the purchaser existing prior to transfer of the lot, parcel or interest to the purchaser shall be extinguished by the reconveyance.

      (6) An act of a purchaser is not effective to waive the right of cancellation granted by subsection (1) of this section. A subdivider, series partitioner or developer may require that a purchaser of a lot, parcel or interest in a subdivision or series partition execute and deliver to the subdivider, series partitioner or developer, after the expiration of the three-day cancellation period, a signed statement disclaiming any notice of cancellation that may have been made by the purchaser prior to expiration of the three-day cancellation period for the offer under subsection (1) of this section, that may have been timely and properly done under this section and that has not been received by the subdivider, series partitioner or developer. In case of execution of any such statement by the purchaser, the statement shall be sufficient to rescind the notice of cancellation.

      (7) This section does not apply to:

      (a) The sale of a lot in a subdivision or a parcel in a series partition that has a residential dwelling upon it at the time of sale;

      (b) The sale of a lot in a subdivision or a parcel in a series partition when, at the time of sale, the seller has contracted with the purchaser to build a residential dwelling upon the lot or parcel; or

      (c) The sale of a lot in a subdivision or a parcel in a series partition to a person who derives a substantial portion of income from the development or purchase and sale of real property.

      (8) Notwithstanding subsection (7) of this section, this section applies to a planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings created under ORS 92.830 to 92.845. [1975 c.643 §16; 1983 c.570 §20; 2001 c.711 §6; 2003 c.474 §4]

      (4) Issue, circulate or publish any prospectus, circular, advertisement, printed matter, document, pamphlet, leaflet or other literature which contains an untrue statement of a material fact or fails to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;

      (5) Issue, circulate or publish any advertising matter or make any written representation, unless the name of the person issuing, circulating or publishing the matter or making the representation is clearly indicated; or

      (6) Make any statement or representation, or issue, circulate or publish any advertising matter containing any statement to the effect that the real estate subdivision or series partition has been in any way approved or indorsed by the Real Estate Commissioner.

      92.475 False or misleading advertising prohibited; liability. It shall be unlawful for any owner, subdivider, developer, series partitioner, agent or employee of such persons or other person, who with intent, directly or indirectly, to sell or lease subdivided or series partitioned lands or lots, parcels or interests therein, to authorize, use, direct or aid in the publication, distribution or circularization of any advertisement, radio broadcast or telecast concerning subdivided or series partitioned lands, which contains any statement, pictorial representation or sketch which is false or misleading. Nothing in this section shall be construed to hold the publisher or employee of any newspaper, any job printer, broadcaster or telecaster liable for any publication referred to in ORS 92.305 to 92.495 unless the publisher, employee, printer, broadcaster or telecaster has actual knowledge of the falsity thereof or has an interest in the subdivided or series partitioned lands advertised or the sale thereof. [1974 c.1 §17; 1975 c.643 §12; 1983 c.570 §26]

 

      92.485 Waiver of legal rights void. Any condition, stipulation or provision in any sales contract or lease, or in any other legal document, binding any purchaser or lessee to waive any legal rights under ORS 92.305 to 92.495 against the subdivider, series partitioner or developer shall be deemed to be contrary to public policy and void. [1974 c.1 §18; 1975 c.643 §13; 1983 c.570 §27]

SUBDIVISION IN MANUFACTURED DWELLING PARK OR MOBILE HOME PARK

 

      92.830 Definitions for ORS 92.830 to 92.845. As used in ORS 92.830 to 92.845, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Declarant” means a person who makes a declaration pursuant to ORS 92.845.

      (2) “Lot” has the meaning given that term in ORS 92.010.

      (3) “Manufactured dwelling” has the meaning given that term in ORS 90.100.

      (4) “Manufactured dwelling park” and “mobile home park” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 446.003.

      (5) “Person” has the meaning given that term in ORS 92.305.

      (6) “Tenant” means a person who owns and occupies as a residence a manufactured dwelling or mobile home on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park. [2001 c.711 §1; 2003 c.474 §5; 2011 c.503 §12]

 

      Note: 92.830 to 92.845 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 92 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      92.832 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (1) There is a need to create a mechanism for owners of manufactured dwellings in existing manufactured dwelling parks and mobile home parks to acquire individual ownership interest in the lot on which the dwelling is located;

      (2) The creation of an individual ownership interest should not impose an undue financial burden on the owner of a park;

      (3) The public interest is furthered by regulating the promotion, subdivision and sale of individual ownership interests in the lots in a park to owners of manufactured dwellings to ensure that local jurisdictions do not place unreasonable constraints on the conversion of existing parks into planned community subdivisions of manufactured dwellings; and

      (4) The orderly conversion of manufactured dwelling parks and mobile home parks to subdivisions has effects on infrastructure and access that make it appropriate to require assurances that public health and safety standards are met by persons buying or selling lots converted from a park. [2001 c.711 §2; 2003 c.474 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 92.830.

 

      92.835 Subdivision of manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park; waiver of right of remonstrance to formation of local improvement district. Notwithstanding the standards and procedures established under ordinances and regulations adopted by the governing body of a city or a county under ORS 92.044 or 92.048, when application for approval of the subdivision of a manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park that was lawfully approved before July 2, 2001, is made under ORS 92.040 to the governing body of a city or county, the governing body of the city or county shall approve:

      (1) A tentative plan upon receipt and verification of evidence that:

      (a) The park is in compliance with the governing body’s standards for a manufactured dwelling park or a mobile home park or is an approved nonconforming use. For the purposes of this paragraph, a park is in compliance if the governing body of the city or county has not issued a written notice of noncompliance on or before July 2, 2001;

      (b) Except as provided in this paragraph, the tentative plan does not make changes from the approved manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park development, including but not limited to increasing or decreasing the number of lots as defined in ORS 446.003 or changing the external boundary lines or setback requirements. The tentative plan may provide for a reduction in the number of lots, if the reduction involves only lots that have never been used for placement of manufactured dwellings;

      (c) The tentative plan restricts the use of lots in the subdivision to the installation of manufactured dwellings and restricts any other property in the subdivision to use as common property as defined in ORS 94.550 or for public purposes;

      (d) The tentative plan does not contain conditions of approval or require development agreements except the original conditions of approval and development agreements contained in the original approval for the park or conditions required by ORS 92.830 to 92.845; and

      (e) The property owners applying for the conversion have signed and recorded a waiver of the right of remonstrance, in a form approved by the city or county, for the formation of a local improvement district by a city or county. A waiver described in this paragraph must be in regard only to sanitary and storm sewers or water facilities and be operative only if the city or county determines after a hearing that the absence or inadequacy of those sewers or facilities is an immediate danger to life, health or safety. However, a waiver of the right of remonstrance may not be required of the owner of a lot in a manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park if the park was served for water, sewer and irrigation by a private utility company prior to an acquisition of that company by municipal condemnation commenced prior to January 1, 2003.

      (2) A plat in compliance with the applicable requirements of ORS 92.010 to 92.192, except standards and procedures adopted by regulation or ordinance under ORS 92.044 or 92.048. The plat may not contain conditions of approval or require development agreements except the original conditions of approval and development agreements contained in the original plat for the park or conditions required by ORS 92.830 to 92.845. [2001 c.711 §3; 2003 c.474 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 92.830.

 

      92.837 Application of city or county comprehensive plans and land use regulations; placement of new or replacement manufactured dwelling. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, city or county comprehensive plans and land use regulations that applied at the time the manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park was approved continue to apply to park land that is converted to a subdivision pursuant to ORS 92.830 to 92.845 until the earlier of:

      (a) The sale of all of the newly created lots in accordance with ORS 92.840 and the issuance of permits to allow the placement of a manufactured dwelling on each of those lots; or

      (b) Ten years after conversion of the manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park to a subdivision.

      (2) An original or replacement manufactured dwelling may be placed on a park space that has been converted to a subdivision lot under ORS 92.835 if:

      (a) The manufactured dwelling is constructed and installed in accordance with state and federal standards; and

      (b) The owner of the lot has signed and recorded a waiver of the right of remonstrance, in a form approved by the city or county, for the formation of a local improvement district by a city or county. A local improvement district described in this paragraph must be for the construction of a capital improvement described in ORS 223.299 (1)(a)(A) to (C).

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)(b) of this section, a waiver of the right of remonstrance may not be required of the owner of a lot in a manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park if the park was served for water, sewer and irrigation by a private utility company prior to an acquisition of that company by municipal condemnation commenced prior to January 1, 2003. [2003 c.474 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 92.830.

 

      92.839 Notice to tenants of conversion and tenants’ rights during conversion. (1) When a declarant submits an application for approval of the conversion of a manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park to a planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings pursuant to ORS 92.830 to 92.845, the declarant shall give each tenant:

      (a) A copy of any notice given by the local government to neighboring property owners regarding the application.

      (b) A written statement generally explaining the subdivision conversion and describing any public process or hearings to be conducted concerning the application.

      (c) A general explanation of the tenant’s rights during the conversion, including the right under ORS 92.840 to purchase the lot created during the conversion of the park to a planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings.

      (2) The declarant shall give the items described in subsection (1) of this section to the tenant in the manner provided in ORS 90.155 within five days after the local government gives its notice to the neighbors or, if the local government does not give a notice, within 10 days after the declarant submits the application.

      (3) A declarant is liable to an affected tenant for failure to give the items described in subsection (1) of this section in the amount of $200 or actual damages, whichever is more. However, failure to give the items described in subsection (1) of this section to a tenant does not affect the validity of the conversion. [2011 c.503 §15]

 

      Note: See note under 92.830.

 

      92.840 Sale of subdivision lots; offer to sell lot to tenant; improvement or rehabilitation of park proposed for subdivision; continuation of tenancy on lot in subdivision. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 92.016 (1), prior to the approval of a tentative plan, the declarant may negotiate to sell a lot for which approval is required under ORS 92.830 to 92.845.

      (2) Prior to the sale of a lot, the declarant shall offer to sell the lot to the tenant who occupies the lot. The offer required under this subsection:

      (a) Terminates 60 days after receipt of the offer by the tenant or upon written rejection of the offer, whichever occurs first; and

      (b) Does not constitute a notice of termination of the tenancy.

      (3) For 60 days after termination of the offer required under subsection (2) of this section, the declarant may not sell the lot to a person other than the tenant at a price or on terms that are more favorable to the purchaser than the price or terms that were offered to the tenant.

      (4) After the manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park has been submitted for subdivision under ORS 92.830 to 92.845 and until a lot is offered for sale in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, the declarant shall notify a prospective tenant, in writing, prior to the commencement of the tenancy, that the park has been submitted for subdivision and that the tenant is entitled to receive an offer to purchase the lot under subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) Prior to the sale of a lot in a subdivision created by conversion of the park, the declarant must provide the tenant or other potential purchaser of the lot with information about the homeowners association formed by the declarant as required by ORS 94.625. The information must, at a minimum, include the association name and type and any rights set forth in the declaration required by ORS 94.580.

      (6) The declarant may not begin improvements or rehabilitation to the lot during the period described in the landlord’s notice of termination under ORS 90.645 without the permission of the tenant.

      (7) The declarant may begin improvements or rehabilitation to the common property as defined in the declaration during the period described in the landlord’s notice of termination under ORS 90.645.

      (8) If the tenant does not buy the lot occupied by the tenant’s manufactured dwelling or mobile home, the declarant and the tenant may continue the tenancy on the lot after approval of the tentative plan. The rights and responsibilities of tenants who continue their tenancy on the lot in the planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings are set out in ORS 90.643.

      (9) After approval of the tentative plan and the period provided by subsection (2)(a) of this section, the declarant shall promptly:

      (a) Notify the Housing and Community Services Department of the approval.

      (b) Provide the department with a street address for each lot in the planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings that remains available for rental use.

      (10) Nothing in this section prevents the declarant from terminating a tenancy in the park in compliance with ORS 90.630, 90.632 and 90.645. However, the declarant shall make the offer required under subsection (2) of this section to a tenant whose tenancy is terminated after approval of the tentative plan unless the termination is for cause under ORS 90.392, 90.394, 90.396, 90.630 (1) or (10) or 90.632. [2001 c.711 §4; 2003 c.474 §8; 2005 c.391 §27; 2007 c.906 §8; 2011 c.503 §13; 2019 c.625 §64]

 

      Note: See note under 92.830.

 

      92.843 Approval of declaration or amendment to declaration made pursuant to ORS 92.845. (1) A declaration made pursuant to ORS 92.845, or an amendment to the declaration, may not be recorded unless first approved by the tax collector for the county where the property is located and the Real Estate Commissioner.

      (2) A tax collector shall approve a declaration or amendment submitted under this section if:

      (a) All ad valorem taxes, special assessments, fees and other charges required by law to be placed on the tax roll that are or will become a lien on the property during the tax year have been paid as required by ORS 92.095; and

      (b) Any additional taxes or penalties, and interest on taxes or penalties, resulting from a disqualification of the property from special assessment have been paid.

      (3) The commissioner shall approve a declaration or amendment submitted under this section if:

      (a) The declaration or amendment complies with ORS 92.835, 92.845 and 94.580; and

      (b) The plat executed by the declarant is in conformance with ORS 92.835 (2).

      (4) The commissioner’s approval of a declaration or amendment under this section expires after two years if the declaration or amendment has not been recorded. The commissioner shall specify the expiration date when approving the declaration or amendment. A declaration or amendment may not be reapproved after an approval expires unless the declaration or amendment is resubmitted and new determinations are made under subsections (2) and (3) of this section. [2003 c.474 §3]

      (a) Is subject to ORS 94.550 to 94.783;

      (b) Is not subject to system development charges or other similar charges that are based on approval of the subdivision; and

      (c) Remains subject to system development charges that are based on the prior approval of the manufactured dwelling park or mobile home park.

      (2) The declarant of a planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings under ORS 92.830 to 92.845 shall:

      (a) Comply with the provisions of ORS 92.305 to 92.495, except ORS 92.337 and 92.395; and

      (b) Include in the declaration described in ORS 94.580 a statement that the subdivision will comply with the conditions required by ORS 92.835 and subsections (1)(b) and (c) of this section. [2001 c.711 §5; 2003 c.474 §9]
