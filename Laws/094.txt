      (a) Allowing the use of a transferable development credit that complies with an adopted transferable development credit system and the acknowledged comprehensive plan; or

      (b) Maintaining the registry required under subsection (4) of this section. [1999 c.573 §1]

 

      Note: 94.531 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 94 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      94.534 Policy on transferable development credit systems. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Working farms and forests make vital contributions to Oregon by:

      (A) Providing jobs, timber, agricultural products, tax base and other social and economic benefits;

      (B) Helping to maintain soil, air and water resources;

      (C) Reducing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; and

      (D) Providing habitat for wildlife and aquatic life.

      (b) Natural resources, scenic and historic areas and open spaces promote a sustainable and healthy environment and natural landscape that contributes to the livability of Oregon.

      (c) Population growth, escalating land values, increasing risks due to wildfire and invasive species and changes in land ownership and management objectives, with a resulting increase in conflict caused between resource uses and dispersed residential development, require that new methods be developed to facilitate the continued management of private lands zoned for farm use, forest use and mixed farm and forest use for the purposes of:

      (A) Agricultural production and timber harvest; and

      (B) Preservation of natural resources, scenic and historic areas and open spaces for future generations.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that transferable development credit systems:

      (a) Complement the statewide land use planning system in Oregon and encourage effective local implementation of the statewide land use planning goals.

      (b) Provide incentives for private landowners, local, regional, state and federal governments and other entities to permanently protect farm land and forestland, including a land base for working farms, ranches, forests and woodlots, significant natural resources, scenic and historic areas and open spaces.

      (c) Benefit rural land owners, including owners of working farms, ranches, forests and woodlots, that voluntarily provide stewardship of natural resources on private lands.

      (d) Provide voluntary and effective methods to help improve the livability of urban areas and to mitigate and adapt to global climate change. [2009 c.504 §1]

 

      Note: 94.534, 94.536 and 94.538 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 94 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      94.538 Transferable development credit systems. (1) One or more governmental units may establish a transferable development credit system, including a process for allowing transfer of development interests from a sending area within the jurisdiction of one governmental unit to a receiving area within the jurisdiction of another governmental unit.

      (2) If the transferable development credit system allows transfer of development interests between the jurisdictions of different governmental units, the process must be described in an intergovernmental agreement under ORS 190.003 to 190.130 entered into by the governmental units with land use jurisdiction over the sending and receiving areas and, for purposes of administration of the process, the Department of Land Conservation and Development. The intergovernmental agreement may contain provisions for sharing between governmental units of the prospective ad valorem tax revenues derived from new development in the receiving area authorized under the system.

      (3) A transferable development credit system must provide for:

      (a) The record owner of a lot, parcel or tract in a sending area to voluntarily sever and sell development interests of the lot, parcel or tract for use in a receiving area;

      (b) A potential developer of land in a receiving area to purchase transferable development credits that allow a higher intensity use or development of the land, including development bonuses or other incentives not otherwise allowed, through changes to the planning and zoning or waivers of density, height or bulk limitations in the receiving area;

      (c) Benefits to developers by allowing increased development and development incentives in receiving areas.

      (5) The governmental units administering a transferable development credit system must:

      (a) Designate sending areas that are chosen to achieve the requirements set forth in this section and the objectives set forth in ORS 94.534.

      (b) Designate receiving areas that are chosen to achieve the requirements set forth in this section and the objectives set forth in ORS 94.534.

      (c) Provide development bonuses and incentives to stimulate the demand for the purchase and sale of transferable development credits.

      (d) Require that the record owner of development interests transferred as development credits from a sending area to a receiving area cause to be recorded, in the deed records of the county in which the sending area is located, a conservation easement that:

      (A) Limits development of the lot, parcel or tract from which the interests are severed consistent with the transfer; and

      94.560 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) In the State of Oregon there are hundreds of homeowners associations to which the Oregon Condominium Law (ORS chapter 100) does not apply.

      (2) These homeowners associations have established a pattern of ownership in which ownership of a single unit makes the owner automatically a member of a homeowners association with responsibilities for management and maintenance.

      (3) Many of these homeowners associations as associations and their members as individuals have experienced problems from the lack of statutory provisions. These problems which have arisen are usually the result of inexperience with this kind of ownership. This inexperience often leads to difficulties for the association when it assumes responsibility for the administration of the planned development because usually neither the developer who drafted the documents nor the local jurisdiction which may have reviewed them has realized the long term management implications of the restrictions imposed by the documents. The most serious and frequent error is imposing excessive voting requirements for any changes in the documents, a basic error that makes it and other errors unnecessarily difficult, if not impossible, to correct. Of almost equal importance is the lack of disclosure of significant differences this pattern of ownership imposes on the homeowner and the restrictions on choice that must be accepted.

      (4) Oregon land conservation policies and the increasing cost of land will result in rapid growth of this kind of homeownership pattern.

      (5) It is a matter of statewide concern that the Legislative Assembly address problems associated with homeowners associations in order to make this kind of homeownership pattern an acceptable choice and in order to assure proper maintenance of the projects so that the investment of the owners and the appearance of Oregon communities are protected.

      (6) It is essential that the Legislative Assembly establish basic statutory requirements for disclosure to first and subsequent buyers, for the organization of the homeowners association, and for a process by which administrative responsibility for the planned community is transferred from the developer to the association of individual owners.

      (7) ORS 94.550 to 94.783 are intended to make developers, their legal counsel and homeowners in Oregon homeowners associations the beneficiaries of experience accumulated under Oregon’s condominium law and gathered from members of existing Oregon homeowners associations and associations in parts of the country where the record of experience is longer than that in Oregon. [1981 c.782 §3a]

      (b) If a transferor retains any special declarant right, or if a successor declarant is an affiliate of the transferor, the transferor is subject to liability for all obligations and liabilities imposed on a declarant by the provisions of ORS 94.550 to 94.783 or by the declaration or bylaws arising after the transfer and is jointly and severally liable with the successor declarant for the liabilities and obligations of the successor declarant that relate to the special declarant rights.

      (c) A transferor who does not retain special declarant rights does not have an obligation or liability for an act or omission or for a breach of a contractual obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.

      (b) A successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor is not liable for any misrepresentations or warranties made or required to be made by the declarant or previous successor declarant or for any breach of fiduciary obligation by such person. Such a successor declarant, however, shall comply with any provisions of the declaration and bylaws that pertain to such successor declarant’s ownership of the lot or lots and the exercise of any special declarant right. [1999 c.677 §34; 2011 c.532 §1]

 

      94.623 Acquisition of special declarant rights by successor declarant; exceptions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a developer, vendor under a land sale contract, mortgagee of a mortgage or beneficiary of a trust deed affecting the declarant’s interest in the property shall acquire all special declarant rights of the transferor upon transfer by the declarant or prior successor declarant of all of such transferor’s interest in a planned community, unless:

      (a) The conveyance evidences an intent not to transfer any special declarant rights;

      (b) An instrument executed by the transferor and the transferee evidences an intent not to transfer any special declarant rights and is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located; or

      (c) The transferee executes an instrument disclaiming any right to exercise any special declarant rights and such instrument is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located.

      (2) A transferee under subsection (1) of this section shall acquire less than all special declarant rights if:

      (a) The conveyance from the transferor or an instrument executed by the transferor and the transferee evidences an intent to transfer less than all special declarant rights and states the specific rights being transferred, and such instrument is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located; or

      (b) The transferee executes an instrument disclaiming specific special declarant rights and the instrument is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located.

      (3) When a transferee acquires all of the declarant’s interest in the planned community in which the declarant has reserved the right to expand the planned community under ORS 94.580, the transferee shall not acquire the right to annex property unless the transferee simultaneously acquires from the declarant property adjacent to the planned community, or unless the conveyance evidences an intent to transfer such right to the transferee.

      (4) A declarant or a successor declarant may transfer all or less than all of the transferor’s special declarant rights to a transferee, whether or not any interest in real property is conveyed, by an instrument executed by the declarant or successor declarant and the transferee evidencing an intent to transfer all or specific special declarant rights, which instrument shall be recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located. If the transfer is not subject to subsection (1) of this section, it shall also bear the written consent of any holder of a blanket encumbrance on the planned community.

      (5) An instrument disclaiming or transferring special declarant rights shall be properly acknowledged as provided by law.

      (6)(a) Upon transfer of any special declarant right under this section, any interest held by the transferor in the special declarant right is extinguished and the transferor has no right of recovery.

      (b) A transferor may only recover a transferred special declarant right through execution by both the transferor and the successor declarant of a subsequent conveyance or other instrument that evidences an intent to convey the special declarant right from the successor declarant to the transferor.

      (A) An owner or the owners affected by a loss; or

      (B) All owners;

      (4) Not later than 10 days after adoption of a resolution under subsection (1) or (3) of this section, the board of directors shall ensure that a copy of the resolution and a notice described in subsection (5) of this section are:

      (5) The notice required under subsection (4) of this section shall:

      (b) Be in a form and style reasonably calculated to inform the owner of the importance of the notice.

      (6) Failure to provide a copy of a resolution or a notice required under this section does not affect the responsibility of an owner to comply with a resolution adopted under this section. [2007 c.409 §3]

 

      94.677 Election to have ORS 94.645, 94.655 and 94.675 apply. Unless contrary to the covenants, conditions or restrictions of a recorded declaration or other similar instrument, or the bylaws of the association adopted in accordance with documents governing the association, the homeowners association board of directors of a subdivision described in ORS 94.673 (1) may elect to be governed by ORS 94.645, 94.655 and 94.675, without further action by the association. [1983 c.206 §7]

 

      94.680 Blanket all-risk insurance.

Cost of the coverage shall be a common expense to the association.

[1981 c.782 §56; 1999 c.677 §24]

 

      94.695 Authority to delegate association powers to master association.

[1981 c.782 §69; 2009 c.641 §14]

 

(Assessments and Liens Against Lots; Easements)

 

      94.704 Assessment and payment of common expenses. (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the declarant of a planned community shall pay all common expenses of the planned community until the individual lots subject to assessment are assessed for common expenses as specified in the declaration pursuant to ORS 94.580 (2).

      (2) If the declaration expressly authorizes deferment, the declarant may defer payment of accrued assessments for reserves required under ORS 94.595 for a lot subject to assessment until the date the lot is conveyed. However, the declarant may not defer payment of accrued assessments for reserves:

      (a) Beyond the date of the turnover meeting provided for in the bylaws in accordance with ORS 94.635 (3); or

      (b) If a turnover meeting is not held, the date the owners assume administrative control of the association.

      (3) Failure of the declarant to deposit the balance due within 30 days after the due date constitutes a violation of ORS 94.777.

      (4) The books and records of the association shall reflect the amount the declarant owes for all reserve account assessments.

      (5)(a) Except for assessments under subsections (6), (7) and (8) of this section, the board of directors shall assess all common expenses against all the lots that are subject to assessment according to the allocations stated in the declaration.

      (b) Any assessment or any installment of the assessment past due shall bear interest at the rate established by resolution of the board of directors.

      (c) Nothing in this section prohibits the board from making compromises on overdue assessments if the compromise benefits the association.

      (6) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration or bylaws, any common expense or any part of a common expense benefiting fewer than all of the lots may be assessed exclusively against the lots or units benefited.

      (7) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration or bylaws, assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against the lots in proportion to their common expense liabilities.

      (8) If the board of directors determines that any loss or cost incurred by the homeowners association is the fault of one or more owners, the homeowners association may assess the loss or cost exclusively against the lots of the responsible owners.

      (9) If the homeowners association reallocates common expense liabilities, any common expense assessment and any installment of the assessment not yet due shall be recalculated according to the reallocated common expense liabilities.

      (10)(a) A lot owner may not claim exemption from liability for contribution toward the common expenses by waiving the use or enjoyment of any of the common property or by abandoning the owner’s lot.

      (b) An owner may not claim to offset an assessment for failure of the association to perform the association’s obligations.

      (11)(a) During any period of declarant control, any special assessment for capital improvements or additions must be approved by not less than 50 percent of the voting rights, or such greater percentage as may be specified in the declaration, without regard to any weighted right or special voting right in favor of the declarant.

      (b) Nothing in this subsection is intended to prohibit a declarant from reserving a special declarant right to approve any such assessment. [1981 c.782 §43; 1999 c.677 §25; 2001 c.756 §21; 2003 c.569 §16; 2009 c.641 §15]

 

      94.705 [Repealed by 1971 c.478 §1]

 

      94.709 Liens against lots; priority; duration; record notice of claim of unpaid assessment; foreclosure procedure. (1) Whenever a homeowners association levies any assessment against a lot, the association shall have a lien upon the individual lot for any unpaid assessments. The lien includes interest, late charges, attorney fees, costs or other amounts imposed under the declaration or bylaws or other recorded governing document. The lien is prior to a homestead exemption and all other liens or encumbrances upon the lot except:

      (a) Tax and assessment liens; and

      (b) A first mortgage or trust deed of record.

      (2) Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien for assessments. No further recording of a claim of lien for assessments or notice of a claim of lien under this section is required to perfect the association’s lien. The association shall record a notice of claim of lien for assessments under this section in the deed records of the county in which a lot is located before any suit to foreclose may proceed under subsection (4) of this section. The notice shall contain:

      (a) A true statement of the amount due for the unpaid assessments after deducting all just credits and offsets;

      (b) The name of the owner of the lot, or reputed owner, if known;

      (c) The name of the association;

      (d) The description of the lot as provided in ORS 93.600; and

      (e) A statement that if the owner of the lot thereafter fails to pay any assessments when due, as long as the original or any subsequent unpaid assessment remains unpaid, the unpaid amount of assessments automatically continue to accumulate with interest without the necessity of further recording.

      (3) The notice shall be verified by the oath of some person having knowledge of the facts and shall be recorded by the county recording officer. The record shall be indexed as other liens are required by law to be indexed.

      (4)(a) The proceedings to foreclose liens created by this section shall conform as nearly as possible to the proceedings to foreclose liens created by ORS 87.010 except, notwithstanding ORS 87.055, a lien may be continued in force for a period of time not to exceed six years from the date the assessment is due. For the purpose of determining the date the assessment is due in those cases when subsequent unpaid assessments have accumulated under a notice recorded as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the assessment and claim regarding each unpaid assessment shall be deemed to have been levied at the time the unpaid assessment became due.

      (b) The lien may be enforced by the board of directors acting on behalf of the association.

      (5) Unless the declaration or bylaws provide otherwise, fees, late charges, fines and interest imposed pursuant to ORS 94.630 (1)(L), (n) and (o) are enforceable as assessments under this section.

      (6) This section does not prohibit an association from pursuing an action to recover sums for which subsection (1) of this section creates a lien or from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of the lien.

      (7) An action to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments may be maintained without foreclosing or waiving the lien for unpaid assessments. A judgment entered on the action does not extinguish the lien. Payment of the judgment operates to satisfy the lien, or a portion of the lien, to the extent of the payment received. [1981 c.782 §44; 1999 c.677 §26; 2003 c.569 §17; 2017 c.110 §1]

 

      94.710 [Repealed by 1971 c.478 §1]

 

      94.712 Lot owner personally liable for assessment; joint liability of grantor and grantee following conveyance; limitations. (1) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an owner is personally liable for all assessments imposed on the owner or assessed against the owner’s lot by the homeowners association.

      (2)(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, in a voluntary conveyance of a lot, the grantee shall be jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor of the lot to the time of the grant or conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee’s right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee therefor.

      (b) Upon request of an owner or owner’s agent, for the benefit of a prospective purchaser, the board of directors shall make and deliver a written statement of the unpaid assessments against the prospective grantor or the lot effective through a date specified in the statement, and the grantee in that case shall not be liable for any unpaid assessments against the grantor not included in the written statement.

      (3) An escrow agent or a title insurance company providing escrow services or issuing title insurance in conjunction with the conveyance:

      (a) May rely on a written statement of unpaid assessments delivered pursuant to subsection (2) of this section; and

      (b) Is not liable for a failure to pay the association at closing any amount in excess of the amount set forth in the written statement.

      (4) During the redemption period that follows an execution sale conducted under ORS 18.860 to 18.993, a certificate holder, as defined in ORS 18.960, is solely liable for all assessments that come due during the redemption period.

      94.716 Lien against two or more lots; release. If a lien against two or more lots of the planned community becomes due, whether the lien is perfected before or after establishment of the planned community, the owner of an affected lot may pay the lienholder the portion of the lien attributable to the lot. Upon receipt of payment, the lienholder promptly shall deliver to the owner a release of the lien as to that lot. The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio which that owner’s common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all owners whose lots are subject to the lien. After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that owner’s lot for any portion of the common expense liability representing the lien. This section applies to all liens except a mortgage. [1981 c.782 §45]

 

      94.719 Lien foreclosure; other legal action by declarant, association or owner; attorney fees. In any suit or action brought by a homeowners association to foreclose its lien or to collect delinquent assessments or in any suit or action brought by the declarant, the association or any owner or class of owners to enforce compliance with the terms and provisions of ORS 94.550 to 94.783 or the declaration or bylaws, including all amendments and supplements thereto or any rules or regulations adopted by the association, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees therein and in any appeal therefrom.

      94.723 Common expenses; liability of first mortgagee. If a first mortgagee acquires a lot in a planned community by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, the mortgagee and subsequent purchaser shall not be liable for any of the common expenses chargeable to the lot which became due before the mortgagee or purchaser acquired title to the lot. The unpaid expenses shall become a common expense of all lot owners including the mortgagee or purchaser. [1981 c.782 §46; 1999 c.677 §27]

 

      94.725 [Repealed by 1971 c.478 §1]

 

      94.728 Taxation of lots and common property. (1) Each lot in a planned community constitutes for all purposes a separate parcel of real estate and shall be separately taxed and assessed.

      (2) No separate tax or assessment may be levied against any common property which a declarant has reserved no right to develop into additional lots.

      (3) The declarant alone is liable for payment of taxes or assessments on any portion of the common property of a planned community in which the declarant has reserved the right to develop the property into additional lots, until the right terminates or expires, or is exercised, abandoned or relinquished.

      (4) If the right described under subsection (3) of this section terminates or expires or is abandoned or relinquished before July 1 of any year, no tax or assessment shall be imposed against the portion of the common property so affected for the next tax year beginning on July 1. [1981 c.782 §34]

 

      94.730 [Repealed by 1971 c.478 §1]

 

      94.733 Easements held by owner of lot and by declarant; homeowners association access to lots. (1) Subject to ORS 94.665, each owner of a lot has an easement through the common property:

      (a) For access to the owner’s lot; and

      (b) For use of the common property consistent with the declaration and the bylaws.

      (2) Except as provided in the declaration, a declarant has an easement through the common property as may be necessary for discharging the declarant’s obligations or exercising any special declarant right.

      (3) If an encroachment results from construction, reconstruction, repair, shifting, settlement or movement of any portion of the planned community, an easement for the encroachment exists to the extent that any lot or common property encroaches on any other lot or common property. An easement continues for maintaining the encroachment so long as the encroachment exists. Nothing in this section relieves an owner of liability in case of the owner’s willful misconduct or relieves a declarant or any other person of liability for failure to adhere to the plat of the planned community.

      (4)(a) Upon request given to the owner and any occupant, any person authorized by a homeowners association may enter a lot:

      (A) To perform necessary maintenance, repair or replacement of any property for which the association has maintenance, repair or replacement responsibility under the declaration or bylaws or ORS 94.550 to 94.783; or

      (B) To make emergency repairs to a lot that are necessary for the public safety or to prevent damage to common property or to another lot.

      (b) Requests for entry under this subsection must be made in advance and for a reasonable time, except in the case of an emergency, when the right of entry is immediate. An emergency entry does not constitute a trespass or otherwise create a right of action in the owner of the lot. [1981 c.782 §33; 2009 c.641 §16]

      94.761 Legislative findings regarding electric vehicle charging stations. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (a) The purpose of ORS 94.762 is to facilitate the installation of an electric vehicle charging station by an owner in a planned community for the owner’s personal residential use.

      (b) Oregon courts have identified the following factors in determining whether personal property is a fixture:

      (A) Whether the personal property is physically annexed to the real property;

      (B) Whether the personal property is specifically adapted to the property; and

      (C) Whether the person attaching the personal property objectively intended the personal property to become part of the real property when attached.

      (c) Oregon courts have identified the objective intent of the annexer, described in paragraph (b)(C) of this subsection, as the most important of the three factors.

      (2) Unless an owner and the homeowners association, or the declarant in lieu of the association, have negotiated a different outcome, an electric vehicle charging station installed under ORS 94.762 on or before June 4, 2015, is deemed to be the personal property of the owner of the lot with which the charging station is associated. [2015 c.249 §2]

 

      94.762 Electric vehicle charging stations. (1) Notwithstanding contrary provisions of a declaration or bylaws of a planned community:

      (a) An owner may submit an application to install an electric vehicle charging station for the personal, noncommercial use of the owner, in compliance with the requirements of this section, in a parking space, on a lot or in any other area subject to the exclusive use of the owner.

      (b) A homeowners association may not prohibit installation or use of a charging station installed and used in compliance with the requirements of this section.

      (2) When the owner complies or agrees to comply with the requirements of this section, a homeowners association, or a declarant in lieu of the association, shall approve a completed application within 60 days after the owner submits the application unless the delay in approving the application is based on a reasonable request for additional information.

      (3) A homeowners association:

      (a) May require an owner to submit an application before installing a charging station.

      (b) May require the charging station to meet the architectural standards of the planned community.

      (c) May impose reasonable charges to recover costs of the review and permitting of a charging station.

      (d) May impose reasonable restrictions on the installation and use of the charging station that do not significantly increase the cost of the charging station or significantly decrease the efficiency or performance of the charging station.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 479.540, the charging station must be installed by a person that holds a license, as defined in ORS 479.530, to act, at a minimum, as a journeyman electrician.

      (5) The owner is responsible for:

      (a) All costs associated with installation and use of the charging station, including:

      (A) The cost of electricity associated with the charging station; and

      (B) The cost of damage to common property and to areas subject to the exclusive use of other owners that results from the installation, use, maintenance, repair, removal or replacement of the charging station.

      (b) Disclosure to a prospective buyer of the lot of the existence of the charging station and the related responsibilities of the owner under this section.

      (6) If the homeowners association reasonably determines that the cumulative use of electricity in the planned community attributable to the installation and use of charging stations requires the installation of additional infrastructure improvements to provide the planned community a sufficient supply of electricity, the association may assess the cost of the additional improvements against the lot of each owner that has installed, or will install, a charging station.

      (7) Unless the owner and the homeowners association, or the declarant in lieu of the association, negotiate a different outcome:

      (a) A charging station installed under this section is deemed to be the personal property of the owner of the lot with which the charging station is associated; and

      (b) The owner must remove the charging station and restore the premises to the condition before installation of the charging station before the owner may transfer ownership of the lot, unless the prospective buyer of the lot accepts ownership of the charging station and all rights and responsibilities that apply to the charging station under this section.

      (8)(a) A pedestal, or similar, charging station that is hard-wired into the electrical system must be a certified electrical product, as defined in ORS 479.530.

      (b) If a charging station, other than one described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, is not a certified electrical product, and the owner of the lot owns the charging station, the owner shall:

      (A) Maintain a homeowner liability insurance policy in an amount not less than $1 million that includes coverage of the charging station; and

      (B) Name the homeowners association as a named additional insured under the policy with a right to notice of cancellation of the policy.

      (9) In any action between an owner and a homeowners association to enforce compliance with this section, the prevailing party is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs. [2013 c.438 §3; 2015 c.249 §3]

 

      94.764 Changes or actions that require approval or consent of mortgagee. (1) Notwithstanding a contrary provision of a declaration or bylaws of a homeowners association, when a change to the declaration, bylaws or other governing document or another action to be taken by the board of directors, association or owners requires approval or consent of a mortgagee, if the mortgagee receives a request to approve or consent to the change or action, the mortgagee is deemed to have approved or consented to the request unless the mortgagee delivers or posts a negative response to the requesting party within 60 days after receipt of the request.

      (2) The request must:

      (a) Be in writing.

      (b) Name the mortgagor.

      (c) Identify the property securing the mortgage by legal description as required for recordation in ORS 93.600 or by address.

(1) The rule against perpetuities may not be applied to defeat any provision of the declaration, or any bylaws or rules adopted under ORS 94.630.

      (2) In the event of a conflict between the declaration and the bylaws of a planned community or between the declaration and the articles of incorporation, the declaration shall prevail except to the extent the declaration is inconsistent with ORS 94.550 to 94.783.

      (3) Title to a unit, lot and common property shall not be rendered unmarketable or otherwise affected by reason of a failure of the declarant or the declaration to comply with ORS 94.550 to 94.783.

      (4) If the provisions of ORS 94.550 to 94.783 and the provisions of ORS chapter 65 apply to an association and the provisions conflict, the provisions of ORS 94.550 to 94.783 control. [1981 c.782 §86; 1999 c.677 §69; 2003 c.569 §19]

 

      94.775 Judicial partition prohibited. (1) Unless the declaration expressly allows the division of lots in a planned community, judicial partition by division of a lot in a planned community is not allowed under ORS 105.205. The lot may be partitioned by sale and division of the proceeds under ORS 105.245.

      (2) The restriction specified in subsection (1) of this section does not apply if the homeowners association has removed the property from the provisions of the declaration. [1981 c.782 §87; 2003 c.569 §20]

 

      94.777 Compliance with bylaws and other restrictions required; effect of noncompliance. Each owner and the declarant shall comply with the bylaws, and with the administrative rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, and with the covenants, conditions and restrictions in the declaration or in the deed to the lot. Failure to comply therewith shall be grounds for an action maintainable by the homeowners association or by an aggrieved owner. [1999 c.677 §36]

 

      94.778 Prohibition against installation of solar panels void and unenforceable. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a provision in a declaration or bylaws of a planned community that prohibits an owner of the roof or other exterior portion of a building or improvement on which solar panels may be installed from installing or using solar panels for obtaining solar access, as described in ORS 215.044 and 227.190, is void and unenforceable as a violation of the public policy to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the people of Oregon.

      (2) An owner of record of real property subject to an instrument that contains a provision described in subsection (1) of this section may file a petition to remove the provision in the manner provided in ORS 93.272 for removal of a provision from an instrument conveying or contracting to convey real property.

      (b) Permit or require the replacement of turf or other landscape vegetation with xeriscape on any portion of the planned community.

      (d) Require the use of best practices and industry standards to reduce the landscaped areas and minimize irrigation of existing landscaped areas of common property where turf is necessary for the function of the landscaped area.

      (3) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the following provisions of a planned community’s governing document are void and unenforceable:

      (a) A provision that prohibits or restricts the use of the owner’s unit or lot as the premises of an exempt family child care provider participating in the subsidy program under ORS 329A.500; or

      (b) If the unit does not share a wall, floor or ceiling surface in common with another unit, a provision that prohibits or restricts the use of the owner’s unit or lot as a certified or registered family child care home pursuant to ORS 329A.250 to 329A.450.

      (4) Subsection (3) of this section does not prohibit a homeowners association from adopting or enforcing a provision of the planned community’s governing document that regulates parking, noise, odors, nuisance, use of common property or activities that impact the cost of insurance policies held by the planned community, provided the provision:

      (a) Is reasonable; and

      (b) Does not have the effect of prohibiting or restricting the use of a unit or lot as the premises of an exempt family child care provider participating in the subsidy program under ORS 329A.500 or as a certified or registered family child care home pursuant to ORS 329A.250 to 329A.450.

(1) Failure of the declarant, association, any association member or any other person subject to ORS 94.550 to 94.783 to comply with applicable sections of ORS 94.550 to 94.785 shall be cause for suit or action to remedy the violation or to recover actual damages. The prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and court costs.

      (2) Failure of an association to accept administrative responsibility under ORS 94.616 shall be a defense for the declarant against an action brought under this section.

The real market value of timeshare property shall not be based upon the aggregate sales prices of timeshares, if such sales prices include nonreal property components.

      (2) The real market value of timeshare property, other than the recreational facilities, shall be determined by taking the value of each individual living unit as if such living unit were owned by a single taxpayer, without having been timeshared, and adjusting such value by an amount necessary to reflect any increase or decrease in such value attributable to the fact that such timeshare property is marketed in increments of time. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the value of such timeshare property is increased by 20 percent of its value under single ownership by virtue of being marketed in increments of time. If the managing entity or assessor contends that the adjustment due to such ability to market in increments of time is less than or greater than an increase of 20 percent of the single ownership value, then the burden of establishing such adjustment shall be upon the party so contending.

      (3) A court of competent jurisdiction, on petition of the developer of a timeshare plan or the developer’s successor in interest, may grant a waiver of the prohibition against partition under subsection (1) of this section, if the court is satisfied that:

      (a) The developer retains at least 50 percent of the timeshares created in the timeshare plan;

      (d) The petition has not been brought by the developer to avoid the developer’s responsibilities under the timeshare instrument without good cause; and

      (e) The holder of each blanket encumbrance consents to the proceeding under this section.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, upon a court declaration of timeshare plan failure under subsection (3) of this section, the court shall proceed to partition the timeshare property as otherwise provided by law.

Funds paid to the developer or the related entity’s credit shall be held by the court as proceeds available to lienholders and other claimants in such partition. If there are insufficient funds to fully discharge purchase money obligations of all owners except the developer, the balance of unsatisfied purchase money obligations of all owners except the developer shall be discharged by judgment of the court; and

      (d) As otherwise provided by law. [1983 c.530 §6; 2003 c.576 §356]

(Purchaser’s Rights)

 

      94.836 Cancellation of purchase within five days. (1) A purchaser from a developer may cancel, for any reason, any contract, agreement or other evidence of indebtedness associated with the sale of the timeshare within five calendar days from the date the purchaser signs the first written offer or contract to purchase.

      (2) Cancellation, under subsection (1) of this section, occurs when the purchaser gives written notice to the developer at the developer’s address. The cancellation period in subsection (1) of this section does not begin until the developer provides the purchaser with developer’s address for cancellation purposes.

      (3) A notice of cancellation given by a purchaser need not take a particular form and is sufficient if it indicates in writing the purchaser’s intent not to be bound by the contract or evidence of indebtedness.

      (4) Notice of cancellation, if given by mail, shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, and is effective on the date that the notice is deposited with the United States Postal Service, properly addressed and postage prepaid.

      (5) Upon receipt of a timely notice of cancellation, the developer shall immediately return any payment received from the purchaser. If the payment was made by check, the developer shall not be required to return the payment to the purchaser until the check is finally paid as provided in ORS 74.2130. Upon return of all payments the purchaser shall immediately transfer any rights the purchaser may have acquired in the timeshare to the developer, not subject to any encumbrance created or suffered by the purchaser. In the case of cancellation by a purchaser of any evidence of indebtedness, the purchaser shall return the purchaser’s copy of the executed evidence of indebtedness to the developer, and the developer shall cancel the evidence of indebtedness. Any encumbrance against the purchaser’s interest in the timeshare arising by operation of law from an obligation of the purchaser existing before transfer of the interest to the purchaser shall be extinguished by the reconveyance.

      (6) No act of a purchaser shall be effective to waive the right of cancellation granted by subsection (1) of this section. After the expiration of the five-day cancellation period, a developer may require a purchaser to execute and deliver to the developer a signed statement disclaiming any notice of cancellation timely and properly made by the purchaser before the five-day cancellation period expired under subsection (1) of this section, that has not been received by the developer. A disclaimer statement executed by the purchaser shall rescind the notice of cancellation. [1983 c.530 §26]

      94.855 [Repealed by 1971 c.478 §1]

 

      94.856 Assessment of common expenses as lien; recording; foreclosure; fees; remedies; exception. (1) Whenever a managing entity levies an assessment for common expenses against a timeshare estate, the managing entity, upon complying with subsection (2) of this section, shall have a lien upon the timeshare estate for the reasonable value of the expenses, for any unpaid assessment and interest as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section and for any late charges, fines and costs of collection, including but not limited to attorney fees and court costs. The lien shall be prior to any other lien or encumbrance upon the timeshare estate except:

      (a) Blanket encumbrances of record;

      (b) Tax and assessment liens; and

      (c) A purchase money mortgage of record, a purchase money trust deed of record or a purchase agreement of record.

      (2)(a) A managing entity claiming a lien under subsection (1) of this section shall record in the county in which the timeshare estate or some part thereof is located a claim containing:

      (A) A true statement of the account due for common expenses after deducting all just credits and offsets;

      (B) The name of the owner of the timeshare estate, or reputed owner, if known; and

      (C) The designation of the timeshare estate, sufficient for identification.

      (b) If a claim is filed and recorded under this section and the owner of the timeshare estate subject to the claim thereafter fails to pay any assessment chargeable to the timeshare estate, then so long as the original or any subsequent unpaid assessment remains unpaid the claim shall automatically accumulate the subsequent unpaid assessment and interest thereon without the necessity of further filings under this section.

      (3) The claim shall be verified by the oath of a person having knowledge of the facts and shall be filed with and recorded by the recording officer in the book kept for the purpose of recording liens filed under ORS 87.035. The record shall be indexed in the same manner that a deed or other conveyance is required by ORS 93.630 to be indexed.

      (4) The proceeding to foreclose a lien created by this section shall conform as nearly as possible to the proceeding to foreclose a lien created by ORS 87.010, except that notwithstanding ORS 87.055, a lien may be continued in force for a period of time not to exceed six years from the date the claim is filed under subsection (3) of this section. For the purpose of determining the date the claim is filed in those cases where subsequent unpaid assessments have accumulated under the claim as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section, the claim regarding each unpaid assessment shall be considered to have been filed at the time the unpaid assessment became due. The lien may be enforced by the managing entity. An action to recover a money judgment for unpaid common expenses may be maintained without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the claim for common expenses.

      (5) Unless the timeshare instrument provides otherwise, a fee, late charge, fine and interest imposed under ORS 94.858 (4)(i) is enforceable as an assessment under this section.

      (6) In addition to seeking a money judgment for the unpaid assessment if the timeshare plan conveys only a timeshare license, the managing entity may bring an action for breach of contract.

      (7) A construction lien under ORS 87.001 to 87.093 for labor performed or materials furnished to timeshare property, if properly incurred by the association or managing entity for the benefit of all timeshare owners with interests in the timeshare property shall, if effective, attach to each timeshare with interests in the timeshare property. The owner of a timeshare subject to the lien shall have the right to have the timeshare released from the lien by payment of the amount of the lien attributable to the timeshare. The amount of the lien attributable to the timeshare and the payment required to satisfy the lien, in the absence of agreement, shall be determined by application of the allocation of common expenses established in the timeshare instrument.

      (8) Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, a construction lien under ORS 87.001 to 87.093 for labor performed or materials furnished to a unit shall not be filed against the timeshare of any timeshare owner who did not expressly consent to or request the labor or materials. Consent shall be considered given under this subsection by the owner of a timeshare in the case of emergency repairs to the timeshare property done with the consent or at the request of the managing entity.

      (i) Impose a charge for the late payment of an assessment and, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, levy a reasonable fine for violation of the timeshare instrument, bylaws and rules and regulations of the association;

      (j) Provide for the indemnification of the association’s officers and governing board and maintain adequate liability insurance for the association’s officers and governing board;

      (b) The rights of the timeshare owners under the timeshare instrument will be substantially impaired if a trustee is not appointed; and

Liability insurance required under this paragraph shall be issued on a comprehensive liability basis.

      (a) Insurance for all insurable improvements in the timeshare property against loss or damage by fire or other hazards, including extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief.

      (a) The rights or lien of a lienholder whose lien was recorded before the notice of timeshare plan;

      (b) The rights of a person holding an option in the timeshare property if the option was recorded before the notice of timeshare plan; and

The lienholder’s agreement not to disturb an owner may require as a continuing condition that the owner perform all obligations and make all payments due under any purchase money agreement for the owner’s timeshare and, if the timeshare is held as a leasehold, under the lease for the owner’s timeshare.

      (h) Require the deposit into trust before closing the first timeshare sale, and the intention to maintain for the duration of the trust, an installment payment reserve consisting of funds in an amount sufficient at all times:

      (A) To pay the total of three successive monthly installments of debt service on each blanket encumbrance or, if installments of debt services are not payable monthly or in equal installments, such funds as the commissioner determines reasonably necessary to assure that the trustee will have sufficient cash to make any payment under the blanket encumbrances when due; and

      (B) To create a sinking fund to extinguish the debt at its maturity if the blanket encumbrance against the trust property is an interest only loan, contains a balloon payment provision or is otherwise not fully amortized under the terms for repayment.

      (i) Authorize the trustee to sell, transfer, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise dispose of the purchase money agreement or any other asset composing the lien payment deposit or any portion thereof if, in the trustee’s judgment, such action is necessary to enable the trustee to make all payments required under the blanket encumbrances to prevent foreclosure of the blanket encumbrance.

      (j) Require the developer to replenish the funds and assets in the trust whenever the lien payment deposit or the funds in the installment payment reserve fail to meet the requirements set forth in this subsection.

      (k) Provide that the trustee periodically shall disburse funds in the trust as follows: First, to pay real property taxes, governmental assessments, and lease rent, if any; second, to pay current payments due on the blanket encumbrances, in their order of priority; third, to any sinking fund established for the payment of blanket encumbrances, including any prepayment penalties and release prices; fourth, to pay any service charge and cost payable to the trustee and its collection agent, if any, under the trust instrument; and fifth, to the developer or as directed by the developer.

Following such demand, the holder must immediately deliver all subsequent payments of the owner to the trustee and continue to deliver the payments until the lien payment deposit is replenished.

      (3)(a) The lien payment deposit shall consist of either nondelinquent purchase money agreements from timeshare owners in the timeshare plan or other assets deposited into the trust by the developer and approved by the commissioner. The purchase money agreements must have an aggregate remaining principal balance of not less than, and any other assets deposited must have a liquidated value of not less than, 110 percent of the difference between the aggregate remaining balance owing under blanket encumbrances against the timeshare property, including any prepayment penalties, release prices or similar charges, and the amount of money or its equivalent in the trust and available at any time to be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the blanket encumbrance. The developer shall have the burden of establishing the liquidated value of assets other than purchase money agreements from timeshare owners in the timeshare plan.

      (b) If the blanket encumbrance payment deposit consists of purchase money agreements, the payments required to be made by owners under the agreements shall:

      (A) Be due on or before the date payments become due on the blanket encumbrances;

      (B) If paid when due as provided in subsection (4) of this section, be equal to at least 110 percent of the amount required to be paid on the blanket encumbrances on such date; and

      (c) If the developer proposes to deposit into trust assets other than purchase money agreements, the assets must be sufficient to pay debt service installments on the blanket encumbrance as they become due and to create a sinking fund or other arrangement adequate to extinguish the debt secured by the blanket encumbrance at its maturity.

      (4) For the purposes of this section, “purchase money agreement” means and includes a purchase money mortgage, a purchase money trust deed and a purchase contract.

      (5) For the purpose of this section, a purchase money agreement is considered delinquent when an installment payment is more than 59 days past due. [1983 c.530 §32; 1997 c.631 §394]

      (2) The Real Estate Commissioner may approve an alternative arrangement that permits termination of the trust. [1983 c.530 §33]

 

      94.900 Alternative to lien payment trust. (1) If it is impossible or impractical for a developer to satisfy any of the requirements of ORS 94.890 because of factors over which the developer has little or no control, the Real Estate Commissioner may accept arrangements other than those prescribed by ORS 94.890 which in the commissioner’s judgment will give rights and remedies affording equivalent benefits and protection to timeshare owners and which are at least comparable in scope though not necessarily in nature to those afforded by ORS 94.890.

      (2) If the commissioner is asked to accept alternative arrangements under this section, the commissioner may contract with an attorney and with any other private consultant the commissioner considers necessary or advisable, in connection with the review of the proposed arrangements for protecting purchasers. The attorney shall thoroughly review the timeshare plan for the purpose of examining the purchaser protections, including the documentation used in the timeshare plan and the disclosure thereof in the developer’s public report. After completing the review the attorney shall provide a written analysis of the nature and extent of the protection that the proposal affords a purchaser against blanket encumbrances. The cost of retaining the attorneys and other consultants shall be paid by the developer. [1983 c.530 §34]

 

      94.905 Surety bond. Any surety bond furnished to the Real Estate Commissioner under ORS 94.890 must be in an amount which is not less than 110 percent of the remaining principal balance of every indebtedness secured by a blanket encumbrance affecting the timeshare property. The surety bond must be issued by a surety authorized to do business in Oregon and having sufficient net worth to be acceptable to the commissioner. The bond shall provide for payment, up to the limit of the bond, of all amounts secured by the blanket encumbrance, including costs, expenses and legal fees of the lienholder, if for any reason the blanket encumbrance is enforced. The obligee of the surety bond shall be the commissioner on behalf of the timeshare owners. The bond may be reduced periodically in proportion to the reduction of the remaining principal balance of the indebtedness secured by the blanket encumbrances. Upon being furnished with a surety bond satisfying the foregoing requirements, the developer shall prepare and the commissioner shall execute and acknowledge a document in recordable form accepting the surety bond and identifying the timeshare property to which it applies.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to hold the publisher or employee of any newspaper, any job printer, broadcaster or telecaster liable for any publication referred to in this chapter, unless the publisher, employee, printer, broadcaster or telecaster has actual knowledge that the material is false or has an interest in the membership camping contract being advertised. [1991 c.377 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 94.975.

 

      94.977 Registration as salesperson or broker. (1) Unless the transaction is exempt under ORS 94.962, it is unlawful for any person to act as a salesperson or membership camping contract broker in this state without first registering as a salesperson or membership camping contract broker as provided in ORS 94.980. Individuals licensed as real estate brokers or principal real estate brokers under ORS chapter 696 are exempt from registration under this section.

      (2) A violation of this section is a Class A misdemeanor. [1985 c.639 §9; 2001 c.300 §54; 2007 c.319 §26]

 

      94.980 Application for registration; fee. (1) A salesperson or membership camping contract broker may apply for registration by filing with the Real Estate Commissioner an application which includes the following information:

      (a) A statement whether or not the applicant has been convicted of any misdemeanor or felony involving theft, fraud or dishonesty or whether or not the applicant has been enjoined from, had any civil penalty assessed for, or been found to have engaged in any violation of any act designed to protect consumers; and

      (b) A statement describing the applicant’s employment history for the past five years and whether or not any termination of employment during the last five years was occasioned by any theft, fraud or act of dishonesty.

      (2) Each applicant for initial registration shall submit to fingerprinting and provide to the commissioner as part of the application a recent photograph of the applicant. The registration must be accompanied by a written acceptance of the applicant as a salesperson signed by the membership camping operator with whom the salesperson will be associated.

      (3) The commissioner may deny, suspend or revoke a salesperson’s or membership camping contract broker’s application for registration or the salesperson’s or membership camping contract broker’s registration if the commissioner finds that the order is necessary for the protection of purchasers or owners of membership camping contracts and that the applicant or registrant:

      (a) Has been convicted of any misdemeanor or felony or has been enjoined from, had any civil penalty assessed for, or been found to have engaged in any violation of any act designed to protect consumers;

      (b) Has violated any material provision of ORS 94.925 to 94.983; or

      (c) Has engaged in fraudulent or deceitful practices in any industry involving sales to consumers.

      (4) Registration shall be effective for a period of one year. Registration shall be renewed annually by the filing of a form prescribed by the commissioner for that purpose. The completed application for registration or renewal shall automatically become effective upon the expiration of 30 business days following filing with the commissioner, unless:

      (a) The application has been denied under subsection (3) of this section;

      (b) The commissioner grants the registration effective as of an earlier date; or

      (c) The applicant or registrant consents to delay of the effective date.

      (5) During the effective period of a salesperson’s registration, the salesperson may transfer to a new membership camping operator by requesting the operator to return the salesperson’s registration to the commissioner and filing with the commissioner a written acceptance of the salesperson’s transfer signed by the membership camping operator with whom the salesperson will be associated following the transfer. Upon receipt of the salesperson’s registration and payment to the commissioner of a $10 transfer fee, the commissioner may issue a registration for the salesperson to the new membership camping operator. Upon the request of a salesperson, a membership camping operator shall promptly return the registration of the salesperson to the commissioner.

      (6) A salesperson’s registration granted under this section shall be issued to a membership camping operator who signed the written acceptance accompanying the initial registration application or transfer request. A salesperson’s registration entitles the salesperson to sell membership camping contracts only for any campground operated by the membership camping operator under the supervision of the operator. If the salesperson terminates sales activity for any reason, the membership camping operator shall return the registration of the salesperson to the commissioner without delay.

      (7) If an applicant for registration has an active real estate license outstanding, the applicant must place the real estate license on inactive status before issuance of the registration by the commissioner. A salesperson or membership camping contract broker may not reactivate an inactive real estate license during any term of registration as a salesperson or membership camping contract broker. [1985 c.639 §10; 1991 c.377 §11]

In computing the number of business days, the day on which the membership camping contract was signed, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall not be included as a “business day.” The membership camping operator shall promptly refund any money or other consideration paid by the purchaser upon receipt of timely notice of cancellation by the purchaser.

      (3) Every membership camping contract shall include the following statement in at least 10-point type immediately before the space for the purchaser’s signature:

______________________________________________________________________________

 

Purchaser’s Right To Cancel: You may cancel this membership camping contract without any cancellation fee or other penalty by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to _____ (insert name and mailing address of membership camping operator). The notice must be postmarked by midnight of the third business day following the day on which the membership camping contract is signed. In computing the three business days, the day on which the membership camping contract is signed shall not be included as a “business day,” nor shall Saturday, Sunday or legal holidays be included.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (4) If the purchaser has not inspected a campground or facility at which camping sites are located or planned, the notice must contain the following additional language:

______________________________________________________________________________

 

If you sign this membership camping contract without having first inspected the property at which camping sites are located or planned, you may also cancel this membership camping contract by giving this notice within six business days following the day on which you signed if you inspect such a property prior to sending the notice.

      94.986 Requirements for sale of membership camping contract; nondisturbance agreements. With respect to any campground offered for sale in this state and acquired and put into operation by a membership camping operator after September 1, 1985, the membership camping operator shall not sell membership camping contracts in this state granting the right to use such campground until one of the following requirements has been satisfied:

      (1) Each person holding an interest in a blanket encumbrance executes and delivers to the Real Estate Commissioner a nondisturbance agreement and records such agreement in the real estate records of the county in which the campground is located. “Nondisturbance agreement” means an instrument by which the holder of a blanket encumbrance agrees that the holder’s rights in the campground shall be subordinate to the rights of any membership camping contract purchaser. Every nondisturbance agreement must contain a covenant by the lienholder that the lienholder, its successors, and anyone who acquires the campground property through the blanket lien shall not use, or cause or permit the property to be used in a manner that prevents a membership camping contract purchaser from using, the campground property in the manner contemplated by the membership camping contract. The lienholder’s agreement not to disturb a membership camping contract purchaser may require as a continuing condition that the purchaser perform all obligations and make all payments due under any membership camping contract for the purchaser’s campground interest and, if the membership camping contract is held as a leasehold, under the lease for the purchaser’s campground interest. The nondisturbance agreement shall also contain provisions setting forth each of the following:

      (a) The nondisturbance agreement may be enforced by purchasers of membership camping contracts. If the membership camping operator is not in default under its obligations to the holder of the blanket encumbrance, the agreement may be enforced by both the membership camping operator and the purchasers.

      (b) The nondisturbance agreement is effective as between each purchaser and the holder of the blanket encumbrance despite any rejection or cancellation of the purchaser’s contract during bankruptcy proceedings of the membership camping operator.

      (c) The agreement is binding upon the successors in interest of both the membership camping operator and the holder of the blanket encumbrance.

      (d) A holder of the blanket encumbrance who obtains title or possession, or who causes a change in title or possession in a campground by foreclosure or otherwise, and who does not continue to operate the campground upon conditions no less favorable to members than existed prior to the change of title or possession shall:

      (A) Offer the title or possession of the campground to an association of members to operate the campground; or

      (B) Obtain a commitment from another entity that obtains title or possession to undertake the responsibility for operation of the campground.

      (2) If a financial institution, acting as hypothecation lender and providing the major hypothecation loan to the membership camping operator, has a lien on, or security interest in, the membership camping operator’s interest in the campground, the financial institution shall execute and deliver to the commissioner a nondisturbance agreement and record such agreement in the real estate records of the county in which the campground is located. In addition, each person holding an interest in any blanket encumbrance superior to the interest held by the financial institution shall execute, deliver and record an instrument stating that such person shall give the financial institution notice of, and at least 30 days to cure, any default under the blanket encumbrance before such person commences any foreclosure action affecting the campground. For the purposes of this provision, a major hypothecation loan to a membership camping operator is a loan or line of credit secured by substantially all of the contracts receivable arising from the membership camping operator’s sale of membership camping contracts.

      (3) There shall have been delivered to and accepted by the commissioner a surety bond or letter of credit with the commissioner as obligee for the benefit of purchasers. The bond or letter of credit must be in an amount which is not less than 105 percent of the remaining principal balance of every indebtedness secured by the blanket encumbrance affecting the campground. Any such bond must be issued by a surety authorized to do business in this state and having sufficient net worth to satisfy the indebtedness. Any such letter of credit must be irrevocable and must be drawn upon a bank, savings and loan association or other financial institution acceptable to the commissioner. The bond or letter of credit shall provide for payment of all amounts secured by the blanket encumbrance, including costs, expenses and legal fees of the lienholder, if for any reason the blanket encumbrance is enforced. The bond or letter of credit may be reduced periodically in proportion to the reduction of the amounts secured by the blanket encumbrance.

      (4) There have been delivered to and accepted by the commissioner other financial assurances which the commissioner finds are acceptable to carry into effect the intent and provisions of this section. [1985 c.639 §11a; 1991 c.377 §5]

 

      94.987 Judicial declaration of failure in management. (1)(a) Upon petition by the Real Estate Commissioner or a majority of active purchasers not then in default under their membership camping contracts, a court of competent jurisdiction may declare a failure of management of the membership camping operator and appoint a trustee to assume the membership camping operator’s duties under the membership camping contracts, if the court finds that:

      (A) Irreparable injury to the rights of the purchasers is likely to occur unless a trustee is appointed; and

      (B) There is no reasonable alternative to appointment of a trustee.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, “active purchaser” means a current, dues-paying member of the membership camping operator.

      (2) The court may attach such conditions and terms to its appointment of a trustee under subsection (1) of this section as the court considers necessary to protect the rights of the purchasers under the membership camping contract. The trustee shall provide a copy of the court’s decision in such a case to the commissioner.

      (3) If the court petitioned under subsection (1) of this section finds that there is a reasonable alternative to the appointment of a trustee, the court may order the membership camping operator to carry out the reasonable alternative and may attach to its order such terms and conditions as it considers necessary to protect the rights of the purchasers under the membership camping contracts. [1991 c.377 §4]

 

      94.989 Interpretation of membership camping contracts; application of Unlawful Trade Practices Act. (1) Membership camping contracts, campgrounds and facilities are not subdivisions or series partitions under ORS chapter 92, are not condominiums under ORS chapter 100, are not timeshare properties under ORS chapter 94, and are not securities under ORS 59.005 to 59.505, 59.710 to 59.830, 59.991 and 59.995.

      (2) Membership camping contracts covered by ORS 94.925 to 94.983 are retail installment contracts under ORS 83.010 to 83.190.

      (3) The Attorney General shall protect the rights of purchasers through the application of ORS 336.184 and 646.605 to 646.652. [1985 c.639 §12]

 

      94.990 [Repealed by 1971 c.478 §1]

 

      94.991 [Formerly 91.990; 1987 c.320 §15; renumbered 100.990 in 1989]
