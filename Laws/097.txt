If no relatives or interested persons claim the body, the department may transfer the body to an institution that is on the list maintained by the board under subsection (2) of this section that desires the body for education or research purposes, or may authorize burial or cremation of the body. The department shall pay expenses related to burial or cremation authorized by the department under this subsection.

      (5) Upon receipt of a qualifying statement as required by the board by rule that the deceased person is an indigent person, the board shall reimburse a funeral establishment the reasonable costs for disposition of the body of any unclaimed deceased indigent person.

      (3) If the payment for the purchase of an interment space is past due for a period of 90 days or more, this section does not apply to or prohibit the removal of any remains from one plot to another in the same cemetery or the removal of remains by the cemetery authority from a plot to some other suitable place.

      (4) This section does not apply to the disinterment of remains upon order of court or if ordered under the provisions of ORS 146.045 (3)(e). [Amended by 1977 c.582 §3; 2007 c.661 §2; 2011 c.164 §3; 2019 c.241 §3]

DEDICATION TO CEMETERY PURPOSES; PLATTINGS

 

      97.310 Survey and subdivision of land; map or plat of mausoleum or columbarium; access easement. (1) Every cemetery authority, from time to time as its property may require for cemetery purposes, shall:

      (a) In case of land, survey and subdivide it into sections, blocks, plots, avenues, walks or other subdivisions and make a good and substantial map or plat showing them, with descriptive names or numbers. In all instances this shall be done in compliance with ORS 92.010 to 92.192 except that ORS 92.090 (2)(a) and (b) shall not be applicable to streets, alleys, ways and footpaths located wholly within a cemetery.

      (b) In case of a mausoleum or columbarium, make a good substantial map or plat on which are delineated the sections, halls, rooms, corridors, elevation and other divisions, with descriptive names or numbers. In all instances this shall be done in compliance with the state building code.

      (2) Every lot in a cemetery subdivision shall include an access easement across the lot for the benefit of adjacent lots. Designated areas between lots for the purpose of providing access to separate lots are not required to approve a subdivision under this section. A cemetery authority must disclose to a potential purchaser of a lot in the cemetery the existence of the access easement across the lot. [Amended by 1965 c.396 §2; 1979 c.57 §1; 1985 c.582 §3; 1999 c.381 §1]

 

      97.320 Filing map or plat and declaration of dedication of land to cemetery purposes. In case of a cemetery lot, the cemetery authority shall file the map or plat in the office of the recording officer of the county in which all or a portion of the property is situated, and it forthwith shall file for record in that officer’s office a written declaration dedicating the property delineated on the plat or map exclusively to cemetery purposes.

 

      97.330 When dedication is complete. Upon the filing of the map or plat and of the declaration for record, the dedication is complete for all purposes, and thereafter the property shall be held, occupied and used exclusively for cemetery purposes.

 

      97.340 Effect of dedication. After property is dedicated to cemetery purposes pursuant to ORS 97.310 to 97.330 and 97.360 (1), neither the dedication nor the title of a plot owner shall be affected by the dissolution of the cemetery authority by nonuser on its part, by alienation of the property, by any encumbrances, by sale under execution or otherwise, except as provided in ORS 97.310 to 97.350, 97.360 (2), 97.440, 97.510 to 97.650, 97.710, 97.720 and 97.810 to 97.865.

 

      97.350 Dedication to cemetery purposes not invalid. Dedication to cemetery purposes pursuant to ORS 97.010 to 97.040, 97.110 to 97.450, 97.510 to 97.730, 97.810 to 97.920 and 97.990 is not invalid as violating any laws against perpetuities or the suspension of the power of alienation of title to or use of property, and is deemed to be in respect for the dead, and is a provision for the interment of human remains and is a duty to, and for the benefit of, the general public.

 

      97.360 Resurvey and alteration in shape or size; vacation of streets, walks, driveways and parks and replatting into lots. (1) Any part or subdivision of the property so mapped and platted may, by order of the directors and consent of the lot owners, be resurveyed and altered in shape and size and an amended map or plat filed, so long as such change does not disturb any interred remains.

      (2) Whenever a majority of the lots as platted or laid out in any cemetery established before March 3, 1927, or any part thereof, has been sold without the owners or persons in control of the cemetery having made provision for the establishment of an adequate endowment fund for the perpetual maintenance, upkeep and beautification of the cemetery and of the lots therein, the avenues, streets, alleys, walks, driveways and parks therein may be vacated or altered and replatted into lots which may be sold for burial purposes in the manner provided in this subsection and in ORS 97.370 to 97.430. Application for the vacation or alteration of any avenues, streets, alleys, walks, driveways or parks, and for the replatting of the same, or any portion thereof, for cemetery lots in any such cemetery shall be made to the county court or board of county commissioners in the county where the cemetery is situated. The application may be by the owners or persons in control of the cemetery or by a group of 20 or more persons owning lots or having relatives buried therein. The application shall be verified and shall specify the lots owned by each petitioner in which are buried bodies of relatives in which the petitioner is interested and shall state the reason for the proposed change and what provisions have theretofore been made for the perpetual upkeep, maintenance and beautification of the cemetery, and there shall be presented therewith a plat of the cemetery, together with the proposed replat, which shall have clearly indicated thereon the proposed changes.

 

      97.370 Fixing date of hearing; notice. When any application mentioned in ORS 97.360 (2) is filed, the court or board shall fix the time for the hearing of it and notice of the time thereof shall be given by publication in a paper of general circulation published in the town in which the cemetery is situated or in the town to which it is nearest once a week for a period of six successive weeks prior to the date of the hearing and a copy of such notice shall be posted for a like period at three public and conspicuous places in the cemetery. Such notice shall be addressed to all persons owning lots or having an interest in the cemetery, but need not name them, and shall set forth in a general way the proposed changes, the reason stated in the application for making it, the time when the hearing of the application will be had, and shall state that a plat showing the proposed changes is on file with the county clerk of the county in which the cemetery is situated.

 

      97.380 Hearing; order allowing replatting. At the hearing mentioned in ORS 97.370 the court or board shall consider and hear any evidence introduced in favor of the proposed change and all objections thereto and, after a full hearing thereon, may allow the proposed change and replat in whole or in part. If the proposed change is allowed, either in whole or in part, an order allowing it shall be made providing that title to any new lot created by the alteration or vacation of any avenues, streets, alleys, driveways, walks or parks, or any part thereof, shall be vested in the owner of the fee of the part of the cemetery sought to be vacated in trust for burial purposes, or vested in any association which may be formed for the purpose of taking over the cemetery and operating and maintaining it in accordance with the provisions of ORS 97.400. [Amended by 1985 c.582 §4; 1999 c.381 §2]

 

      97.390 Assessment of benefits and damages. If any damages are claimed by the owner of any lot in any such cemetery as is mentioned in ORS 97.360 (2), which lot is adjacent to the avenues, streets, alleys, driveways or parks vacated as provided in ORS 97.380, they shall be ascertained by the county court or board of county commissioners and offset against the benefits accruing to the lot owner on account of the upkeep and beautification of the cemetery in the manner provided in ORS 97.400. Any person feeling aggrieved at the amount of damages so assessed by the board may appeal from such order of allowance to the circuit court of the county in which the cemetery is situated in the same manner as is provided by statute for appeal from the assessment of damages by the exercise of eminent domain in locating a county road and on such appeal the jury, in assessing the amount of damages to be allowed to the appellant, shall offset against such damages the benefits accruing to the appellant as in this section above provided.

 

      97.400 Disposal of newly created lots; disposition and use of proceeds from sale; failure of owner to perform duties. Any owner or association accepting the trust of handling and disposing of lots newly created pursuant to ORS 97.380 shall by the acceptance thereof agree to dispose of the lots only for burial purposes and at a price not less than that fixed by the county court or board of county commissioners. The net funds derived from the sale of the lots remaining after the payment of the reasonable expenses incident to the vacation and of the sale shall be placed in an irreducible and perpetual fund and the interest therefrom shall be used for the perpetual upkeep and beautification of the cemetery and the lots therein situated. The fund shall be placed in some reliable trust company specified by the court or board, which trust company shall invest the same and pay the income therefrom to the owner or association charged with the disposal of such lots. Any owner or association taking over the sale of the lots shall comply with such provisions as the court or board may require of it in the upkeep, beautification and care of the cemetery with the income thereof, and if such owner or association for any reason fails to perform such duties, the court or board may, on its own motion, from time to time, appoint some other association or individual to perform them. The restrictions of this section shall not apply to the sale of lots obtained by replatting cemeteries owned and maintained by any county.

 

      97.410 Right of adjacent lot owner upon vacation of way. The vacation of an avenue, street, alley, driveway, walk or park adjacent to a cemetery lot shall vest in the owner of such lot no interest in the vacated portion thereof; but the adjacent owner shall, for 30 days after the date of such an order of vacation, have the right to purchase any new lot adjacent to the lot of the owner at the price fixed by the court or board at which the lots are to be sold, and if there is more than one adjacent lot owner, the new lot shall be sold to the one offering the highest price therefor.

 

      97.420 Effect of failure to object. Any owner of such cemetery as is mentioned in ORS 97.360 (2), or of any lot therein, or any relative or heir of any deceased person buried in such cemetery who fails to appear and file written objection to any proposed replat, alteration or vacation, authorized by ORS 97.360 (2), shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed change and shall be forever barred from claiming any right to use and have open for traffic or passageway any streets, alleys, driveways or parks vacated, or any right, title or interest therein, except as provided in ORS 97.360 (2) and 97.370 to 97.410.

 

      97.430 Declaration of exercise of police power and right of eminent domain. The enactment of ORS 97.360 (2) and 97.370 to 97.430 is hereby declared to be a necessary exercise of the police powers of the state in order to preserve and keep existing cemeteries as resting places for the dead and to preserve old and historic cemeteries from becoming unkempt and places of reproach and desolation in the communities in which they are located. The taking of avenues, streets, alleys, walks, driveways and parks for the purpose and by the method specified in ORS 97.360 (2) and 97.370 to 97.420 is hereby declared an exercise of the right of eminent domain in behalf of the public health, safety, comfort, pleasure and historic instruction.

 

      97.440 Removal of dedication. (1) Property dedicated to cemetery purposes shall be held and used exclusively for cemetery purposes until the dedication is removed from all or any part of it by an order and decree of the county court or board of county commissioners of the county in which the property is situated in a proceeding brought by the cemetery authority for that purpose and upon notice of hearing and proof satisfactory to the court that:

      (a) The portion of the property from which dedication is sought to be removed is not being used for interment of human remains; or

      (b) The Oregon Commission on Historic Cemeteries has received notice of and had the opportunity to comment on the removal from the dedicated property of all human remains and markers dated prior to February 14, 1909.

      (2) The notice of hearing required by this section must:

      (a) Be given by publication once a week for at least four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the cemetery is located and by publication twice in a newspaper with statewide circulation;

      (b) Be posted in three conspicuous places on that portion of the property from which the dedication is to be removed;

      (c) Describe the portion of the cemetery property sought to be removed from dedication;

      (d) State that all remains and markers have been removed or that no interments have been made in the portion of the cemetery property sought to be removed from dedication; and

      (e) Specify the time and place of the hearing. [Amended by 2003 c.237 §1]

 

      97.445 Vacating county interest in cemetery real property. Consistent with the provisions of ORS 368.326 to 368.366, a county may vacate any real property interests the county may own in a cemetery. Consistent with ORS 368.366 (2), the county may vacate its real property interests in favor of a private nonprofit organization provided the organization states its intent to provide for the continuing maintenance and care of the cemetery and associated facilities. [1997 c.747 §2]

 

      97.450 Discontinuance of cemetery and removal of remains and markers. (1)(a) Whenever any cemetery that is within the limits of any county, city or town has been abandoned, or it is desirable to abandon such cemetery, the governing body of any county, if the cemetery is owned by the county, or the corporate authorities of the city or town, if the cemetery is owned by the city or town, or the trustees or directors, if the cemetery is owned by an association or corporation, may order that such burial ground be discontinued, have the remains of all persons interred in the cemetery moved to some other suitable place and provide for the removal and reerection of all stones and monuments marking said graves. Each removal must be made in an appropriate manner and in accordance with the directions of the Director of the Oregon Health Authority. Prior to any removal authorized under this section, written notice must be given to the family, or next of kin of the deceased, if known, and if unknown, notice of the removal shall be published for at least four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the cemetery is located and twice in a newspaper with statewide circulation.

      (b) Any removal and the costs of the proceedings under this section shall be at the expense of the county, city or town, individual, corporation or association owning the cemetery to be moved.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(a) of this section, a cemetery or burial ground containing human remains that were interred before February 14, 1909, may not be discontinued or declared abandoned or have remains removed from the burial ground or cemetery without prior notice to and comment by the Oregon Commission on Historic Cemeteries. When commenting on a request to discontinue or declare abandoned a cemetery or burial ground, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The listing of the cemetery or burial ground under ORS 97.782;

      (b) The historic significance of the cemetery or graves included in the request; and

      (c) The findings of any archaeological survey of the cemetery or burial ground. [Amended by 1955 c.472 §1; 2003 c.237 §2; 2009 c.595 §63]

 

      97.460 Requirements for establishment of cemetery or burial park. (1) A person may not lay out, open up or use any property for cemetery or burial park purposes unless the person:

      (a) Is the owner of the property;

      (d) Agrees to disclose the disposition of human remains upon sale of the property. Failure to disclose the disposition of human remains does not invalidate the sale of the property.

      (2) A planning commission of a county or city or, if there is no planning commission in a county or city, the governing body of the county or city, shall provide to the State Mortuary and Cemetery Board a list of the requirements for laying out, opening up or using property in the county or city for cemetery or burial park purposes. [Formerly 64.060; 1965 c.396 §3; 2009 c.709 §9]

 

SALES AND RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF CEMETERY PLOTS

 

      97.510 Sale and conveyance of plots by cemetery authority. (1) After filing the map or plat and recording the declaration of dedication, a cemetery authority may sell and convey plots subject to such rules and regulations as may be then in effect and subject to such other and further limitations, conditions and restrictions made a part of the declaration of dedication by reference or included in the instrument of conveyance of the plot.

      (2) Scattering of cremated remains in a scattering garden is not a sale or conveyance. [Amended by 2007 c.661 §3]

      97.520 Sale or offer to sell cemetery plot upon promise of resale at financial profit. A person, firm or corporation may not sell or offer to sell a cemetery plot upon the promise, representation or inducement of resale at a financial profit, except with the consent and approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. Each violation of this section constitutes a separate offense. [Amended by 1989 c.171 §13; 2007 c.661 §4]

 

      97.530 Commission, bonus or rebate for sale of plot or services. No cemetery authority shall pay or offer to pay, and no person, firm or corporation shall receive, directly or indirectly, a commission, bonus, rebate or other thing of value for the sale of a plot or services. This does not apply to a person regularly employed by the cemetery authority for such purpose. Each violation of this section constitutes a separate offense.

 

      97.540 Commission, bonus or rebate for recommendation of cemetery. No person shall pay, cause to be paid or offer to pay, and no person, firm or corporation shall receive, directly or indirectly, except as provided in ORS 97.530, any commission, bonus, rebate or other thing of value in consideration of recommending or causing a dead human body to be disposed of in any cemetery. Each violation of this section constitutes a separate offense.

 

      97.550 Plots are indivisible. All plots, the use of which has been conveyed by deed or certificate of ownership as a separate plot, are indivisible except with the consent of the cemetery authority, or as provided by law.

 

      97.560 Presumption of sole ownership in grantee of plot. All plots conveyed to individuals are presumed to be solely and separately owned by the person named in the instrument of conveyance.

 

      97.570 Spouse has vested right of interment. (1) The spouse of an owner of any plot containing more than one interment space has a vested right of interment of the remains of the spouse in the plot, and any person thereafter becoming the spouse of the owner has a vested right of interment of the remains of the person in the plot if more than one interment space is unoccupied at the time the person becomes the spouse of the owner.

      (2) The purchase by a married person of more than one interment space shall create in the spouse a right of interment therein.

 

      97.580 Divestiture of spouse’s right of interment. No conveyance or other action of the owner without the written consent or joinder of the spouse of the owner divests the spouse of the vested right of interment, except that a judgment of divorce between them terminates the right unless otherwise provided in the judgment. [Amended by 2003 c.576 §357]

 

      97.590 Transfer of plot or right of interment. No transfer of any plot, heretofore or hereafter made, or any right of interment is complete or effective until recorded on the books of the cemetery authority.

 

      97.600 Descent of plot. Upon the death of the owner, unless the owner has disposed of the plot either by specific direction in the will of the owner or by a written declaration filed and recorded in the office of the cemetery authority, if no interment has been made in an interment plot which has been transferred by deed or certificate of ownership to an individual owner or if all remains previously interred are lawfully removed, the plot descends to the heirs at law of the owner, subject to the rights of interment of the decedent and the surviving spouse of the decedent.

 

      97.610 Determining occupant of burial plot having co-owners. When there are two or more owners of a burial plot or of rights of interment therein, such owners may designate one or more persons to designate the burials to be made in the plot and file written notice of such designation with the cemetery association. In the absence of such notice or of written objection to its so doing, the cemetery association is not liable to any owner for interring or permitting an interment therein upon the request or direction of any registered co-owner of the plot.

 

      97.620 Death of co-owner; authorization to use plot under directions of surviving owners. An affidavit by any person having knowledge of the fact, setting forth the fact of the death of one owner and establishing the identity of the surviving owners named in the deed to any plot, when filed with the cemetery authority operating the cemetery in which the plot is located, is authorization to the cemetery authority to permit the use of the unoccupied portion of the plot in accordance with the directions of the surviving owners or their successors in interest.

 

      97.630 Family plots; order of occupation. (1) Whenever an interment of the remains of a member or of a relative of a member of the family of the record owner, or of the remains of the record owner, is made in a plot transferred by deed or certificate of ownership to an individual owner, and the owner dies without making disposition of the plot, either by direction in the owner’s will, or by a written declaration filed and recorded in the office of the cemetery authority, the plot thereby becomes inalienable and shall be held as the family plot of the owner, and occupied in the following order:

      (a) One grave, niche or crypt may be used for the owner’s interment; one for the owner’s surviving spouse, if there is one, who by ORS 97.010 to 97.040, 97.110 to 97.450, 97.510 to 97.730, 97.810 to 97.920 and 97.990 has a vested right of interment in it; and in those remaining, if any, the children of the deceased owner in order of death may be interred without the consent of any person claiming any interest in the plot.

      (b) If no child survives, the right of interment goes in order of death to the spouse of any child of the record owner.

      (2) Any surviving spouse, child or child’s spouse who has a right of interment in a family plot may waive such right in favor of any other relative or spouse of a relative of either the deceased owner or of the deceased owner’s spouse, and upon such waiver the remains of the person in whose favor the waiver is made may be interred in the plot.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the personal representative of the deceased owner of a family plot may sell unoccupied interment spaces in the plot as property of the estate of the deceased owner when there are no existing rights of interment in those spaces or all existing rights of interment in those spaces have been waived and thereby terminated.

      97.650 Limitations upon vested right of interment.

(1) A nonprofit corporation organized or existing solely for the purposes of either owning and operating a cemetery or cremating dead bodies and burying and caring for incinerate remains may, by its bylaws, provide that a stated percentage of the money received from the sale of lots and burial space, cremation of bodies, donations, gifts or other sources of revenue shall constitute an irreducible fund. Any bylaw enacted for the creation of the irreducible fund cannot be amended to reduce the fund.

      (2) The board of directors may direct the investment of the money in the irreducible fund, but all investments of money deposited in the fund on or after January 1, 1972, shall be in securities in classes and amounts approved by the State Treasurer and published in a list pursuant to ORS 97.820. If a bank or trust company qualified to engage in the trust business is directed by the board of directors to invest the money in the irreducible fund, the bank or trust company shall be governed by ORS 130.750 to 130.775 and shall not be required to invest the money according to the list approved by the State Treasurer. An officer of the corporation shall file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services on or before April 15 of each year a verified statement in duplicate containing the same information pertaining to the irreducible fund as provided in ORS 97.810 (4) regarding endowment care funds.

      (3) The interest or income arising from the irreducible fund provided for in this section or by any bylaws, or so much thereof as is necessary, shall be devoted exclusively to the preservation and embellishment of the grounds, buildings and property of the corporation and the lots and space in buildings or grounds sold to the members of the corporation, or to the payment of the interest or principal of the debts authorized by subsection (5) of this section for the purchase of land, erecting buildings, and improvements. Any surplus thereof not needed or used for such purposes shall be invested as provided in this section and shall become part of the irreducible fund.

      (4) After paying for the land and the erection of the original buildings and improvements thereon, all the future receipts and income of the corporation subject to the provisions in this section relating to the creation of an irreducible fund, whether from the sale of lots and burial space, cremation of bodies, donations, gifts and other sources, shall be applied exclusively to laying out, preserving, protecting, embellishing and beautifying the cemetery or the crematory and grounds thereof, and the avenues leading thereto, and to the erection of such buildings and improvements as may be necessary or convenient for cemetery or crematory purposes, and to pay the necessary expenses of the corporation.

      (5) No debts shall be contracted by such corporation in anticipation of any future receipts, except for originally purchasing the lands authorized to be purchased by it, laying out and embellishing the grounds and avenues, erecting buildings and vaults on such land, and improving them for the purposes of the corporation. The corporation may issue bonds or notes for debts so contracted and may secure them by way of mortgage upon any of its lands, buildings, property and improvements excepting lots or space conveyed to the members.

Burial lots or space for burial of incinerate remains in buildings or grounds sold by a nonprofit corporation organized and existing solely for the purposes of either owning and operating a cemetery or cremating dead bodies and burying and caring for incinerate remains shall be for the sole purpose of interment or deposit and safekeeping of incinerate remains. Such lots or space shall be exempt from execution, attachment or other lien or process, if used as intended by the purchaser thereof from such corporation, or the assigns or representatives of the purchaser, exclusively for burial purposes, and in no wise with a view to profit. Such lots or space shall be exempt from taxation as provided in ORS 307.150. The vendor of any gravestone, however, shall not be prevented from having and enforcing a lien thereon for all or part of its purchase price. If a suit is brought to enforce such a lien, the judgment therein is enforceable thereafter; and, for the purpose of enabling the lien to be had and enforced, the gravestone shall be deemed personal property and may be severed and removed, under execution and order of sale, from the lot where it is situated and may be sold in the same manner as any other personal property.

They are not invalid by reason of any indefiniteness or uncertainty of the persons designated as beneficiaries in the instrument creating the trust; nor are they invalid as violating any existing laws against perpetuities or suspension of the power of alienation of title to property. But nothing in this section affects any existing authority or cause to pass upon the reasonableness of the amount of such gift, grant or bequest. Any cemetery association may act as trustee of and execute any such trust with respect to lots, walks, fences, monuments, structures or tombs, both within or outside its own cemetery limits, but within the county where such cemetery association has its principal office and place of business, whether such power is otherwise included in its corporate powers or not.

      97.813 Standards of care for and public access to endowment care cemeteries; rules. The Department of Consumer and Business Services, in collaboration with the State Mortuary and Cemetery Board, shall adopt rules relating to:

      (1) Minimum standards of care for the maintenance and operation of endowment care cemeteries; and

      (2) The ability of the public to access the premises of endowment care cemeteries. [2019 c.8 §4]

 

      Note: 97.813 was added to and made a part of 97.810 to 97.920 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      97.820 Placing cemetery under endowed care; deposit; commingling endowment and special care funds; trustee or custodian of fund. (1) Every cemetery authority that operates a cemetery may place its cemetery under endowed care and establish, maintain and operate an endowment care fund. All endowed care funds shall be deposited with and held solely by the trustee or custodian appointed by the cemetery authority.

      (2) Endowment care and special care funds may be commingled for investment and the income therefrom shall be divided between the endowment care and special care funds in the proportion that each fund contributed to the principal sum invested. The income of the endowment care fund may be used only to finance the care of the cemetery.

      (3) The cemetery authority shall appoint as sole trustee of the endowment care fund a trust company as defined in ORS 706.008 that is authorized to transact trust business in this state, or an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 that is authorized to accept deposits in this state. Such trust company or insured institution shall receive and accept the fund, including any accumulated endowment care fund in existence at the time of its appointment and perform such duties as are agreed upon in the agreement between it and the cemetery authority. An insured institution not qualified to transact trust business in this state may act as custodian of such endowment care fund provided:

      (a) The duties of the insured institution are essentially custodial or ministerial in nature; and

      (b) The insured institution invests the funds from such plan only in its own time or savings deposits.

      (4) The trustee or custodian may resign upon written notice to the cemetery authority or the cemetery authority may remove the trustee or custodian by written notice to it.

[Amended by 1955 c.545 §3; 1965 c.396 §5; 1985 c.450 §1; 1987 c.295 §2; 1993 c.18 §19; 1993 c.229 §22; 1993 c.318 §11; 1997 c.167 §2; 1997 c.631 §395; 2007 c.661 §6]

 

      97.823 Prohibitions related to endowment care cemeteries. A person may not, in connection with operating an endowment care cemetery:

      (1) Employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud;

      (2) Knowingly make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit stating a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which the statements are made, not misleading;

      (3) Engage in an act, practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or

      (4) Make or file, or cause to be made or filed, to or with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, a statement, report or document that is known to be false in any material respect or matter. [2019 c.8 §5]

 

      Note: 97.823 was added to and made a part of 97.810 to 97.920 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      97.825 Suits to enforce endowed care statutes; attorney fees. (1)(a) If the cemetery authority fails to remit to the trustee or trustees, in accordance with the law, the funds herein provided for endowment and special care, or fails to expend the net income from the funds and generally care for and maintain any portion of a cemetery entitled to endowment care, any of the following may bring an action for a mandatory injunction or for an appointment of a receiver to sue for, take charge of and expend the net income:

      (A) Any three lot owners, or a lot owner’s next of kin, heir or personal representative whose lots are entitled to endowment care;

      (B) Any one lot owner, or the lot owner’s next of kin, heir or personal representative, whose lot is entitled to special care;

      (C) The district attorney of the county where a lot described in this subsection is located; or

      (D) A local government with jurisdiction over the county or municipality where a lot described in this subsection is located.

      (b) The suit may be filed in the circuit court of the county where the cemetery is located in order to compel the cemetery authority or the appointed receiver to make the expenditure of the net income from the endowment care fund for the purposes set out in ORS 97.010 to 97.040, 97.110 to 97.450, 97.510 to 97.730, 97.810 to 97.920 and 97.990.

      (2) When the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services has reason to believe that a cemetery endowment care fund does not conform to the requirement of law, or when the director has reason to believe that any cemetery is operating in violation of ORS 97.810 or 97.820, or when the director has sent an endowment care cemetery a notice of delinquency to make any report to the director required by ORS 97.810, the director shall, as soon thereafter as reasonable, give notice of the foregoing to the trustee or trustees of the cemetery endowment care fund, the cemetery authority, the Attorney General of Oregon and the State Mortuary and Cemetery Board.

      (3) Within 120 days after the receipt of such notice, the Attorney General shall institute suit in the circuit court of any county of this state in which such cemetery is located, for a mandatory injunction against further sales of graves, plots, crypts, niches, burial vaults, markers or other cemetery merchandise by such cemetery or for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the cemetery, unless the Attorney General shall prior to that time be notified by the director that such failure to conform to the requirements of the law or to report has been corrected.

      (4) The Attorney General may delay instituting any suit brought under subsection (3) of this section for no more than an additional 30 days if, in the discretion of the Attorney General after consulting with the director, it appears to the Attorney General:

      (a) That the failure to conform to the requirements of the law or to report will be corrected; and

      (b) That no harm to the public will occur during the additional 30 days.

      (5) If a trustee fails to perform the duties of the trustee under ORS 97.810 to 97.920, the trustee shall be liable for any damage resulting from that failure to any lot owners or the next of kin, heirs at law or personal representatives of such lot owners.

      (6) The court may award reasonable attorney fees, costs and disbursements to the prevailing party in an action under this section. [1955 c.545 §5; 1965 c.396 §6; 1985 c.450 §2; 1999 c.67 §1; 2001 c.796 §24; 2007 c.661 §7; 2019 c.8 §7]

 

      97.830 Investment and reinvestment of principal of endowed care funds; use and application of income. (1) The principal of all funds for endowed care shall be invested, from time to time reinvested and kept invested. If a trust agreement imposes upon the trustee or custodian the duty to direct the investment or reinvestment of endowed care funds, the trustee or custodian shall perform this duty governed by ORS 130.750 to 130.775. Otherwise, the cemetery authority, governed by ORS 130.750 to 130.775, shall direct the investment and reinvestment of endowed care funds in the time or savings deposits of the custodian bank or savings association.

      (2) The principal of invested endowed care funds shall never be voluntarily reduced, but shall be maintained separate and distinct by the trustee or custodian from all other funds except that it shall be proper to commingle endowment care funds with special care funds. The payment of charges chargeable against principal under ORS chapter 129 or of other expenses necessarily incurred in the administration of the trust in accordance with subsection (1) of this section shall not constitute a voluntary reduction of principal. The net income earned shall be used solely for the general care and maintenance of the cemetery property entitled to endowment care, as stipulated in the resolution, bylaw and other action or instrument by which the fund was established, and in such manner as the cemetery authority may from time to time determine to be in the best interests of such endowed property. Such net income shall never be used for the improvement or embellishment of undeveloped property offered for sale. [Amended by 1955 c.545 §4; 1985 c.450 §3; 1987 c.295 §3; 1995 c.157 §24; 1995 c.297 §1; 2003 c.279 §32; 2005 c.348 §125]

 

      97.835 Limitation of duties and liability of trustee. The trustee shall have no duty whatsoever to operate, maintain or to supervise the general maintenance of any endowment fund cemetery, and the trustee shall have no duty whatsoever to enforce collection of any of the trust funds either from the purchasers of lots, or from the cemetery authority, and the trustee shall have no duty whatsoever to see to the application of the net income after payment of the net income to the cemetery authority. The trustee shall be entitled to rely without liability upon the affidavit of the cemetery authority showing the amount payable to the trustee as endowment care funds. [1955 c.545 §6]

 

      97.840 Cemetery authority authorized to receive and hold gifts of property; disposition of gifts. A cemetery authority which has established an endowment care fund may take, receive and hold any property, real, personal or mixed, bequeathed, devised, granted, given or otherwise contributed to it for its endowment care fund. Within 30 days of the receipt of such contributions, the cemetery authority shall deposit, with the trustee or custodian of the fund to which the property was contributed, all moneys and all documents or instruments of title or conveyance evidencing the contribution. As soon as practicable, the cemetery authority shall provide for the sale of all property for fair market value and, within 30 days of the receipt of the proceeds thereof, shall deposit the proceeds with the trustee or custodian. The trustee or custodian shall execute all documents necessary to effect the sale, consistent with the purposes of this section. [Amended by 1987 c.295 §4]

 

      97.843 Endowment and special care funds are charitable. The endowment and special care funds and all payments or contributions to them are expressly permitted as and for charitable and eleemosynary purposes. Endowment care is a provision for the discharge of a duty from the persons contributing to the persons interred and to be interred in the cemetery and a provision for the benefit and protection of the public by preserving and keeping cemeteries from becoming unkempt and places of reproach and desolation in the communities in which they are situated. [Formerly 97.850]

 

      97.846 Agreements for care. (1) Upon payment of the purchase price, including the amount fixed as a proportionate contribution for endowed care, there may be included in the deed of conveyance, or by separate instrument, an agreement to care, in accordance with the plan adopted, for the cemetery and its appurtenances to the proportionate extent the income received by the cemetery authority from the contribution permits.

      (2) Upon the application of an owner of any plot, and upon the payment by the owner of the amount fixed as a reasonable and proportionate contribution for endowed care, a cemetery authority may enter into an agreement with the owner for the care of the plot of the owner and its appurtenances. [Formerly 97.860]

 

      97.849 Authority of Department of Consumer and Business Services to take action regarding endowment care cemetery. (1) The Department of Consumer and Business Services may, if a cemetery authority responsible for an endowment care cemetery violates a provision of ORS 97.810 to 97.920 with respect to the endowment care cemetery:

      (a) Issue an emergency order to suspend or restrict the operations of an endowment care cemetery; or

      (b) Take other action deemed necessary by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (2) After taking an action described in subsection (1) of this section, the director shall promptly provide opportunity for a hearing pursuant to ORS chapter 183.

      (a) Effective upon issuance;

      (b) Reviewable as provided in ORS 183.480; and

      (c) Enforceable in the courts of this state. [2019 c.8 §2]

 

      Note: 97.849 was added to and made a part of 97.810 to 97.920 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (d) To prevent loss, wasting, dissipation, theft or conversion of assets that should be marshaled and held available for the honoring of obligations under ORS 97.810 to 97.920; or

      (e) When the court receives proof of other grounds that the court deems good and sufficient for instituting receivership action concerning the endowment care cemetery.

      (b) Venue of receivership proceedings shall be in the county where the endowment care cemetery is located. The receiver shall be the petitioner or a person nominated by the petitioner and approved by the court. [2019 c.8 §3]

      97.860 [Renumbered 97.846 in 2019]

 

      97.865 Application of ORS 97.810 to 97.865 to religious, county and city cemeteries. (1) A cemetery authority that operates a cemetery for any religious or eleemosynary corporation, church, religious society or denomination, corporation sole administering temporalities of any church or religious society or denomination and any county or city may make an irrevocable election to have ORS 97.810 to 97.865 apply to any cemetery controlled or operated by the cemetery authority, county or city by filing a written statement indicating such action with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The statement shall be in the form prescribed by the director and shall contain the information specified by the director.

      (2)(a) When a cemetery authority, county or city files a statement described in this section with the director, ORS 97.810 to 97.865 applies to a cemetery controlled or operated by the cemetery authority, county or city beginning on the first day of the fiscal year next following the filing of the statement.

      (b) ORS 294.035 does not apply to funds held by a county or city under ORS 97.810 to 97.865. [1997 c.167 §4; 2001 c.796 §25; 2007 c.661 §8]

 

      97.870 Unused and uncared for portions of cemetery declared common nuisances. (1) In all cases where a cemetery authority has owned a site for a cemetery for more than 40 years and has during that period sold lots, subdivisions of lots, pieces or parcels of the cemetery for burial purposes and the grantee or party claiming through the grantee has not used portions of such lots, subdivisions of lots, pieces or parcels of the cemetery for purposes of burial and has not kept them free of weeds or brush, but has allowed them to remain entirely unused for more than 40 years or uncared for and unused for more than 20 years prior to the adoption of the resolution provided for in ORS 97.880, and such lots, subdivisions of lots, pieces and parcels of the cemetery are adjacent to improved parts thereof, and by reason of their uncared-for condition detract from the appearance of the cemetery and interfere with the harmonious improvement thereof, and furnish a place for the propagation of weeds and brush, thereby becoming a menace to adjacent property, such lots, subdivisions of lots, pieces and parcels of such cemetery, which are unused and uncared for as aforesaid, hereby are declared to be a common nuisance and contrary to public policy.

      (2) The provisions of this section are not applicable to portions of cemeteries which have been or are sold with agreements between the cemetery authority or its successor in interest, or both, and the grantee providing for endowment care, permanent maintenance or free care. [Amended by 1965 c.396 §7; 2007 c.661 §9]

 

      97.880 Resolution declaring a nuisance. The governing board of a cemetery authority described in ORS 97.870 may adopt a resolution declaring such unused and unimproved portion of its cemetery as is described in ORS 97.870 a common nuisance and an abandoned and unused portion of such cemetery, and may direct its officers to file the complaint described in ORS 97.890. [Amended by 1983 c.740 §9]

 

      97.890 Complaint. (1) Upon the adoption of the resolution described in ORS 97.880 the officers of the cemetery authority may file a complaint in the circuit court for the county in which the cemetery is located against the owners, holders or parties interested in such abandoned portion of its cemetery demanding that the court require such owners, holders or interested parties to keep the premises clear of weeds and brush and in condition in harmony with other lots and, if the owners, holders, or interested parties fail to appear in court and comply with the order of the court, demanding that the court make a judgment declaring such portions of the cemetery a common nuisance, directing the governing board to abate the nuisance by clearing the premises and keeping them clear of weeds and brush, creating a lien upon such lots and parcels in favor of the cemetery authority, providing that the lien be foreclosed and the lots and parcels be sold in the same manner as other sales upon execution are made and authorizing the governing board to become a purchaser thereof on behalf of the cemetery authority.

      (2) In such suit any number of owners of different lots, subdivisions of lots, pieces or parcels of the cemetery may be included in the one suit.

      (3) It is a sufficient designation of the property so abandoned and unimproved to give the lot number or portion thereof, or a description of the piece or parcel having no lot number, together with the name of the owner thereof, as appears on the record of the cemetery authority.

      (4) In addition to the names of the persons that appear on the records of the cemetery authority as the record owners of such unused and unimproved portions of the cemetery, the plaintiff shall include as a defendant in a complaint the following: “Also all other persons unknown claiming any right, title, estate, lien or interest in the unused and unimproved portions of the cemetery described in the complaint.” [Amended by 2003 c.576 §358; 2007 c.661 §10]

 

      97.900 Summons. (1) Summons shall be served upon all owners or holders who are residents of this state in like manner as in service of summons in a civil action if such owners and holders are known to the sheriff in the county in which the cemetery is located. If the defendants are not known to the sheriff, it is sufficient to serve the owners and holders whose names appear on the tax rolls of the county for the year previous to that in which the suit is started. The plaintiff is not required to mail a copy of the summons or complaint to nonresident defendants.

      (2) All owners and holders of such unimproved lots whose names do not appear on the tax rolls as aforesaid as shown by the return of the sheriff may be served by publication in any legal newspaper published in the county in which the cemetery is located for four consecutive weeks upon return of the sheriff that such owners and holders are not known and cannot be served in the jurisdiction of the sheriff.

      (3) The published summons shall contain the names of the record owners, as shown by the records of the cemetery authority, and “also all other persons unknown claiming any right, title, estate, lien or interest in the unused and unimproved portions of the cemetery described in the complaint,” together with a brief description of the lot, or subdivisions of lots, pieces or parcels of the cemetery and a statement setting forth the order and judgment described in ORS 97.890 (1) for which the plaintiff has applied to the court in the complaint. Such summons shall require all parties defendant to appear and show cause why an order should not be made declaring the unused and unimproved portions of the cemeteries to be a common nuisance, directing the cemetery authority to abate the nuisance, creating a lien thereon, providing that it be foreclosed and directing that the unused and unimproved portion of the cemetery be sold within four weeks from and after the date of the first publication thereof. [Amended by 2003 c.576 §359; 2007 c.661 §11]

 

      97.910 Disuse as prima facie evidence of abandonment. In all cases arising under ORS 97.870 to 97.900, the fact that the owner, holder or interested party, of the unused and unimproved portion of the cemetery has not, for a term of 20 years or more, used the plot and has failed to keep it clear of weeds or brush is prima facie evidence that the owner, holder or interested party has abandoned it.

 

      97.920 Judgment declaring nuisance, authorizing abatement and creating and foreclosing lien. Upon the failure of the owner of the premises to comply with the order of the court requiring proper care of the premises or upon the failure of any of the defendants to appear and answer the complaint or upon the trial of the cause, if the court finds that the allegations of the complaint are supported by the evidence and that the summons has been served as provided in ORS 97.900, the court may enter a judgment in accordance with the allegations of the complaint and the provisions of ORS 97.890 (1). [Amended by 2003 c.576 §360]

      (d) Upon presentation of proof of the death, dissolution, insolvency or merger with another of the provider of an irrevocable trust, the financial institution shall continue to hold such trust fund subject to the funeral plan trust, and upon appointment of a successor provider by the purchaser, the purchaser’s legal representative, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or a court of competent jurisdiction, the financial institution shall release such trust fund to the successor provider only as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (4) If trust funds are held in a common trust account under subsection (3) of this section, the provider shall maintain records showing the purchaser and beneficiary of each individual trust fund in the account and the allocation to each individual trust fund of interest earned by the account.

      (8) Except for an irrevocable contract described in ORS 97.939 (4), at any time prior to the death of the beneficiary of a prearrangement sales contract, the purchaser of the prearrangement sales contract may cancel the contract and is entitled to a refund of all amounts paid on the contract, all amounts in trust including earnings allocated to the contract that are in excess of all amounts paid on the contract and unallocated earnings on trust contract amounts from the date of the last allocation to the date of the refund request, less any amounts paid for merchandise already delivered or services already performed, which amounts may be retained by the certified provider as compensation.

      (b) Once commenced, construction or development shall be pursued diligently to completion. The first phase of construction must be completed within seven years of the first sale.

Such temporary facilities shall be constructed of permanent materials, and, insofar as practical, be landscaped and groomed to the extent customary in that community. The heirs, assigns or personal representative of a purchaser or beneficiary shall not be required to accept temporary underground interment space where undeveloped space contracted for was an aboveground entombment or inurnment space. In the event that temporary facilities as described in this subsection are not made available upon the death of a purchaser or beneficiary, the heirs, assigns or personal representative is entitled to a refund of the entire sales price paid plus undistributed interest attributable to such amount while in trust.

      (6) Upon completion of the phase of construction or development, section or sections of the project as certified to the depository by the certified provider and the contractor, the trust requirements shall terminate and all funds held in the preconstruction sales contract trust fund attributable to the completed phase, section or sections shall be paid to the certified provider who sold the preconstruction sales contract.

Upon certification of the default, the depository shall deliver the balance to the certified provider. The depository may rely on the certification and affidavits made to it under the provisions of ORS 97.923 to 97.949, 97.992, 97.994 and 692.180 and shall not be liable to any person for such reliance.

The fees shall be remitted to the director annually within 30 days after the end of December for all contracts that have been entered into during the 12-month period.

      (2) Except as provided in this section, the fund shall be used solely for the purpose of providing restitution to purchasers who have suffered pecuniary loss arising out of prearrangement sales contracts or preconstruction sales contracts. The fund may be used for payment of actual administrative expenses incurred in administering the fund.

      (3) The director shall administer the fund and shall adopt rules governing the payment of restitution from the fund.

      (5) The fund must not be applied toward any restitution for losses on a prearrangement sales contract or preconstruction sales contract entered into prior to September 27, 1987.

      (6) The fund must not be allocated for any purpose other than that specified in ORS 97.923 to 97.949, 97.992, 97.994 and 692.180.

      (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the payment of restitution from the fund is a matter of grace and not of right and no purchaser has vested rights in the fund as a beneficiary or otherwise.

      (9)(a) The director shall annually review the status of the fund. If the director determines that the fund together with all accumulated income earned on the fund is sufficient to cover costs of potential claims against the fund and that the total number of outstanding claims filed against the fund is less than 10 percent of the fund’s current balance, then payments to the fund may be adjusted accordingly at the discretion of the director.

      (b) If the fund’s balance falls below acceptable levels to meet future obligations, the director by rule may increase the fee or impose an assessment on certified providers.

      (c) The balance of the fund may not exceed $2 million. The director is authorized to adjust the fee or assessment as necessary to comply with this paragraph. [Formerly 128.435; 2003 c.362 §5; 2012 c.7 §11]

      (2) A donor’s revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor’s body or body part under ORS 97.959 is not a refusal and does not prohibit another person specified in ORS 97.955 or 97.965 from making an anatomical gift of the donor’s body or body part under ORS 97.957 or 97.967.

      (3) If a person other than the donor makes an unrevoked anatomical gift of the donor’s body or body part under ORS 97.957 or an amendment to an anatomical gift of the donor’s body or body part under ORS 97.959, another person may not make, amend or revoke the gift of the donor’s body or body part under ORS 97.967.

      (4) A revocation of an anatomical gift of a donor’s body or body part under ORS 97.959 by a person other than the donor does not prohibit another person from making an anatomical gift of the body or body part under ORS 97.957 or 97.967.

      (5) In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under ORS 97.955, an anatomical gift of a body part is neither a refusal to give another body part nor a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of another body part at a later time by the donor or other person.

      (6) In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under ORS 97.955, an anatomical gift of a body part for one or more of the purposes set forth in ORS 97.955 is not a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of the body part for any of the other purposes by the donor or other person under ORS 97.957 or 97.967.

      (b) When a determination to delay the recovery of an eye or tissue is made, every effort possible shall be made by the medical examiner to complete the collection of evidence or the post-mortem examination in a timely manner compatible with the preservation of the eye or tissue for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research or education.

      (c) The collection of evidence or the post-mortem examination shall occur during the normal business hours of the medical examiner and, when possible and practicable, at times other than the normal business hours of the medical examiner.
