The amendment may not change the allocations of any other units.

      (3) The board of directors shall approve the amendment unless it determines within 45 days that the reallocations are unreasonable or the relocation or elimination will impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems of the condominium or lessen the support of any portion of the condominium.

      (b) The amendment is certified by the association as being adopted in accordance with the declaration and the provisions of this section, acknowledged and recorded, notwithstanding a provision in a declaration, including a declaration recorded before January 1, 2002, that requires amendments to be executed and acknowledged by all owners approving the amendment.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 100.105 or 100.130 or this section, the declaration may be amended only with the approval of at least 75 percent of owners, or such greater percentage as may be required by the declaration.

      (4) Unless the declaration requires a greater percentage:

      (a) The declaration and plat may be amended to change a general common element to a limited common element or change the boundary of a limited common element with the approval of at least 75 percent of owners and approval of the owners of all units to which the limited common element appertains.

      (b) The declaration may be amended to change a limited common element, or portion thereof, to a general common element with the approval of the owners of all units to which the limited common element appertains and the board of directors.

      (5)(a)(A) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 100.120, 100.130, 100.515, 100.600, 100.605 and 100.625 and paragraph (b) of this subsection or other provisions of the Oregon Condominium Act, an amendment must be approved by all unit owners if:

      (ii) The amendment changes the boundary of a unit; or

      (iii) The amendment creates an additional unit from common elements or part of one or more units, or both.

      (B) An amendment under this subsection constitutes a conveyance and must include words of conveyance and, if an additional unit is created, must state the name of the grantee and unit designation. If an additional unit is created from common elements, the association is the initial grantee of the additional unit. A subsequent conveyance of the additional unit must be made by a deed certified by the association and acknowledged.

      (6) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 100.005 to 100.627, an amendment may not change the allocation of undivided interest in the common elements, the method of determining liability for common expenses, the method of determining the right to common profits or the method of determining voting rights of any unit unless such amendment has been approved by the owners of the affected units.

      (7) The declaration may not be amended to limit or diminish any right of a declarant reserved under ORS 100.105 (2) or (7) or any other special declarant right without the consent of the declarant unless the declarant waives the declarant’s right of consent.

      (8) This section does not affect any other approval that may be required by the declaration, bylaws or other instrument.

      (9) During a period of declarant control reserved under ORS 100.200, an amendment under this section must be voted on without regard to any weighted vote or other special voting allocation reserved by the declarant unless the declaration provides that the declarant has the right to exercise the voting rights with respect to specifically described amendments. Nothing in this subsection prohibits a declarant from reserving the right that declarant’s consent is required for an amendment during a period of declarant control reserved in the declaration.

      (10) An amendment to a declaration or a supplemental declaration is conclusively presumed to have been regularly adopted in compliance with all applicable procedures relating to such amendment unless an action is brought within one year after the date the amendment was recorded or the face of the recorded amendment indicates that the amendment did not receive the votes required for approval. Nothing in this subsection prevents the further amendment of an amended declaration or plat in accordance with ORS 100.005 to 100.627.

      (11) An amendment to a declaration or supplemental declaration, including an amendment under this section or ORS 100.515 (5), must conform to any format and include any additional information required by the commissioner. [Formerly 94.059; 1995 c.31 §3; 1997 c.816 §6; 1999 c.677 §70; 2001 c.756 §31; 2003 c.569 §26; 2009 c.641 §21; 2019 c.69 §9]

(1) A floating structure described in ORS 100.020 (3)(b)(D) that constitutes part of a condominium may be temporarily relocated for purposes of safety, renovation, repair or remodeling without affecting its status as a condominium or real property. However, if the floating structure is not returned to its original location within 18 months after the relocation, the condominium shall be terminated or, if there are remaining units, partially terminated pursuant to ORS 100.600 and subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) If the condominium is terminated, all security interests affecting any interest in the condominium shall continue to be considered a security in real property after the termination, notwithstanding that the floating structure portion of the condominium may be physically moved from its permanent moorage.

      (3) When a floating structure has been relocated under subsection (1) of this section, the board of directors of the association shall give written notice of the temporary location of the structure to the county assessor within 10 days of the relocation. [1997 c.816 §18]

      (c) Unless otherwise specifically provided in the declaration or supplemental declaration:

      (A) The declarant shall pay all assessments, taxes and other expenses of the variable property. If the declarant fails to pay any expenses of any variable property designated as nonwithdrawable variable property, the board of directors may elect to pay the expenses and assess the unit owners as a common expense. All costs incurred may be charged to the declarant.

      (B) Ownership or occupancy of variable property does not confer any right to use the common elements of the condominium.

      (C) Ownership or occupancy of units does not confer any right to use variable property.

      (D) Variable property is not subject to assessments for expenses of the condominium. [Formerly 94.021; 2001 c.756 §32; 2019 c.69 §10]

 

      100.155 Variable property; uses and restrictions. (1) If by the termination date specified in the declaration there is any remaining variable property:

      (a) Any property designated nonwithdrawable variable property becomes part of the common elements and any interest in the property held for security purposes is automatically extinguished by reclassification.

      (b) Any property designated withdrawable variable property is automatically withdrawn from the condominium as of the termination date.

      (c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this subsection, the association may record in the office of the recording officer in the county in which the condominium is located:

      (A) For property reclassified under paragraph (a) of this subsection, a “Statement of Reclassification of Variable Property” stating that the remaining nonwithdrawable variable property has been reclassified to common elements pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (B) For property withdrawn under paragraph (b) of this subsection, a “Statement of Withdrawal of Variable Property from Condominium” stating that remaining withdrawable variable property has been withdrawn from the condominium pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (C) Be executed by the association and acknowledged.

      (e) After recording a statement under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the association shall provide a copy of the recorded statement to the county surveyor. The original plat may not be changed or corrected after it is recorded with the county clerk.

      (2)(a) Unless expressly prohibited by the declaration, any variable property automatically withdrawn from the condominium under subsection (1)(b) of this section or voluntarily withdrawn under ORS 100.150 (1)(b) may be later annexed to the condominium by the recording of a supplemental declaration and plat in accordance with ORS 100.120 (3) if such action is first approved by at least 75 percent of all voting rights in the manner required for an amendment to the declaration.

      (b) The supplemental declaration and plat shall be executed by the association and acknowledged. Except for the termination date, the supplemental declaration must comply with ORS 100.120 (1) and (2) and must state that the annexation was approved by at least 75 percent of all voting rights.

      (3)(a) Unless expressly prohibited by the declaration and notwithstanding the termination date, the association may, with respect to any variable property automatically reclassified, exercise any rights previously held by the declarant. The exercise of any right must first be approved by at least a majority of all voting rights. All other actions relating to such reclassified general common elements are regulated and governed in like manner as other general common elements of the condominium.

      (b) If a supplemental declaration and plat is required for any action, the plat must be executed by the association and must comply with the requirements of this chapter as to a supplemental declaration and the recording of plats.

      (4) Title to any additional units created under subsection (3) of this section automatically vests in the association upon the recording of a supplemental declaration and plat. The board of directors acting on behalf of the association has the power to hold, convey, lease, encumber or otherwise deal with a unit or any interest therein in like manner as other property owned by the association.

      (5) The county clerk may charge a fee for recording a statement under this section according to provisions of ORS 205.320 (1)(d).

      (6) The county assessor shall cause the assessment and tax rolls to reflect the status of any variable property affected by automatic property reclassification under subsection (1)(a) of this section or automatically withdrawn under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (a) Is a general partner, officer, director or employee;

      (b) If a transferor retains any special declarant right, or if a successor declarant is an affiliate of the transferor, the transferor is subject to liability for all obligations and liabilities imposed on a declarant by the provisions of this chapter or by the declaration or bylaws arising after the transfer and is jointly and severally liable with the successor declarant for the liabilities and obligations of the successor declarant that relate to the special declarant rights.

      (c) A transferor who does not retain special declarant rights does not have an obligation or liability for an act or omission or for a breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.

      (3) Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liabilities and obligations of a successor declarant are as follows:

      (a) A successor declarant who is an affiliate of the transferor is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on a declarant by the provisions of this chapter or by the declaration or bylaws.

      (b) A successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor is not liable for any misrepresentations or warranties made or required to be made, including without limitation warranties required under ORS 100.185, by the declarant or previous successor declarant or for any breach of fiduciary obligation by such person. Such a successor declarant, however, shall:

      (A) Comply with any provisions of the declaration and bylaws which pertain to such successor declarant’s ownership of the unit or units and the exercise of any special declarant right;

      (B) Comply with the provisions of ORS 100.015 and 100.635 to 100.910 in connection with the sale of any unit or units, except as provided in ORS 100.665; and

      (C) Give the warranties described in ORS 100.185 only with respect to common elements or units constructed by the successor declarant.

      (4)(a) Upon transfer of any special declarant right under this section, any interest held by the transferor in the special declarant right is extinguished and the transferor has no right of recovery.

      (b) A transferor may only recover a transferred special declarant right by execution of a subsequent conveyance or other instrument that evidences an intent to convey the special declarant right from the successor declarant to the transferor. [Formerly 94.097; 2011 c.532 §8; 2017 c.112 §1]

 

      100.225 Acquisition of special declarant rights by successor declarant; exceptions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a developer, vendor under a land sale contract, mortgagee of a mortgage or beneficiary of a trust deed affecting the declarant’s interest in the property shall acquire all special declarant rights of the transferor upon transfer by the declarant or prior successor declarant of all of such transferor’s interest in the condominium, unless:

      (a) The conveyance evidences an intent not to transfer any special declarant rights;

      (b) An instrument executed by the transferor and the transferee evidences an intent not to transfer any special declarant rights and is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located; or

      (c) The transferee executes an instrument disclaiming any right to exercise any special declarant rights and such instrument is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located.

      (2) A transferee under subsection (1) of this section shall acquire less than all special declarant rights if:

      (a) The conveyance from the transferor or an instrument executed by the transferor and the transferee evidences an intent to transfer less than all special declarant rights and states the specific right being transferred, and such instrument is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located; or

      (b) The transferee executes an instrument disclaiming specific special declarant rights and the instrument is recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located.

      (3) When a transferee acquires all of the declarant’s interest in a condominium in which the declarant has reserved the right to add additional stages under ORS 100.125, the transferee shall not acquire the right to annex additional stages to the condominium unless the transferee simultaneously acquires from the declarant property adjacent to the condominium which is entitled to be annexed to the condominium, or unless the conveyance evidences an intent to transfer such right to the transferee.

      (4) A declarant or a successor declarant may transfer all or less than all of the transferor’s special declarant rights to a transferee, whether or not any interest in real property is conveyed, by an instrument executed by the declarant or successor declarant and the transferee evidencing an intent to transfer all or specific special declarant rights, which instrument shall be recorded in the office of the recording officer of every county in which the property is located. If the transfer is not subject to subsection (1) of this section, it shall also bear the written consent of any holder of a blanket encumbrance on the condominium. [Formerly 94.103]

      (3) Matters that may be voted on by written ballot shall be deemed approved or rejected as follows:

      (a) If approval of a proposed action otherwise would require a meeting at which a certain quorum must be present and at which a certain percentage of total votes cast is required to authorize the action, the proposal shall be deemed to be approved when the date for return of ballots has passed, a quorum of unit owners has voted and the required percentage of approving votes has been received. Otherwise, the proposal shall be deemed to be rejected; and

      (b) If approval of a proposed action otherwise would require a meeting at which a specified percentage of unit owners must authorize the action, the proposal shall be deemed to be approved when the percentage of total votes cast in favor of the proposal equals or exceeds the required percentage.

      (4) All solicitations for votes by written ballot shall state the following:

      (a) If approval of a proposal by written ballot requires that the total number of votes cast equal or exceed a certain quorum requirement, the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirement;

      (C) In all cases, a specified date certain on which all ballots must be returned to be counted.

      (b) If the vote is by secrecy procedure under subsection (2)(b) of this section, the period shall end on the date specified in the solicitation or any extension under paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (c) Except as otherwise provided in the declaration, articles of incorporation or bylaws, in the discretion of the board of directors, if a date certain is specified in the solicitation under subsection (4) of this section, the period may be extended by written notice of the extension given to all unit owners before the end of the specified date certain.

      (6) Except as otherwise provided in the declaration, articles of incorporation or bylaws, unless the vote is by secrecy procedure under subsection (2)(b) of this section, a written ballot may be revoked before the final return date of the ballots.

      (7) Unless otherwise prohibited by the declaration, articles of incorporation or bylaws, the votes may be counted from time to time before the final return date of the ballots to determine whether the proposal has passed or failed by the votes already cast on the date the ballots are counted.

      100.430 Unit deeds; contents. The deed of a unit shall contain:

      (1) The name of the property, and the recording index numbers and date of recording of the declaration and in the case of a staged or flexible condominium, the applicable supplemental declaration or declaration amendment.

      100.435 Insurance for individual units and common elements; fidelity bond. (1) If the bylaws provide that the association of unit owners has the sole authority to decide whether to repair or reconstruct a unit that has suffered damage or that a unit must be repaired or reconstructed, the board of directors shall obtain and maintain at all times and shall pay for out of the common expense funds, the following insurance covering both the common elements and individual units:

      (a) Property insurance including, but not limited to, fire, extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief; and

      (b) Insurance covering the legal liability of the association of unit owners, the unit owners individually and the manager including, but not limited to, the board of directors, the public and the unit owners and their invitees or tenants, incident to ownership, supervision, control or use of the property. There may be excluded from the policy required under this paragraph, coverage of a unit owner, other than coverage as a member of the association of unit owners or board of directors, for liability arising out of acts or omissions of that unit owner and liability incident to the ownership or use of the part of the property as to which that unit owner has the exclusive use or occupancy. Liability insurance required under this paragraph shall be issued on a comprehensive liability basis and shall provide a cross liability indorsement providing that the rights of a named insured under the policy do not prejudice any action against another named insured.

      (2) If the bylaws require the individual unit owners to obtain insurance for their units, the bylaws also shall contain a provision requiring the board of directors to obtain the following insurance covering the common elements:

      (a) Property insurance including, but not limited to, fire, extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief; and

      (b) Insurance covering the legal liability of the association of unit owners and the manager including, but not limited to, the board of directors, to the public or the unit owners and their invitees or tenants, incident to supervision, control or use of the property.

      (3) The board of directors shall obtain, if reasonably available, terms in insurance policies under this section that provide a waiver of subrogation by the insurer as to any claims against the board of directors of the association.

      (4) Notwithstanding a provision in the declaration or bylaws of a condominium, including a condominium created before September 27, 2007, that imposes a maximum deductible amount of $10,000 or less in an association insurance policy, if the board of directors determines that it is in the best interest of the association of unit owners and of the unit owners, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the board may adopt a resolution authorizing the association to obtain and maintain an insurance policy with a deductible amount exceeding the specified maximum, but not in excess of the greater of:

      (a) The maximum deductible acceptable to the Federal National Mortgage Association; or

      (b) $10,000.

      (5) In making the determination under subsection (4) of this section, the board of directors shall consider such factors as the availability and cost of insurance and the loss experience of the association.

      (6) If the declaration or bylaws of a condominium created before September 27, 2007, do not assign the responsibility for payment of the amount of the deductible in an association insurance policy, the board of directors may adopt a resolution that assigns the responsibility for payment of the amount of the deductible. The resolution must include, but need not be limited to:

      (a) The circumstances under which the deductible will be charged against:

      (A) A unit owner or the unit owners affected by a loss; or

      (B) All unit owners;

      (b) The allocation of the deductible charged under paragraph (a) of this subsection; and

      (7) If the board of directors adopts a resolution described in subsection (6) of this section, the resolution may require that a unit owner, in addition to any other insurance required by the declaration or bylaws, obtain and maintain:

      (a) An insurance policy that insures the unit owner’s unit and appurtenant limited common elements for not less than the amount of the deductible in the association’s insurance policy for which the unit owner may be responsible and that insures the unit owner’s personal property for any loss or damage; and

      (b) Comprehensive liability insurance that includes, but is not limited to, coverage for negligent acts of unit owners and tenants, guests of unit owners and tenants and occupants of other units for damage to the general and limited common elements, to other units and to the personal property of other persons that is located in other units or the common elements.

      (8) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration or bylaws, the board of directors may adopt a resolution that:

      (a) Prescribes a procedure for processing insurance claims. The procedure may require that all claims against the association’s insurance policy be processed through and coordinated by the board of directors or the managing agent, if authorized by the board.

      (b) Assigns the responsibility for payment of charges for handling claims, including any charges by a managing agent.

      (9) Not later than 10 days after adoption of a resolution under subsection (4), (6) or (8) of this section, the board of directors shall ensure that a copy of the resolution and a notice described in subsection (10) of this section are:

      (a) Delivered to each unit owner; or

      (b) Mailed to the mailing address of each unit owner or to the mailing address designated in writing by the unit owner.

      (10) The notice required under subsection (9) of this section shall:

      (a) Advise the unit owner to contact the unit owner’s insurance agent to determine the effect of the resolution on the unit owner’s individual insurance coverage; and

      (b) Be in a form and style reasonably calculated to inform the unit owner of the importance of the notice.

      (11) Failure to provide a copy of a resolution or a notice required under this section does not affect the responsibility of a unit owner to comply with a resolution adopted under this section.

      (12)(a) An association of unit owners shall maintain fidelity bond coverage for:

      (A) All persons with access to association funds, including directors, officers, employees, managing agents and employees of a management company or entity with which the association contracts.

      (B) Computer fraud and funds transfer fraud.

      (b) The fidelity bond required under paragraph (a) of this subsection must be in an amount that is at least equal to the combined amount of:

      (A) Funds maintained in the name of the association in accounts under ORS 100.480; and

      (B) Any obligations issued by the United States government purchased by the association under ORS 100.480.

      (13) Subsection (12) of this section applies to a condominium created before, on or after January 1, 2020.

      (14) Following the turnover meeting described in ORS 100.210, on an annual basis, with the approval of owners representing a majority of the voting rights present at a meeting, the board of directors may elect for the following year to not maintain the fidelity bond coverage required under subsection (12)(a) of this section or to maintain fidelity bond coverage in an amount less than required under subsection (12)(b) of this section. [Formerly 94.177; 1999 c.677 §50; 2007 c.409 §31; 2019 c.66 §2]

 

      100.440 Liens against property; removal from lien; effect of part payment. (1) Subsequent to recording a declaration and while the property remains subject to this chapter, no lien shall arise or be effective against the property. During such period liens or encumbrances shall arise or be created only against each unit and the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining thereto, in the same manner and under the same conditions as liens or encumbrances may arise or be created upon or against any other separate parcel of real property subject to individual ownership.

      (2) No labor performed or materials furnished with the consent or at the request of a unit owner, the agent, contractor or subcontractor of the unit owner, shall be the basis for the filing of a mechanic’s or materialman’s lien against the unit of any other unit owner not consenting to or requesting the labor to be performed or the materials to be furnished, except that consent shall be considered given by the owner of any unit in the case of emergency repairs thereto performed or furnished with the consent or at the request of the board of directors.

      (3) If a lien becomes effective against two or more units, the owner of each unit subject to such a lien shall have the right to have the unit of the owner released from the lien by payment of the amount of the lien attributable to the unit. The amount of the lien attributable to a unit and the payment required to satisfy such a lien, in the absence of agreement, shall be determined by application of the allocation established in the declaration. Such partial payment, satisfaction or discharge shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce the rights of the lienor against any unit and the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining thereto not so released by payment, satisfaction or discharge. [Formerly 94.185]

 

      100.445 Independent default clauses; option to purchase fee simple interest. Where a leasehold interest is submitted to the provisions of this chapter, the master lease shall:

      (1) Contain independent default clauses, the effect of which shall be that a unit owner cannot be evicted because the board of directors of the association of unit owners has defaulted so long as the unit owner has paid the pro rata share of the unit owner of the funds necessary to correct the default or because another unit owner has defaulted.

      (2) Contain the procedure for the submission of the fee simple interest in the property to the condominium if the lease includes an option for the unit owners to purchase the fee simple interest.

      (3) Be recorded in the office of the recording officer before the declaration for the property is recorded in accordance with ORS 100.100. [Formerly 94.190; 2001 c.756 §45]

 

      100.450 Association lien against individual unit; recording notice of claim; foreclosure; effect of judgment and payment; priority of lien. (1) Whenever an association of unit owners levies any assessment against a unit, the association of unit owners shall have a lien upon the individual unit and the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to such unit for any unpaid assessments. The lien includes interest, late charges, attorney fees, costs or other amounts levied under the declaration or bylaws. The lien is prior to a homestead exemption and all other liens or encumbrances upon the unit except:

      (a) Tax and assessment liens; and

      (b) A first mortgage or trust deed of record unless:

      (A) The condominium consists of fewer than seven units, all of which are to be used for nonresidential purposes;

      (B) The declaration provides that the lien of any mortgage or trust deed of record affecting the property shall be subordinate to the lien of the association provided under subsection (1) of this section; and

      (C) The holder of any mortgage or trust deed of record affecting the property when the declaration is recorded executes a separate subordination of the holder’s interest to the declaration which is attached as an exhibit and which states that the holder understands that the declaration subordinates the holder’s lien to the assessment lien of the association provided under subsection (1) of this section.

      (2) Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien for assessments. No further recording of a claim of lien for assessments or notice of a claim of lien under this section is required to perfect the association’s lien. The association shall record a notice of claim of lien for assessments under this section in the deed records of the county in which the unit is located before any suit to foreclose may proceed under subsection (4) of this section. The notice shall contain:

      (a) A true statement of the amount due for the unpaid assessments after deducting all just credits and offsets;

      (b) The name of the owner of the unit, or reputed owner, if known;

      (c) The name of the condominium and the designation of the unit as stated in the declaration or applicable supplemental declaration; and

      (d) A statement that if the owner of the unit thereafter fails to pay any assessments when due, as long as the original or any subsequent unpaid assessment remains unpaid, the unpaid amount of assessments automatically continue to accumulate with interest without the necessity of further recording.

      (3) The notice shall be verified by the oath of some person having knowledge of the facts and shall be recorded by the county recording officer. The record shall be indexed as other liens are required by law to be indexed.

      (4)(a) The proceedings to foreclose liens created by this section shall conform as nearly as possible to the proceedings to foreclose liens created by ORS 87.010 except, notwithstanding ORS 87.055, a lien may be continued in force for a period of time not to exceed six years from the date the assessment is due. For the purpose of determining the date the assessment is due in those cases when subsequent unpaid assessments have accumulated under a notice recorded as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the assessment and claim regarding each unpaid assessment shall be deemed to have been levied at the time the unpaid assessment became due.

      (b) The lien may be enforced by the board of directors acting on behalf of the association of unit owners.

      (c) An action to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments may be maintained without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the claim for unpaid assessments. A judgment entered on the action does not extinguish the lien. Payment on the judgment operates to satisfy the lien, or a portion of the lien, to the extent of the payment received.

      (d) An action to foreclose a lien under this section or recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments may not be maintained unless the Condominium Information Report and the Annual Report described in ORS 100.250 are designated current as provided in ORS 100.255.

      (5) Unless the declaration or bylaws provides otherwise, fees, late charges, fines and interest imposed pursuant to ORS 100.405 (4)(j), (k), (L) and (m) are enforceable as assessments under this section.

      (6) With respect to condominium units also constituting timeshare property as defined by ORS 94.803, liens created by this section shall be assessed to the timeshare owners in the timeshare property according to the method for determining each owner’s liability for common expenses under the timeshare instrument and shall be enforced individually against each timeshare owner in the condominium unit.

      (7) Notwithstanding the priority established for a lien for unpaid assessments and interest under subsection (1) of this section, the lien shall also be prior to the lien of a first mortgage or trust deed of record for the unit and the undivided interest in the common elements, if:

      (a) The association of unit owners for the condominium in which the unit is located has given the lender under the mortgage or trust deed 90 days prior written notice that the owner of the unit is in default in payment of an assessment. The notice shall contain:

      (2) Each unit owner shall be entitled to the exclusive ownership and possession of the unit of the owner. [Formerly 94.231]

 

      100.510 Units and common elements distinguished. Unless otherwise provided in the declaration:

      (1) The walls, floors and ceilings are the boundaries of a unit.

      (2) All lath, furring, wallboard, plaster-board, plaster, paneling, tiles, wallpaper, paint, finished flooring and any other materials constituting any part of the finished surfaces thereof are a part of the unit except those portions of the walls, floors or ceilings that materially contribute to the structural or shear capacity of the condominium. All other portions of the walls, floors or ceilings are a part of the common elements.

      (3) The following are a part of the unit:

      (a) All spaces, nonbearing interior partitions, interior doors and all other fixtures and improvements within the boundaries of the unit;

      (b) The glazing and screening of windows and unit access doors; and

      (c) All outlets of utility service lines, including but not limited to power, light, gas, hot and cold water, heating, refrigeration, air conditioning and waste disposal within the boundaries of the unit. [Formerly 94.237; 1999 c.677 §52; 2007 c.410 §14; 2009 c.641 §31]

 

      100.515 Interest of units in common elements. (1) Each unit shall be entitled to an undivided interest in the common elements in the allocation expressed in the declaration. Such allocation shall be expressed as a fraction or percentage of undivided interest in the common elements. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the allocation of undivided interest of each unit in the common elements as expressed in a declaration shall not be altered unless all unit owners having an interest in the particular common element agree thereto and record an amendment to the declaration setting forth the altered allocation of each unit having an interest.

      (2) The sums of the undivided interest in the common elements shall equal one if stated as fractions or 100 percent if stated as percentages.

      (3) The undivided interest in the common elements shall not be separated from the unit to which it appertains and shall be conveyed or encumbered with the unit even though such interest is not expressly mentioned or described in the conveyance or other instrument.

      (4) The common elements shall remain undivided and no unit owner shall bring any action for partition or division of any part thereof, except as provided in this chapter. Any covenant to the contrary is void.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (3) of this section, except where expressly prohibited by the declaration or bylaws, the right of use of any unit in a limited common element may be transferred to any other unit. Such transfer shall occur only if the existing unit owner and all mortgagees of the unit for which the right of use of the limited common element is presently reserved and the unit owner to whom the right of use is being transferred agree to and record an amendment to the declaration setting forth the transfer.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (3) of this section, in the case where a single unit is originally designed and constructed to be two or more separate hotel, motel or other similar living accommodations with separate bathrooms and separate entrances from a hallway, balcony, staircase or other common element, the owner, or owners, with the consent of the holder, or holders, of any recorded mortgage or lien on the unit, may separate such unit into two or more units each having such separate bathrooms and entrances from such common elements. Such persons may divide between such separate units the allocation of the common elements assigned to the original unit on substantially the basis that the square footage of such separated units bears to the total square footage of the original unit by recording an amendment to the declaration signed by such owner, or owners, of original unit together with an amendment to any plat and floor plan of such original unit recorded pursuant to ORS 100.116 showing the division thereof into such two or more units. The amendment shall comply with ORS 100.116. Such separated parts of the original unit shall not be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which such separable parts were originally designed and constructed and thereafter have generally been used. [Formerly 94.243; 2009 c.641 §47]

 

      100.520 Easement held by units and common elements.

There shall be valid easements for the maintenance of the encroaching units and common elements so long as the encroachments shall exist, and except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the rights and obligations of owners shall not be altered in any way by the encroachment.

      (3) The easement described under subsection (2) of this section does not relieve a unit owner of liability in case of willful misconduct of a unit owner or relieve a declarant or any contractor, subcontractor or materialman of liability for failure to adhere to the plat and any floor plans recorded pursuant to ORS 100.115.

      (4) The encroachments described in subsection (2) of this section shall not be construed to be encumbrances affecting the marketability of title to any unit. [Formerly 94.250; 2001 c.756 §49]

 

      100.525 Voting or consenting. (1) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, each unit of a condominium is entitled to one vote.

      (b) Whenever a unit is owned by two or more persons jointly, according to the records of the association:

      (A) Except as provided in this subsection, the vote of the unit may be exercised by any one of the owners, in the absence of protest by a co-owner. In the event of a disagreement among the co-owners, the vote of the unit shall be disregarded completely in determining the proportion of votes given with respect to the matter.

      (B) A valid court order may establish the right of co-owners’ authority to vote. [Formerly 94.255; 2001 c.756 §50; 2007 c.409 §32; 2009 c.641 §32]

 

      100.530 Allocation of common profits and expenses; liability of unit owner; limitation on assessments against declarant; deferral of assessments by declarant. (1) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, the common profits of the property are distributed among, and the common expenses are charged to, the unit owners according to the allocation of undivided interest of each unit in the common elements.

      (2) A unit owner, by the owner’s own action, may not claim exemption from liability for contribution toward the common expenses by waiving the owner’s use or enjoyment of any of the common elements or by abandoning the owner’s unit. An owner may not claim an offset against an assessment for failure of the association to perform its obligations.

      (3) Subject to subsection (4) of this section:

      (a) The declarant shall pay assessments due for operating expenses on all unsold units:

      (A) From the date of conveyance of the first unit in the condominium; and

      (c) The declarant may defer payment of accrued assessments for reserves required under ORS 100.175 for a unit until the date the unit is conveyed. However, the declarant may not defer payment of accrued assessments for reserves:

      (A) Beyond the date of the turnover meeting provided for in the bylaws in accordance with ORS 100.210; or

      (B) If a turnover meeting is not held, the date the owners assume administrative control of the association.

      (d) Failure of the declarant to deposit the balance due within 30 days after the due date constitutes a violation under ORS 100.545.

      (e) The books and records of the association shall reflect the amount the declarant owes for all reserve account assessments.

      (4)(a) The association may not assess units owned by the declarant for additional capital improvements without the written consent of the declarant as long as:

      (A) In a single stage condominium, the declarant owns more than two units or five percent of the units, whichever is greater.

      (B) In a staged or flexible condominium, the declarant owns more than two units or five percent of the units submitted to the provisions of this chapter, whichever is greater, or the termination date has not expired.

      (b) The declarant may waive the declarant’s right of consent provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (5)(a) Except with respect to assessments for reserves required by ORS 100.175, a declaration or bylaws may provide that, until the turnover meeting, the declarant may elect to defer commencement of all or part of common expense assessments as to all units in a condominium or as to all units in a stage of a condominium or as to all units created by a supplemental declaration and plat pursuant to ORS 100.150.

      (b) If a declarant so elects to defer commencement of all or part of common expense assessments, declarant shall pay as they accrue and be responsible for all or part of the common expenses attributable to the condominium or attributable to the stage of the condominium or the units and common elements created by such supplemental declaration and plat for which assessments have been deferred, until assessments commence for all common expenses.

      (5) A unit owner shall make no repair or alteration or perform any other work on the unit which would jeopardize the soundness or safety of the property, reduce the value thereof, impair any easement or hereditament or increase the common expenses of the association unless the consent of all the other unit owners affected is first obtained.

      (B) To make emergency repairs to the unit or common elements necessary for the public safety or to prevent damage to the common elements or to another unit.

      (b) Requests for entry under this subsection must be made in advance and for a reasonable time, except in the case of an emergency, when the right of entry is immediate.

      100.555 Taxation of units; exemptions; uniform appraisal and assessment; rules. (1)(a) Each unit with its allocation of undivided interest in the common elements shall be considered a parcel of real property, whether fee simple, leasehold, easement or other interest or combination thereof, subject to separate assessment and taxation by any taxing unit in like manner as other parcels of real property. A unit created by a declaration or supplemental declaration recorded with the recording officer under ORS 100.100 or 100.120 shall be assessed in the name of the unit owner.

      (2) In determining the real market value of a unit with its undivided interest in the common elements, the county assessor may use the allocation of undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to a unit as expressed in the declaration. Determination of real market value of a unit based upon a leasehold estate shall be the same as a unit in fee simple. There shall be no diminution of value by reason of the term of said lease.

      (3) Removal of the condominium or a portion thereof from the provisions of this chapter under subsections (1) or (2) of this section shall comply with all of the requirements of ORS 100.600 except that the percent of the owners required to take action shall conform only to subsections (1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.

      100.610 Common ownership of property removed from unit ownership; valuation; liens. (1) If the property is removed from the provisions of this chapter, as provided by ORS 100.600 (1) and 100.605, the property shall be considered owned in common by all the unit owners. The respective interest of a unit owner shall be the total of the fair market value of the unit of the unit owner and common element interest appertaining to such unit immediately before termination of the condominium. The proportion of any unit owner’s interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner’s unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all units and common element interests. The fair market value of each unit and common element interest appertaining to such unit shall be determined by:

      (a) Agreement of all of the unit owners; or

      (b) An independent appraiser selected by the board of directors of the association. The decision of the appraiser shall be distributed to the unit owners and shall become final unless within 15 days after the distribution, the board of directors receives written objection from at least 25 percent of the unit owners. In such event, a new appraiser shall be selected by the presiding judge for the judicial district in which the property is located. Such appraiser’s decision shall be final.

      (2) All costs and expenses incurred under subsection (1) of this section shall be common expenses.

If the property is removed from the provisions of this chapter, as provided in ORS 100.600 and 100.605, it shall be subject to an action for partition at the suit of any unit owner. The net proceeds of sale, together with the net proceeds of the insurance on the property, if any, shall be considered as one fund and shall be divided among the unit owners in proportion to their respective undivided interests as determined under ORS 100.600 and 100.610 after first paying out of the respective shares of the unit owners, to the extent sufficient for the purpose, all liens on the undivided interest in the property owned by each unit owner. [Formerly 94.312]

 

      100.620 Termination or removal no bar to resubmission. The termination of the condominium or the removal of a portion of the property from the condominium shall in no way bar its resubmission. [Formerly 94.318]

      (4) The board of directors may require the owner of the unit to be divided or converted to submit an opinion of a registered professional engineer as to whether or not the proposed division or conversion will impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems of the condominium or weaken the support of any portion of the condominium.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS

 

      100.626 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (a) The purpose of ORS 100.627 is to facilitate the installation of an electric vehicle charging station by a unit owner in a condominium for the unit owner’s personal residential use.

      (b) Oregon courts have identified the following factors in determining whether personal property is a fixture:

      (A) Whether the personal property is physically annexed to the real property;

      (B) Whether the personal property is specifically adapted to the property; and

      (C) Whether the person attaching the personal property objectively intended the personal property to become part of the real property when attached.

      (c) Oregon courts have identified the objective intent of the annexer, described in paragraph (b)(C) of this subsection, as the most important of the three factors.

      (2) Unless a unit owner and the association of unit owners, or the declarant in lieu of the association, have negotiated a different outcome, an electric vehicle charging station installed under ORS 100.627 on or before June 4, 2015, is deemed to be the personal property of the unit owner of the unit with which the charging station is associated. [2015 c.249 §5]

 

      Note: 100.626 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 100 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      100.627 Electric vehicle charging stations. (1) Notwithstanding contrary provisions of a declaration or bylaws of a condominium:

      (a) A unit owner may submit an application to install an electric vehicle charging station for the personal, noncommercial use of the unit owner, in compliance with the requirements of this section:

      (A) In a space assigned to the unit and used for the parking or storage of automobiles, trucks, boats, campers or other vehicles or equipment; or

      (B) In a limited common element with the written approval of the unit owner of each unit to which use of the limited common element is reserved.

      (b) An association of unit owners may not prohibit installation or use of a charging station installed and used in compliance with the requirements of this section.

      (2) When the unit owner complies or agrees to comply with the requirements of this section, an association of unit owners, or a declarant in lieu of the association, shall approve a completed application within 60 days after the unit owner submits the application unless the delay in approving the application is based on a reasonable request for additional information.

      (3) An association of unit owners:

      (a) May require a unit owner to submit an application before installing a charging station.

      (b) May require the charging station to meet the architectural standards of the condominium.

      (c) May impose reasonable charges to recover costs of the review and permitting of a charging station.

      (d) May impose reasonable restrictions on the installation and use of the charging station that do not significantly increase the cost of the charging station or significantly decrease the efficiency or performance of the charging station.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 479.540, the charging station must be installed by a person that holds a license, as defined in ORS 479.530, to act, at a minimum, as a journeyman electrician.

      (5) The unit owner is responsible for:

      (a) All costs associated with installation and use of the charging station, including:

      (A) The cost of electricity associated with the charging station; and

      (B) The cost of damage to general common elements, limited common elements and areas subject to the exclusive use of other unit owners that results from the installation, use, maintenance, repair, removal or replacement of the charging station.

      (b) Disclosure to a prospective buyer of the unit of the existence of the charging station and the related responsibilities of the unit owner under this section.

      (6) If the association of unit owners reasonably determines that the cumulative use of electricity in the condominium attributable to the installation and use of charging stations requires the installation of additional infrastructure improvements to provide the condominium with a sufficient supply of electricity, the association may assess the cost of the additional improvements against the unit of each unit owner that has, or will, install a charging station.

      (7) Unless the unit owner and the association of unit owners, or the declarant in lieu of the association, negotiate a different outcome:

      (a) A charging station installed under this section is deemed to be the personal property of the unit owner of the unit with which the charging station is associated; and

      (b) The unit owner must remove the charging station and restore the premises to the condition before installation of the charging station before the unit owner may transfer ownership of the unit, unless the prospective buyer of the unit accepts ownership and all rights and responsibilities that apply to the charging station under this section.

      (8)(a) A pedestal, or similar, charging station that is hard-wired into the electrical system must be a certified electrical product, as defined in ORS 479.530.

      (b) If a charging station, other than one described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, is not a certified electrical product, and the unit owner owns the charging station, the unit owner shall:

      (A) Maintain a homeowner liability insurance policy in an amount not less than $1 million that includes coverage of the charging station; and

      (B) Name the association of unit owners as a named additional insured under the policy with a right to notice of cancellation of the policy.

      (9) In any action between a unit owner and an association of unit owners to enforce compliance with this section, the prevailing party is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs. [2013 c.438 §7; 2015 c.249 §6]
