      101.010 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that continuing care retirement communities are an important and necessary alternative for the long term residential, social and health maintenance needs for many of Oregon’s senior citizens. The Legislative Assembly recognizes the need for disclosure with respect to the terms of agreements between residents, prospective residents and the provider. The Legislative Assembly also recognizes the need to establish reserves and escrow requirements to provide adequate standards for the development and operation of continuing care retirement communities. Accordingly, the Legislative Assembly has determined that these providers should be registered and should establish reserves and escrows in accordance with this chapter. [1989 c.693 §2]

      (3) In the event a prospective resident withdraws from the residency agreement prior to occupancy, the entrance fee described in ORS 101.080 may not be refunded to the prospective resident until such time as the prospective resident’s unit has been resold.

(1) Any provider that requires any resident, as a condition of occupancy or use of the facility, to pay an entrance fee, prior to or during the first six months of occupancy in addition to monthly payments, shall provide that a percentage of that entrance fee be refunded to the resident if the residency agreement is terminated, other than by reason of death of the resident, within the first six months of occupancy.

      (2) The percentage of the entrance fee to be refunded and the manner in which this percentage is calculated shall be written in boldfaced type in the residency agreement and disclosed in the initial and annual disclosure statements required by ORS 101.050 and 101.052.

However, any closed bed long term care facility which initiates under this exemption any new institutional health services, as defined in ORS 442.015, and which subsequently accepts patients who are not residents of the continuing care retirement community, shall become subject to certificate of need review for such new institutional health services at the time that nonresident patients begin to be admitted. [1989 c.693 §10; 1991 c.67 §20; 2009 c.201 §8]

[1989 c.693 §14]

 

      101.110 Revocation of registration; findings. (1) The registration of a provider shall remain in effect until revoked, after notice and hearing, upon written findings of fact by the Department of Human Services that the provider has:

      (2) Findings of fact in support of revocation, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.

      (3) If the department finds, after notice and hearing, that the provider has been guilty of a violation for which revocation could be ordered, it may first issue a cease and desist order.

A meeting described in subsection (1) of this section may be used for this purpose. At least 14 days prior to the meeting, the provider shall post in a conspicuous location and make available to each resident an agenda for the meeting. At the meeting, the provider shall make available an accounting of:

The provider may remove from the minutes information regarding any matters discussed in executive session or that relate to litigation, personnel, competitive advantage or an individual resident’s personal affairs, but may not remove information regarding the annual budget, increases in regular periodic charges, provider indebtedness or expansion in new or existing facilities. A provider shall retain the minutes for no less than three years from the date the minutes were created.

      (6) The governing body of a provider shall allow at least one resident from each CCRC operated in this state by the provider to participate as a nonvoting resident representative on the governing body or along with the owners or managers. The resident representative may be excluded from any executive session and from discussion of confidential matters or matters related to litigation, personnel, competitive advantage or an individual resident’s personal affairs. The resident representative may not be excluded from discussion of matters relating to the annual budget, increases in regular periodic charges, provider indebtedness or expansion in new or existing facilities.

      (7) The resident representative described in subsection (6) of this section and the representative’s alternate must be elected by a majority vote of the residents’ council of each CCRC or by a majority vote of all residents of a CCRC. The representative is responsible for submitting the representative’s name, address, electronic mail address and telephone number to the provider. The provider may establish the term for representatives and the procedures for election and replacement of a representative and an alternate.

      (8) A provider shall send to each resident representative and alternate, at the same time and in the same manner as other members of the governing body, owners or managers of the provider, the notice of meeting and any written materials relevant to the discussions in which the resident representative may participate under subsection (6) of this section.

      (9) The provider shall pay all reasonable travel expenses for a resident representative or alternate to attend meetings of the governing body and meetings of governing body committees.

      (10) Nothing in this chapter prohibits a provider from allowing greater resident participation than the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter including, but not limited to, the requirement:

      (a) Under subsection (1) of this section to hold meetings with the residents’ council or meetings that are open to all of the residents twice each year.
