PARENT AND CHILD RELATIONSHIP

 

      109.001 Breast-feeding in public place. A woman may breast-feed her child in a public place. [1999 c.306 §1]

 

      Note: 109.001 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 109 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      109.003 Attorney fees; intervenor. In any proceeding brought under this chapter, an authorization of attorney fees to a party also authorizes an award of attorney fees to or against any person who has appeared or intervened in the proceeding. [1997 c.90 §4; 2005 c.22 §84]

 

      109.010 Duty of support. Parents are bound to maintain their children who are poor and unable to work to maintain themselves; and children are bound to maintain their parents in like circumstances.

 

      109.012 Liability of parents for expenses and education of children. (1)(a) The expenses of a minor child and the education of the minor child are chargeable upon the property of either or both parents who have not married each other. The parents may be sued jointly or separately for the expenses and education of the minor child.

      (b) This subsection applies to a person who is asserted to be a parent of the minor child only when:

      (A) A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form has been filed in this or another state and the period for rescinding or challenging the voluntary acknowledgment on grounds other than fraud, duress or material mistake of fact has expired; or

      (B) Parentage has been established pursuant to an order or judgment entered under ORS 109.124 to 109.230 or 416.430.

      (c) As used in this subsection, “expenses of a minor child” includes only expenses incurred for the benefit of a minor child.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a parent is not responsible for debts contracted by the other parent after the separation of one parent from the other parent, except for debts incurred for maintenance, support and education of the minor child of the parents.

      (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, parents are considered separated if they are living in separate residences without intention of reconciliation at the time the debt is incurred. The court may consider the following factors in determining whether the parents are separated, in addition to other relevant factors:

      (a) Whether the parents subsequently reconciled.

      (b) The number of separations and reconciliations of the parents.

      (c) The length of time the parents lived apart.

      (d) Whether the parents intend to reconcile.

      (4) An action under this section must be commenced within the period otherwise provided by law. [2005 c.732 §2; 2017 c.651 §15]

 

      109.015 Proceedings for child support if child receives public assistance. If public assistance, as defined in ORS 416.400, is provided for any dependent child, the administrator, as defined in ORS 25.010, may initiate proceedings under ORS chapter 18, 107, 108, 109, 110 or 125 or ORS 25.010 to 25.243, 25.378, 25.402, 416.400 to 416.465, 419B.400 or 419C.590 to obtain support for the child from one or both parents or from any other person legally responsible for the support of the child, including a guardian or conservator. In any proceeding under any statute cited in this section, the obligee is a party. [1983 c.767 §2; 1985 c.671 §44c; 1991 c.67 §22; 1993 c.33 §371; 1993 c.596 §19; 1993 c.798 §45; 1995 c.608 §36; 1997 c.249 §37; 2003 c.73 §54; 2003 c.572 §14; 2003 c.576 §577b; 2007 c.643 §2]

 

      109.020 When child’s maintenance and education may be defrayed out of income of own property. If any minor, whose parent is living, has property the income of which is sufficient for the maintenance and education of the minor in a manner more expensive than the parent can reasonably afford, regard being had to the situation of the parent’s family and to all the circumstances of the case, the expenses of the maintenance and education of the minor may be wholly or partially defrayed out of the income of the property of the minor, as is judged reasonable by the court having probate jurisdiction. The charges therefor may be allowed accordingly in the settlement of the accounts of the guardian or the conservator of the minor of the estate of the minor. [Amended by 1973 c.823 §104; 2007 c.22 §6]

 

      109.030 Equality in rights and responsibilities of parents. The rights and responsibilities of the parents, in the absence of misconduct, are equal, and each parent is as fully entitled to the custody and control of the children and their earnings as the other parent. In case of the death of one parent, the other parent shall come into full and complete control of the children and their estate. [Amended by 2017 c.651 §50]

 

      109.035 Security required before foreign travel with child. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Custody order” includes any order or judgment establishing or modifying custody of, or parenting time or visitation with, a minor child as described in ORS 107.095, 107.105 (1), 107.135 or 109.103.

      (b) “Foreign country” means any country that:

      (A) Is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction;

      (B) Does not provide for the extradition to the United States of a parental abductor and minor child;

      (C) Has local laws or practices that would restrict the other parent of the minor child from freely traveling to or exiting from the country because of the race, religion, sex or sexual orientation of the other parent;

      (D) Has local laws or practices that would restrict the ability of the minor child from legally leaving the country after the child reaches the age of majority because of the race, religion, sex or sexual orientation of the child; or

      (E) Poses a significant risk that the physical health or safety of the minor child would be endangered in the country because of war, human rights violations or specific circumstances related to the needs of the child.

      (2) A court that finds by clear and convincing evidence a risk of international abduction of a minor child may issue a court order requiring a parent who is subject to a custody order and who plans to travel with a minor child to a foreign country to provide security, bond or other guarantee as described in subsection (4) of this section.

      (3) In determining whether a risk of international abduction of a minor child exists, a court shall consider the following factors involving a parent who is subject to a custody order:

      (a) The parent has taken or retained, attempted to take or retain or threatened to take or retain a minor child in violation of state law or a valid custody order and the parent is unable to present clear and convincing evidence that the parent believed in good faith that the conduct was necessary to avoid imminent harm to the parent or the child;

      (b) The parent has recently engaged in a pattern of activities that indicates the parent is planning to abduct the minor child from this country;

      (c) The parent has strong familial, emotional or cultural connections to this country or another country, regardless of citizenship or residency status; and

      (d) Any other relevant factors.

      (4) A security, bond or other guarantee required by a court under this section may include, but is not limited to, any of the following:

      (a) A bond or security deposit in an amount that is sufficient to offset the cost of recovering the minor child if the child is abducted;

      (b) Supervised parenting time; or

      (c) Passport and travel controls, including but not limited to controls that:

      (A) Prohibit the parent from removing the minor child from this state or this country;

      (B) Require the parent to surrender a passport or an international travel visa that is issued in the name of the minor child or jointly in the names of the parent and the child;

      (C) Prohibit the parent from applying for a new or replacement passport or international travel visa on behalf of the minor child; and

      (D) Require the parent to provide to a relevant embassy or consulate and to the Office of Children’s Issues in the United States Department of State the following documents:

      (i) Written notice of passport and travel controls required under this paragraph; and

      (ii) A certified copy of a court order issued under this section.

      (5) After considering the factors under subsection (3) of this section and requiring a security, bond or other guarantee under this section, the court shall issue a written determination supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law.

      (6) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the inherent power of a court in matters relating to children. [2003 c.532 §1; 2005 c.22 §85; 2007 c.100 §17]

 

      Note: 109.035 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 109 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      109.040 [Repealed by 1953 c.650 §4]

 

      109.041 Relationship between adopted child and natural and adoptive parents. (1) The effect of a judgment of adoption heretofore or hereafter granted by a court of this state shall be that the relationship, rights and obligations between an adopted person and the descendants of the adopted person and

      (a) The adoptive parents of the adopted person, their descendants and kindred, and

      (b) The natural parents of the adopted person, their descendants and kindred

shall be the same to all legal intents and purposes after the entry of such judgment as if the adopted person had been born in lawful wedlock to the adoptive parents and had not been born to the natural parents.

      (2) When a person has been or shall be adopted in this state by a stepparent, this section shall leave unchanged the relationship, rights and obligations between such adopted person and descendants of the adopted person and natural parent of the adopted person, who is the spouse of the person who adopted the person, and the descendants and kindred of such natural parent. [1953 c.650 §1; 2003 c.576 §134]

[Formerly 126.030; 2005 c.79 §4; 2007 c.250 §1; 2012 c.106 §2; 2013 c.81 §22]

 

      109.060 Legal status and legal relationships when parents not married. The legal status and legal relationships and the rights and obligations between a person and the descendants of the person, and between a person and parents of the person, their descendants and kindred, are the same for all persons, whether or not the parents have been married. [1957 c.411 §1]

      Note: 109.065 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 109 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      109.070 Presumption of parentage; establishing paternity by voluntary acknowledgment. (1) The parentage of a person is rebuttably presumed if:

      (a) The person is married to the birth mother at the time of the child’s birth, without a judgment of separation, regardless of whether the marriage is void.

      (b) The person is married to the birth mother and the child is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated by death, annulment or dissolution or after entry of a judgment of separation.

      (2) The parentage of a child established under subsection (1)(a) or (4)(a) of this section may be challenged in an action or proceeding by either spouse. The parentage may not be challenged by a person other than a spouse as long as the spouses are married and are cohabiting, unless both spouses consent to the challenge.

      (3) If the court finds that it is just and equitable, giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the child, the court shall admit evidence offered to rebut the presumption of parentage in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) The paternity of a person may be established by a voluntary acknowledgement as follows:

      (a) By the marriage of the parents of a child after the birth of the child, and the parents filing with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics the voluntary acknowledgement of paternity form as provided by ORS 432.098.

      (b) By filing with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics the voluntary acknowledgement of paternity form as provided under ORS 432.098. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (8) of this section, a filing under this paragraph establishes paternity for all purposes.

      (c) By establishment of paternity through a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity in another state.

      (5)(a) A party to a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity may rescind the acknowledgment within the earlier of:

      (A) Sixty days after filing the acknowledgment; or

      (B) The date of a proceeding relating to the child, including a proceeding to establish a support order, in which the party wishing to rescind the acknowledgment is also a party. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the date of a proceeding is the date on which an order is entered in the proceeding.

      (b) To rescind the acknowledgment, the party shall sign and file with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics a written document declaring the rescission.

      (6)(a) A signed voluntary acknowledgment of paternity filed in this state may be challenged and set aside in circuit court at any time after the 60-day period referred to in subsection (5) of this section on the basis of fraud, duress or a material mistake of fact.

      (b) The challenge may be brought by:

      (A) A party to the acknowledgment;

      (B) The child named in the acknowledgment; or

      (C) The Department of Human Services or the administrator, as defined in ORS 25.010, if the child named in the acknowledgment is in the care and custody of the department under ORS chapter 419B and the department or the administrator reasonably believes that the acknowledgment was signed because of fraud, duress or a material mistake of fact.

      (c) The challenge shall be initiated by filing a petition with the circuit court. Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, the challenge shall be conducted pursuant to the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.

      (d) The party bringing the challenge has the burden of proof.

      (e) Legal responsibilities arising from the acknowledgment, including child support obligations, may not be suspended during the challenge, except for good cause.

      (f) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the acknowledgment was signed because of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact, the court shall set aside the acknowledgment unless, giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the child, the court finds that setting aside the acknowledgment would be substantially inequitable.

      (7) Within one year after a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form is filed in this state and if blood tests, as defined in ORS 109.251, have not been completed, a party to the acknowledgment, or the department if the child named in the acknowledgment is in the care and custody of the department under ORS chapter 419B, may apply to the administrator for an order for blood tests in accordance with ORS 416.443.

      (8)(a) A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is not valid if, before the party signed the acknowledgment:

      (A) The party signed a consent to the adoption of the child by another individual;

      (B) The party signed a document relinquishing the child to a child-caring agency as defined in ORS 418.205;

      (C) The party’s parental rights were terminated by a court; or

      (D) In an adjudication, the party was determined not to be the biological parent of the child.

      (b) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (4)(a) or (b) of this section or ORS 432.098 to the contrary, an acknowledgment signed by a party described in this subsection and filed with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics does not establish paternity and is void. [1957 c.411 §2; 1969 c.619 §11; 1971 c.127 §2; 1975 c.640 §3; 1983 c.709 §37; 1995 c.79 §37; 1995 c.514 §7; 1999 c.80 §20; 2001 c.455 §17; 2003 c.576 §136; 2005 c.160 §§11,17; 2007 c.454 §1; 2016 c.106 §42; 2017 c.651 §3]

      (a) “Blood tests” has the meaning given that term in ORS 109.251.

      (b)(A) “Parentage judgment” means a judgment or administrative order that:

      (i) Expressly or by inference determines the parentage of a child, or that imposes a child support obligation based on the parentage of a child; and

      (ii) Resulted from a proceeding in which blood tests were not performed and the issue of parentage was not challenged.

      (B) “Parentage judgment” does not include a judgment or administrative order that determines paternity or parentage of a child conceived by assisted reproduction as defined in ORS 109.239.

      (c) “Petition” means a petition or motion filed under this section.

      (d) “Petitioner” means the person filing a petition or motion under this section.

      (2)(a) The following may file in circuit court a petition to vacate or set aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment, including any child support obligations established in the parentage judgment, and for a judgment of nonparentage:

      (A) A party to the parentage judgment.

      (B) The Department of Human Services if the child is in the care and custody of the Department of Human Services under ORS chapter 419B.

      (C) The Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice if the child support rights of the child or of one of the parties to the parentage judgment have been assigned to the state.

      (b) The petitioner may file the petition in the circuit court proceeding in which the parentage judgment was entered, in a related proceeding or in a separate action. The petitioner shall attach a copy of the parentage judgment to the petition.

      (c) If the ground for the petition is that the parentage determination was obtained by or was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, the petitioner may not file the petition more than one year after entry of the parentage judgment.

      (d) If the ground for the petition is that the parentage determination was obtained by or was the result of fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party, the petitioner may not file the petition more than one year after the petitioner discovers the fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct.

      (3) In the petition, the petitioner shall:

      (a) Designate as parties:

      (A) All persons who were parties to the parentage judgment;

      (B) The child if the child is a child attending school, as defined in ORS 107.108;

      (C) The Department of Human Services if the child is in the care and custody of the Department of Human Services under ORS chapter 419B; and

      (D) The Administrator of the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice if the child support rights of the child or of one of the parties to the parentage judgment have been assigned to the state.

      (b) Provide the full name and date of birth of the child whose parentage was determined by the parentage judgment.

      (c) Allege the facts and circumstances that resulted in the entry of the parentage judgment and explain why the issue of parentage was not contested.

      (4) After filing a petition under this section, the petitioner shall serve a summons and a true copy of the petition on all parties as provided in ORCP 7.

      (5) The court, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, may appoint counsel for the child. However, if requested to do so by the child, the court shall appoint counsel for the child. A reasonable fee for an attorney so appointed may be charged against one or more of the parties or as a cost in the proceeding, but may not be charged against funds appropriated for public defense services.

      (6) The court may order the mother, the child and the person whose parentage of the child was determined by the parentage judgment to submit to blood tests. In deciding whether to order blood tests, the court shall consider the interests of the parties and the child and, if it is just and equitable to do so, may deny a request for blood tests. If the court orders blood tests under this subsection, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the costs of the blood tests.

      (7) Unless the court finds, giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the child, that to do so would be substantially inequitable, the court shall vacate or set aside the parentage determination of the parentage judgment, including provisions imposing child support obligations, and enter a judgment of nonparentage if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:

      (a) The parentage determination was obtained by or was the result of:

      (A) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect; or

      (B) Fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party;

      (b) The mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct was discovered by the petitioner after the entry of the parentage judgment; and

      (c)(A) Blood tests establish that the person is not the biological parent of the child and the parentage determination was based on biological parentage; or

      (B) The parentage determination was not based on biological parentage.

      (8) If the court finds that the parentage determination of a parentage judgment was obtained by or was the result of fraud, the court may vacate or set aside the parentage determination regardless of whether the fraud was intrinsic or extrinsic.

      (9) If the court finds, based on blood test evidence, that the person may be the biological parent of the child and that the cumulative paternity or parentage index based on the blood test evidence is 99 or greater, the court shall deny the petition.

      (10) The court may grant the relief authorized by this section upon a party’s default, or by consent or stipulation of the parties, without blood test evidence.

      (11) A judgment entered under this section vacating or setting aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment and determining nonparentage:

      (a) Shall contain the full name and date of birth of the child whose parentage was established or declared by the parentage judgment.

      (b) Shall vacate and terminate any ongoing and future child support obligations arising from or based on the parentage judgment.

      (c) May vacate or deem as satisfied, in whole or in part, unpaid child support obligations arising from or based on the parentage judgment.

      (d) May not order restitution from the state for any sums paid to or collected by the state for the benefit of the child.

      (12) If the court vacates or sets aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment under this section and enters a judgment of nonparentage, the petitioner shall send a court-certified true copy of the judgment entered under this section to the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics and to the Department of Justice as the state disbursement unit. Upon receipt of the court-certified true copy of the judgment entered under this section, the state registrar shall correct any records maintained by the state registrar that indicate that the party to the parentage judgment is the parent of the child.

      (13) The court may award to the prevailing party a judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs, including the cost of any blood tests ordered by the court and paid by the prevailing party.

      (14) A judgment entered under this section vacating or setting aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment and determining nonparentage is not a bar to further proceedings to determine parentage, as otherwise allowed by law.

      (15) If a person whose parentage of a child has been determined by a parentage judgment has died, an action under this section may not be initiated by or on behalf of the estate of the person.

      (16) This section does not limit the authority of the court to vacate or set aside a judgment under ORCP 71, to modify a judgment within a reasonable period, to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, to vacate or set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court or to render a declaratory judgment under ORS chapter 28.

      (17) This section shall be liberally construed to the end of achieving substantial justice. [2007 c.454 §9; 2017 c.651 §16]

      109.090 Interpretation of ORS 109.060 to 109.090. (1) The provisions of ORS 109.060 to 109.090 shall apply to all persons, irrespective of whether they are born before or after August 20, 1957. ORS 109.060 to 109.090 shall not be construed to affect a decree of distribution entered, or any probate proceeding closed, prior to August 20, 1957.

      (2) ORS 109.060 to 109.090 shall be liberally construed, with the view of effectuating their objects, notwithstanding the rule of common law that statutes in derogation thereof are to be strictly construed. [1957 c.411 §§5,6; 1983 c.740 §11]

 

      109.092 Obligation to recognize responsibility for conception; mother surrendering child for adoption. When it is determined that a woman is pregnant with a child, the woman and any man to whom she is not married and with whom she engaged in sexual intercourse at approximately the time of conception have an obligation to recognize that the man may be the other person responsible for the conception. During the months of pregnancy, the man may join the woman in acknowledging paternity and assuming the rights and duties of expectant parenthood. If the man acknowledges paternity of the expected child and the woman denies that he is the father or refuses to join him in acknowledging paternity, the man may seek relief under ORS 109.125. If the woman wants the man to join her in acknowledging his paternity of the expected child and the man denies that he is the father or refuses to join her in acknowledging paternity, the woman may seek relief under ORS 109.125. If after the birth of the child the mother decides to surrender the child for adoption and paternity has not been acknowledged as provided in ORS 109.065 (1)(e) or the putative father has not asserted his rights in filiation proceedings, the mother has the right without the consent of the father to surrender the child as provided in ORS 418.270 or to consent to the child’s adoption. [1975 c.640 §2; 1995 c.514 §17; 2005 c.160 §§13,19; 2017 c.651 §18]

 

      109.094 Rights of parent when parentage established; procedure when parentage established. Upon the parentage of a child being established in the proceedings, a parent shall have the same rights as a parent who is or was married to the mother of the child. The clerk of the court shall certify the fact of parentage to the Center for Health Statistics of the Oregon Health Authority, and the Center for Health Statistics shall amend a record of live birth for the child and issue a new certified copy of the record of live birth for the child. [1975 c.640 §6; 1983 c.709 §38; 2009 c.595 §67; 2013 c.366 §56; 2017 c.651 §19]

 

      109.096 Notice to putative father when parentage not established. (1) When the parentage of a child has not been established under ORS 109.065, the putative father is entitled to reasonable notice in adoption or other court proceedings concerning the custody of the child, except for juvenile court proceedings, if the petitioner knows, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have known:

      (a) That the child resided with the putative father at any time during the 60 days immediately preceding the initiation of the proceeding, or at any time since the child’s birth if the child is less than 60 days old when the proceeding is initiated; or

      (b) That the putative father repeatedly has contributed or tried to contribute to the support of the child during the year immediately preceding the initiation of the proceeding, or during the period since the child’s birth if the child is less than one year old when the proceeding is initiated.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) or (4) of this section, a verified statement of the mother of the child or of the petitioner, or an affidavit of another person with knowledge of the facts, filed in the proceeding and asserting that the child has not resided with the putative father, as provided in subsection (1)(a) of this section, and that the putative father has not contributed or tried to contribute to the support of the child, as provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section, is sufficient proof to enable the court to grant the relief sought without notice to the putative father.

      (3) The putative father is entitled to reasonable notice in a proceeding for the adoption of the child if notice of the initiation of filiation proceedings as required by ORS 109.225 was on file with the Center for Health Statistics of the Oregon Health Authority prior to the child’s being placed in the physical custody of a person or persons for the purpose of adoption by them. If the notice of the initiation of filiation proceedings was not on file at the time of the placement, the putative father is barred from contesting the adoption proceeding.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the putative father is entitled to reasonable notice in court proceedings concerning the custody of the child, other than juvenile court proceedings, if notice of the initiation of filiation proceedings as required by ORS 109.225 was on file with the Center for Health Statistics prior to the initiation of the proceedings.

      (5) Notice under this section is not required to be given to a putative father who was a party to filiation proceedings under ORS 109.125 that were dismissed or resulted in a finding that he was not the father of the child.

      (6) The notice required under this section shall be given in the manner provided in ORS 109.330.

      (7) No notice given under this section need disclose the name of the mother of the child.

      (8) A putative father has the primary responsibility to protect his rights, and nothing in this section shall be used to set aside an act of a permanent nature including, but not limited to, adoption or termination of parental rights, unless the father establishes within one year after the entry of the final judgment or order fraud on the part of a petitioner in the proceeding with respect to matters specified in subsections (1) to (5) of this section. [1975 c.640 §7; 1979 c.491 §1; 1983 c.709 §39; 1995 c.90 §1; 2003 c.576 §137; 2005 c.160 §5; 2009 c.595 §68; 2017 c.651 §20]

 

      109.098 Objection of putative father in proceeding referred to in ORS 109.096; effect of failure to appear and object. (1) If a putative father of a child by due appearance in a proceeding of which he is entitled to notice under ORS 109.096 objects to the relief sought, the court:

      (a) May stay the adoption or other court proceeding to await the outcome of the filiation proceedings only if notice of the initiation of filiation proceedings was on file as required by ORS 109.096 (3) or (4).

      (b) Shall, if filiation proceedings are not pending, inquire as to the paternity of the child, the putative father’s past endeavors to fulfill his obligation to support the child and to contribute to the pregnancy-related medical expenses, the period that the child has lived with the putative father, the putative father’s fitness to care for and rear the child and whether the putative father is willing to be declared the father of the child and to assume the responsibilities of a father.

      (2) If after inquiry under subsection (1)(b) of this section the court finds:

      (a) That the putative father is the father of the child and is fit and willing to assume the responsibilities of a father, it shall have the power:

      (A) Upon the request of the putative father, to declare his paternity and to certify the fact of paternity in the manner provided in ORS 109.094; and

      (B) To award custody of the child to either parent as may be in the best interests of the child, or to take any other action which the court may take if the parents are or were married to each other.

      (b) That the putative father is not the father of the child, it may grant the relief sought in the proceeding without the putative father’s consent.

      (c) That the putative father is the natural father of the child but is not fit or willing to assume the responsibilities of a father, it may grant the relief sought in the proceeding or any other relief that the court deems to be in the best interests of the child, notwithstanding the father’s objection.

      (3) If a putative father of a child is given the notice of a proceeding required by ORS 109.096 and he fails to enter due appearance and to object to the relief sought therein within the time specified in the notice, the court may grant the relief sought without the putative father’s consent. [1975 c.640 §8; 1995 c.90 §2; 2005 c.160 §6; 2017 c.651 §21]

 

      109.100 Petition for support; effect of judgment; parties. (1) Any minor child or the administrator may, in accordance with ORCP 27 A, apply to the circuit court in the county in which the child resides, or in which the natural or adoptive father or mother of the child may be found, for an order upon the child’s father or mother, or both, to provide for the child’s support. The child or the administrator may apply for the order by filing in the county a petition setting forth the facts and circumstances relied upon for the order. If satisfied that a just cause exists, the court shall direct that the father or mother appear at a time set by the court to show cause why an order of support should not be entered in the matter.

      (2) The petitioner shall state in the petition, to the extent known:

      (a) Whether there is pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the minor child, including a proceeding brought under ORS 25.287, 107.085, 107.135, 107.431, 108.110, 109.103, 109.165, 125.025, 416.400 to 416.465, 419B.400 or 419C.590 or ORS chapter 110; and

      (b) Whether there exists in this state or any other jurisdiction a support order, as defined in ORS 110.503, involving the minor child.

      (3) The petitioner shall include with the petition a certificate regarding any pending support proceeding and any existing support order. The petitioner shall use a certificate that is in a form established by court rule and include information required by court rule and subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) The judgment of a court under subsection (1) of this section is final as to any installment or payment of money that has accrued up to the time either party makes a motion to set aside, alter or modify the judgment, and the court may not set aside, alter or modify the judgment, or any portion thereof, that provides for any payment of money that has accrued prior to the filing of the motion.

      (5) The provisions of ORS 108.120 apply to proceedings under subsection (1) of this section.

      (6) In any proceeding under this section, both the child’s physical and legal custodians are parties to the action. [1963 c.497 §2; 1975 c.458 §14; 1979 c.90 §2; 1979 c.284 §100; 1989 c.812 §7; 1993 c.596 §20; 2003 c.73 §55a; 2003 c.116 §8; 2003 c.576 §244; 2011 c.595 §124; 2015 c.298 §93]

 

      109.103 Proceeding to determine custody or support of child. (1) If a child is born to an unmarried person and parentage has been established under ORS 109.065, or if a child is born to a married person by a person other than the birth mother’s spouse and parentage between the person and the child has been established under ORS 109.065, either parent may initiate a civil proceeding to determine the custody or support of, or parenting time with, the child. The proceeding shall be brought in the circuit court of the county in which the child resides or is found or in the circuit court of the county in which either parent resides. The parents have the same rights and responsibilities regarding the custody and support of, and parenting time with, their child that married or divorced parents would have, and the provisions of ORS 107.094 to 107.449 that relate to custody, support and parenting time, the provisions of ORS 107.755 to 107.795 that relate to mediation procedures, and the provisions of ORS 107.810, 107.820 and 107.830 that relate to life insurance, apply to the proceeding.

      (10) As used in this section:

      (a) “Child-parent relationship” means a relationship that exists or did exist, in whole or in part, within the six months preceding the filing of an action under this section, and in which relationship a person having physical custody of a child or residing in the same household as the child supplied, or otherwise made available to the child, food, clothing, shelter and incidental necessaries and provided the child with necessary care, education and discipline, and which relationship continued on a day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay and mutuality, that fulfilled the child’s psychological needs for a parent as well as the child’s physical needs. However, a relationship between a child and a person who is the nonrelated foster parent of the child is not a child-parent relationship under this section unless the relationship continued over a period exceeding 12 months.

The testimony of the parent or expectant parent and the corroborating evidence may be presented by affidavit. [1969 c.619 §4; 1975 c.640 §14; 1983 c.762 §4; 2017 c.651 §23]

      109.155 Hearing; order for payment for support of child and other costs; policy regarding settlement; enforcement of settlement terms; remedies. (1) The court, in a private hearing, shall first determine the issue of parentage. If the respondent admits the parentage, the admission shall be reduced to writing, verified by the respondent and filed with the court.

      (2) If the court finds, from a preponderance of the evidence, that the petitioner or the respondent is the father of the child who has been, or who may be born out of wedlock, the court shall then proceed to a determination of the appropriate relief to be granted.

      (5) An affidavit certifying the authenticity of documents substantiating expenses set forth in subsection (4) of this section is prima facie evidence to establish the authenticity of the documents.

      (6)(a) It is the policy of this state:

      (A) To encourage the settlement of cases brought under this section; and

      (B) For courts to enforce the terms of settlements described in paragraph (b) of this subsection to the fullest extent possible, except when to do so would violate the law or would clearly contravene public policy.

      (b) In a proceeding under this section, the court may enforce the terms set forth in a stipulated judgment of parentage signed by the parties, a judgment of parentage resulting from a settlement on the record or a judgment of parentage incorporating a settlement agreement:

      (A) As contract terms using contract remedies;

      (B) By imposing any remedy available to enforce a judgment, including but not limited to contempt; or

      (C) By any combination of the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph.

      (c) A party may seek to enforce an agreement and obtain remedies described in paragraph (b) of this subsection by filing a motion, serving notice on the other party in the manner provided by ORCP 7 and, if a remedy under paragraph (b)(B) of this subsection is sought, complying with the statutory requirements for that remedy. All claims for relief arising out of the same acts or omissions must be joined in the same proceeding.

      (d) Nothing in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection limits a party’s ability, in a separate proceeding, to file a motion to set aside, alter or modify a judgment under ORS 109.165 or to seek enforcement of an ancillary agreement to the judgment.

      (7) If parentage between a person and a child has been established under ORS 109.065 and the parentage has not been disestablished before proceedings are initiated under ORS 109.125, the court may not render a judgment under ORS 109.124 to 109.230 establishing parentage between another person and the child unless the judgment also disestablishes the parentage established under ORS 109.065.

As to any installment or payment of money that has accrued up to the time the nonmoving party, other than the state, is served with a motion to set aside, alter or modify the judgment, the judgment is final and the court may not change it. However, the court may allow a credit against child support arrearages for periods of time, excluding reasonable parenting time unless otherwise provided by order or judgment, during which the obligor, with the knowledge and consent of the obligee or pursuant to court order, has physical custody of the child. A child attending school is a party for purposes of this section.

      (2) The moving party shall state in the motion, to the extent known:

      (a) Whether there is pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the child, including a proceeding brought under ORS 25.287, 109.100, 125.025, 416.400 to 416.465, 419B.400 or 419C.590 or ORS chapter 110; and

      (b) Whether there exists in this state or any other jurisdiction a support order, as defined in ORS 110.503, involving the child, other than the judgment the party is moving to set aside, alter or modify.

      (3) The moving party shall include with the motion a certificate regarding any pending support proceeding and any existing support order other than the judgment the party is moving to set aside, alter or modify. The party shall use a certificate that is in a form established by court rule and include information required by court rule and subsection (2) of this section.

      (4)(a) It is the policy of this state:

      (A) To encourage the settlement of cases brought under this section; and

      (B) For courts to enforce the terms of settlements described in paragraph (b) of this subsection to the fullest extent possible, except when to do so would violate the law or would clearly contravene public policy.

      (b) In a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, the court may enforce the terms set forth in a stipulated order or judgment signed by the parties, an order or judgment resulting from a settlement on the record or an order or judgment incorporating a settlement agreement:

      (A) As contract terms using contract remedies;

      (B) By imposing any remedy available to enforce an order or judgment, including but not limited to contempt; or

      (C) By any combination of the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph.

      (c) A party may seek to enforce an agreement and obtain remedies described in paragraph (b) of this subsection by filing a motion, serving notice on the other party in the manner provided by ORCP 7 and, if a remedy under paragraph (b)(B) of this subsection is sought, complying with the statutory requirements for that remedy. All claims for relief arising out of the same acts or omissions must be joined in the same proceeding.

      (d) Nothing in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection limits a party’s ability, in a separate proceeding, to file a motion to modify an order or judgment under subsection (1) of this section or to seek enforcement of an ancillary agreement to the order or judgment.

      109.170 [Repealed by 1969 c.619 §15]

 

      109.175 Determination of legal custody after parentage established. (1) If parentage of a child born out of wedlock is established pursuant to a petition filed under ORS 109.125 or an order or judgment entered pursuant to ORS 109.124 to 109.230 or ORS 416.400 to 416.465, or if parentage is established by the filing of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity as provided by ORS 109.065 (1)(e), the parent with physical custody at the time of filing of the petition or the notice under ORS 416.415, or the parent with physical custody at the time of the filing of the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, has sole legal custody until a court specifically orders otherwise. The first time the court determines who should have legal custody, neither parent shall have the burden of proving a change of circumstances. The court shall give primary consideration to the best interests and welfare of the child and shall consider all the standards set out in ORS 107.137.

UNIFORM ACT ON BLOOD TESTS TO DETERMINE PATERNITY

 

      109.250 Short title. ORS 109.250 to 109.262 may be cited as the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity. [1953 c.628 §7]

 

      109.251 “Blood tests” defined. As used in ORS 109.250 to 109.262, “blood tests” includes any test for genetic markers to determine parentage of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation bodies designated by the Oregon Health Authority in compliance with the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, and performed by a laboratory approved by such accreditation body. “Blood tests” includes but is not limited to the Human Leucocyte Antigen Test, the deoxyribonucleic acid test and any test that extracts genetic material from any human tissue. [1981 c.401 §2; 1995 c.608 §5; 1999 c.80 §24; 2009 c.595 §70; 2017 c.651 §26]

 

      109.252 Authority for blood test; effect of refusal to submit to test; payment for test. (1) Unless the court or administrator finds good cause not to proceed in a proceeding under ORS 109.125 to 109.230 and 416.400 to 416.465, in which parentage is a relevant fact, the court or administrator, as defined in ORS 25.010, upon the court’s or administrator’s own initiative or upon suggestion made by or on behalf of any person whose blood is involved may, or upon motion of any party to the action made at a time so as not to delay the proceedings unduly shall, order the mother, child, alleged father and any other named respondent who may be the father to submit to blood tests. If any person refuses to submit to such tests, the court or administrator may resolve the question of parentage against such person or enforce the court’s or administrator’s order if the rights of others and the interests of justice so require.

      (2) When child support enforcement services are being provided under ORS 25.080, the Child Support Program shall pay any costs for blood tests subject to recovery from the party who requested the tests. If the original test result is contested prior to the entry of an order establishing parentage, the court or administrator shall order additional testing upon request and advance payment by the party making the request. [1953 c.628 §1; 1969 c.619 §13; 1983 c.762 §7; 1985 c.671 §43; 1999 c.80 §25; 2001 c.455 §18; 2007 c.71 §28; 2017 c.651 §27]

 

      109.254 Selection of experts to make tests; admissible evidence. (1) The tests shall be made by experts qualified as examiners of genetic markers who shall be appointed by the court or administrator, as defined in ORS 25.010. Any party or person at whose suggestion the tests have been ordered may demand that other experts, qualified as examiners of genetic markers, perform independent tests under order of the court or administrator, the results of which may be offered in evidence. The number and qualifications of such experts shall be determined by the court or administrator.

      (2) The blood test results and the conclusions and explanations of the blood test experts are admissible as evidence of parentage without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless a written challenge to the testing procedure or the results of the blood test has been filed with the court and delivered to opposing counsel at least 10 days before any hearing set to determine the issue of parentage. Failure to make such timely challenge constitutes a waiver of the right to have the experts appear in person and is not grounds for a continuance of the hearing to determine parentage. A copy of the results, conclusions and explanations must be furnished to both parties or their counsel at least 20 days before the date of the hearing for this subsection to apply. The court for good cause or the parties may waive the time limits established by this subsection.

      (3) An affidavit documenting the chain of custody of the specimens is prima facie evidence to establish the chain of custody. [1953 c.628 §2; 1981 c.401 §3; 1985 c.671 §44; 1999 c.80 §26; 2001 c.455 §19; 2017 c.651 §28]

 

      109.256 Compensation of experts. (1) The compensation of each expert witness appointed by the court or administrator shall be fixed at a reasonable amount. It shall be paid as the court or administrator shall order. The court or administrator may order that the costs of blood tests be paid by the parties in such proportions and at such times as it shall prescribe, or that the proportion of any party be paid by the county in which the proceedings are had, and that, after payment by the parties or such county or both, all or part or none of it be taxed as costs in the action.

      (2) The fee of an expert witness called by a party but not appointed by the court or administrator shall be paid by the party calling the witness but shall not be taxed as costs in the action. [1953 c.628 §3; 1983 c.762 §8; 1985 c.671 §44a]

 

      109.258 Effect of test results. A disputable presumption of paternity is created if one or more blood tests result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater. If the court or administrator finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly. If the experts disagree in their findings or conclusions, the question shall be submitted upon all the evidence. [1953 c.628 §4; 1985 c.671 §44b; 1999 c.80 §27]

 

      109.259 Temporary child support pending determination of parentage. Notwithstanding the objections of a party to an order that seeks to establish parentage, if the blood tests conducted under ORS 109.250 to 109.262 result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater, the evidence of the blood tests together with the testimony of a parent is a sufficient basis upon which to presume paternity for establishing temporary support. Upon the motion of a party, the court shall enter a temporary order requiring the alleged father to provide support pending the determination of parentage by the court. In determining the amount of support, the court shall use the formula established under ORS 25.275. [1997 c.746 §24b; 1999 c.80 §88; 2017 c.651 §29]

 

      Note: 109.259 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 109 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      109.260 Applicability to criminal actions for nonsupport. ORS 109.250 to 109.262 apply to criminal cases for nonsupport under ORS 163.555 subject to the following limitations and provisions:

      (1) An order for the tests shall be made only upon application of a party or on the court’s initiative.

      (2) The compensation of the experts shall be paid by the county in which the proceedings are had under order of court.

      (3) The court may direct a verdict of acquittal upon the conclusions of all the experts under the provisions of ORS 109.258, otherwise the case shall be submitted for determination upon all evidence. [1953 c.628 §5; 2011 c.259 §1]

 

      109.262 Uniformity of interpretation. The Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact it. [1953 c.628 §6]

 

      109.264 Parties. In any action under ORS 109.250 to 109.262, the mother, the putative father, if any, the alleged parent and the state are parties. [1993 c.596 §23; 2017 c.651 §30]

 

ADOPTION

 

      109.304 Definitions for ORS 109.305 to 109.410. As used in ORS 109.305 to 109.410, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Home study” means a written report documenting the result of an assessment conducted by the Department of Human Services, a licensed adoption agency or other public agency to evaluate the suitability of a prospective adoptive parent or parents to adopt.

      (2) “Placement report” means a written report prepared by the department or by an Oregon licensed adoption agency after the petition for adoption has been filed that includes the department’s or the agency’s recommendation to the court concerning whether the court should grant the petition for adoption based upon the department’s or the agency’s evaluation of:

      (a) The status and adjustment of the child; and

      (b) The status and adjustment of the child’s prospective adoptive parent.

      (3) “Records, papers and files” means all documents, writings, information, exhibits and other filings retained in the court’s record of an adoption case pursuant to ORS 109.319, and includes but is not limited to the Adoption Summary and Segregated Information Statement described in ORS 109.317, and exhibits attached to the statement, the petition and exhibits attached to the petition pursuant to ORS 109.315, and any other motion, judgment, document, writing, information, exhibit or filing retained in the court’s record of the adoption case. [1993 c.717 §8; 2013 c.346 §1]

 

      109.305 Interpretation of adoption laws; agreement for continuing contact. (1) The rule that statutes in derogation of common law are to be strictly construed does not apply to the adoption laws of this state.

      (2) An adoptive parent and a birth parent may enter into a written agreement, approved by the court, to permit continuing contact between the birth relatives and the child or adoptive parents.

      (3) If the child is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B.100, an adoptive parent and a birth relative may enter into a written agreement, approved by the court, to permit continuing contact between the birth relatives and the child or adoptive parents. A birth relative that enters into an agreement under this subsection must have established emotional ties creating an ongoing personal relationship, as defined in ORS 109.119, with the child. If the child is under one year of age, the ongoing personal relationship between the birth relative and the child must have continued for at least half of the child’s life.

      (4) If the child is 14 years of age or older, an agreement made under this section may not be entered into without the consent of the child.

      (5) As used in this section, “birth relative” includes a birth parent, grandparent, sibling and other member of the child’s birth family.

      (6) The court may show approval of an agreement made under this section by incorporating the agreement by reference and indicating the court’s approval of the agreement in the adoption judgment.

      (7) Failure to comply with the terms of an agreement made under this section is not grounds for setting aside an adoption judgment or revocation of a written consent to an adoption.

      (8)(a) An agreement made under this section may be enforced by a civil action. However, before a court may enter an order requiring compliance with the agreement, the court must find that the party seeking enforcement participated, or attempted to participate, in good faith in mediating the dispute giving rise to the action prior to filing the civil action.

      (b) The court may modify an agreement made under this section if the court finds that the modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the adopted child, that the party seeking modification participated, or attempted to participate, in good faith in mediation prior to seeking modification of the agreement and that:

      (A) The modification is agreed to by all parties to the original agreement; or

      (B) Exceptional circumstances have arisen since the parties entered into the agreement that justify modification of the agreement.

      (9) The Department of Human Services is not responsible for any costs associated with an agreement described in subsection (3) of this section. [1957 c.710 §15; subsections (2), (3) and (4) of 1993 Edition enacted as 1993 c.401 §1; 2003 c.576 §142; 2007 c.720 §1]

 

      Note: 109.305 (7) and (8) were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 109 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      109.306 Rules regarding home studies and placement reports. (1) Rules adopted by the Department of Human Services for home studies and placement reports under ORS 109.309 (7) and (8) must, at a minimum, require the department to:

      (a) Consider each prospective adoptive parent on the basis of the prospective adoptive parent’s ability to meet the individual needs of the child for safety, attachment and well-being;

      (b) Safeguard a child’s rights under ORS 419B.090 (3) by considering a child’s relatives and current caretaker as having equal status and priority as prospective adoptive parents in the consideration of each of the relative’s and current caretaker’s respective abilities to meet the child’s individual needs for safety, attachment and well-being; and

      (c) Give a child’s relatives and current caretaker a greater weight in the consideration of suitability as prospective adoptive parents as compared to the department’s consideration of other persons seeking to adopt a child who are not relatives or current caretakers.

      (2) For purposes of this section, “current caretaker” has the meaning given that term in ORS 419A.004. [2015 c.795 §5]

 

      Note: Section 12 (1), chapter 795, Oregon Laws 2015, provides:

      Sec. 12. (1) Section 5 of this 2015 Act [109.306] and the amendments to ORS 109.309, 419A.004, 419B.090 and 419B.395 by sections 1 to 4 of this 2015 Act apply to:

      109.307 Court required to act within six months of filing of petition for adoption; duty of clerk. (1) Not earlier than provided in ORS 109.309 and not later than six months from the date on which the petition for leave to adopt another is filed under ORS 109.309, the court before which the petition is pending shall hold a hearing and shall:

      (a) Enter a judgment under ORS 109.350;

      (b) Continue the guardianship or legal custodial status of the child;

      (c) Waive the child to a court having jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 or 419C.005; or

      (d) Take such other action as the court considers necessary.

      (2) The court before which the petition is pending, on its own motion, may take testimony from or confer with the child to be adopted and may exclude from the conference the parents or guardians of the child, the proposed adoptive parents and other persons if the court finds that such action would be likely to be in the best interests of the child. However, the court shall permit an attorney for each party to attend the conference, and the conference shall be reported.

      (3) The clerk of the court before which petitions for leave to adopt another are pending shall periodically notify the court and the Department of Human Services of all such petitions which have been pending before the court for more than six months without final disposition pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) The clerk of the court before which a petition is filed for leave to adopt a minor child shall provide to the Director of Human Services a copy of the court’s order of disposition of the petition.

      109.308 Confidentiality of petitioners. In an adoption proceeding that is contested or in which a summons is required to be served, the court may preserve the confidentiality of the names and addresses of the petitioners for the adoption if the court finds that to do so is in the best interests of the child. [Formerly 109.235; 2005 c.369 §2]

 

      109.309 Petition for adoption; residency and jurisdictional requirements; venue; home study; placement report; fee; rules; filing requirements for entry of judgment. (1) Any person may petition the circuit court for leave to adopt another person and, if desired, for a change of the other person’s name. Except as provided in ORS 419B.529, a separate petition must be filed for each person for whom leave to adopt is sought.

      (2) One petitioner, the child, one parent or the person, who is not an adoption agency, consenting to the adoption as required under ORS 109.321 (1) must be a resident of this state. As used in this subsection, “resident” means a person who has resided in this state continuously for a period of six months prior to the date of the petition.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, when the petition is for the adoption of a minor child, the adoption is governed by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, ORS 109.701 to 109.834.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding ORS 109.741 and 109.744, a court of this state has jurisdiction over the adoption of a minor child if, immediately prior to the filing of a petition for adoption:

      (A) The minor child resided in this state for at least six consecutive months including periods of temporary absence;

      (B) One parent or another person, who is not an adoption agency, consenting to the adoption as required under ORS 109.321 (1) resided in this state for at least six consecutive months including periods of temporary absence;

      (C) The prospective adoptive parent resided in this state for at least six consecutive months including periods of temporary absence and substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the present or future care of the minor child;

      (D) It appears that no court of another state would have jurisdiction under circumstances substantially in accordance with subparagraphs (A) to (C) of this paragraph; or

      (E) A court of another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that this state is a more appropriate forum to hear a petition for adoption of the minor child and it is in the best interests of the minor child that a court of this state assume jurisdiction.

      (b) As used in paragraph (a) of this subsection, “periods of temporary absence” means periods of absence of not more than a total of 30 days in the prior six consecutive months.

      (5) In a petition to adopt a minor child, venue lies in the Oregon county with which the child has the most significant connection or in the Oregon county in which the licensed adoption agency is located.

      (6) A petition for adoption of a minor child must comply with the requirements, and be served in the manner, described in ORS 109.315.

      (7)(a) In a proceeding for the adoption of a minor child, a current home study must be approved by either the Department of Human Services or an Oregon licensed adoption agency for the purpose of demonstrating that the petitioner meets the minimum standards for adoptive homes as set forth in the department’s administrative rules.

      (b) The department, upon request by the petitioner, may waive the home study requirement in an adoption proceeding in which one of the child’s biological parents or adoptive parents retains parental rights, or when a relative who qualifies under the department’s administrative rules for a waiver of the home study requirement is the prospective adoptive parent.

      (c) The department shall, subject to ORS 109.306, adopt rules to implement the provisions of this subsection.

      (8)(a) Within 90 days after service upon the Director of Human Services as required under ORS 109.315, the Department of Human Services shall investigate and file for the consideration of the judge before whom the petition for adoption is pending a placement report containing information regarding the status of the child and evidence concerning the suitability of the proposed adoption. The department may designate an Oregon licensed adoption agency to investigate and report to the court. If the department designates an Oregon licensed adoption agency to investigate and report to the court, the department shall make the designation and provide all necessary information and materials to the Oregon licensed adoption agency no later than 30 days after the service on the director and upon receipt of all required documentation and fees. The department may waive the placement report requirement under this subsection but shall waive the placement report requirement in an adoption proceeding in which one of the child’s biological parents or adoptive parents retains parental rights.

      (b) Upon receipt of a written request by the petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney, the department shall furnish to the petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney copies of any information that the department has filed with the court.

      (c) Information gathered by the department or by an Oregon licensed adoption agency during the preparation of the placement report may include information concerning the child’s social, medical and genetic history and the birth parent’s history as may be required by ORS 109.321 or 109.342.

      (d) The court shall file and retain the placement report filed under this subsection in the same location in the records, papers and files in the court’s record of the adoption case as the petition and exhibits filed under ORS 109.315 are located. The placement report must be segregated from the Adoption Summary and Segregated Information Statement and the exhibits submitted under ORS 109.317.

      (e) The department shall, subject to ORS 109.306, adopt rules to implement the provisions of this subsection.

      (9) The department may charge the petitioner a fee for investigating a proposed nonagency adoption and preparing the home study required under subsection (7) of this section and the placement report required under subsection (8) of this section. The petitioner shall report the fee amount to the court. The court granting the adoption shall make a finding as to whether the fee is necessary and reasonable. Any fee charged may not exceed reasonable costs for investigation, home study and placement report preparation. The department shall prescribe by rule the procedure for computing the investigation, home study and placement report preparation fee. The rules shall provide a waiver of either part or all of the fee based upon the petitioner’s ability to pay.

If the parent has no guardian, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to appear for the parent in the adoption proceedings.

      (3) Upon hearing, if the court finds that the adoption is in the best interests of the child, the consent of the parent who is imprisoned or adjudged to be a person with mental illness or an intellectual disability is not required, and the court may proceed regardless of the objection of the parent.

      (2) Upon hearing or when the parent has failed to file a written answer as required in ORS 109.330 (3), if the court finds that the parent has willfully deserted the child or neglected without just and sufficient cause to provide proper care and maintenance for the child for one year next preceding the filing of the petition for adoption, the consent of the parent at the discretion of the court is not required and, if the court determines that the parent’s consent is not required, the court may proceed regardless of the objection of the parent.

      (3) In determining whether the parent has willfully deserted the child or neglected without just and sufficient cause to provide proper care and maintenance for the child, the court may:

      (b) Permanently committed to it by order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or

      (2) If parentage of the child has not been determined, a determination of nonparentage may be made by any court having adoption, divorce or juvenile court jurisdiction. The testimony or affidavit of the mother or the spouse or another person with knowledge of the facts filed in the proceeding constitutes competent evidence before the court making the determination.

      (3) Before making the determination of nonparentage, the petitioner shall serve on the spouse a summons and a true copy of a motion and order to show cause why a judgment of nonparentage should not be entered if:

      (a) There has been a determination by any court of competent jurisdiction that the spouse is the parent of the child;

      (b) The child resided with the spouse at any time since the child’s birth; or

      (c) The spouse repeatedly has contributed or tried to contribute to the support of the child.

      (B) A person cohabiting with a petitioner who is interested in the affairs and welfare of the petitioner.

      (C) The adult children of each petitioner.

      (5) If, upon a petition for adoption presented and consented to in writing by each petitioner and the person to be adopted, the court is satisfied as to the identity and relations of each petitioner and the person to be adopted, that each petitioner understands the significance and ramifications of the adoption, that each petitioner is not acting under duress, coercion or undue influence and that it is fit and proper that the adoption be effected, a judgment shall be made setting forth the facts and ordering that from the date of the judgment, the person to be adopted, for all legal intents and purposes, is the child of the petitioner or petitioners.

      109.350 Judgment of adoption or readoption. If, upon a petition for adoption or readoption duly presented and consented to, the court is satisfied as to the identity and relations of the persons, that the petitioner is of sufficient ability to bring up the child and furnish suitable nurture and education, having reference to the degree and condition of the parents, that, if applicable, the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) have been met, and that it is fit and proper that such adoption or readoption be effected, a judgment shall be made setting forth the facts, and ordering that from the date of the judgment the child, to all legal intents and purposes, is the child of the petitioner. In an adoption or readoption subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), the state court shall provide to the United States Secretary of the Interior a copy of the judgment together with the other information required by the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.).

      109.360 Change of adopted child’s name. If in a petition for the adoption of a child a change of the child’s name is requested, the court, upon entering a judgment granting the adoption, may also provide in the judgment for the change of the name without the notice required by ORS 33.420.

      109.381 Effect of judgment of adoption. (1) A judgment of a court of this state granting an adoption, and the proceedings in such adoption matter, shall in all respects be entitled to the same presumptions and be as conclusive as if rendered by a court of record acting in all respects as a court of general jurisdiction and not by a court of special or inferior jurisdiction, and jurisdiction over the persons and the cause shall be presumed to exist.

      (2) Except for such right of appeal as may be provided by law, judgments of adoption shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties to the proceeding. No party nor anyone claiming by, through or under a party to an adoption proceeding, may for any reason, either by collateral or direct proceedings, question the validity of a judgment of adoption entered by a court of competent jurisdiction of this or any other state.

      (3) After the expiration of one year from the entry of a judgment of adoption in this state the validity of the adoption shall be binding on all persons, and it shall be conclusively presumed that the child’s natural parents and all other persons who might claim to have any right to, or over the child, have abandoned the child and consented to the entry of such judgment of adoption, and that the child became the lawful child of the adoptive parents or parent at the time when the judgment of adoption was rendered, all irrespective of jurisdictional or other defects in the adoption proceeding. After the expiration of the one-year period no one may question the validity of the adoption for any reason, either through collateral or direct proceedings, and all persons shall be bound thereby. However, the provisions of this subsection shall not affect the right of appeal from a judgment of adoption as may be provided by law.

      (3) A copy of a decree, order, judgment, certificate or other document of adoption by adoptive parents, at least one of whom is a citizen of the United States, issued by a court or pursuant to an administrative proceeding of competent jurisdiction in the foreign nation is prima facie evidence in any court or administrative proceeding in this state that the adoption was legal and valid.

      Note: 109.425 to 109.507 and 109.990 (2) were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 109 by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      109.430 Policy and purpose. It is the policy of this state that adoption is based upon the legal termination of parental rights and responsibilities of birth parents and the creation of the legal relationship of parents and child between an adoptee and the adoptive parents. These legal and social premises underlying adoption must be maintained. The state recognizes that some persons who were adopted as children have a strong desire to obtain identifying information about their birth parents, putative father or genetic siblings while other such adoptees have no such desire. The state further recognizes that some birth parents have a strong desire to obtain identifying information about their biological children who were adopted, while other birth parents have no such desire. The state fully recognizes the right to privacy and confidentiality of birth parents whose children were adopted, the adoptees and the adoptive parents. The purpose of ORS 109.425 to 109.507 and 432.250 is to:

      (1) Set up a voluntary adoption registry where birth parents, putative fathers, adoptees and genetic siblings of adoptees may register their willingness to the release of identifying information to each other;

      (2) Provide for the disclosure of identifying information to birth parents and their progeny through a person employed or approved by a licensed adoption agency or the Department of Human Services, if the relevant persons for such disclosure are registered;

      (3) Provide for the transmission of nonidentifying health and genetic and social histories of adoptees, birth parents, putative fathers, genetic siblings of adoptees and other specified persons; and

      (4) Provide for disclosure of specific identifying information to Indian tribes or governmental agencies when needed to establish the adoptee’s eligibility for tribal membership or for benefits or to a person responsible for settling an estate that refers to the adoptee. [1983 c.672 §1; 1989 c.372 §5; 1995 c.79 §40; 1995 c.730 §8; 1997 c.442 §2; 2013 c.346 §15; 2015 c.200 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 109.425.

 

      109.435 Adoption records to be permanently maintained. (1) All records of any adoption finalized in this state shall be permanently maintained by the Department of Human Services or by the agency arranging the adoption.

      (2) If an agency which handles adoptions ceases to do business, the agency shall transfer the adoption records to the department or to a successor agency, if the agency gives notice of the transfer to the department. [1983 c.672 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 109.425.

 

      109.440 [1983 c.672 §4; 1995 c.79 §41; 1995 c.730 §9; 2001 c.586 §1; repealed by 2013 c.346 §7]

 

      109.445 Information of registry confidential. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the information acquired by any voluntary adoption registry shall not be disclosed under any freedom of information legislation, rules or practice.

      (2) A class action suit shall not be maintained in any court of this state to require the registry to disclose identifying information. [1983 c.672 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 109.425.

 

      109.450 Child placement agency to maintain registry; Department of Human Services duties. (1) A voluntary adoption registry shall be established and maintained by each agency or its successor agency. An agency may delegate or contract with another agency to establish, maintain and operate the registry for the delegating agency.

      (2) The Department of Human Services shall establish, maintain and operate the registry for all adoptions not arranged through a licensed agency. The department may contract out the function of establishing, maintaining and operating the registry to another agency. The department may join a voluntary national or international registry and make its records available in the manner authorized by ORS 109.425 to 109.507. However, if the rules of disclosure of such a voluntary organization differ from those prescribed in ORS 109.425 to 109.507, ORS 109.425 to 109.507 shall prevail. [1983 c.672 §6; 1995 c.79 §42; 1995 c.730 §10; 2015 c.200 §16]

The affidavit shall contain the information listed in ORS 109.465 and a statement of the registrant’s willingness to be identified to the other relevant persons who register. The affidavit gives authority to the registry to release to the other relevant persons who register identifying information related to the registrant or, if the registrant is registering on behalf of a minor adoptee or a minor genetic sibling, identifying information related to the minor adoptee or sibling. Each registration shall be accompanied by the registrant’s, or if the registrant is registering on behalf of a minor adoptee or a minor genetic sibling, the minor’s, certified copy of the record of live birth.

      (2) At the discretion of the agency operating the registry, the adult progeny, or the parent or guardian of minor progeny, of a deceased adoptee, a deceased genetic sibling of an adoptee or a deceased birth parent of an adoptee may register to have specific identifying and contact information disclosed by submitting a signed affidavit containing the information listed in ORS 109.465 and a statement of the registrant’s willingness to be identified to other relevant persons who register.

      (3) An adoptee, or the parent or guardian of a minor adoptee, may register to have specific identifying information disclosed to Indian tribes or to governmental agencies in order to establish the adoptee’s eligibility for tribal membership or for benefits or to a person settling an estate. The information shall be limited to a true copy of documents that prove the adoptee’s lineage. Information disclosed in accordance with this subsection shall not be disclosed to the adoptee or the parent or guardian of the minor adoptee by the registry or employee or agency operating a registry nor by the Indian tribe, governmental agency or person receiving the information.

      (4) Registration under this section by the parent or guardian of a minor adoptee or of a minor genetic sibling of an adoptee expires when the minor reaches 18 years of age. The adoptee or sibling must reregister with a registry as an adult in accordance with this section for identifying information to be released to relevant persons who are registered. If the adoptee or sibling reregisters, the registration fee will be waived.

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 109.503, a registry or employee or the agency operating a registry shall not contact or in any other way solicit any adoptee or birth parent to register with the registry. [1983 c.672 §8; 1989 c.372 §6; 1993 c.410 §10; 1997 c.442 §4; 2013 c.366 §57; 2015 c.200 §4]

      Note: See note under 109.425.

 

      109.503 Access to adoption records for search; duties of searcher. (1) When the Department of Human Services, an Oregon licensed adoption agency or a third party individual or entity to whom the department or agency has delegated, or with whom the department or agency has contracted, to conduct searches under ORS 109.502 is requested to conduct a search under ORS 109.502, the department, agency or third party individual or entity may examine adoption records maintained by the department and by private adoption agencies under ORS 109.435. However, the department, agency or third party individual or entity may examine the adoption records of a private adoption agency only if the private adoption agency allows the examination. The department, agency or third party individual or entity shall keep the records and information located in the records confidential.

      (2) If the department, agency or third party individual or entity is able to identify and locate the person being sought, the department, agency or third party individual or entity shall make a confidential inquiry of that person to determine whether the person wishes to make contact with the person requesting the search. If the reason the person is requesting the search is because there is a serious medical condition in the person’s immediate family that is, or may be, an inheritable condition and the person being sought is biologically related to the ill person, the department, agency or third party individual or entity shall inform the person being sought of that fact.

      (3) If the department, agency or third party individual or entity is able to identify the county in which an adoption was finalized, in the discretion of the department, agency or third party individual or entity, the identity of the county may be disclosed to an adult adoptee, the parent or guardian of a minor adoptee, or to a birth parent.

      (4)(a) If the person being sought wishes to make contact with the person requesting the search, the department, agency or third party individual or entity shall:

      (A) Tell the person about the voluntary adoption registry under ORS 109.425 to 109.507 and that any contact will be made through the registry and its provisions and shall give the person any information and forms necessary to register;

      (B) Notify the voluntary adoption registry that the person being sought has been identified and located and has indicated that the person wishes to make contact; and

      (C) Return all materials and information obtained during the search to the department or agency responsible for maintaining the information.

      (b) If the person being sought has indicated a wish to make contact and has not registered with the voluntary adoption registry within 90 days after the confidential inquiry was made, the department, agency or third party individual or entity, where practicable, shall contact the person to offer forms and materials to register and to determine if the person still intends to register.

      (5) If the person being sought does not wish to make contact with the person requesting the search, the department, agency or third party individual or entity shall:

      (a) Tell the person about the voluntary adoption registry under ORS 109.425 to 109.507;

      (b) Notify the voluntary adoption registry that the person being sought has been identified, located and has indicated that the person does not wish to make contact; and

      (c) Return all materials and information obtained during the search to the department or agency responsible for maintaining the information.

      (6) If the department, agency or third party individual or entity is unable to identify and locate the person being sought, the department, agency or third party individual or entity shall notify the voluntary adoption registry of that fact.

      (7) Upon receiving notice under subsection (4)(a)(B), (5)(b) or (6) of this section, the voluntary adoption registry shall:

      (a) Enter the information into its records; and

      (b) Notify the person requesting the search only that the person being sought has or has not been located, and either:

      (A) Has indicated a wish to make contact and has been given information and forms necessary to register; or

      (B) Has indicated a wish not to make contact. [1993 c.410 §4; 1995 c.79 §43; 1995 c.730 §13; 1997 c.442 §10; 2015 c.200 §11]

 

      Note: See note under 109.425.

 

      109.504 Effect on subsequent searches when person sought in initial search refuses contact; other restrictions on searches. (1) If an adult adoptee or the adoptive parent of a minor or deceased adoptee has initiated a search under ORS 109.502, the fact that the person being sought in the original search does not wish to make contact does not prevent the adult adoptee or the adoptive parent from requesting another search for a birth parent or putative father not previously contacted.

RELATIVE CAREGIVERS

 

      109.570 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Current economic and cultural circumstances are such that relatives of minor children are playing an increasing role in ensuring the health, safety and education of minor children who, for many reasons, cannot live with and are not being cared for by their parents or guardians, and for whom legal proceedings have not been initiated or undertaken to establish legal guardianships or placements under the laws of this state.

      (2) Relatives of minor children are frequently asked, with minimal notice, to provide housing and health care, and to make educational decisions, for minor children who are left in their care.

      (3) Relative caregivers frequently face barriers to obtaining necessary and appropriate medical treatment and educational services for minor children left in their care.

      (4) These barriers pose a significant challenge to relative caregivers in dealing with health care providers and schools, and pose a substantial threat to the health, safety and welfare of minor children in this state.

      (5) It is necessary to provide legal authority for relative caregivers to access necessary and appropriate medical treatment and educational services for minor children who are left in the relative caregivers’ care and who are without legal parents or guardians who can otherwise provide for them. [2013 c.231 §1]

 

      Note: 109.570 to 109.580 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 109 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      109.572 Definitions for ORS 109.570 to 109.580. As used in ORS 109.570 to 109.580:

      (1) “Educational services” means enrollment of a minor child in a school to which the minor child has been or will be accepted for attendance and participation in any school activities, including extracurricular activities.

      (2) “Health care facility” means any facility that provides medical treatment.

      (3) “Health care provider” means a person who is licensed, certified, registered or otherwise authorized by law in this state to administer medical treatment in the practice of a health care profession or at a health care facility, and includes a health care facility.

      (4) “Medical treatment” means developmental screening, mental health screening and treatment, ordinary and necessary medical, dental and optical examination and treatment and preventive care including ordinary immunizations, tuberculin testing and well-child care, and includes the examination for and treatment of any injury, symptom, disease or pathology that is, in the judgment of the treating health care provider, reasonably necessary.

      (5) “Legal parent or guardian” means the parent or guardian of a minor child, a person with rights established under ORS 109.119 or a person to whom powers have been delegated under ORS 109.056.

      (6) “Relative caregiver” means a competent adult who is 18 years of age or older, who is related to a minor child by blood, marriage or adoption, who is not the legal parent or guardian and who represents in the affidavit described in ORS 109.580 that the minor child lives with the adult and that the adult is responsible for the care of the minor child. [2013 c.231 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 109.570.

 

      109.575 Authority of relative caregiver to consent to medical treatment and educational services for minor child; liability for payment; expiration of authority. (1) A relative caregiver acting pursuant to an affidavit under ORS 109.580 may consent to medical treatment and educational services for a minor child that a minor child cannot otherwise legally consent to if, after reasonable efforts have been made to obtain the consent of the legal parent or guardian to the treatment or services, the consent of the legal parent or guardian cannot be obtained.

      (2) A relative caregiver providing consent under this section is liable to the health care provider or school for payment for any medical treatment or educational services provided to a minor child pursuant to the consent.

      (3) The consent of a relative caregiver under this section shall be superseded by any contravening decision of the legal parent or guardian, provided the decision does not threaten the life, health or safety of the minor child.

      (4) If the minor child stops living with the relative caregiver, the relative caregiver shall immediately notify any health care provider or school that has been given an affidavit under ORS 109.580. The affidavit is invalid immediately upon receipt by the health care provider or school of the notice under this subsection.

      (5) An affidavit under ORS 109.580 expires one year after the date it is given to a health care provider or school by a relative caregiver. If the date the affidavit is given to a health care provider or school is unknown or uncertain, it shall expire one year after the date the relative caregiver signs the affidavit.

      (6)(a) A health care provider or school may, but is not required to, rely on the representations or affidavit of a person claiming to be a relative caregiver if the health care provider or school does not have actual notice of the falsity of any of the statements or documentation made or provided by the person claiming to be a relative caregiver.

      (b) Upon receipt of a valid affidavit as described in ORS 109.580, a health care provider or school may, but is not required to, request documentation of a person’s claimed status as a relative caregiver and of attempts made to obtain the consent of the legal parent or guardian.

      (7) A relative caregiver acting in good faith with reasonable grounds to provide consent for medical treatment or educational services pursuant to an affidavit under ORS 109.580 is not subject to criminal or civil liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed for giving consent to the medical treatment or educational services.

      (8) Nothing in this section relieves a legal parent or guardian of liability for payment for medical treatment or educational services provided to a minor child pursuant to the valid consent of a relative caregiver under this section. [2013 c.231 §3]

If such disclosure is made, the physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse practitioner, clinical social worker licensed under ORS 675.530, professional counselor or marriage and family therapist licensed by the Oregon Board of Licensed Professional Counselors and Therapists, naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685 or community mental health program shall not be subject to any civil liability for advising the parent, parents or legal guardian without the consent of the minor.

For the purpose of carrying out the policy and intent of ORS 109.675 to 109.695 while taking into account the respective rights of minors at risk of chemical dependency or mental or emotional disorder and the rights and interests of parents or legal guardians of such minors, the Oregon Health Authority shall adopt rules for the implementation of ORS 109.675 to 109.695 by community mental health programs approved to do so.

[1985 c.525 §5; 2009 c.595 §74]

 

      109.697 Right to contract for dwelling unit and utilities without parental consent. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that there are in the State of Oregon unemancipated minors who are living apart from their parents and are homeless. Many of these minors are able financially to provide housing and utility services for themselves and their children, but cannot contract for these necessities due to perceived legal limitations affecting contracts with minors. The purpose of this legislation is to address those limitations.

      (2) For purposes of this section, “minor” means an unemancipated and unmarried person who is living apart from the person’s parent, parents or legal guardian, and who is either:

      (a) Sixteen or 17 years of age;

      (b) Under 16 years of age and the parent of a child or children who are living in the physical custody of the person; or

      (c) Under 16 years of age, pregnant and expecting the birth of a child who will be living in the physical custody of the person.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a minor may contract for the necessities of a residential dwelling unit and for utility services to that unit. Such a contract is binding upon the minor and cannot be voided or disaffirmed by the minor based upon the minor’s age or status as a minor.

      (4) The consent of the parent or legal guardian of such minor shall not be necessary to contract for a residential dwelling unit or utility services to that unit. The parent or legal guardian of such minor shall not be liable under a contract by that minor for a residential dwelling unit or for utility services to that unit unless the parent or guardian is a party to the minor’s contract, or enters another contract, for the purpose of acting as guarantor of the minor’s debt. [1993 c.369 §29]

      (a) This state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state;

      (b) A court of another state does not have jurisdiction under subsection (1)(a) of this section, or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this state is the more appropriate forum under ORS 109.761 or 109.764, and:

      (A) The child and the child’s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence; and

      (B) Substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child’s care, protection, training and personal relationships;

      (c) All courts having jurisdiction under subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under ORS 109.761 or 109.764; or

      (d) No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) of this section.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this state.

      (3) Physical presence of, or personal jurisdiction over, a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make a child custody determination. [1999 c.649 §13]

 

      Note: See note under 109.701.

 

      109.744 Exclusive, continuing jurisdiction. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 109.751, a court of this state that has made a child custody determination consistent with ORS 109.741 or 109.747 has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the determination until:

      (a) A court of this state determines that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent have a significant connection with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state concerning the child’s care, protection, training and personal relationships; or

      (b) A court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child, the child’s parents and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.

      (2) A court of this state that has made a child custody determination and does not have exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under this section may modify that determination only if the court has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under ORS 109.741. [1999 c.649 §14]

 

      Note: See note under 109.701.

 

      109.747 Jurisdiction to modify determination. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 109.751, a court of this state may not modify a child custody determination made by a court of another state unless a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under ORS 109.741 (1)(a) or (b) and:

      (1) The court of the other state determines that it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under ORS 109.744 or that a court of this state would be a more convenient forum under ORS 109.761; or

      (2) A court of this state or a court of the other state determines that the child, the child’s parents and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other state. [1999 c.649 §15]

 

      Note: See note under 109.701.

      109.751 Temporary emergency jurisdiction. (1) A court of this state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this state and the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child, or a sibling or parent of the child, is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.

      (2) If there is no previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under ORS 109.701 to 109.834 and a child custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747, a child custody determination made under this section remains in effect until an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747. If a child custody proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747, a child custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination if the determination so provides and this state becomes the home state of the child.

      (3) If there is a previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under ORS 109.701 to 109.834, or a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747, any order issued by a court of this state under this section must specify in the order a period that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747. The order issued in this state remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the period expires.

      (4) A court of this state that has been asked to make a child custody determination under this section, upon being informed that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of a state having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747, shall immediately communicate with the other court. A court of this state that is exercising jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747, upon being informed that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of another state under a statute similar to this section, shall immediately communicate with the court of that state to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.

      (2) ORS 109.701 to 109.834 do not govern the enforceability of a child custody determination made without notice or an opportunity to be heard.

      (3) The obligation to join a party and the right to intervene as a party in a child custody proceeding under ORS 109.701 to 109.834 are governed by the law of this state as in child custody proceedings between residents of this state. [1999 c.649 §17]

      109.757 Simultaneous proceedings. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 109.751, a court of this state may not exercise its jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.771 if, at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with ORS 109.701 to 109.834, unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state because a court of this state is a more convenient forum under ORS 109.761.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 109.751, a court of this state, before hearing a child custody proceeding, shall examine the court documents and other information supplied by the parties under ORS 109.767. If the court determines that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court in another state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with ORS 109.701 to 109.834, the court of this state shall stay its proceeding and communicate with the court of the other state. If the court of the state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with ORS 109.701 to 109.834 does not determine that the court of this state is a more appropriate forum, the court of this state shall dismiss the proceeding.

      (3) In a proceeding to modify a child custody determination, a court of this state shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been commenced in another state. If a proceeding to enforce a child custody determination has been commenced in another state, the court may:

      (a) Stay the proceeding for modification pending the entry of an order of a court of the other state enforcing, staying, denying or dismissing the proceeding for enforcement;

      (b) Enjoin the parties from continuing with the proceeding for enforcement; or

      (c) Proceed with the modification under conditions it considers appropriate. [1999 c.649 §18]

      109.761 Inconvenient forum. (1) A court of this state that has jurisdiction under ORS 109.701 to 109.834 to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if the court determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon the motion of a party, the court’s own motion or the request of another court.

      (2) Before determining whether a court of this state is an inconvenient forum, the court shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:

      (a) Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;

      (b) The length of time the child has resided outside this state;

      (c) The distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;

      (d) The relative financial circumstances of the parties;

      (e) Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;

      (f) The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;

      (g) The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and

      (h) The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.

      (3) If a court of this state determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.

      (4) A court of this state may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under ORS 109.701 to 109.834 if a child custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding. [1999 c.649 §19]

 

      Note: See note under 109.701.

 

      109.764 Jurisdiction declined by reason of conduct. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 109.751 or 419B.100, if a court of this state has jurisdiction under ORS 109.701 to 109.834 because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct to so invoke the jurisdiction, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:

      (a) The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;

      (b) A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747 determines that this state is a more appropriate forum under ORS 109.761; or

      (c) No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in ORS 109.741 to 109.747.

      (2) If a court of this state declines to exercise its jurisdiction under subsection (1) of this section, it may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under ORS 109.741 to 109.747.

      (3) If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction under subsection (1) of this section, it shall assess against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication expenses, attorney fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses and child care expenses during the course of the proceeding unless the party from whom necessary and reasonable expenses are sought establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate. The court may not assess fees, costs or expenses against this state unless authorized by law other than ORS 109.701 to 109.834. [1999 c.649 §20]

 

      Note: See note under 109.701.

      (2) If the information required by subsection (1) of this section is not furnished, the court, upon motion of a party or its own motion, may stay the proceeding until the information is furnished.

      (3) If the information as to any of the items described in subsection (1) of this section is in the affirmative, the declarant shall give additional information under oath as required by the court. The court may examine the parties under oath as to details of the information furnished and other matters pertinent to the court’s jurisdiction and the disposition of the case.

      (4) Each party has a continuing duty to inform the court of any proceeding in this or any other state that could affect the current proceeding.

      (5) If a party alleges in the first pleading, or in an attached affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury, that the health, safety or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of identifying information, the information must be sealed and may not be disclosed to the other party or the public unless the court orders the disclosure to be made after a hearing in which the court takes into consideration the health, safety or liberty of the party or child and determines that the disclosure is in the interest of justice. Costs incurred by the court when special notice procedures are made necessary by the nondisclosure of identifying information shall be paid by the parties as deemed appropriate by the court.

      (b) A hearing to contest the validity of the registered determination must be requested within 21 days after service of notice; and

      (c) Failure to contest the registration will result in confirmation of the child custody determination and preclude further contest of that determination with respect to any matter that could have been asserted.

      (5) A person seeking to contest the validity of a registered order must request a hearing within 21 days after service of the notice and pay the filing fee established under ORS 21.145.

      (7) Confirmation of a registered order, whether by operation of law or after notice and hearing, precludes further contest of the order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted at the time of registration. [1999 c.649 §27; 2011 c.595 §34]

      (2) If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other witness, is satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the child is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this state, it may issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child.

      (2) The court may not assess fees, costs or expenses against a state unless authorized by law other than ORS 109.701 to 109.834. [1999 c.649 §34; 2013 c.688 §13]
