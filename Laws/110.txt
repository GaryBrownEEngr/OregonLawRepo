JURISDICTION

 

      110.518 Bases for jurisdiction over nonresident; limitations. (1) In a proceeding to establish or enforce a support order or to determine parentage of a child, a tribunal of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual or the individual’s guardian or conservator if:

      (a) The individual is personally served with notice within this state;

      (b) The individual submits to the jurisdiction of this state by consent in a record, by entering a general appearance or by filing a responsive document having the effect of waiving any contest to personal jurisdiction;

      (c) The individual resided with the child in this state;

      (d) The individual resided in this state and provided prenatal expenses or support for the child;

      (e) The child resides in this state as a result of the acts or directives of the individual;

      (f) The individual engaged in sexual intercourse in this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse; or

      (g) There is any other basis consistent with the Constitutions of the State of Oregon and the United States for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.

      (2) The bases of personal jurisdiction set forth in subsection (1) of this section or in any other law of this state may not be used to acquire personal jurisdiction for a tribunal of this state to modify a child support order of another state unless the requirements of ORS 110.632 are met or, in the case of a foreign support order, unless the requirements of ORS 110.639 are met. [2015 c.298 §7]

 

      110.520 Continuation of personal jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction acquired by a tribunal of this state in a proceeding under this chapter or other law of this state relating to a support order continues as long as a tribunal of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order or continuing jurisdiction to enforce its order as provided by ORS 110.527, 110.530 and 110.540. [2015 c.298 §8]

 

      110.522 Initiating and responding tribunals. Under this chapter, a tribunal of this state may serve as an initiating tribunal to forward proceedings to a tribunal of another state, and as a responding tribunal for proceedings initiated in another state or a foreign country. [2015 c.298 §9]

 

      110.524 Simultaneous proceedings in another state. (1) A tribunal of this state may exercise jurisdiction to establish a support order if the petition or comparable pleading is filed after a pleading is filed in another state or a foreign country only if:

      (a) The petition or comparable pleading in this state is filed before the expiration of the time allowed in the other state or the foreign country for filing a responsive pleading challenging the exercise of jurisdiction by the other state or the foreign country;

      (b) The contesting party timely challenges the exercise of jurisdiction in the other state or the foreign country; and

      (c) If relevant, this state is the home state of the child.

      (2) A tribunal of this state may not exercise jurisdiction to establish a support order if the petition or comparable pleading is filed before a petition or comparable pleading is filed in another state or a foreign country if:

      (a) The petition or comparable pleading in the other state or foreign country is filed before the expiration of the time allowed in this state for filing a responsive pleading challenging the exercise of jurisdiction by this state;

      (b) The contesting party timely challenges the exercise of jurisdiction in this state; and

      (c) If relevant, the other state or foreign country is the home state of the child. [2015 c.298 §10]

 

      110.527 Continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. (1) A tribunal of this state that has issued a child support order consistent with the law of this state has and shall exercise continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its child support order if the order is the controlling order and:

      (a) At the time of the filing of a request for modification, this state is the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued; or

      (b) Even if this state is not the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued, the parties consent in a record or in open court that the tribunal of this state may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order.

      (2) A tribunal of this state that has issued a child support order consistent with the law of this state may not exercise continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify the order if:

      (a) All of the parties who are individuals file consent in a record with the tribunal of this state that a tribunal of another state that has jurisdiction over at least one of the parties who is an individual or that is located in the state of residence of the child may modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction; or

      (b) The tribunal’s order is not the controlling order.

      (3) If a tribunal of another state has issued a child support order pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act or a law substantially similar to that Act which modifies a child support order of a tribunal of this state, tribunals of this state shall recognize the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal of the other state.

      (4) A tribunal of this state that lacks continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify a child support order may serve as an initiating tribunal to request a tribunal of another state to modify a support order issued in that state.

      (5) A temporary support order issued ex parte or pending resolution of a jurisdictional conflict does not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the issuing tribunal. [2015 c.298 §11]

 

      110.530 Tribunal of state as initiating or responding tribunal. (1) A tribunal of this state that has issued a child support order consistent with the law of this state may serve as an initiating tribunal to request a tribunal of another state to enforce:

      (a) The order if the order is the controlling order and has not been modified by a tribunal of another state that assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act; or

      (b) A money judgment for arrears of support and interest on the order accrued before a determination that an order of a tribunal of another state is the controlling order.

      (2) A tribunal of this state having continuing jurisdiction over a support order may act as a responding tribunal to enforce the order. [2015 c.298 §12]

 

      110.533 Recognition of controlling child support order. (1) If a proceeding is brought under this chapter and only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be recognized.

      (2) If a proceeding is brought under this chapter and two or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of this state, another state or a foreign country with regard to the same obligor and same child, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which order controls and must be recognized:

      (a) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter the order of that tribunal controls.

      (b) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter:

      (A) An order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls; or

      (B) If an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls.

      (c) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the tribunal of this state shall issue a child support order, which controls.

      (3) If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (2) of this section. The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification pursuant to ORS 110.605 to 110.641 or may be filed as a separate proceeding.

      (4) A request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.

      (5) The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section has continuing jurisdiction to the extent provided in ORS 110.527 or 110.530.

      (6) A tribunal of this state that determines by order which is the controlling order under subsection (2)(a) or (b) or (3) of this section or that issues a new controlling order under subsection (2)(c) of this section shall state in that order:

      (a) The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination;

      (b) The amount of prospective support, if any; and

      (c) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited as provided by ORS 110.537.

      (7) Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining which is the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it in each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency obtaining the order that fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.

      (8) An order that has been determined to be the controlling order, or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made pursuant to this section must be recognized in proceedings under this chapter. [2015 c.298 §13]

 

      110.536 Multiple child support orders for two or more obligees. In responding to registrations or petitions for enforcement of two or more child support orders in effect at the same time with regard to the same obligor and different individual obligees, at least one of which was issued by a tribunal of another state or a foreign country, a tribunal of this state shall enforce those orders in the same manner as if the orders had been issued by a tribunal of this state. [2015 c.298 §14]

 

      110.537 Credit for payments. A tribunal of this state shall credit amounts collected for a particular period pursuant to any child support order against the amounts owed for the same period under any other child support order for support of the same child issued by a tribunal of this state, another state or a foreign country. [2015 c.298 §15]

 

      110.539 Certain procedures in proceeding involving nonresident. A tribunal of this state exercising personal jurisdiction over a nonresident in a proceeding under this chapter, under other law of this state relating to a support order or recognizing a foreign support order may receive evidence from outside this state pursuant to ORS 110.584, communicate with a tribunal outside this state pursuant to ORS 110.587 and obtain discovery through a tribunal outside this state pursuant to ORS 110.590. In all other respects, ORS 110.542 to 110.641 do not apply and the tribunal shall apply the procedural and substantive law of this state. [2015 c.298 §16]

 

      110.540 Spousal support proceedings. (1) A tribunal of this state issuing a spousal support order consistent with the law of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify the spousal support order throughout the existence of the support obligation.

      (2) A tribunal of this state may not modify a spousal support order issued by a tribunal of another state or a foreign country having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over that order under the law of that state or foreign country.

      (3) A tribunal of this state that has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal support order may serve as:

      (a) An initiating tribunal to request a tribunal of another state to enforce the spousal support order issued in this state; or

      (b) A responding tribunal to enforce or modify its own spousal support order. [2015 c.298 §17]

Payment of support owed to the obligee has priority over fees, costs and expenses.

      (3) The tribunal shall order the payment of costs and reasonable attorney fees if it determines that a hearing was requested primarily for delay.

[2015 c.298 §30]

 

      110.579 Limited immunity of petitioner. (1) Participation by a petitioner in a proceeding under this chapter before a responding tribunal, whether in person, by private attorney or through services provided by the support enforcement agency, does not confer personal jurisdiction over the petitioner in another proceeding.

      (2) An affidavit, a document substantially complying with federally mandated forms or a document incorporated by reference in an affidavit or form that would not be excluded under the hearsay rule if given in person is admissible in evidence if given under penalty of perjury by a party or witness residing outside this state.

      (3) A copy of the record of child support payments certified as a true copy of the original by the custodian of the record may be forwarded to a responding tribunal. The copy is evidence of the facts asserted in the record and is admissible to show whether payments were made.

      (4) Copies of bills for testing for parentage of a child and for prenatal and postnatal health care of the mother and child that are furnished to the adverse party at least 10 days before trial are admissible in evidence to prove the amount of the charges billed and that the charges were reasonable, necessary and customary.

      (5) Documentary evidence transmitted from outside this state to a tribunal of this state by telephone, telecopier or other electronic means that do not provide an original record may not be excluded from evidence on an objection based on the means of transmission.

      (6) In a proceeding under this chapter, a tribunal of this state shall permit a party or witness residing outside this state to be deposed or to testify under penalty of perjury by telephone, audiovisual means or other electronic means at a designated tribunal or other location. A tribunal of this state shall cooperate with other tribunals in designating an appropriate location for the deposition or testimony.

      (8) A privilege against disclosure of communications between spouses does not apply in a proceeding under this chapter.

      (9) The defense of immunity based on the relationship of husband and wife or parent and child does not apply in a proceeding under this chapter.

      (10) A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, certified as a true copy, is admissible to establish parentage of the child. [2015 c.298 §33]

 

      110.587 Communication between tribunals. A tribunal of this state may communicate with a tribunal outside this state in a record or by telephone, electronic mail or other means to obtain information concerning the laws of that tribunal, the legal effect of a judgment, decree or order of that tribunal and the status of a proceeding. A tribunal of this state may furnish similar information by similar means to a tribunal outside this state. [2015 c.298 §34]

      (2) If neither the obligor nor the obligee who is an individual nor the child resides in this state, upon request from the support enforcement agency of this state or another state, the support enforcement agency of this state or a tribunal of this state shall:

      (a) Direct that the support payment be made to the support enforcement agency in the state in which the obligee is receiving services; and

      (b) Issue and send to the obligor’s employer a conforming income withholding order or an administrative notice of change of payee reflecting the redirected payments.

      (3) The support enforcement agency of this state receiving redirected payments from another state pursuant to a law similar to subsection (2) of this section shall furnish to a requesting party or tribunal of the other state a certified statement by the custodian of the record of the amount and dates of all payments received. [2015 c.298 §36]

DETERMINATION OF PARENTAGE

 

      110.592 Authority to issue support order. (1) If a support order entitled to recognition under this chapter has not been issued, a responding tribunal of this state with personal jurisdiction over the parties may issue a support order if:

ENFORCEMENT OF SUPPORT ORDER

WITHOUT REGISTRATION

 

      110.594 Income withholding order issued in another state. An income withholding order issued in another state may be sent by or on behalf of the obligee, or by the support enforcement agency, to the person defined as the obligor’s employer under the income withholding law of this state without first filing a petition or comparable pleading or registering the order with a tribunal of this state. [2015 c.298 §39]

      110.597 Employer’s compliance with multiple income withholding orders. If an obligor’s employer receives two or more income withholding orders with respect to the earnings of the same obligor, the employer satisfies the terms of the orders if the employer complies with the law of the state of the obligor’s principal place of employment to establish the priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for two or more child support obligees.

[2015 c.298 §42]

 

      110.600 Penalties for noncompliance.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a tribunal of this state shall recognize and enforce, but may not modify, a registered support order if the issuing tribunal had jurisdiction. [2015 c.298 §48]

 

      110.611 Choice of law. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, the law of the issuing state or foreign country governs:

      (3) A responding tribunal of this state shall apply the procedures and remedies of this state to enforce current support and collect arrears and interest due on a support order of another state or a foreign country registered in this state.

      (4) After a tribunal of this state or another state determines which is the controlling order and issues an order consolidating arrears, if any, a tribunal of this state shall prospectively apply the law of the state or foreign country issuing the controlling order, including its law on interest on arrears, on current and future support and on consolidated arrears. [2015 c.298 §49]

 

(Contest of Validity or Enforcement)

 

      110.614 Notice of registration of order. (1) When a support order or income withholding order issued in another state or a foreign support order is registered, the registering tribunal of this state shall notify the nonregistering party. The notice must be accompanied by a copy of the registered order and the documents and relevant information accompanying the order.

      (2) A notice must inform the nonregistering party:

      (a) That a registered support order is enforceable as of the date of registration in the same manner as an order issued by a tribunal of this state;

      (b) That a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order must be requested within 20 days after notice unless the registered order is under ORS 110.657;

      (c) That failure to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order in a timely manner will result in confirmation of the order and enforcement of the order and the alleged arrearages; and

      (d) Of the amount of any alleged arrearages.

      (3) If the registering party asserts that two or more orders are in effect, a notice must also:

      (a) Identify the two or more orders and the order alleged by the registering party to be the controlling order and the consolidated arrears, if any;

      (b) Notify the nonregistering party of the right to a determination of which is the controlling order;

      (c) State that the procedures provided in subsection (2) of this section apply to the determination of which is the controlling order; and

      (d) State that failure to contest the validity or enforcement of the order alleged to be the controlling order in a timely manner may result in confirmation that the order is the controlling order.

      (4) Upon registration of an income withholding order for enforcement, the support enforcement agency or the registering tribunal shall notify the obligor’s employer pursuant to the income withholding law of this state. [2015 c.298 §50]

(1) A nonregistering party seeking to contest the validity or enforcement of a registered support order in this state shall request a hearing within the time required by ORS 110.614. The nonregistering party may seek to vacate the registration, to assert any defense to an allegation of noncompliance with the registered order or to contest the remedies being sought or the amount of any alleged arrearages pursuant to ORS 110.620.

      (2) If the nonregistering party fails to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered support order in a timely manner, the order is confirmed by operation of law.

      (3) If a nonregistering party requests a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered support order, the registering tribunal shall schedule the matter for hearing and give notice to the parties of the date, time and place of the hearing. [2015 c.298 §51]

 

      110.620 Contest of registration or enforcement. (1) A party contesting the validity or enforcement of a registered support order or seeking to vacate the registration has the burden of proving one or more of the following defenses:

      (a) The issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party;

      (b) The order was obtained by fraud;

      (c) The order has been vacated, suspended or modified by a later order;

      (d) The issuing tribunal has stayed the order pending appeal;

      (e) There is a defense under the law of this state to the remedy sought;

      (f) Full or partial payment has been made;

      (g) The statute of limitation under ORS 110.611 precludes enforcement of some or all of the alleged arrearages; or

      (h) The alleged controlling order is not the controlling order.

      (2) If a party presents evidence establishing a full or partial defense under subsection (1) of this section, a tribunal may stay enforcement of a registered support order, continue the proceeding to permit production of additional relevant evidence and issue other appropriate orders. An uncontested portion of the registered support order may be enforced by all remedies available under the law of this state.

      (3) If the contesting party does not establish a defense under subsection (1) of this section to the validity or enforcement of a registered support order, the registering tribunal shall issue an order confirming the order. [2015 c.298 §52]

 

      110.623 Effect of confirmation of order. Confirmation of a registered support order, whether by operation of law or after notice and hearing, precludes further contest of the order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted at the time of registration. [2015 c.298 §53]

 

(Registration and Modification of Child Support Order of Another State)

 

      110.626 Registration of order for modification; petition for modification. A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a child support order issued in another state shall register that order in this state in the same manner provided in ORS 110.605 to 110.623 if the order has not been registered. A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a request for registration or later. The pleading must specify the grounds for modification. [2015 c.298 §54]

 

      110.629 Effect of registration of order for modification. A tribunal of this state may enforce a child support order of another state registered for purposes of modification in the same manner as if the order had been issued by a tribunal of this state, but the registered support order may be modified only if the requirements of ORS 110.632 or 110.636 have been met. [2015 c.298 §55]

 

      110.632 Modification of child support order of another state. (1) If ORS 110.636 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal of this state may modify a child support order issued in another state that is registered in this state if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds that:

      (a) The following requirements are met:

      (A) Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual nor the obligor resides in the issuing state;

      (B) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and

      (C) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or

      (b) This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

      (2) Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state, and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.

      (3) A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support. If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under ORS 110.533 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.

      (4) In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor’s fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.

      (5) On the issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (5) of this section and ORS 110.518 (2), a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:

      (a) One party resides in another state; and

      (b) The other party resides outside the United States. [2015 c.298 §56]

 

      110.635 Enforcement and recognition of order modified by another state. If a child support order issued by a tribunal of this state is modified by a tribunal of another state that assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, a tribunal of this state:

      (1) May enforce its order that was modified only as to arrears and interest accruing before the modification;

      (2) May provide appropriate relief for violations of its order that occurred before the effective date of the modification; and

      (3) Shall recognize the modifying order of the other state upon registration for the purpose of enforcement. [2015 c.298 §57]

 

      110.636 Jurisdiction to modify order of another state when individual parties reside in this state; applicable law. (1) If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this state and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state’s child support order in a proceeding to register that order.

      (2) A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the provisions of ORS 110.500 to 110.510, 110.518 to 110.540, 110.605 to 110.641 and the procedural and substantive law of this state to the proceeding for enforcement or modification. ORS 110.542 to 110.591, 110.592, 110.593, 110.594 to 110.602, 110.645 to 110.669, 110.670 and 110.673 do not apply. [2015 c.298 §58]

 

      110.637 Notice to issuing tribunal of modification of order. Within 30 days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal that had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows the earlier order has been registered. A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. [2015 c.298 §59]

 

(Registration and Modification of Foreign Child Support Order)

 

      110.639 Jurisdiction to modify foreign child support order. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 110.667, if a foreign country lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its child support order pursuant to its laws, a tribunal of this state may assume jurisdiction to modify the child support order and bind all individuals subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal whether the consent to modification of a child support order otherwise required of the individual pursuant to ORS 110.632 has been given or whether the individual seeking modification is a resident of this state or of the foreign country.

      (2) An order issued by a tribunal of this state modifying a foreign child support order pursuant to this section is the controlling order. [2015 c.298 §60]

 

      110.641 Procedure to modify foreign child support order. A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a foreign child support order not under the Convention may register that order in this state under ORS 110.605 to 110.623 if the order has not been registered. A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a request for registration or at another time. The petition must specify the grounds for modification. [2015 c.298 §61]

      (2) The following grounds are the only grounds on which a tribunal of this state may refuse recognition and enforcement of a registered Convention support order:

      (h) Payment, to the extent alleged arrears have been paid in whole or in part;

      (i) In a case in which the respondent neither appeared nor was represented in the proceeding in the issuing foreign country:

      (B) If the law of that country does not provide for prior notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the order and an opportunity to be heard in a challenge or appeal on fact or law before a tribunal; or

      (j) The order was made in violation of ORS 110.667.

      (a) Recognition and enforcement of the agreement is manifestly incompatible with public policy;

      (b) The agreement was obtained by fraud or falsification;

      110.667 Modification of Convention support order; requirements. (1) A tribunal of this state may not modify a Convention child support order if the obligee remains a resident of the foreign country where the support order was issued unless:

      (b) The foreign tribunal lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its support order or issue a new support order.

      (2) If a tribunal of this state does not modify a Convention child support order because the order is not recognized in this state, ORS 110.660 (3) applies. [2015 c.298 §72]

INTERSTATE RENDITION

 

      110.670 Grounds for rendition. (1) For purposes of this section and ORS 110.673, “governor” includes an individual performing the functions of governor or the executive authority of a state covered by this chapter.

      (2) The Governor of this state may:

      (a) Demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual found in the other state who is charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee; or

      (b) On the demand of the governor of another state, surrender an individual found in this state who is charged criminally in the other state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee.

      (3) A provision for extradition of individuals not inconsistent with this chapter applies to the demand even if the individual whose surrender is demanded was not in the demanding state when the crime was allegedly committed and has not fled therefrom. [2015 c.298 §75]

 

      110.673 Conditions of rendition. (1) Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the Governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.

      (2) If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the Governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the Governor of this state may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the Governor of this state may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.

      (3) If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the Governor of this state may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the Governor of this state may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order. [2015 c.298 §76]

 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 

      110.675 Uniformity of application and construction.

[2015 c.298 §77; 2017 c.17 §4]

 

      110.677 Severability clause. If any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable. [2015 c.298 §79]
