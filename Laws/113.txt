      113.005 Special administrators. (1) If, prior to appointment and qualification of a personal representative, property of a decedent is in danger of loss, injury or deterioration, or disposition of the remains of a decedent is required, the court may appoint a special administrator to take charge of the property or the remains. The petition for appointment must state the reasons for special administration and specify the property, so far as known, requiring administration, and the danger to which it is subject.

      (2)(a) Except as provided in ORS 113.007, the special administrator may not act, and letters may not be issued to the special administrator, until the special administrator provides a bond to the clerk of the court. The bond must be for the security and benefit of all interested persons and must be conditioned upon the special administrator faithfully performing the duties of the position. The bond must be executed by a surety qualified under ORCP 82 D to G.

      (b) The amount of the bond set by the court under this subsection must be adequate to protect interested persons. In setting the amount of the bond, the court shall consider:

      (A) The nature, liquidity and apparent value of the property subject to administration.

      (B) The anticipated income during administration.

      (C) The probable indebtedness and taxes.

      (3) The court may authorize the special administrator to:

      (a) Arrange for and incur expenses for the funeral of the decedent;

      (b) Incur expenses for the protection of property of the estate; and

      (c) Administer property of the estate.

      (4) The special administrator may not approve or reject claims of creditors or pay claims or expenses of administration or take possession of assets of the estate other than those in danger of loss, injury or deterioration pending the appointment of a personal representative.

      (5) Upon the appointment and qualification of a personal representative the powers of the special administrator cease. Within 30 days after the issuance of letters testamentary or letters of administration to a personal representative, the special administrator shall make and file an account and deliver to the personal representative the assets of the estate in the possession of the special administrator. If the personal representative objects to the account of the special administrator, the court shall hear the objections, and, whether or not objections are made, shall examine the account.

      (6) To the extent approved by the court, the compensation of the special administrator and expenses properly incurred by the special administrator, including a reasonable fee of the attorney of the special administrator, shall be paid as expenses of administration. [1969 c.591 §80; 1999 c.592 §1; 2016 c.42 §20; 2017 c.169 §4]

 

      113.007 Exceptions to bond requirement for special administrator. (1) A special administrator is not required to provide a bond to the court under ORS 113.005 (2) if a will provides that no bond is required of the person appointed as special administrator, but the court may, for good cause, require a bond notwithstanding any provision in a will that no bond is required.

      (2) Upon a request by the special administrator, the court may waive the requirement of a bond if:

      (a) The request states the reasons why the waiver is requested; and

      (b) The request describes the known creditors of the estate, if the special administrator will administer property of the estate.

      (3) Upon a request by the special administrator, the court may waive or reduce the requirement of a bond if the court orders the special administrator to provide written confirmation from a financial institution that property of the estate is held by the financial institution subject to withdrawal only on order of the court. [2017 c.169 §6]

 

      113.010 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.015 Venue. (1) The venue for a proceeding seeking the appointment of a personal representative and for a proceeding to probate a will is:

      (a) In the county where the decedent had a domicile or where the decedent had a place of abode at the time of death;

      (b) In any county where property of the decedent was located at the time of death or is located at the time the proceeding is commenced; or

      (c) In the county in which the decedent died.

      (2) Filing a proceeding in a county other than specified in subsection (1) of this section does not constitute a jurisdictional defect. [1969 c.591 §81]

 

      113.020 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.025 Proceedings commenced in more than one county. (1) If proceedings seeking the appointment of a personal representative of the same estate or proceedings to probate a will of the same decedent are commenced in more than one county, they shall be stayed except in the county where first commenced until final determination there of venue. A proceeding is considered commenced by the filing of a petition. In determining venue, if the court finds that transfer to another county where a proceeding has been commenced is for the best interest of the estate, it may in its discretion order such transfer.

      (2) When the court enters an order transferring the proceeding to another county, the clerk of the court shall notify the court for the other county of the order, and the court for the other county has exclusive jurisdiction of the proceeding to the same extent and with like effect as though the proceeding were in the court on original jurisdiction. [1969 c.591 §82; 2017 c.252 §12]

 

      113.027 Limitation on admission of will to probate. A will may not be admitted to probate or an estate reopened to admit a will to probate more than one year after the estate of the decedent has been administered in Oregon and closed. [1973 c.506 §21]

 

      113.030 [Amended by 1963 c.308 §1; repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.035 Petition for appointment of personal representative and probate of will. Any interested person or the person nominated as personal representative named in the will may petition for the appointment of a personal representative and for the probate of a will. The petition must include the following information, so far as known:

      (1) The name, age, domicile, post-office address and date and place of death of the decedent.

      (2) Whether the decedent died testate or intestate.

      (3) The facts relied upon to establish venue.

      (4) The name and post-office address of the person nominated as personal representative and the facts that show the person is qualified to act.

      (5) The names, relationship to the decedent and post-office addresses of persons who are or would be the heirs of the decedent upon the death of the decedent intestate, and the ages of any who are minors.

      (6) A statement that reasonable efforts have been made to identify and locate all heirs of the decedent. If the petitioner knows of any actual or possible omissions from the list of heirs, the petition must include a statement indicating that there are omissions from the information relating to heirs.

      (7) If the decedent died testate, the names and post-office addresses of the devisees, and the ages of any who are minors. If the will devises property to a person who did not survive the decedent or who is otherwise not entitled to receive the devise, the petition must include a statement explaining why the devise failed. If the petitioner knows of any actual or possible omissions from the list of devisees, the petition must include a statement indicating that there are omissions from the information relating to devisees.

      (8) The name and post-office address of any person asserting an interest in the estate, or on whose behalf an interest has been asserted, based on a contention that:

      (a) The will alleged in the petition to be the will of the decedent is ineffective in whole or part;

      (b) There exists a will that has not been alleged in the petition to be the will of the decedent; or

      (c) The decedent agreed, promised or represented that the decedent would make or revoke a will or devise, or not revoke a will or devise, or die intestate.

      (9) The name and post-office address of any person asserting an interest in the estate, or on whose behalf an interest has been asserted, based on a contention that a parent of the decedent willfully deserted the decedent or neglected without just and sufficient cause to provide proper care and maintenance for the decedent, as provided by ORS 112.047.

      (10) Whether the original of the last will of the decedent is in the possession of the court or accompanies the petition. If the original will is not in the possession of the court or accompanying the petition and an authenticated copy of the will probated in another jurisdiction does not accompany the petition, the petition shall also state the contents of the will and indicate that it is lost, destroyed or otherwise unavailable and that it was not revoked.

      (11) A statement of the extent and nature of assets of the estate, to enable the court to set the amount of bond of the personal representative. [1969 c.591 §83; 1973 c.506 §19; 1991 c.704 §1; 2003 c.395 §10; 2005 c.741 §4; 2017 c.169 §7]

 

      113.038 Request for different method of compensation of personal representative. (1) A petition for the appointment of a personal representative under ORS 113.035 may include a request for the compensation of the personal representative to be determined by a different method than as provided in ORS 116.173 (3). The petition must set forth specific facts showing that the compensation calculated under ORS 116.173 (3) would be inadequate to compensate the personal representative for the reasonable value of the personal representative’s services. The court may grant the request if the court finds that compensation as provided in ORS 116.173 (3) would be inadequate.

      (2) If the petition includes a request for a different method of compensation under this section:

      (a) The petitioner shall give notice and a copy of the petition to the distributees of the estate, the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority. The notice shall allow 20 days for filing objections to the petition unless the court allows a different time.

      (b) A judgment appointing a personal representative under ORS 113.035 may not be entered until the court has held a hearing on the petition including the request or the time for filing objections to the petition has expired without an objection being filed.

      (3) If the court allows the petitioner’s request for a different method of compensation under this section, the personal representative may, at any time prior to or at the time of the filing of the final account or the statement in lieu of the final account under ORS 116.083, elect to be compensated as provided in ORS 116.173 (3).

      (4) Failure by the department, the authority or a distributee to object to a request for a different method of compensation under this section does not preclude the department, the authority or a distributee from objecting to the amount of the personal representative’s compensation set forth in the final account filed under ORS 116.083 on the basis that the compensation exceeds the reasonable value of the services actually provided by the personal representative. [2017 c.169 §9]

 

      113.040 [Amended by 1963 c.308 §2; repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.045 Information of escheat to Department of State Lands. (1) Upon appointment, a personal representative shall deliver or mail to the Department of State Lands a copy of the petition filed under ORS 113.035, and a copy of any last will of the decedent, if the personal representative has not identified and found all heirs and devisees of the decedent. The personal representative shall file proof of the delivery or mailing with the court.

      (2) If at any time after the appointment of a personal representative it appears that any heir or devisee of the decedent cannot be identified and found, the personal representative shall promptly deliver or mail to the Department of State Lands a notice indicating that an heir or devisee cannot be identified and found. The personal representative shall file proof of the delivery or mailing with the court.

      (3) This section does not affect the requirements of ORS 113.085 (3). [1969 c.591 §84; 2003 c.395 §11; 2007 c.284 §9; 2017 c.169 §10]

 

      113.050 [Amended by 1963 c.272 §1; repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.055 Testimony of attesting witnesses to will. (1) Upon the ex parte review of a petition for the probate of a will, an affidavit of an attesting witness may be used instead of the personal presence of the witness in court. The witness may give evidence of the execution of the will by attaching the affidavit to the will or to a photographic or other facsimile copy of the will and may identify the signature of the testator and witnesses to the will by use of the will or the copy. The affidavit shall be received in evidence by the court and have the same weight as to matters contained in the affidavit as if the testimony were given by the witness in open court. The affidavit of the attesting witness may be made at or after the time of execution of the will.

      (2) However, upon motion of any person interested in the estate filed within 30 days from the date the personal representative first delivers or mails information under ORS 113.145 (1), the court may require that the witness making the affidavit be brought before the court. If the witness is outside the reach of a subpoena, the court may order that the deposition of the witness be taken.

      (3) If the evidence of none of the attesting witnesses is available, the court may allow proof of the will by testimony or other evidence that the signature of the testator or at least one of the witnesses is genuine.

      (4) In the event of contest of the will or of probate of the will in solemn form, proof of any facts shall be made in the same manner as in an action tried without a jury. [1969 c.591 §85; 1979 c.284 §105; 2017 c.169 §11]

 

      113.060 [Amended by 1963 c.271 §1; repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.065 Establishing foreign wills. (1) The written will of a testator who died domiciled outside this state, which upon probate may operate upon property in this state, may be admitted to probate upon petition, by filing a certified copy of the will and a certified copy of the order admitting the will to probate or evidencing its establishment in the jurisdiction where the testator died domiciled.

      (2) A will offered for probate under this section may be contested for a cause that would be grounds for rejection of a will of a testator who died domiciled in this state. [1969 c.591 §86; 2017 c.169 §49]

 

      113.070 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.075 Will contest. (1) Any interested person may contest the probate of the will or the validity of the will or assert an interest in the estate for the reason that:

      (a) The will alleged in the petition for probate to be the will of the decedent is ineffective in whole or part;

      (b) There exists a will that has not been alleged in the petition to be the will of the decedent; or

      (c) The decedent agreed, promised or represented that the decedent would make or revoke a will or devise, or not revoke a will or devise, or die intestate.

      (2) An action described in subsection (1) of this section must be commenced by the filing of a petition in the probate proceedings, except that an action described in subsection (1)(c) of this section may be commenced by the filing of a separate action in any court of competent jurisdiction.

      (3) An action described in subsection (1) of this section must be commenced before the later of:

      (a) Four months after the date of delivery or mailing of the information described in ORS 113.145 if that information was required to be delivered or mailed to the person on whose behalf the action under subsection (1) of this section is filed; or

      (b) Four months after the first publication of notice to interested persons if the person on whose behalf the action under subsection (1) of this section is filed was not required to be named in the petition for probate as an interested person.

      (4)(a) A person who commences an action under subsection (1) of this section shall give notice of the action to heirs and devisees identified in the petition for probate or amended petition for probate, and to the Department of State Lands if the personal representative has delivered or mailed information to the department under ORS 113.045.

      (b) If any devisee under the contested will is a charitable trust as described in ORS 130.170, a public benefit corporation as defined in ORS 65.001 or a religious organization, a person who commences an action under subsection (1) of this section shall give notice to the Attorney General of the action.

      (5) A cause of action described in subsection (1)(c) of this section may not be presented as a claim under ORS chapter 115. [1969 c.591 §87; 1973 c.506 §23; 1991 c.704 §2; 2017 c.169 §12]

 

      113.080 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      113.085 Preference in appointing personal representative. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, upon the filing of the petition under ORS 113.035, if there is no will or if there is a will and it has been proved, the court shall appoint a qualified person the court finds suitable as personal representative, giving preference in the following order:

      (a) The personal representative named in the will.

      (b) If the surviving spouse of the decedent is a distributee of the estate, the surviving spouse of the decedent or the nominee of the surviving spouse of the decedent.

      (c) If the person is a distributee of the estate, a person who would be entitled to property of the decedent under intestate succession.

      (d) Any other distributee of the estate.

      (e) The Director of Human Services or the Director of the Oregon Health Authority, or an attorney approved under ORS 113.086, if the decedent received public assistance as defined in ORS 411.010, received medical assistance as defined in ORS 414.025 or received care at an institution described in ORS 179.321 (1) and it appears that the assistance or the cost of care may be recovered from the estate of the decedent.

      (f) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs, if the decedent was a protected person under ORS 406.050 (10) and the department has joined in the petition for such appointment.

      (g) Any other person.

      (2) Before the court appoints a personal representative under subsection (1)(b) to (g) of this section, the court may require the petitioner to make a reasonable attempt to notify persons of higher priority than the proposed personal representative under subsection (1)(b) to (g) of this section.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the court shall appoint the Department of State Lands as personal representative if it appears that the decedent died wholly intestate and without known heirs. The Attorney General shall represent the Department of State Lands in the administration of the estate. Any funds received by the Department of State Lands in the capacity of personal representative may be deposited in accounts, separate and distinct from the General Fund, established in the State Treasury. Interest earned by such account shall be credited to that account.

      (4) The court may appoint a person other than the Department of State Lands to administer the estate of a decedent who died wholly intestate and without known heirs if the person filing a petition under ORS 113.035 attaches written authorization from the Department of State Lands approving the filing of the petition by the person. Except as provided by rule adopted by the Director of the Department of State Lands, the department may consent to the appointment of another person to act as personal representative only if it appears after investigation that the estate is insolvent. [1969 c.591 §88; 1971 c.421 §1; 1971 c.675 §1; 1973 c.370 §1; 1987 c.158 §17a; 1987 c.425 §1; 1989 c.966 §2; 1995 c.106 §2; 2001 c.102 §3; 2001 c.900 §15; 2003 c.395 §12; 2005 c.381 §20; 2005 c.625 §56; 2009 c.595 §76; 2009 c.602 §2; 2009 c.828 §7; 2011 c.720 §57; 2013 c.36 §33; 2013 c.688 §14; 2015 c.381 §5; 2017 c.169 §13]

 

      113.086 Approval of attorneys who are eligible to be personal representative for decedent who received Medicaid or other public assistance. The Director of Human Services, or the director’s designated representative, or the Director of the Oregon Health Authority, or the director’s designated representative, may approve in writing attorneys who are eligible to be appointed as personal representatives under ORS 113.085 if the decedent received public assistance as defined in ORS 411.010, received medical assistance as defined in ORS 414.025 or received care at an institution as defined in ORS 179.010, and it appears that the assistance or the cost of care may be recovered from the estate of the decedent. An attorney approved under this section does not represent the Director of Human Services or the Director of the Oregon Health Authority when appointed as a personal representative. [2009 c.262 §2; 2009 c.828 §6; 2013 c.688 §15]

 

      113.087 Effect of accepting appointment as personal representative; notices to be sent to representative. (1) By accepting appointment, a personal representative, whether a resident or nonresident of this state, submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by any interested person.

      (2) Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the personal representative or mailed to the personal representative by ordinary first class mail at the address as listed in the petition for appointment or as thereafter reported to the court. If the personal representative has an address different from that listed in the petition or reported to the court, the person giving the notice shall also mail the notice to that address if it is known to the person. [1973 c.506 §22]

 

      113.090 [Amended by 1969 c.591 §79; renumbered 112.695]

 

      113.092 Convicted felon as nominated personal representative. (1) A person nominated as personal representative who has been convicted of a felony shall inform the court of the conviction. The conviction shall not disqualify the nominee from acting as personal representative unless the court finds that the facts underlying the conviction are substantially similar to facts which would constitute grounds for removal of a personal representative under ORS 113.195 (2), and the court has reasonable grounds to believe that such person will be unfaithful to or neglectful of the trust.

      (2) A nominee who fails to inform the court of a felony conviction may be disqualified from acting as personal representative. A personal representative who so fails to inform the court may be removed. [1975 c.781 §8]

 

      113.095 Persons not qualified to act as personal representatives. A person is not qualified to act as personal representative if the person is:

      (1) Incapacitated or financially incapable, as those terms are defined in ORS 125.005.

      (2) A minor.

      (3) A person suspended for misconduct or disbarred from the practice of law, during the period of suspension or disbarment.

      (4) A person who has resigned from the Oregon State Bar when charges of professional misconduct are under investigation or when disciplinary proceedings are pending against the person, until the person is reinstated.

      (5) A licensed funeral service practitioner unless the decedent was:

      (a) A relative of the licensed funeral service practitioner; or

      (b) A licensed funeral service practitioner who was a partner, employee or employer in the practice of the licensed funeral service practitioner who is petitioning for appointment as personal representative. [1969 c.591 §89; 1973 c.308 §1; 1973 c.506 §24; 1975 c.781 §6; 1993 c.287 §1; 2001 c.779 §11; 2003 c.14 §43; 2017 c.169 §14]

 

      113.105 Bond for personal representative. (1)(a) Except as provided in subsections (2) to (4) of this section, the personal representative may not act, and letters may not be issued to the personal representative, until the personal representative provides a bond to the clerk of the court. The bond must be for the security and benefit of all interested persons and must be conditioned upon the personal representative faithfully performing the duties of the position. The bond must be executed by a surety qualified under ORCP 82 D to G.

      (b) The amount of the bond set by the court under this subsection must be adequate to protect interested persons. In setting the amount of the bond, the court shall consider:

      (A) The nature, liquidity and apparent value of the assets of the estate.

      (B) The anticipated income during administration.

      (C) The probable indebtedness and taxes.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply if:

      (a) The will provides that no bond is required, but the court may, for good cause, require a bond notwithstanding any provision in a will that no bond is required;

      (b) The personal representative is the sole heir or devisee, but the court may, for good cause, require a bond notwithstanding the fact that the personal representative is the sole heir or devisee; or

      (c) The personal representative is the Department of State Lands, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the Director of Human Services, the Director of the Oregon Health Authority or an attorney approved under ORS 113.086.

      (3) Upon a request by the personal representative, the court may waive the requirement of a bond if:

      (a) The request states the reasons why the waiver is requested; and

      (b) The request describes the known creditors of the estate.

      (4) The court may waive or reduce the requirement of a bond to the extent that:

      (a) The personal representative provides written confirmation from a financial institution that property of the estate is held by the financial institution subject to withdrawal only on order of the court; or
