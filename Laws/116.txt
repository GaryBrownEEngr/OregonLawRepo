      (2) Unless the will otherwise provides, income from the assets of a decedent’s estate after the death of the testator and before distribution, including income from property used to discharge liabilities, shall be determined in accordance with the rules applicable to a trustee under ORS chapter 129 and this section and distributed as follows:

      (a) To specific legatees and devisees, the income from the property bequeathed or devised to them respectively, less taxes, ordinary repairs, and other expenses of management and operation of the property, and an appropriate portion of interest accrued since the death of the testator and of taxes imposed on income, excluding taxes on capital gains, that accrue during the period of administration.

      (b) To all other legatees and devisees, except legatees of pecuniary bequests that are not in trust and that do not qualify for the marital deduction provided for in section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 2056), the balance of the income, less the balance of taxes, ordinary repairs, and other expenses of management and operation of all property from which the estate is entitled to income, interest accrued since the death of the testator, and taxes imposed on income, excluding taxes on capital gains, that accrue during the period of administration, in proportion to their respective interests in the undistributed assets of the estate computed at times of distribution on the basis of inventory value.

      (3) Income received by a trustee under subsection (2) of this section shall be treated as income of the trust. [1975 c.717 §15 (enacted in lieu of 116.003); 2003 c.279 §33; 2005 c.22 §94; 2007 c.71 §29]

PARTIAL DISTRIBUTION

 

      116.013 Petition and order for partial distribution. Upon petition by the personal representative or other interested person, and after such notice and hearing as the court may prescribe, the court may order the personal representative to distribute, prior to final settlement and distribution, property of the estate to the person or persons who would be entitled to the property under the will or under intestate succession on final distribution, if the court finds that:

      (1) After the distribution sufficient assets will remain to pay support of spouse and children, expenses of administration, unpaid claims and all known unpaid creditors of the decedent or of the estate; and

      (2) The distribution may be made without loss to creditors or injury to the estate or to any interested person. [1969 c.591 §169; 1987 c.646 §1]

      116.025 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.033 Discharge of personal representative.

[1969 c.591 §171]

 

      116.043 Petition and order for refund by distributee. If, after the distribution of property under ORS 116.013, it appears that all or any part of the property distributed is required for the payment of claims and expenses of administration, including determined and undetermined state and federal tax liability, the personal representative shall petition the court to order the return of the property. Notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given as provided in ORS 111.215. Upon the hearing the court may order the distributee to return all or part of the property distributed, or to pay the value of the property as of the time of distribution, and may specify the time within which the return or payment must be made. If the property is not returned or the payment is not made within the time ordered, the person failing to return the property or pay its value may be adjudged in contempt of court and judgment may be entered against the person and the sureties of the person, if any. [1969 c.591 §172; 2017 c.169 §57]

      (7) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may by rule specify the form and contents of accounts that must be filed by a personal representative. [1969 c.591 §175; 1973 c.506 §37; 1985 c.304 §1; 1995 c.453 §2; 1997 c.631 §405; 1999 c.592 §2; 2003 c.576 §375; 2005 c.22 §95; 2005 c.123 §1; 2007 c.284 §2; 2011 c.526 §19; 2013 c.218 §14; 2017 c.169 §33; 2019 c.414 §10]

      (a) Each distributee at the last-known address of the distributee.

      (2) If a charitable trust as described in ORS 130.170, a public benefit corporation as defined in ORS 65.001 or a religious organization is a residuary beneficiary of the estate, or if a charitable trust, a public benefit corporation or a religious organization will receive less under the judgment than the amount of a specific devise to the trust, corporation or organization, the personal representative shall mail the notice under subsection (1) of this section to the Attorney General.

      (3) The notice need not be mailed to the personal representative.

      (4) Proof of the mailing to those persons entitled to notice shall be filed in the estate proceeding at or before approval of the final account.

      (5) If the Department of Human Services has presented a claim under ORS chapter 411 or ORS 416.310 to 416.340, 416.350 or 417.010 to 417.080, or the Oregon Health Authority has presented a claim under ORS chapter 414 or ORS 416.310 to 416.340, 416.350 or 416.510 to 416.990, or the Department of Corrections has presented a claim under ORS 179.620 (3), and the claim has not been settled or paid in full, the personal representative shall mail to the appropriate agency a copy of the final account at the same time, and shall make proof of the mailing in the same manner, as the notice provided for in this section.

      (6) The Oregon Health Authority may adopt rules designating the Department of Human Services as the appropriate department to receive the final account for claims presented by the authority under subsection (5) of this section. [1969 c.591 §176; 1969 c.597 §280; 1989 c.348 §14; 2001 c.487 §14; 2001 c.900 §20a; 2003 c.576 §376; 2005 c.381 §21; 2007 c.284 §13; 2009 c.595 §82; 2011 c.720 §62; 2017 c.169 §34]

 

      116.103 Objections to final account and petition. Any person entitled to notice under ORS 116.093 may, within the time fixed for the filing, file in the estate proceeding objections to the final account and petition for distribution, specifying the particulars of the objections.

      116.110 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.113 Judgment of final distribution. (1) If no objections to the final account and petition for distribution are filed, or if objections are filed, upon the hearing or upon the filing of a statement in lieu of the final account under ORS 116.083 (5), the court shall enter a general judgment of final distribution. In the judgment the court shall designate the persons in whom title to the estate available for distribution is vested and the portion of the estate or property to which each is entitled under the will, by agreement approved by the court or pursuant to intestate succession. The judgment shall also contain any findings of the court in respect to:

      (a) Advancements.

      (b) Election against will by the surviving spouse.

      (c) Renunciation.

      (d) Lapse.

      (h) Claims for which a special fund is set aside, and the amount set aside.

      (i) Contingent claims that have been allowed and are still unpaid.

      (j) Any reserve requested under ORS 116.083.

      (k) Attorney fees.

      (L) Approval of the final account or the statement filed in lieu of the final account under ORS 116.083 (5) in whole or in part.

      (2) If, by agreement approved by the court, property is distributed to persons in whom title is vested by the judgment of final distribution otherwise than as provided by the will or pursuant to intestate succession, the judgment operates as a transfer of the property between those persons.

      (3) The judgment of final distribution is a conclusive determination of the persons who are the successors in interest to the estate and of the extent and character of their interest, subject only to the right of appeal and the power of the court to vacate the judgment. [1969 c.591 §178; 1987 c.646 §2; 1989 c.921 §1; 1995 c.453 §3; 1999 c.59 §26; 2003 c.576 §377; 2005 c.568 §34; 2017 c.169 §35; 2019 c.414 §11]

      116.120 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.123 Effect of approval of final account. To the extent that the final account is approved, the personal representative and the surety of the personal representative, subject to the right of appeal, to the power of the court to vacate its final orders and to the provisions of ORS 116.213, are relieved from liability for the administration of the trust. The court may disapprove the account in whole or in part, surcharge the personal representative for any loss caused by any breach of duty and deny in whole or in part the right of the personal representative to receive compensation. [1969 c.591 §179]

 

      116.125 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.130 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.133 Distribution; order in which assets appropriated; abatement. (1) If the will expresses an order of abatement, or the testamentary plan or the express or implied purpose of the devise would be defeated by the order of abatement stated in subsection (2) of this section, the shares of the distributees abate as may be found necessary to give effect to the intention of the testator.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 112.405 as to the shares of pretermitted children, and in ORS 114.600 to 114.725 relating to the elective share of the surviving spouse, shares of distributees abate without any preference or priority as between real and personal property in the following order:

      (a) Property not disposed of by the will.

      (b) Residuary devises.

      (c) General devises.

      (d) Specific devises.

      (3) A general devise charged on any specific property or fund is considered, for purposes of abatement, property specifically devised to the extent of the value of the thing on which it is charged. Upon the failure or insufficiency of the thing on which it is charged, it is considered a general devise to the extent of the failure or insufficiency.

      (4) Abatement within each classification is in proportion to the amounts of property each of the distributees would have received had full distribution of the property been made in accordance with the terms of the will.

      (5) Persons to whom the will gives tangible personal property not used in trade, agriculture or other business are not required to contribute from that property unless the particular devise forms a substantial amount of the total estate and the court specifically orders contribution because of the devise.

      (6) When the subject matter of a preferred devise is sold or used incident to administration, abatement shall be achieved by appropriate adjustments in, or contribution from, other interests in the remaining assets. [1969 c.591 §180; 2009 c.574 §22]

 

      116.135 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.140 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.143 Interest on pecuniary devises. (1) As used in this section, “discount rate” means the auction average rate on 91-day United States Treasury bills, as established by the most recent auction of these Treasury bills and as reported by the United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt. The discount rate shall be determined, with reference to the most recent auction date, before May 15 and before November 15 of each year.

      (2) General pecuniary devises not entitled to a share of income under ORS 116.007 (2) bear interest payable from the residuary estate at the discount rate for a period beginning one year after the first appointment of a personal representative until payment, unless a contrary intent is evidenced in the will or unless otherwise ordered by the court. [1969 c.591 §181; 2005 c.125 §1]

      116.150 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.153 Right of offset and retainer. The amount of the indebtedness of a distributee to the estate if due, or its present worth if not due, shall be offset against the interest of the distributee in the estate; but the distributee has the benefit of any defense that would be available to the distributee in a direct proceeding for recovery of the debt. The right of offset and retainer is prior and superior to the rights of judgment creditors, heirs or assignees of the distributee. [1969 c.591 §182]

 

      116.155 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.160 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.163 Distribution to foreign personal representative. When administration of an estate in this state has been completed and the estate is in a condition to be distributed, the court, upon application by the personal representative, may authorize the delivery to the personal representative of an estate of a decedent pending in a foreign jurisdiction of such property as the court finds appropriate for the payment of debts, taxes or other charges or for distribution to the distributees of the estate in the foreign jurisdiction. [1969 c.591 §183]

      116.173 Compensation of personal representative. (1) As used in this section, “property subject to the jurisdiction of the court” means:

      (b) All income received during the course of the administration of the estate;

      (c) All gains realized on the sale or disposition of assets during the course of the administration of the estate, to the extent that the gain realized on each asset sold or disposed of exceeds the value of the asset as provided in subsection (2) of this section;

      (d) All unrealized gains on assets acquired during the course of administration of the estate; and

      (e) Proceeds recovered in a wrongful death claim, as defined in ORS 114.441, by judgment or settlement.

      (2)(a) For purposes of this section, each asset shall be valued at its highest value as shown in the inventory, any amended or supplemental inventory, any interim account or the final account or statement in lieu of the final account filed under ORS 116.083, which may be based upon revaluation of the asset to reflect its then current fair market value.

      (b) If the highest value of an asset as shown in the inventory, any amended or supplemental inventory, any interim account or the final account or statement in lieu of the final account filed under ORS 116.083 was materially misstated at the time of filing of the document, the value of the asset is the highest correctly stated value of the asset as shown in the inventory, any amended or supplemental inventory, any interim account or the final account or statement in lieu of the final account filed under ORS 116.083.

      (3) Unless the court has granted a request for a different determination of the compensation of the personal representative under ORS 113.038, upon application to the court a personal representative is entitled to receive compensation for services as provided in this section.

The compensation is a commission upon the whole estate, as follows:

      (a) Upon the property subject to the jurisdiction of the court:

      (A) Seven percent of any sum not exceeding $1,000.

      (B) Four percent of all above $1,000 and not exceeding $10,000.

      (C) Three percent of all above $10,000 and not exceeding $50,000.

      (D) Two percent of all above $50,000.

      (b) One percent of the property, exclusive of life insurance proceeds, not subject to the jurisdiction of the court but reportable for Oregon estate tax or federal estate tax purposes.

      (4) In all cases, further compensation as is just and reasonable may be allowed by the court for any extraordinary and unusual services, including services not ordinarily required of a personal representative in the performance of duties as a personal representative.

      (5) When a decedent by will has made special provision for the compensation of a personal representative:

      (a) The personal representative is not entitled to any other compensation for services unless prior to appointment the personal representative signs and files with the clerk of the court a written renunciation of the compensation provided by the will.

      (b) If the assets of the estate are insufficient to pay in full all expenses or claims of the estate, the compensation of the personal representative may not exceed the compensation provided by subsections (3) and (4) of this section.

(1) A personal representative shall be allowed in the settlement of the final account all necessary expenses incurred in the care, management and settlement of the estate, including reasonable fees of appraisers, attorneys and other qualified persons employed by the personal representative. A partial award of such expenses, including fees, may be allowed prior to settlement of the final account upon petition, showing that the final account reasonably cannot be filed at that time, and upon notice as directed by the court.

      (2)(a) An award of reasonable attorney fees under this section shall be made after consideration of the customary fees in the community for similar services, the time spent by counsel, counsel’s experience in such matters, the skill displayed by counsel, the result obtained, any agreement as to fees between the personal representative and the counsel of the personal representative, the amount of responsibility assumed by counsel considering the total value of the estate, and other factors as may be relevant. No single factor is controlling.

      (b) Before the court awards attorney fees in an amount less than the amount requested by the personal representative, the court must allow the attorney an opportunity to submit additional materials supporting the requested amount.

      (c) ORCP 68 does not apply to requests for attorney fees under this section.

      (3) A personal representative who defends or prosecutes any proceeding in good faith and with just cause, whether successful or not, is entitled to receive from the estate necessary expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorney fees, in the proceeding.

If a report filed in the estate proceeding by the personal representative not less than 30 days after the date of entry of the judgment of distribution shows that payment or delivery of property in the possession of the personal representative or under the control of the personal representative cannot be made to a distributee entitled thereto, either because the distributee refuses to accept the property or because the distributee cannot be found, the court may direct the personal representative to pay or deliver the property to the Department of State Lands, to be placed in the escheat funds of the state. The personal representative shall take the receipt of the Department of State Lands stating from whom the property was received, a description of the property and the name of the person entitled to the property.

      116.208 Motion to close estate with no known assets; judgment; discharge of personal representative. (1) If the petition for appointment of the personal representative states that no assets of the estate are known to the petitioner and no assets of the estate have come into the possession or knowledge of the personal representative, the personal representative may move to close the estate no earlier than four months after the latest date of delivery or mailing of the information described in ORS 113.145.

      (4) If the court grants the motion, the court shall enter a general judgment closing the estate and discharging the personal representative. The discharge so entered operates as a release of the personal representative from further duties and as a bar to any action against the personal representative. The court may, in its discretion and upon such terms as may be just, within one year after entry of the judgment of discharge, permit an action to be brought against the personal representative if the judgment of discharge was taken through fraud or misrepresentation of the personal representative or through the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect of the claimant.

The court may, in its discretion and upon such terms as may be just, within one year after entry of the supplemental judgment of discharge, permit an action to be brought against the personal representative and the surety of the personal representative if the supplemental judgment of discharge was taken through fraud or misrepresentation of the personal representative or the surety of the personal representative or through the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect of the claimant.

The personal representative shall cause to be recorded in the deed records of any county in which real property belonging to the estate is situated, a deed from the personal representative executed in the manner required by ORS chapter 93. The execution of the bargain and sale deed does not place the personal representative in the chain of title to the property conveyed unless the personal representative is also an heir, devisee or claiming successor to the property conveyed. [1969 c.591 §189; 1991 c.191 §1; 2017 c.169 §38; 2019 c.165 §30]

The court may reappoint the former personal representative, or appoint another personal representative, to administer any additional property or to perform such other acts as are considered necessary. The provisions of law as to original administration apply, in so far as applicable, to accomplish the purpose for which the estate is reopened, but a claim that already is adjudicated or barred may not be asserted in the reopened administration. [1969 c.591 §190]

The reasonable unpaid cost of care and maintenance shall be determined in accordance with ORS 179.701.

      (5) For the purposes of this section, the death of the decedent is presumed to have occurred on the date shown in the decedent’s certified copy of the death record or in any other similar document issued by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred or issued by an agency of the federal government.

      (2) “Person” means any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, corporation, government, political subdivision, governmental agency or local governmental agency.

      (3) “Person interested in the estate” means any person entitled to receive, or who has received, from a decedent or by reason of the death of a decedent any property or interest therein included in the decedent’s estate. It includes a personal representative, guardian, conservator or trustee.

      (4) “State” means any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

      (5) “Tax” means the federal estate tax and the estate tax payable to this state under ORS 118.005 to 118.540, and interest and penalties imposed in addition to the tax. [1969 c.591 §194; 1977 c.666 §32; 2011 c.526 §21]

      116.310 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.313 Apportionment among interested persons; valuations; apportionment directed by will or trust. Unless the will, or a revocable trust of which the decedent is settlor, otherwise provides, the tax shall be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate. The apportionment shall be made in the proportion that the value of the interest of each person interested in the estate bears to the total value of the interests of all persons interested in the estate. The values used in determining the tax shall be used for that purpose. In the event the decedent’s will or revocable trust directs a method of apportionment of tax different from the method described in ORS 116.303 to 116.383, the method described in the will or revocable trust shall control. A mere testamentary direction to pay debts, charges, taxes or expenses of administration shall not be considered a direction against apportionment of estate taxes.

      116.323 Apportionment proceedings; equitable apportionment; penalties and interest; court determination. (1) The court in which the administration of the estate is proceeding may on petition for the purpose determine the apportionment of the tax.

      (2) If the court finds that it is inequitable to apportion interest and penalties in the manner provided in ORS 116.313 because of special circumstances, it may direct apportionment thereof in the manner it finds equitable.

      (3) If the court finds that the assessment of penalties and interest assessed in relation to the tax is due to delay caused by the negligence of the personal representative, the court may charge the personal representative with the amount of the assessed penalties and interest.

      (4) In any suit or judicial proceeding to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with ORS 116.303 to 116.383, the determination of the probate court in respect thereto is prima facie correct. [1969 c.591 §196]

      116.330 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.333 Withholding of tax; recovery from distributee; bond of distributee. (1) The personal representative or other person who is in possession of the property of the decedent and who is required to pay the tax may withhold from any property distributable to any person interested in the estate, upon its distribution to the person, the amount of tax attributable to the interest of the person. If the property in possession of the personal representative or other person required to pay the tax and distributable to any person interested in the estate is insufficient to satisfy the proportionate amount of the tax determined to be due from the person, the personal representative or other person required to pay the tax may recover the deficiency from the person interested in the estate. If the property is not in the possession of the personal representative or the other person required to pay the tax, the personal representative or the other person required to pay the tax may recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with ORS 116.303 to 116.383.

      (2) If property held by the personal representative is distributed prior to final apportionment of the tax, the distributee shall provide a bond or other security for the apportionment liability in the form and amount prescribed by the personal representative. [1969 c.591 §197]

 

      116.335 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.340 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      116.343 Allowances for exemptions, deductions and credits. (1) In making an apportionment, allowances shall be made for any exemptions granted, any classification made of persons interested in the estate and any deductions and credits allowed by the law imposing the tax.

      (2) Any exemption or deduction allowed by reason of the relationship of any person to the decedent or by reason of the purpose of the gift inures to the benefit of the person bearing that relationship or receiving the gift, except that when an interest is subject to a prior present interest that is not allowable as a deduction, the tax apportionable against the present interest shall be paid from principal.

      (3) Any deduction for property previously taxed and any credit for gift taxes or estate taxes of a foreign country paid by the decedent or the estate of the decedent inures to the proportionate benefit of all persons liable to apportionment.

      (4) Any credit for estate taxes in respect to property or interests includable in the estate inures to the benefit of the persons or interests chargeable with the payment of the tax to the extent that, or in proportion as, the credit reduces the tax.

      (5) To the extent that property passing to or in trust for a surviving spouse or any charitable, public or similar gift or bequest does not constitute an allowable deduction for purposes of the tax solely by reason of an estate tax or other death tax imposed upon and deductible from the property, the property shall not be included in the computation provided for in ORS 116.313, and to that extent no apportionment shall be made against the property. This subsection does not apply to any case in which the result will be to deprive the estate of a deduction otherwise allowable under section 2053(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 2053(d)) relating to deduction for state estate taxes on transfers for public, charitable or religious uses. [1969 c.591 §198; 2005 c.22 §96; 2011 c.526 §22; 2017 c.169 §40]

 

      116.353 Income interests; life or temporary interests; charging corpus. No interest in income and no estate for years or for life or other temporary interest in any property or fund is subject to apportionment as between the temporary interest and the remainder. The tax on the temporary interest and the tax, if any, on the remainder is chargeable against the corpus of the property or funds subject to the temporary interest and remainder. [1969 c.591 §199]

 

      116.363 Proceedings for recovery of tax; liability of personal representative; apportionment of amount not recovered. Neither the personal representative nor other person required to pay the tax is under any duty to institute any suit or proceeding to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to that person until the expiration of three months next following final determination of the tax. A personal representative or other person required to pay the tax who institutes the suit or proceeding within a reasonable time after the three-month period is not subject to any liability or surcharge because any portion of the tax apportioned to any person interested in the estate was collectible at a time following the death of the decedent but thereafter became uncollectible. If the personal representative or other person required to pay the tax cannot collect from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person, the amount not recoverable shall be equitably apportioned among the other persons interested in the estate who are subject to apportionment. [1969 c.591 §200]

 

      116.373 Foreign personal representatives and estates. A personal representative acting in another state or a person required to pay the tax who is domiciled in another state may institute an action in the courts of this state and may recover a proportionate amount of the federal estate tax, of an estate tax payable to another state or of a death duty due by a decedent’s estate to another state, from a person interested in the estate who is either domiciled in this state or who owns property in this state subject to attachment or execution. For the purposes of the action the determination of apportionment by the court having jurisdiction of the administration of the decedent’s estate in the other state is prima facie correct. [1969 c.591 §201]

 

      116.383 Construction. ORS 116.303 to 116.383 embody the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act and shall be construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact it. [1969 c.591 §202]
