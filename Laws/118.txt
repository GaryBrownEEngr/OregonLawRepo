      (3) If a trust or other property interest would qualify as Oregon special marital property under subsection (2) of this section except that the trust or other property interest allows principal or income to be distributed to other persons in addition to the surviving spouse, the executor may elect to set aside a share of the trust or other property interest as a separate share of the trust or property interest or as a separate trust, which shall qualify as Oregon special marital property if:

      (a) The executor makes the election described in ORS 118.016 (1);

      (b) In such other manner as the Department of Revenue prescribes by rule.

(1) The tax provided for in ORS 118.010 shall take effect at and accrue upon the death of the decedent. A return shall be filed and the tax shall be paid to the Department of Revenue on the date the federal estate tax is payable or, if no federal estate tax return is required, no later than nine months following the date of death of the decedent. If the department determines, pursuant to an amended return or refund claim, that the amount of tax imposed by ORS 118.010 is less than the amount theretofore paid, the excess tax shall be refunded by the department with interest at the rate established by ORS 305.220 for a period beginning 45 days after the due date of the return or on the date the amended return or refund claim is filed, whichever is later, and ending at the time the refund is made.

      (2) If the amount of federal estate tax reported on a federal estate tax return is changed or corrected by the Internal Revenue Service or other competent authority, resulting in a change in the Oregon taxable estate, the executor shall report the change or correction in federal estate tax to the department. If the federal change or correction results in a reduction of the Oregon taxable estate, the report of the change or correction shall be treated by the department as a claim for refund pursuant to ORS 305.270 and, notwithstanding the limitations of ORS 305.270, shall be deemed timely if filed with the department within two years after the federal correction was made. If the change or correction results in an increase in the Oregon taxable estate, the department may issue a notice of deficiency within two years after the federal change or correction was made or within two years after receiving a report of the federal change or correction, whichever is the later. Any executor filing an amended federal estate tax return shall also file an amended return with the department within 90 days thereafter.

      (3)(a) In the case of an estate that contains property that is valued under section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code for federal estate tax purposes (relating to the valuation of certain farm or other property) and that ceases to qualify for valuation under section 2032A, an additional tax under ORS 118.005 to 118.540 shall be imposed in the amount attributable to the change in the value of the estate resulting from the imposition of additional federal estate tax under section 2032A.

      (b) The department shall be notified of the disqualification of the property from valuation under section 2032A in the same time and manner as the federal Internal Revenue Service is notified of the disqualification.

      (c) The period for assessment of the tax imposed under this subsection, including any penalty or interest, shall be two years from the date on which the department receives the notice described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (d) The other provisions of ORS 118.005 to 118.540 and ORS chapter 305 shall apply to the additional tax imposed under this subsection in the same manner in which those provisions apply to the tax imposed under ORS 118.010.

      (4) For purposes of this section, a change or correction of a federal estate tax return is deemed to be made on the date of the federal audit report.

      (5) The executor shall, upon request of the department, supply a copy of the federal estate tax return which the executor has filed or may file with the federal government, or a copy of any federal agent’s report upon any audit or adjustment of the federal estate tax return.

      118.120 Qualified family-owned business interests; additional tax. (1) In the case of an estate that contains a qualified family-owned business interest, an additional tax shall be imposed under ORS 118.005 to 118.540 if:

      (a) The value of the interest was originally taken as a deduction under section 2057(a) of the Internal Revenue Code in computing the value of the taxable estate for federal estate tax purposes; and

      (b) An additional federal estate tax is imposed with respect to the qualified family-owned business interest for the reasons stated in section 2057(f) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (2)(a) The additional tax imposed under this section shall equal the amount of any allowable increase in the state death tax credit under section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code if the applicable percentage of the family-owned business interest that is being disqualified under section 2057(f) of the Internal Revenue Code were added to the taxable estate for federal estate tax purposes.

      (b) The applicable percentage to be used in calculating the additional tax under this subsection shall equal the applicable percentage used in calculating the additional federal estate tax under section 2057(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (3) The Department of Revenue must be notified of the qualified family-owned business interest being made subject to additional federal estate tax under section 2057(f) of the Internal Revenue Code at the same time and in the same manner as the Internal Revenue Service is notified of the additional federal tax.

      (4) The period for assessment of the additional tax imposed under this section, including any penalty or interest, shall be two years from the date on which the department receives the notice described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) The other provisions of ORS 118.005 to 118.540 and ORS chapter 305 shall apply to the additional tax imposed under this section in the same manner in which those provisions apply to the tax imposed under ORS 118.010. [1999 c.90 §27]

Real property for which a credit is claimed under this section may be replaced only with real property that would otherwise qualify as natural resource property and that replacement must be made within one year to avoid a disposition and additional tax, except that a replacement of property that is involuntarily converted under section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code must occur within two years.

The additional tax liability is the responsibility of the owner of the property at the time of the disposition or disqualifying event and is due within six months after the date on which the disposition or event occurs.

      118.270 Property from which tax is collectible. Except as to real property located outside of the state passing in fee from the decedent owner, the tax imposed under ORS 118.010 shall be assessed against and be collected from property of every kind, which, at the death of the decedent owner is subject to, or thereafter, for the purpose of distribution, is brought into this state and becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state for distributive purposes, or which was owned by any decedent domiciled within the state at the time of the death of the decedent even though the property was situated outside of the state.

      (2) Any part of the gross estate sold for the payment of claims against the estate and expenses of administration, for the payment of the tax imposed by ORS 118.005 to 118.540, or for purposes of distribution, shall be divested of the lien of such tax, and such lien shall be transferred to the proceeds of such sale. A mortgage on property executed for payment of claims against the estate and expenses of administration and for payment of the tax imposed by ORS 118.005 to 118.540 shall constitute a lien upon said property prior and superior to the estate tax lien, which estate tax lien shall attach to the proceeds of such mortgage.

The payment thereof shall be enforced by the executor, administrator or trustee in the same manner that payment of the bequest or legacy is enforced, or by the Department of Revenue in the same manner as income taxes are collected under ORS chapter 314.

      (2) If any bequest or legacy is given in money for a limited period, the administrator, executor or trustee shall retain the tax upon the whole amount. If any bequest or legacy is not given in money, the administrator, executor or trustee shall make application to the court having jurisdiction of an accounting by the administrator, executor or trustee to make an apportionment, if the case requires, of the sum to be paid by such legatee or beneficiary, and for such further order relative thereto as the case may require. [Amended by 1961 c.455 §5; 1985 c.85 §5; 2009 c.33 §2]

 

      118.300 Deferred payment election; bond or letter of credit. Any beneficiary of any property chargeable with a tax under this chapter and personal representatives and trustees, may elect, on or before the date on which the estate tax is due and payable under ORS 118.100, not to pay the tax until the person or persons beneficially interested therein shall come into actual possession or enjoyment thereof. If it is personal property, the person or persons so electing shall give a bond or irrevocable letter of credit to the state in double the amount of the tax, with such sureties or issued by such insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 as the Director of the Department of Revenue may approve, conditioned for the payment of the tax and interest thereon, at such time and period as the person or persons beneficially interested therein may come into actual possession or enjoyment of the property, which bond shall be executed and filed, and a full return of the property made to the Director of the Department of Revenue within six months from the date of transfer thereof, as in this section provided. The bond or letter of credit must be renewed every five years. [Amended by 1969 c.591 §216; 1975 c.762 §10; 1977 c.666 §14; 1991 c.331 §34; 1997 c.99 §14; 1997 c.631 §406; 2011 c.526 §13]

 

      118.310 Transfer of stock or obligations by foreign representative or trustee; payment of tax prior to transfer. If a foreign executor, administrator or trustee assigns or transfers any stock or obligations in this state standing in the name of the decedent, or in trust for a decedent, liable to any such tax, the tax shall be paid to the Department of Revenue on or before the transfer thereof, and no such assignment or transfer is valid unless such tax is paid.

 

      118.320 [Amended by 1969 c.178 §1; 1973 c.254 §4; 1975 c.762 §11; 1985 c.85 §6; repealed by 1987 c.646 §9]

      118.350 Compromise and compounding tax; approval by court; proceedings in case of actions or suits involving title to real property. (1) Whenever an estate, devise, legacy or beneficial interest therein, charged or sought to be charged with the estate tax is of such nature or is so disposed that the liability of the same is doubtful, or the value thereof cannot with reasonable certainty be ascertained under the provisions of law, the Department of Revenue may compromise with the beneficiaries or representatives of such estate, and determine the tax. The payment of the amount of the taxes so agreed upon shall discharge the lien against the property of the estate.

      (2) In any suit or action involving the title to real property, in which it appears, by the pleadings or otherwise, that an estate tax is or might be payable to the State of Oregon by reason of the death of any person whose estate has not been administered in Oregon, a copy of the pleadings shall be served upon the Department of Revenue, such service to be made as summons is served in any cause in the circuit court of this state. Thereupon further proceedings in the cause shall be suspended until the department has had an opportunity to appear therein, such appearance to be made within the time that is required by the service of summons upon a private person or corporation. The department shall appear in the cause and present the claims of the state, if any, to an estate tax, and it is the duty of the Attorney General of the state to represent the state and the department in such proceedings, and the department may compromise and compound the tax claimed to be due upon the passing of such real property. Such settlement and compromise shall be entered of record in the register of such court. Thereafter the payment of the amount of taxes so agreed upon shall discharge the estate tax lien against the property. If a compromise is not effected, the amount of tax, if any, due upon the passing of the real property shall be determined by the court as are other questions involved in such litigation, and subject to the same right of appeal to the Court of Appeals. The judgment of the court or of the Court of Appeals, if there is an appeal, is conclusive as to the amount of taxes due upon the passing of the real property and payment thereof shall discharge the lien against the property.

The department may disclose to the executor or beneficiary of any estate, or an authorized representative thereof, any information or particulars otherwise made confidential by this section, if the department determines that the executor or beneficiary has a material interest which will be affected by such information or particulars.

      (4) The department may disclose a taxpayer’s name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, refund amount or tax due to the extent necessary in connection with collection activities or the processing or mailing of returns, correspondence or forms with respect to the tax imposed under this chapter.

      (6) Each officer or employee of the department and each person described or referred to in subsection (5) of this section to whom disclosure or access to tax information is given, prior to beginning employment or the performance of duties involving such disclosure or access, shall be advised in writing of the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and ORS 118.990 (3), and shall as a condition of employment or performance of duties execute a certificate for the department, stating in substance that the person has read these provisions of law, that the person has had them explained and that the person is aware of the penalties for the violation of subsection (1) of this section.

      (2) The cost of the appraisal including the appraiser’s fee as a witness in the event of an appeal shall be paid out of the taxes collected under this chapter before the net revenue is credited to the General Fund as provided in ORS 118.510. [1979 c.516 §3; 1997 c.99 §16]
