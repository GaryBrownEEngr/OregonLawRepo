DISCLOSURE OF DIGITAL ASSETS

 

      119.011 Authority of custodian. (1) When disclosing digital assets of a user under ORS 119.006 to 119.081, the custodian may, in the custodian’s sole discretion:

      (a) Grant a fiduciary or designated recipient full access to the user’s account;

      (b) Grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the user’s account sufficient to perform the tasks with which the fiduciary or designated recipient is charged; or

      (c) Provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a record of any digital asset that, on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the user could have accessed if the user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.

      (2) A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing digital assets under ORS 119.006 to 119.081.

      (3) A custodian need not disclose under ORS 119.006 to 119.081 a digital asset deleted by a user.

      (4) If a user directs, or a fiduciary requests, a custodian to disclose some, but not all, of the user’s digital assets under ORS 119.006 to 119.081, the custodian need not disclose the digital assets if segregation of the digital assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek an order from the court to disclose:

      (a) A subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets;

      (b) All of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;

      (c) None of the user’s digital assets; or

(1) A user may use an online tool to direct the custodian to disclose to a designated recipient or not to disclose some or all of the user’s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications. If the online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding disclosure using an online tool overrides a contrary direction by the user in a will, trust, power of attorney or other record.

      (2) If a user has not used an online tool to give direction under subsection (1) of this section, or if the custodian has not provided an online tool, the user may allow or prohibit in a will, trust, power of attorney or other record disclosure to a fiduciary of some or all of the user’s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications sent or received by the user.

      (3) A user’s direction under subsection (1) or (2) of this section overrides a contrary provision in a terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from the user’s assent to the terms of service. [2016 c.19 §4]

      (3) A certified copy of the letter of appointment of the personal representative or a small estate affidavit or court order;

      (4) Unless the user provided direction using an online tool, a copy of the user’s will, trust, power of attorney or other record evidencing the user’s consent to disclosure of the content of electronic communications; and

      (c) A finding by the court that:

      (A) The user had a specific account with the custodian, identifiable by the information specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection;

      (B) Disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user would not violate 18 U.S.C. 2701 et seq., 47 U.S.C. 222 or other applicable law;

      (C) Unless the user provided direction using an online tool, the user consented to disclosure of the content of electronic communications; or
