      (b) After accepting the order and petition, cannot complete service within 10 days, the sheriff shall notify the petitioner or guardian petitioner, at the address provided by the petitioner or guardian petitioner, that the documents have not been served.

      (d) The court shall exercise its discretion in a manner that protects the elderly person or person with a disability from traumatic confrontation with the respondent.

      (3) Notice provided under subsection (1) of this section must be similar to the notice provided to the respondent and must contain an objection form that the elderly person or person with a disability may complete and mail to the court.

      (4) Notice under this section must be personally served on the elderly person or person with a disability. The date of personal service must be not later than 72 hours after the court issues a restraining order under ORS 124.020.

      (5) Proof of service under this section must be filed in the proceeding before the court holds a hearing under ORS 124.015. [2003 c.257 §7; 2003 c.257 §7a; 2005 c.671 §10; 2007 c.70 §28; 2015 c.119 §6]

 

      124.025 Removal of personal effects; accompanying peace officer; limitation on liability. (1) A peace officer who accompanies a party removing essential personal effects pursuant to an order issued under ORS 124.020 shall remain for up to 20 minutes and may temporarily interrupt the removal of property at any time.

      124.030 Proof of service of restraining order to be delivered to sheriff; entry in LEDS; expiration of restraining order; release of respondent pending hearing. (1) Whenever a restraining order, as authorized by ORS 124.015 or 124.020, that includes a security amount and an expiration date pursuant to ORS 124.015 and 124.020 and this section, is issued and the person to be restrained has actual notice of the order, the clerk of the court or any other person serving the petition and order shall immediately deliver to a county sheriff a true copy of proof of service, on which it is stated that personal service of the petition and order was served on the respondent, and copies of the petition and order. Proof of service may be made by affidavit or by declaration under penalty of perjury. If an order entered by the court recites that the respondent appeared in person before the court, the necessity for service of the order and proof of service is waived. Upon receipt of a copy of the order and notice of completion of any required service by a member of a law enforcement agency, the county sheriff shall immediately enter the order into the Law Enforcement Data System maintained by the Department of State Police. If the petition and order were served on the respondent by a person other than a member of a law enforcement agency, the county sheriff shall enter the order into the Law Enforcement Data System upon receipt of a true copy of proof of service. Entry into the Law Enforcement Data System constitutes notice to all law enforcement agencies of the existence of the order. Law enforcement agencies shall establish procedures adequate to ensure that an officer at the scene of an alleged violation of the order may be informed of the existence and terms of the order. The order is fully enforceable in any county in this state.

      (2)(a) A restraining order shall remain in effect until the order expires or is terminated by court order.
