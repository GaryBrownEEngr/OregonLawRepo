      You have the right to object to the appointment of a guardian by saying you want to continue to make your own decisions. If you do not want another person, agency or business making decisions for you, you can object. If you do not want ________ (Proposed Guardian) to make these decisions for you, you can object. If you do not want your money to be used to pay for these expenses, you can object.

      You can object any time after the judge has appointed a guardian. You can ask the judge at any time to limit the kinds of decisions that the guardian makes for you so that you can make more decisions for yourself. You can also ask the judge at any time to end the guardianship.

 

      THE HEARING:

      The judge will hold a hearing if you do not want a guardian, do not want this particular person to act as your guardian or do not want your money used this way. At the hearing, the judge will listen to what you and others have to say about whether you need someone else to make decisions for you, who that person should be and whether your money should be spent on these things.

      THE COURT VISITOR:

This person is called a “visitor.” The visitor works for the judge and does not work for the person who filed the petition asking the judge to appoint a guardian for you, for you or for any other party. The visitor will come and talk to you about the guardianship process, about whether you think that you need a guardian and about who you would want to be your guardian if the judge decides that you need a guardian. The visitor will talk to other people who have information about whether you need a guardian. The visitor will make a report to the judge about whether what the petition says is true, whether the visitor thinks that you need a guardian, whether the person proposed as your guardian is able and willing to be your guardian, who would be the best guardian for you and what decisions the guardian should make for you. If there is a hearing about whether to appoint a guardian for you, the visitor will be in court to testify.

      You can tell the visitor if you don’t want someone else making decisions for you when the visitor comes to talk with you about this matter.

 

      LEGAL SERVICES:

      You can call a lawyer if you don’t want someone else making decisions for you. If you don’t have a lawyer, you can ask the judge whether a lawyer can be appointed for you.

      OBJECTION FORM:

      You can mark the blue sheet (Respondent’s Objection) that is attached to this form if you do not want someone else to make your decisions for you.

      (b) The nominated fiduciary or prefers another person to act as fiduciary.

      (10) A visitor shall determine whether the respondent or protected person, or each petitioner or the person to be adopted under ORS 109.329, wishes to be represented by counsel and, if so, whether the respondent or protected person, or each petitioner or the person to be adopted under ORS 109.329, has retained counsel and, if not, the name of an attorney the respondent or protected person, or each petitioner or the person to be adopted under ORS 109.329, wishes to retain.

      (c) The recommendations of the visitor with regard to the suitability of the nominated fiduciary, any limitations that should be imposed on the fiduciary and the need for further evaluation.

      (d) The recommendation of the visitor on any issue the court specifically asks the visitor to investigate regarding the propriety of appointing a fiduciary for the respondent.

      (e) The visitor’s determinations required by ORS 125.150.

      (3) The State Court Administrator may prescribe one or more forms to be used by visitors for filing their reports.

      (4) As soon as possible after a report is filed with the court under the provisions of this section, the clerk of the court shall mail copies of the report to any person who has filed with the court a specific request for a copy of the report. A request made under ORS 125.060 (3)(b) does not meet the requirements of this subsection unless the request specifically requests a copy of the visitor’s report.

      (5) The visitor must be present at the hearing on any objections to the appointment of a fiduciary. A visitor is entitled to reasonable compensation for attendance at the hearing. The court shall notify the visitor of the time and place of any hearing on objections to the appointment. [1995 c.664 §17; 2003 c.227 §6]

 

      125.160 Subsequent appointment of visitor. At any time after the appointment of a fiduciary, the court may appoint a visitor. The court may require the visitor to perform any duty the visitor could have performed if appointed at the time the fiduciary was appointed, including interviewing relevant persons, examining relevant records, reporting in writing to the court and being present at any hearing. [1995 c.664 §18]

 

      125.165 Qualifications and standards for visitors. (1) A presiding judge shall by court order establish:

      (a) Qualifications for persons serving as visitors for the court, in addition to those qualifications established by this section; and

      (b) Standards and procedures to be used by visitors in the performance of their duties.

      (2) A visitor may be an employee of the court. The visitor may not have any personal interest in the respondent or protected person, or any pecuniary or financial interest in the proceedings, if those interests could compromise or otherwise affect the decisions of the visitor. A visitor may not receive compensation for services rendered as a fiduciary for two or more protected persons at the same time who are not related to the fiduciary.

      (3) A visitor must:

      (a) Have the training and expertise adequate to allow the person to conduct the interviews and make the recommendations required under ORS 125.150 and 125.155, to communicate with, assess and interact with respondents and protected persons, and to perform the other duties required of a visitor; and

      (b) Demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the law so as to be able to inform a respondent or protected person of the nature and effect of a protective proceeding, to inform a respondent or protected person of the rights of the respondent or protected person in the protective proceeding, to answer the questions of a respondent or protected person and to inform fiduciaries concerning their powers and duties. [1999 c.775 §10; 2003 c.227 §2]

 

      125.170 Payment and reimbursement for visitor services. (1) Not more than once each calendar year, the court may charge a respondent or protected person for any visitor services provided during the year. The court may order reimbursement to the state from the assets of the respondent or protected person for the cost of any interview or report unless the court finds that the assessment would impose a hardship on the respondent or protected person. If the respondent or protected person is receiving public assistance or medical assistance, as defined in ORS 414.025, there is a rebuttable presumption that charging a respondent or protected person for the services of a visitor would impose a hardship.

      (2) The presiding judge by court order shall establish fees for visitors conducting interviews and preparing reports.

      (3) All amounts collected under this section in reimbursement for visitor services shall be forwarded to the State Court Administrator and are continuously appropriated to the State Court Administrator. Funds appropriated to the State Court Administrator under this section may be used by the State Court Administrator for the purpose of funding visitor services provided under ORS 125.150 and 125.155. [1999 c.775 §9; 2003 c.227 §1; 2013 c.688 §21]

      (B) The court entered a subsequent order that:

      (i) The protected person should be permanently removed from the person’s home, or continued in substitute care, because it was not safe for the protected person to be returned to the person’s home, and no subsequent order of the court was entered that permitted the protected person to return to the person’s home before the protected person’s wardship was terminated under ORS 419B.328; or

      125.215 Acceptance of appointment as fiduciary; notice of proceedings to fiduciary. (1) If the person filing a petition in a protective proceeding is also nominated in the petition as fiduciary for the respondent, the signature of the petitioner on the petition acts as acceptance of appointment upon entry of an order appointing the petitioner as fiduciary. If the person nominated as a fiduciary is not the petitioner, the person nominated must file an acceptance of the appointment before the entry of the order appointing the fiduciary.

      (2) A fiduciary must promptly file with the court any change in the name, residence or post-office address of the fiduciary.

      (b) A full and accurate disclosure of the services to be performed by the person.

      (c) A full and accurate disclosure of the anticipated costs to the estate in using the person to provide the services.

      (2) In addition to the disclosures required by subsection (1) of this section, after making such inquiry as the court deems appropriate, the court may require additional disclosures for the purpose of assessing whether the pecuniary or financial interest of the fiduciary could compromise or otherwise affect decisions made by the fiduciary in carrying out the duties of the fiduciary.

      (3) The continuing authority of a court over protective proceedings under ORS 125.025 includes the authority to supervise and inquire into:

      (a) Whether the fiduciary by employing a person in which the fiduciary has a pecuniary or financial interest is acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes for which the fiduciary was appointed.

      (4) In addition to the disclosures required by subsections (1) and (2) of this section, prior court approval is required for payment of compensation to a person who is the spouse, parent or child of the fiduciary or to a business entity in which the spouse, parent or child of the fiduciary has an ownership interest and that is employed by the fiduciary to provide direct services to a protected person or to provide services to the fiduciary that directly affect the protected person.

      (a) The specific services to be provided;

      (b) The qualifications of the person providing the services;

      (a) Any direct or indirect ownership interest in the person;

      (b) A business association with the person; or

      (c) Any financial involvement with the person.

      (7) A fiduciary has a pecuniary or financial interest in another person for the purposes of this section if the fiduciary, or any person related to, employed by or affiliated with the fiduciary, receives remuneration or any other financial benefit from the person, without regard to whether that remuneration or benefit is directly tied to the services provided to the fiduciary or protected person.

      (8) In addition to the grounds specified in subsections (6) and (7) of this section, a fiduciary has a pecuniary or financial interest in another person for the purposes of this section if the relationship between the fiduciary and other person is such that the relationship could compromise or otherwise affect decisions made by the fiduciary in carrying out the duties of the fiduciary.

      (9) A fiduciary employs a person for the purposes of this section whether the person is engaged as an employee or as an independent contractor. [1999 c.774 §2 (enacted in lieu of 125.220); 2003 c.392 §1]

 

      125.225 Removal of fiduciary. (1) A court shall remove a fiduciary whenever that removal is in the best interests of the protected person.

      (2) In addition to any other grounds, the court may remove a conservator if the conservator fails to use good business judgment and diligence in the management of the estate under the control of the conservator. The court may apply a higher standard of care to a conservator who claims to have greater than ordinary skill or expertise.

      (3) In addition to any other grounds, the court may remove a guardian if the court determines the guardian:

      (a) Unreasonably limits the protected person’s associations under ORS 125.323;

      (b) Fails to perform the guardian’s duties required under ORS 125.315 (1)(g) to (i); or

      (c) Changes the abode of the adult protected person or places the protected person in a mental health treatment facility, a nursing home or other residential facility and:

An interim fiduciary under this subsection may be appointed by the court without the appointment of a visitor, additional notices or any other additional procedure, except as may be determined necessary by the court.

      (5) Upon termination of the authority of a fiduciary, the court may appoint a successor fiduciary. A petition for appointment as successor fiduciary must be filed in the same manner as provided for an original petition, and is subject to all provisions applicable to an original petition for the appointment of a fiduciary.

(1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a fiduciary’s authority terminates upon the death, resignation or removal of the fiduciary or upon the protected person’s death. If the fiduciary is a guardian appointed solely by reason of the minority of the protected person, the fiduciary’s authority terminates upon the protected person attaining 18 years of age.

      (2) Resignation or removal of a fiduciary does not discharge the fiduciary until a final report or accounting has been approved by the court, any surety exonerated and the fiduciary discharged by order of the court.

      (3) A guardian retains the authority to direct disposition of the remains of a deceased protected person if the guardian is unaware of any contact during the 12-month period immediately preceding the death of the protected person between the protected person and any person with priority over the fiduciary to control disposition of the remains under ORS 97.130 or to make an anatomical gift under ORS 97.965.

GUARDIANS

 

      125.300 In general. (1) A guardian may be appointed for an adult person only as is necessary to promote and protect the well-being of the protected person. A guardianship for an adult person must be designed to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence of the protected person and may be ordered only to the extent necessitated by the person’s actual mental and physical limitations.

      (2) An adult protected person for whom a guardian has been appointed is not presumed to be incompetent.

      (3) A protected person retains all legal and civil rights provided by law except those that have been expressly limited by court order or specifically granted to the guardian by the court. Rights retained by the person include but are not limited to the right to contact and retain counsel and to have access to personal records. [1995 c.664 §27]

 

      125.305 Order of appointment. (1) After determining that conditions for the appointment of a guardian have been established, the court may appoint a guardian as requested if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that:

      (a) The respondent is a minor in need of a guardian or the respondent is incapacitated;

      (b) The appointment is necessary as a means of providing continuing care and supervision of the respondent; and

      (c) The nominated person is both qualified and suitable, and is willing to serve.

      (2) The court shall make a guardianship order that is no more restrictive upon the liberty of the protected person than is reasonably necessary to protect the person. In making the order the court shall consider the information in the petition, the report of the visitor, the report of any physician, naturopathic physician or psychologist who has examined the respondent, if there was an examination and the evidence presented at any hearing.

      (3) The court may require that a guardian post bond.

      (4) The Department of Human Services may be appointed guardian of a minor if the minor has no living parents and if no willing, qualified and suitable relative or other person has petitioned the court for appointment as a guardian. [1995 c.664 §28; 2017 c.356 §11]

 

      125.310 Letters of guardianship. The court shall issue letters of guardianship to the guardian after the filing of any acceptance of the appointment and bond that may be required. A copy of the order appointing the guardian must be attached to the letters of guardianship. Letters of guardianship must be in substantially the following form:

      125.315 General powers and duties of guardian. (1) A guardian has the following powers and duties:

      (a) Except to the extent of any limitation under the order of appointment, the guardian has custody of the protected person and may establish the protected person’s place of abode within or without this state.

      (b) The guardian shall provide for the care, comfort and maintenance of the protected person and, whenever appropriate, shall arrange for training and education of the protected person. Without regard to custodial rights of the protected person, the guardian shall take reasonable care of the person’s clothing, furniture and other personal effects unless a conservator has been appointed for the protected person.

      (c) Subject to the provisions of ORS 127.505 to 127.660 and subsection (3) of this section, the guardian may consent, refuse consent or withhold or withdraw consent to health care, as defined in ORS 127.505, for the protected person. A guardian is not liable solely by reason of consent under this paragraph for any injury to the protected person resulting from the negligence or acts of third persons.

      (d) The guardian may:

      (e) The guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who has legal custody of a child, except that the guardian has no obligation to support the minor beyond the support that can be provided from the estate of the minor, and the guardian is not liable for the torts of the minor. The guardian may consent to the marriage or adoption of a protected person who is a minor.

      (f) Subject to the provisions of ORS 125.320 (2), the guardian may receive money and personal property deliverable to the protected person and apply the money and property for support, care and education of the protected person. The guardian shall exercise care to conserve any excess for the protected person’s needs.

      (g) The guardian shall promote the self-determination of the protected person and, to the extent practicable, encourage the protected person to participate in decisions, act on the protected person’s own behalf and develop or regain the capacity to manage the protected person’s personal affairs. To accomplish the duties under this paragraph, the guardian shall:

      (A) Become or remain personally acquainted with the protected person and maintain sufficient contact with the protected person, including through regular visitation, to know the protected person’s abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities and physical and mental health;

      (B) To the extent practicable, identify the values and preferences of the protected person and involve the protected person in decisions affecting the protected person, including decisions about the protected person’s care, dwelling, activities or social interactions; and

      (C) Make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive relationships and services for the protected person.

      (h) In making decisions for the protected person, the guardian shall make the decisions the guardian reasonably believes the protected person would make if the protected person were able, unless doing so would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the protected person. To determine the decision the protected person would make if able, the guardian shall consider the protected person’s previous or current instructions, preferences, opinions, values and actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.

      (i) If the guardian cannot make a decision under paragraph (h) of this subsection because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the protected person would make if able, or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the protected person would make would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the protected person, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best interest of the protected person. In determining the best interest of the protected person, the guardian shall consider:

      (A) Information received from professionals and persons that demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the protected person;

      (B) Other information the guardian believes the protected person would consider if the protected person were able; and

      (C) Other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the protected person would consider, including consequences for others.

      (2) If a conservator has been appointed for the protected person, the guardian may file a motion with the court seeking an order of the court on the duties of the conservator relating to payment of support for the protected person.

      (3) A guardian may consent to the withholding or withdrawing of artificially administered nutrition and hydration for a protected person only under the circumstances described in ORS 127.580 (1)(a), (b), (d), (e) or (f) and, if the protected person has a medical condition specified in ORS 127.580 (1)(b), (d), (e) or (f), the condition has been medically confirmed. [1995 c.664 §30; 1997 c.472 §12; 2007 c.230 §1; 2007 c.681 §27; 2019 c.198 §5]

 

      125.320 Limitations on guardian. (1) A guardian may not authorize the sterilization of the protected person.

      (2) A guardian may not use funds from the protected person’s estate for room and board that the guardian or guardian’s spouse, parent or child have furnished the protected person unless the charge for the service is approved by order of the court before the payment is made.

      (3)(a) Before a guardian may change the abode of an adult protected person or place an adult protected person in a mental health treatment facility, a nursing home or other residential facility, the guardian must file with the court and serve a statement declaring that the guardian intends to make the change of abode or placement in the manner set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b)(A) The statement must be filed and served in the manner provided for serving a motion under ORS 125.065 to the persons specified in ORS 125.060 (3) and (8) at least 15 days prior to each change of abode or placement of the protected person.

      (B) When the guardian determines that the change of abode or placement must occur in less than 15 days to protect the immediate health, welfare or safety of the protected person or others, the statement shall declare that the change of abode or placement must occur in less than 15 days to protect the immediate health, welfare or safety of the protected person or others. The statement must be filed and served with as much advance notice as possible, in no event later than two judicial days after the change of abode or placement occurs. The guardian may make the change of abode or placement prior to a hearing on any objection.

      (c) In addition to the requirements of ORS 125.070 (1), the notice given to the protected person must clearly indicate the manner in which the protected person may object to the proposed placement.

      (d) The court shall schedule a hearing on any objection to a statement filed under this subsection made in the manner provided by ORS 125.075 for presenting objections to a petition or motion in a protective proceeding. If no objection is made, the guardian may change the abode of the adult protected person or place the adult protected person in a mental health treatment facility, a nursing home or other residential facility without further court order.

      (e) The requirement that notice be served on an attorney for a protected person under ORS 125.060 (8) does not impose any responsibility on the attorney receiving the notice to represent the protected person in the protective proceeding. [1995 c.664 §31; 2001 c.473 §1; 2005 c.498 §3; 2017 c.391 §5]

      (b) “Interested person” means a protected person, a person with whom association is being limited, any fiduciary for the protected person or any person who has filed a request for notice in the proceedings.

      (2) A guardian may not limit a protected person’s preferred associations, except:

      (a) As specifically allowed by the court; or

      (b) To the extent the guardian determines necessary to avoid unreasonable harm to the protected person’s health, safety or well-being.

      (3) If a protected person is unable to communicate, the protected person’s preferred association shall be presumed based on the prior relationship between the protected person and the person with whom the association is contemplated.

      (4)(a) If a guardian limits a protected person’s association as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section, an interested person may move the court to modify the guardian’s powers with respect to limiting the association.

      (b) Motions under this subsection must be in writing, except that a protected person may move the court orally in person or by other means that are intended to convey the protected person’s motion to the court. The court shall designate the manner in which an oral motion may be made that ensures that a protected person will have the protected person’s motion presented to the court. The clerk of the court shall provide a means of reducing the oral motion to a signed writing for the purpose of filing the motion.

      (c) Any limits on a protected person’s associations in effect on the date a motion is filed under this subsection remain in effect pending the court’s action under paragraph (e) of this subsection.

      (d) The court shall schedule the hearing required under ORS 125.080 (3) on a motion under this subsection no later than 60 days following the date the motion is filed with the court. The person making the motion shall give notice to all persons entitled to notice under ORS 125.060 (3) of the date, time and place of the scheduled hearing at least 15 days before the date set for the hearing.

      (B) Modify the guardian’s powers to limit the protected person’s associations;

      (C) Remove the guardian; or

      (D) Award reasonable attorney fees and court costs associated with the motion. [2019 c.198 §2]

(Bond)

 

      125.410 Conservator’s bond. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the court shall require a conservator to furnish a bond conditioned upon faithful discharge of all duties of the conservator according to law, with sureties as specified by the court. Unless otherwise directed, the bond must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the control of the conservator plus one year’s estimated income minus the value of securities and money deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal and the value of any real property that the conservator, by express limitation of power, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization.

      (2)(a) The court may waive a bond for good cause shown.

      (b) Subsection (1) of this section does not affect the provisions of ORS 709.240, relating to a trust company acting as fiduciary, ORS 125.715, relating to a county public guardian and conservator acting as fiduciary, ORS 125.687, relating to the Oregon Public Guardian and Conservator or a deputy public guardian and conservator acting as fiduciary under ORS 125.675 to 125.691, or ORS 406.050 (10), relating to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs acting as fiduciary.

      (3) Sureties for a bond required under this section are jointly and severally liable with the conservator and with each other.

      (4) Letters of conservatorship may not be issued until the bond required by this section is approved by the court.

      (5) The bond of the conservator continues in effect until the sureties on the bond are released by order of the court.

      (6) The court may at any time increase or reduce the amount of the bond required of a conservator for the protection of the protected person and the estate of the protected person.

      (7) If a surety on a bond required by this section gives notice of intent to cancel the bond, the conservator shall execute and file in the protective proceeding a new bond before the cancellation date specified by the surety. The new bond shall be in the amount and subject to those conditions that may be required by the court. If the conservator fails to file a new bond, the authority of the conservator ends on the date specified by the surety for cancellation of the bond. The letters of conservatorship issued to the conservator are void from that date, and the conservator must make and file the final accounting of the conservator. [1995 c.664 §36; 2001 c.102 §5; 2005 c.625 §66; 2009 c.602 §4; 2014 c.117 §21; 2015 c.381 §7]

 

      125.415 Termination of bond by surety. (1) A surety may cancel the obligation of the surety upon notice in writing to the conservator and the court. The notice shall specify an effective date for the cancellation that is not less than 30 days after the date of the notice.

      (2) A surety’s obligation under a bond shall continue until court approval of an accounting covering the period during which the bond was effective and an order is entered releasing the sureties. [1995 c.664 §37]

The conservator shall also take possession of all proceeds from the sale, mortgage, lease or other disposition of property of the protected person. The conservator may permit the protected person to retain possession and control of property and funds for living requirements as appropriate to the needs and capacities of the protected person.

(1) A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without prior court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care or benefit of the protected person and the dependents of the protected person after the conservator considers recommendations relating to the appropriate standard of support, education, care and benefit for the protected person made by any parent or guardian of the protected person. The conservator is not personally responsible for sums paid to persons or organizations furnishing support, education, care or benefit to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless:

      (a) The conservator knows that the parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit from those payments; or

      (b) The recommendations made by the parent or guardian clearly are not in the best interests of the protected person.

      (2) A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without prior court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care or benefit of the protected person and the dependents of the protected person if those amounts are reasonably necessary for the support, education, care or benefit of the protected person with due regard to:

      (a) The size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the affairs of the protected person and the estate that has been conserved for the protected person;

      (b) The accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of the household of the protected person; and

      (4) The conservator may reimburse any person, including the protected person, who has expended funds for the purposes specified in this section.

The conservator may make gifts without prior court approval of up to $250 to a person in a calendar year, not to exceed an aggregate amount of $1,000 for all gifts in a calendar year. The conservator must have prior court approval for any other gifts. [1995 c.664 §41]

      (2) Create revocable or irrevocable trusts of property of the estate. A trust created by the conservator may extend beyond the period of disability of the protected person or beyond the life of the protected person. A trust created by the conservator must be consistent with the will of the protected person or any other written or oral expression of testamentary intent made by the protected person before the person became incapacitated. The court may not approve a trust that has the effect of terminating the conservatorship unless:

      (a) The trust is created for the purpose of qualifying the protected person for needs-based government benefits or maintaining the eligibility of the protected person for needs-based government benefits;

      (b) The value of the conservatorship estate, including the amount to be transferred to the trust, does not exceed $50,000;

      (1) Collect, hold and retain assets of the estate including land wherever situated, until, in the judgment of the conservator, disposition of the assets should be made.

[1995 c.664 §50]

 

(Liabilities)

 

      125.485 Liability of conservator. (1) A conservator is not personally liable on a contract entered into in the fiduciary capacity of the conservator in the course of administering the estate unless:

      125.490 Status of persons dealing with conservator. (1) A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with the conservator for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order under the provisions of this chapter is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not require the person to inquire into existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators that are indorsed on letters are effective as to third persons. A person is not required to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator.

      (2) The protection provided under subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) Is not affected by any procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceedings that resulted in the issuance of letters; and

      (3) A person who holds property in which the protected person has an interest, or who is indebted either to the protected person or to the protected person and others, may enter into transactions with the conservator with respect to the property or debt to the same extent that the person could deal with the protected person if the protected person were not under protection.

      (2) A claim may be presented by either of the following methods:

      (a) The claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator or the attorney for the conservator a written statement of the claim stating the basis of the claim, the name and address of the claimant and of the claimant’s attorney if the claimant is represented by an attorney in respect to the claim, and the amount claimed.

The court may shorten the period for cause.

      (3) The conservator may convey the security to the secured creditor in full or partial satisfaction of the claim if the secured creditor agrees to accept the conveyance as full satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the debt. [1995 c.664 §54]

 

      125.505 Notice of claim to conservator. If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is commenced against the protected person after appointment of a conservator, the plaintiff must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator or the attorney of the conservator if any judgment or order arising out of the proceeding will constitute a claim against the estate. [1995 c.664 §55]

 

      125.510 Procedure where claim disallowed. (1) If the conservator disallows a claim in whole or in part, or if the conservator does not allow or disallow a claim within 60 days after it is presented, the claimant may:

      (a) File in the conservatorship proceeding a request for a summary determination of the claim by the court, with proof of service of a copy upon the conservator or the attorney of the conservator; or

      (b) Commence a separate action against the conservator on the claim in a court of competent jurisdiction. The action shall proceed and be tried as any other action.

      (2) If the claimant requests a summary hearing, the conservator may, within 30 days after service of the request, notify the claimant in writing that if the claimant desires to prove the claim the claimant must commence a separate action against the conservator within 60 days after service of the notice. If the claimant fails to commence an action against the conservator within that time, the claim is barred.

      (3) An order allowing or disallowing in whole or in part a claim that has been considered upon a summary hearing may not be appealed. [1995 c.664 §56]
