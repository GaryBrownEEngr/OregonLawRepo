BANK ACCOUNTS FOR MINORS

 

      126.735 Legislative findings; minor’s capacity to contract for bank account; consent; liability. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that there are in the State of Oregon unemancipated minors entitled to payment or delivery of moneys under ORS 126.700, 126.725 or 126.730 who are capable of establishing and maintaining a bank account in their sole name for their sole use and administration but who cannot contract to establish a bank account due to perceived legal limitations affecting contracts with minors.

      (b) If the custodial property is subject to delayed transfer under ORS 126.872, “As custodian for _____ (name of beneficiary) under the Oregon Uniform Transfers to Minors Act until the beneficiary attains the age of ___ years.”

      126.836 Limitations on custodianship; age requirement for transfers. (1) A transfer may be made only for one beneficiary and only one person may be the custodian. All custodial property held under ORS 126.805 to 126.886 by the same custodian for the benefit of the same beneficiary constitutes a single custodianship.

      (2) A transfer may be made for the benefit of a beneficiary under ORS 126.805 to 126.886 at any time before the beneficiary attains 25 years of age. [1985 c.665 §11; 2005 c.349 §7]

 

      126.839 Validity of transfer. (1) The validity of a transfer made in a manner prescribed in ORS 126.805 to 126.886 is not affected by:

      (a) Failure of the transferor to comply with ORS 126.832 (4) concerning possession and control;

      (b) Designation of an ineligible custodian, except designation of the transferor in the case of property for which the transferor is ineligible to serve as custodian under ORS 126.832 (1); or

      (c) Death or incapacity of a person nominated under ORS 126.812 or designated under ORS 126.832 as custodian or the disclaimer of the office by that person.

      (2) A transfer made pursuant to ORS 126.832 is irrevocable, and the custodial property is indefeasibly vested in the beneficiary, but the custodian has all the rights, powers, duties and authority provided in ORS 126.805 to 126.886 and neither the beneficiary nor the beneficiary’s legal representative has any right, power, duty or authority with respect to the custodial property except as provided in ORS 126.805 to 126.886.

      (b) Register or record title to custodial property if appropriate; and

      (c) Collect, hold, manage, invest and reinvest custodial property.

      (2) In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent investor dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries. If a custodian has a special skill or expertise or is named custodian on the basis of representations of a special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise. However, a custodian, in the custodian’s discretion and without liability to the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.

      (3) A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on:

      (a) The life of the beneficiary only if the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s estate is the sole beneficiary; or

      (b) The life of another person in whom the beneficiary has an insurable interest only to the extent that the beneficiary, the beneficiary’s estate or the custodian in the capacity of custodian, is the irrevocable beneficiary.

      (4) A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the beneficiary. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the beneficiary’s interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration is so identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words: “As a custodian for _____ (name of beneficiary) under the Oregon Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.”

      (5) A custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial property, including information necessary for the preparation of the beneficiary’s tax returns, and shall make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent or legal representative of the beneficiary or by the beneficiary if the beneficiary has attained 14 years of age.

      126.846 Rights, powers and authority of custodian. (1) A custodian, acting in a custodial capacity, has all the rights, powers and authority over custodial property that unmarried adult owners have over their own property, but a custodian may exercise those rights, powers and authority in that capacity only.

      (2) This section does not relieve a custodian from liability for breach of ORS 126.842. [1985 c.665 §14]

 

      126.849 Payments to and expenditures for beneficiary; effect on duty to support beneficiary.

      (a) The duty or ability of the custodian personally or of any other person to support the beneficiary; or

      (b) Any other income or property of the beneficiary that may be applicable or available for that purpose.

      (3) A delivery, payment or expenditure under this section is in addition to, not in substitution for, and does not affect any obligation of a person to support the beneficiary. [1985 c.665 §15; 2005 c.349 §10]

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 126.862 (6), a custodian need not give a bond. [1985 c.665 §16]

 

      126.855 [1959 c.640 §11; repealed by 1967 c.300 §7; (126.856 enacted in lieu of 126.855)]

 

      126.856 [1967 c.300 §8 (enacted in lieu of 126.855); 1973 c.823 §114; 1981 c.443 §6; repealed by 1985 c.665 §27]

(1) A claim based on a contract entered into by a custodian acting in a custodial capacity, an obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial property or a tort committed during the custodianship, may be asserted against the custodial property by proceeding against the custodian in the custodial capacity, whether or not the custodian or the beneficiary is personally liable therefor.

      (2) A custodian is not personally liable:

      (a) On a contract properly entered into in the custodial capacity unless the custodian fails to reveal that capacity and to identify the custodianship in the contract; or

      (b) For an obligation arising from control of custodial property or for a tort committed during the custodianship unless the custodian is personally at fault.

      (3) A beneficiary is not personally liable for an obligation arising from ownership of custodial property or for a tort committed during the custodianship unless the beneficiary is personally at fault. [1985 c.665 §18; 2005 c.349 §12]

(1) A person nominated under ORS 126.812 or designated under ORS 126.832 as custodian may decline to serve by delivering a valid disclaimer to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative. If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing and eligible to serve was nominated under ORS 126.812, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under ORS 126.812; otherwise the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under ORS 126.832 (1). The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian.

      (2) A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under ORS 126.816 or the beneficiary as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor. If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or is removed.

      (3) A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the beneficiary if the beneficiary has attained 14 years of age and to the successor custodian and by delivering the custodial property to the successor custodian.

      (4) If a custodian is ineligible, dies or becomes incapacitated without having effectively designated a successor and the beneficiary has attained 14 years of age, the beneficiary may designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, an adult member of the beneficiary’s family, a conservator for the beneficiary or a trust company. If the beneficiary has not attained 14 years of age or fails to act within 60 days after the ineligibility, death or incapacity, the conservator for the beneficiary becomes successor custodian. If the beneficiary has no conservator or the conservator declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the beneficiary’s family or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.

      (5) A custodian who declines to serve under subsection (1) of this section or resigns under subsection (3) of this section, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian. The successor custodian by action may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.

      (6) A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the beneficiary’s family, a beneficiary’s guardian, the conservator for the beneficiary or the beneficiary if the beneficiary has attained 14 years of age may petition the court to remove the custodian for cause and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under ORS 126.816 or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.

      (a) For an accounting by the custodian or the custodian’s legal representative; or

      (b) For a determination of responsibility, as between the custodial property and the custodian personally, for claims against the custodial property unless the responsibility has been adjudicated in an action under ORS 126.859 to which the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s legal representative was a party.

      (2) A successor custodian may petition the court for an accounting by the predecessor custodian.

      (3) The court, in a proceeding under ORS 126.805 to 126.886 or in any other proceeding, may require or permit the custodian or the custodian’s legal representative to account.

      (4) If a custodian is removed under ORS 126.862 (6), the court shall require an accounting and order delivery of the custodial property and records to the successor custodian and the execution of all instruments required for transfer of the custodial property.

      126.872 Delayed transfer of custodial property to beneficiary. (1) Except as provided in this section, a person making a transfer to a custodian under ORS 126.816 or 126.819 may provide for a delayed transfer of the custodial property to the beneficiary at a specific time after the beneficiary attains the age of 21 years and:

      (a) Before the beneficiary attains the age of 25 years; or

      (b) The date on which the beneficiary attains the age of 25 years.

      (2) If the person making the transfer to the custodian under ORS 126.816 or 126.819 specifies no time for the transfer of the custodial property to the beneficiary, the custodian shall transfer the custodial property to the beneficiary on the date that the beneficiary attains the age of 21 years.

      (3) A personal representative or trustee making a transfer to a custodian under ORS 126.819 may provide for a delayed transfer of the custodial property pursuant to this section only if the governing will or trust directs that the custodial property be transferred within the time specified by subsection (1) of this section.

      (1) The transfer purports to have been made under the Oregon Uniform Gifts to Minors Act; or

      (2) The instrument by which the transfer purports to have been made uses in substance the designation “as custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act” or “as custodian under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act” of any other state, and the application of ORS 126.805 to 126.886 is necessary to validate the transfer. [1985 c.665 §22]

 

      126.879 Validation of transfer made before January 1, 1986. (1) Any transfer of custodial property made before January 1, 1986, is validated notwithstanding that there was no specific authority in ORS 126.805 to 126.886 prior to January 1, 1986, for the coverage of custodial property of that kind or for a transfer from that source at the time the transfer was made.

      (2) ORS 126.805 to 126.886 apply to all transfers made before January 1, 1986, in a manner and form prescribed in the Oregon Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, except insofar as the application impairs constitutionally vested rights or extends the duration of custodianships in existence on January 1, 1986.

      (3) ORS 126.805 and 126.869 with respect to the age of a minor for whom custodial property is held under ORS 126.805 to 126.886 do not apply to custodial property held in a custodianship that terminated because of the minor’s attainment of 18 years of age after October 4, 1973, and before January 1, 1986. [1985 c.665 §23]

      126.882 Application and construction of ORS 126.805 to 126.886. ORS 126.805 to 126.886 shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of ORS 126.805 to 126.886 among states enacting it. [1985 c.665 §24]
