POWERS OF ATTORNEY

 

      127.002 Definitions for ORS 127.005 to 127.045. For the purposes of ORS 127.005 to 127.045:

      (1) “Agent” includes an attorney-in-fact; and

      (2) “Financially incapable” has the meaning given that term in ORS 125.005. [2009 c.46 §1]

 

      127.005 When power of attorney in effect; accounting to conservator. (1) When a principal designates another person as an agent by a power of attorney in writing, and the power of attorney does not contain words that otherwise delay or limit the period of time of its effectiveness:

      (a) The power of attorney becomes effective when executed and remains in effect until the power is revoked by the principal;

      (b) The powers of the agent are unaffected by the passage of time; and

      (c) The powers of the agent are exercisable by the agent on behalf of the principal even though the principal becomes financially incapable.

      (2) The terms of a power of attorney may provide that the power of attorney will become effective at a specified future time, or will become effective upon the occurrence of a specified future event or contingency such as the principal becoming financially incapable. If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a specified future event or contingency, the power of attorney may designate a person or persons to determine whether the specified event or contingency has occurred, and the manner in which the determination must be made. A person designated by a power of attorney to determine whether the principal is financially incapable is the principal’s personal representative for the purposes of ORS 192.553 to 192.581 and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations, 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164.

      (3) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principal becoming financially incapable and either the power of attorney does not designate a person or persons to make the determination as to whether the principal is financially incapable or none of the designated persons is willing or able to make the determination, a determination that the principal is financially incapable may be made by any physician. The physician’s determination must be made in writing.

      (4) All acts done by an agent under a power of attorney during a period in which the principal is financially incapable have the same effect, and inure to the benefit of and bind the principal, as though the principal were not financially incapable.

      (5) If a conservator is appointed for a principal, the agent shall account to the conservator, rather than to the principal, for so long as the conservatorship lasts. The conservator has the same power that the principal would have to revoke, suspend or terminate all or any part of the power of attorney.

      (6) This section does not apply to ORS 127.505 to 127.660. [Formerly 126.407; 1993 c.767 §25; 2001 c.395 §4; 2009 c.46 §2; 2018 c.36 §10]

 

      127.010 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      127.015 Power of attorney not revoked until death or other event known. (1) The death of a principal who has executed a power of attorney in writing, or the occurrence of any other event that would otherwise terminate the authority of the agent, does not revoke or terminate the authority of an agent who, without actual knowledge of the death of the principal or other event, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. Any action so taken, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and heirs, devisees and personal representatives of the principal.

      (2) An affidavit executed by an agent that states that the agent did not have, at the time of doing an act under the power of attorney, actual knowledge of the revocation or termination of the power of attorney by death or other event, is, in the absence of fraud, conclusive proof of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power at that time. If the exercise of the power requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, the affidavit may also be recorded.

      (3) This section does not alter or affect any provision for revocation or termination contained in the power of attorney. [Formerly 126.413; 2009 c.46 §3]

 

      127.020 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      127.025 Authority under power of attorney recognizable regardless of date of execution. A person may not refuse to recognize the authority of an agent under a power of attorney based solely on the passage of time since the power of attorney was executed. [2001 c.395 §1; 2009 c.46 §4]

 

      127.030 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      127.035 Limitations on liability of person reasonably relying on power of attorney. Any person who reasonably relies in good faith on the authority of an agent under a power of attorney is not liable to any other person based on that reliance, and is not required to ensure that assets of the principal that are paid or delivered to the agent are properly applied. Any person who has not received actual notice of revocation of a power of attorney is not liable to any other person by reason of relying on a power of attorney that has been revoked. [2001 c.395 §2; 2009 c.46 §5]

 

      127.040 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

 

      127.045 Duty of agent under power of attorney. Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney document, an agent must use the property of the principal for the benefit of the principal. [2001 c.395 §3; 2009 c.46 §6]

 

      127.050 [Repealed by 1969 c.591 §305]

A health care representative who is known to a health care provider to be available to make health care decisions has priority over any person other than the principal to act for the principal with respect to health care decisions. A health care representative has authority to make a health care decision for a principal only when the principal is incapable.

      (2) A health care representative is not personally responsible for the cost of health care provided to the principal solely because the health care representative makes health care decisions for the principal.

      (3) Except to the extent that the right is limited by the appointment or by federal law or regulation, a health care representative for an incapable principal has the same right as the principal to receive information regarding the proposed health care, to receive and review medical records and to consent to the disclosure of medical records. The right of the health care representative to receive information as described in this section is not a waiver of any evidentiary privilege or any right to assert confidentiality with respect to others.

      (4) In making health care decisions, a health care representative has a duty to act consistently with the desires of the principal as expressed in the principal’s advance directive, or as otherwise made known by the principal to the health care representative. If the principal’s preferences are unknown, a health care representative has a duty to act in a manner that the health care representative in good faith believes to be in the best interests of the principal.

      (5) ORS 127.505 to 127.660 do not authorize a health care representative or health care provider to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining procedures or artificially administered nutrition and hydration if the principal manifests an objection to the health care decision. If the principal objects to the health care decision, the health care provider shall proceed as though the principal is capable with respect to the health care decision.

      (6) An advance directive or form appointing a health care representative that would be valid except that the advance directive or form appointing a health care representative is expired, is not properly witnessed or otherwise fails to meet the formal requirements of ORS 127.505 to 127.660 shall constitute evidence of the patient’s desires and interests.

      (7) A health care representative is a personal representative for the purposes of ORS 192.553 to 192.581 and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations, 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164. [1989 c.914 §7; 1993 c.767 §9; 2005 c.53 §1; 2009 c.381 §§2,3; 2018 c.36 §13]

 

      127.540 Limitations on authority of health care representative. ORS 127.505 to 127.660 do not authorize an appointed health care representative to make a health care decision with respect to any of the following on behalf of the principal:

      (1) Convulsive treatment.

      (2) Psychosurgery.

      (3) Sterilization.

      (4) Abortion.

      (5) Withholding or withdrawing of a life-sustaining procedure unless:

      (a) The appointed health care representative has been given authority to make decisions on withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining procedures; or

      (b) The principal has been medically confirmed to be in one of the following conditions:

      (A) A terminal condition.

      (B) Permanently unconscious.

      (C) A condition in which administration of life-sustaining procedures would not benefit the principal’s medical condition and would cause permanent and severe pain.

      (D) A progressive, debilitating illness that will be fatal and is in its advanced stages, and the principal is consistently and permanently unable to communicate, swallow food and water safely, care for the principal, and recognize the principal’s family and other people, and there is no reasonable chance that the principal’s underlying condition will improve.

      (6) Withholding or withdrawing artificially administered nutrition and hydration, other than hyperalimentation, necessary to sustain life except as provided in ORS 127.580. [1989 c.914 §8; 1993 c.442 §18; 1993 c.767 §10; 2011 c.149 §1]

      127.555 Designation of attending physician or health care provider; liability of health care representative and health care provider. (1) If there is more than one physician or health care provider caring for a principal, the principal shall designate one physician or one health care provider as the attending physician or the attending health care provider. If the principal is incapable, the health care representative for the principal shall designate the attending physician or the attending health care provider.

      (2) Health care representatives, and persons who are acting under a reasonable belief that they are health care representatives, are not guilty of any criminal offense, or subject to civil liability, or in violation of any professional oath, affirmation or standard of care for any action taken in good faith as a health care representative.

      (j) Any right persons may otherwise have to make their own health care decisions, or to make health care decisions for another.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 127.505 to 127.660 and 127.995 do not in themselves impose civil or criminal liability on a health care representative or health care provider who withholds or withdraws or directs the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures or artificially administered nutrition and hydration when a principal is in a health condition other than those conditions described in ORS 127.540 (5)(b), 127.580 or 127.635 (1). The provisions of ORS 127.505 to 127.660 and 127.995 do not abolish or limit the civil or criminal liability of a health care representative under other statutory or common law if the health care representative withholds or withdraws or directs the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures or artificially administered nutrition and hydration when a principal is in a health condition other than those conditions described in ORS 127.540 (5)(b), 127.580 or 127.635 (1). [1989 c.914 §11; 1993 c.767 §15; 2011 c.149 §2]

 

      127.565 Independent medical judgment of provider; effect of advance directive on insurance. (1) In following an advance directive or the decision of a health care representative, a health care provider shall exercise the same independent medical judgment that the health care provider would exercise in following the decisions of the principal if the principal were capable.

      (2) A person may not be required to execute or to refrain from executing an advance directive or to appoint or to refrain from appointing a health care representative as a condition for insurance. A health care provider may not condition the provision of health care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive or has appointed a health care representative.

      (3) No existing or future policy of insurance is legally impaired or invalidated in any manner by actions taken under ORS 127.505 to 127.660. A person may not be discriminated against in premium or contract rates because of the existence or absence of an advance directive or appointment of a health care representative.

      (4) Nothing in ORS 127.505 to 127.660 is intended to impair or supersede any conflicting federal statute. [1989 c.914 §12; 1993 c.767 §16; 2018 c.36 §17]

 

      127.570 Mercy killing; suicide. (1) Nothing in ORS 127.505 to 127.660 and 127.995 is intended to condone, authorize or approve mercy killing, or to permit an affirmative or deliberate act or omission to end life, other than to allow the natural process of dying. In making a health care decision, a health care representative may not consider an attempted suicide by the principal as any indication of the principal’s wishes with regard to health care.

      (2) The withholding or withdrawing of a life-sustaining procedure or of artificially administered nutrition and hydration in accordance with the provisions of ORS 127.505 to 127.660 and 127.995 does not, for any purpose, constitute a suicide, assisting a suicide, mercy killing or assisted homicide. [1989 c.914 §14; 1993 c.767 §17]

 

      127.575 Instrument presumed valid. A health care provider has no duty to give effect to any instrument unless the provider has received a copy of the instrument. Health care providers are entitled to assume the validity and enforceability of an advance directive if the directive on its face is in compliance with ORS 127.505 to 127.660 and 127.995, and the provider has not been given notice of a suspension, reinstatement, revocation, superseding document, disqualification, withdrawal, dispute or other legal infirmity raising a question as to the validity or enforceability of the directive. Health care providers are entitled to assume the validity and enforceability of any other instrument if the provider has not been given notice of a suspension, reinstatement, revocation, superseding document, disqualification, withdrawal, dispute or other legal infirmity raising a question as to the validity or enforceability of the instrument. [1989 c.914 §15; 1993 c.767 §18]

 

      127.580 Presumption of consent to artificially administered nutrition and hydration; exceptions.

      (a) The person while a capable adult clearly and specifically stated that the person would have refused artificially administered nutrition and hydration.

      (b) Administration of such nutrition and hydration is not medically feasible or would itself cause severe, intractable or long-lasting pain.

      (c) The person has an appointed health care representative who has been given authority to make decisions on the use, maintenance, withholding or withdrawing of artificially administered nutrition and hydration.

      (d) The person does not have an appointed health care representative or an advance directive that clearly states that the person did not want artificially administered nutrition and hydration, and the person is permanently unconscious.

      (e) The person does not have an appointed health care representative or an advance directive that clearly states that the person did not want artificially administered nutrition and hydration, the person is incapable, and the person has a terminal condition.

      (f) The person has a progressive illness that will be fatal and is in an advanced stage, the person is consistently and permanently unable to communicate by any means, swallow food and water safely, care for the person’s self and recognize the person’s family and other people, and it is very unlikely that the person’s condition will substantially improve.

      (2) If a person does not have an appointed health care representative or an advance directive that clearly states that the person did not want artificially administered nutrition and hydration, but the presumption established by this section has been overcome under the provisions of subsection (1)(a), (b), (d), (e) or (f) of this section, artificially administered nutrition and hydration may be withheld or withdrawn under the provisions of ORS 127.635 (2), (3) and (4).

      (3) The medical conditions specified in subsection (1)(b), (d), (e) and (f) of this section must be medically confirmed to overcome the presumption established by subsection (1) of this section. [1989 c.914 §16; 1993 c.767 §18a]

      127.625 Providers under no duty to participate in withdrawal or withholding of certain health care; duty of provider who is unwilling to participate. (1) A health care provider is not under any duty, whether by contract, statute or other legal requirement, to participate in the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining procedures or of artificially administered nutrition or hydration.

      (2) If a health care provider is unable or unwilling to carry out an advance directive or the decisions of the health care representative, the following provisions apply:

      (a) The health care provider shall promptly notify the health care representative, if the principal has appointed a health care representative;

      (b) If the authority or decision of the health care representative is in dispute, the health care representative or health care provider may seek the guidance of the court in the manner provided in ORS 127.550;

      (c) If the health care representative’s authority or decision is not in dispute, the health care representative shall make a reasonable effort to transfer the principal to the care of another physician or health care provider; and

      (d) If there is no health care representative for an incapable patient, and the health care decisions are not in dispute, the health care provider shall, without abandoning the patient, either discharge the patient or make a reasonable effort to locate a different physician or health care provider and authorize the transfer of the patient to that physician or health care provider. [Formerly 97.070; 1993 c.767 §20; 2018 c.36 §18]

(1) Life-sustaining procedures that would otherwise be applied to a principal who is incapable and who does not have an appointed health care representative or applicable valid advance directive may be withheld or withdrawn in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) of this section if the principal has been medically confirmed to be in one of the following conditions:

      (a) A terminal condition;

      (b) Permanently unconscious;

      (c) A condition in which administration of life-sustaining procedures would not benefit the principal’s medical condition and would cause permanent and severe pain; or

      (d) An advanced stage of a progressive illness that will be fatal, and the principal is consistently and permanently unable to communicate by any means, to swallow food and water safely, to care for the principal’s self and to recognize the principal’s family and other people, and it is very unlikely that the principal’s condition will substantially improve.

      (2) If a principal’s condition has been determined to meet one of the conditions set forth in subsection (1) of this section, and the principal does not have an appointed health care representative or applicable valid advance directive, the principal’s health care representative shall be the first of the following, in the following order, who can be located upon reasonable effort by the health care facility and who is willing to serve as the health care representative:

      (a) A guardian of the principal who is authorized to make health care decisions, if any;

      (b) The principal’s spouse;

      (b) A case manager who receives notice under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall provide the person giving the case manager notice with any information in the case manager’s possession that is related to the principal’s values, beliefs and preferences with respect to the withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining procedures.

      (4) In exercising authority under the declaration, the attorney-in-fact has a duty to act consistently with the desires of the principal as expressed in the declaration. If the principal’s desires are not expressed in the declaration and not otherwise known by the attorney-in-fact, the attorney-in-fact has a duty to act in what the attorney-in-fact in good faith believes to be the best interests of the principal.

If the physician or other provider is unable or unwilling at any time to carry out preferences or instructions contained in a declaration or the decisions of the attorney-in-fact, the physician or provider may withdraw from providing treatment if withdrawal is consistent with the exercise of independent medical judgment that is in the best interest of the principal. Upon withdrawing, a physician or provider shall promptly notify the principal and the attorney-in-fact and document the notification in the principal’s medical record.

NOTICE TO PERSON

MAKING A DECLARATION FOR

MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT

      This is an important legal document. It creates a declaration for mental health treatment. Before signing this document, you should know these important facts:

      This document allows you to make decisions in advance about certain types of mental health treatment: psychoactive medication, short-term (not to exceed 17 days) admission to a treatment facility, convulsive treatment and outpatient services. Outpatient services are mental health services provided by appointment by licensed professionals and programs. The instructions that you include in this declaration will be followed only if a court or two physicians believe that you are incapable of making treatment decisions. Otherwise, you will be considered capable to give or withhold consent for the treatments. Your instructions may be overridden if you are being held pursuant to civil commitment law.

      You may also appoint a person as your representative to make treatment decisions for you if you become incapable. The person you appoint has a duty to act consistently with your desires as stated in this document or, if not stated, as otherwise known by the representative. If your representative does not know your desires, he or she must make decisions in your best interests. For the appointment to be effective, the person you appoint must accept the appointment in writing. The person also has the right to withdraw from acting as your representative at any time. A “representative” is also referred to as an “attorney-in-fact” in state law but this person does not need to be an attorney at law.

      This document will continue in effect for a period of three years unless you become incapable of participating in mental health treatment decisions. If this occurs, the directive will continue in effect until you are no longer incapable.

      You have the right to revoke this document in whole or in part at any time you have not been determined to be incapable. YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS DECLARATION WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERED INCAPABLE BY A COURT OR TWO PHYSICIANS. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician or other provider.

      If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you. This declaration will not be valid unless it is signed by two qualified witnesses who are personally known to you and who are present when you sign or acknowledge your signature.

NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR PROVIDER

      Under Oregon law, a person may use this declaration to provide consent for mental health treatment or to appoint a representative to make mental health treatment decisions when the person is incapable of making those decisions. A person is “incapable” when, in the opinion of a court or two physicians, the person’s ability to receive and evaluate information effectively or communicate decisions is impaired to such an extent that the person currently lacks the capacity to make mental health treatment decisions. This document becomes operative when it is delivered to the person’s physician or other provider and remains valid until revoked or expired. Upon being presented with this declaration, a physician or provider must make it a part of the person’s medical record. When acting under authority of the declaration, a physician or provider must comply with it to the fullest extent possible. If the physician or provider is unwilling to comply with the declaration, the physician or provider may withdraw from providing treatment consistent with professional judgment and must promptly notify the person and the person’s representative and document the notification in the person’s medical record. A physician or provider who administers or does not administer mental health treatment according to and in good faith reliance upon the validity of this declaration is not subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability or professional disciplinary action resulting from a subsequent finding of the declaration’s invalidity.

(Immunities and Liabilities)

 

(Section 4)

 

      127.885 §4.01. Immunities; basis for prohibiting health care provider from participation; notification; permissible sanctions. Except as provided in ORS 127.890:

      (1) No person shall be subject to civil or criminal liability or professional disciplinary action for participating in good faith compliance with ORS 127.800 to 127.897. This includes being present when a qualified patient takes the prescribed medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner.

      (2) No professional organization or association, or health care provider, may subject a person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license, loss of privileges, loss of membership or other penalty for participating or refusing to participate in good faith compliance with ORS 127.800 to 127.897.

      (3) No request by a patient for or provision by an attending physician of medication in good faith compliance with the provisions of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall constitute neglect for any purpose of law or provide the sole basis for the appointment of a guardian or conservator.

      (4) No health care provider shall be under any duty, whether by contract, by statute or by any other legal requirement to participate in the provision to a qualified patient of medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner. If a health care provider is unable or unwilling to carry out a patient’s request under ORS 127.800 to 127.897, and the patient transfers his or her care to a new health care provider, the prior health care provider shall transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient’s relevant medical records to the new health care provider.

      (5)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a health care provider may prohibit another health care provider from participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 on the premises of the prohibiting provider if the prohibiting provider has notified the health care provider of the prohibiting provider’s policy regarding participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a health care provider from providing health care services to a patient that do not constitute participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) to (4) of this section, a health care provider may subject another health care provider to the sanctions stated in this paragraph if the sanctioning health care provider has notified the sanctioned provider prior to participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 that it prohibits participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897:

      (A) Loss of privileges, loss of membership or other sanction provided pursuant to the medical staff bylaws, policies and procedures of the sanctioning health care provider if the sanctioned provider is a member of the sanctioning provider’s medical staff and participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while on the health care facility premises, as defined in ORS 442.015, of the sanctioning health care provider, but not including the private medical office of a physician or other provider;

      (B) Termination of lease or other property contract or other nonmonetary remedies provided by lease contract, not including loss or restriction of medical staff privileges or exclusion from a provider panel, if the sanctioned provider participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while on the premises of the sanctioning health care provider or on property that is owned by or under the direct control of the sanctioning health care provider; or

      (C) Termination of contract or other nonmonetary remedies provided by contract if the sanctioned provider participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while acting in the course and scope of the sanctioned provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to prevent:

      (i) A health care provider from participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while acting outside the course and scope of the provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor; or

      (ii) A patient from contracting with his or her attending physician and consulting physician to act outside the course and scope of the provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider.

      (c) A health care provider that imposes sanctions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection must follow all due process and other procedures the sanctioning health care provider may have that are related to the imposition of sanctions on another health care provider.

      (d) For purposes of this subsection:

      (A) “Notify” means a separate statement in writing to the health care provider specifically informing the health care provider prior to the provider’s participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 of the sanctioning health care provider’s policy about participation in activities covered by ORS 127.800 to 127.897.

      (B) “Participate in ORS 127.800 to 127.897” means to perform the duties of an attending physician pursuant to ORS 127.815, the consulting physician function pursuant to ORS 127.820 or the counseling function pursuant to ORS 127.825. “Participate in ORS 127.800 to 127.897” does not include:

      (i) Making an initial determination that a patient has a terminal disease and informing the patient of the medical prognosis;

      (ii) Providing information about the Oregon Death with Dignity Act to a patient upon the request of the patient;

      (iii) Providing a patient, upon the request of the patient, with a referral to another physician; or

      (iv) A patient contracting with his or her attending physician and consulting physician to act outside of the course and scope of the provider’s capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider.

      (6) Suspension or termination of staff membership or privileges under subsection (5) of this section is not reportable under ORS 441.820. Action taken pursuant to ORS 127.810, 127.815, 127.820 or 127.825 shall not be the sole basis for a report of unprofessional or dishonorable conduct under ORS 677.415 (3), (4), (5) or (6).

      (7) No provision of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall be construed to allow a lower standard of care for patients in the community where the patient is treated or a similar community. [1995 c.3 §4.01; 1999 c.423 §10; 2003 c.554 §3]

 

      Note: As originally enacted by the people, the leadline to section 4.01 read “Immunities.” The remainder of the leadline was added by editorial action.

 

      127.890 §4.02. Liabilities. (1) A person who without authorization of the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication or conceals or destroys a rescission of that request with the intent or effect of causing the patient’s death shall be guilty of a Class A felony.

      (2) A person who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request medication for the purpose of ending the patient’s life, or to destroy a rescission of such a request, shall be guilty of a Class A felony.

      (3) Nothing in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 limits further liability for civil damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional misconduct by any person.

      (4) The penalties in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 do not preclude criminal penalties applicable under other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions of ORS 127.800 to 127.897. [1995 c.3 §4.02]

 

      127.892 Claims by governmental entity for costs incurred. Any governmental entity that incurs costs resulting from a person terminating his or her life pursuant to the provisions of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 in a public place shall have a claim against the estate of the person to recover such costs and reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim. [1999 c.423 §5a]

 

(Severability)

 

(Section 5)

 

      127.895 §5.01. Severability. Any section of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 being held invalid as to any person or circumstance shall not affect the application of any other section of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 which can be given full effect without the invalid section or application.
