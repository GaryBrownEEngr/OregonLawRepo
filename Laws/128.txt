[1971 c.197 §1]

 

      128.090 Limitations on trustee’s administration of “split-interest” trust. (1) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the governing instrument or any law of this state, the trustee of a trust which is a “split-interest trust” as defined in section 4947 (a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, shall not engage in any act of self dealing as defined in section 4941 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; shall not retain any excess business holdings as defined in section 4943 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, unless the trust is one exempted from the requirements of section 4943 by section 4947 (b) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; shall not make any investment in such manner as to subject the trust to the taxes on investments which jeopardize charitable purpose imposed by section 4944 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, unless the trust is one exempted from the requirements of section 4944 by section 4947 (b) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; and shall not make any taxable expenditures as defined in section 4945 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

      (a) Any amounts payable under the terms of a trust to income beneficiaries, unless a deduction was allowed under section 170 (f) (2) (B), section 2055 (e) (2) (B), or section 2522 (c) (2) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954;

      (c) Any amounts transferred in trust before May 27, 1969. [1971 c.197 §2]

 

      128.095 Trustee may amend governing instrument of “private foundation” or “split-interest” trust with prior consent of Attorney General and benefited organizations. The trustee of a trust which is a private foundation to which ORS 128.085 applies or a split-interest trust to which ORS 128.090 applies may, with the prior consent of the Attorney General, amend the terms of the governing instrument to the extent necessary (1) to assure conformity of the governing instrument with the requirements for exemption from the taxes imposed by sections 4941 to 4945 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, including amendments which broaden, extend, reduce or limit the charitable purposes for which the trust is administered, or (2) to terminate the status of the trust as a private foundation in a manner described in section 507 (b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Prior to giving consent, the Attorney General shall determine that the proposed amendments are necessary or appropriate to achieve the charitable purposes of the trust. If the trust is for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable organizations, the trustee shall also obtain the prior consent of such organizations prior to amending the terms of the governing instrument in the manner set forth in this section. [1971 c.197 §3]

 

DEPOSIT OF SECURITIES IN CLEARING CORPORATIONS

 

      128.100 Authority of fiduciary to deposit securities in clearing corporation. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any fiduciary holding securities in a fiduciary capacity, any financial institution or trust company holding securities as a custodian or managing agent, and any financial institution or trust company holding securities as custodian for a fiduciary is authorized to deposit or arrange for the deposit of the securities in a clearing corporation as defined in ORS 78.1020. When the securities are deposited, certificates representing securities of the same class of the same issuer may be merged and held in bulk in the name of the nominee of the clearing corporation with any other securities of the same class deposited in the clearing corporation by any person regardless of the ownership of the securities, and certificates of small denomination may be merged into one or more certificates of larger denomination. The records of the fiduciary and the records of the financial institution or trust company acting as custodian, as managing agent or as custodian for a fiduciary shall at all times show the name of the party for whose account the securities are deposited. Ownership of, and other interests in, the securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of the clearing corporation without physical delivery of certificates representing the securities. A financial institution or trust company depositing securities pursuant to this section shall be subject to the rules and regulations as, in the case of state-chartered institutions, the Department of Consumer and Business Services and, in the case of national banking associations, the Comptroller of the Currency may from time to time issue. A financial institution or a trust company acting as custodian for a fiduciary shall, on demand by the fiduciary, certify in writing to the fiduciary the securities deposited by the financial institution or trust company in the clearing corporation for the account of the fiduciary. A fiduciary shall, on demand by any party to a judicial proceeding for the settlement of the fiduciary’s account or on demand by the attorney for the party, certify in writing to the party the securities deposited by the fiduciary in the clearing corporation for its account as the fiduciary.

      (2) This section shall apply to any fiduciary holding securities in a fiduciary capacity, and to any financial institution or trust company holding securities as a custodian, managing agent or custodian for a fiduciary, acting on October 5, 1973, or who thereafter may act regardless of the date of the agreement, instrument or court order by which it is appointed and regardless of whether or not the fiduciary, custodian, managing agent or custodian for a fiduciary owns capital stock of the clearing corporation.

      128.318 Standard of conduct in managing and investing institutional fund. (1) Subject to the intent of a donor expressed in a gift instrument, an institution, in managing and investing an institutional fund, shall consider the charitable purposes of the institution and the purposes of the institutional fund.

      (2) In addition to complying with the duty of loyalty imposed by law other than ORS 128.305 to 128.336, each person responsible for managing and investing an institutional fund shall manage and invest the fund in good faith and with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances.

      (3) In managing and investing an institutional fund, an institution:

      (a) May incur only costs that are appropriate and reasonable in relation to the assets, the purposes of the institution and the skills available to the institution; and

      (b) Shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the management and investment of the fund.

      (4) An institution may pool two or more institutional funds for purposes of management and investment.

      (5) Except as otherwise provided by a gift instrument, the following rules apply:

      (a) In managing and investing an institutional fund, the following factors, if relevant, must be considered:

      (A) General economic conditions;

      (B) The possible effect of inflation or deflation;

      (C) The expected tax consequences, if any, of investment decisions or strategies;

      (D) The role that each investment or course of action plays within the overall investment portfolio of the fund;

      (E) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments;

      (F) Other resources of the institution;

      (G) The needs of the institution and the fund to make distributions and to preserve capital; and

      (H) An asset’s special relationship or special value, if any, to the charitable purposes of the institution.

      (b) Management and investment decisions about an individual asset must be made not in isolation, but instead in the context of the institutional fund’s portfolio of investments as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the fund and to the institution.

      (c) Except as otherwise provided by law other than ORS 128.305 to 128.336, an institution may invest in any kind of property or type of investment consistent with this section.

      (d) An institution shall diversify the investments of an institutional fund unless the institution reasonably determines that, because of special circumstances, the purposes of the fund are better served without diversification.

      (e) Within a reasonable time after receiving property, an institution shall make and carry out decisions concerning the retention or disposition of the property or to rebalance a portfolio, in order to bring the institutional fund into compliance with the purposes, terms and distribution requirements of the institution as necessary to meet other circumstances of the institution and the requirements of ORS 128.305 to 128.336.

      (f) A person that has special skills or expertise, or is selected in reliance upon the person’s representation that the person has special skills or expertise, has a duty to use those skills or that expertise in managing and investing institutional funds. [2007 c.554 §2]

 

      128.320 [1975 c.707 §3; 1995 c.79 §47; repealed by 2007 c.554 §11]

 

      128.322 Appropriation for expenditure or accumulation of endowment fund; rules of construction. (1) Subject to subsection (4) of this section and the intent of a donor expressed in the gift instrument, an institution may appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as the institution determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes and duration for which the endowment fund is established. Unless stated otherwise in the gift instrument, the assets in an endowment fund are donor-restricted assets until appropriated for expenditure by the institution. In making a determination to appropriate or accumulate, the institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and shall consider, if relevant, the following factors:

      (a) The duration and preservation of the endowment fund;

      (b) The purposes of the institution and the endowment fund;

      (c) General economic conditions;

      (d) The possible effect of inflation or deflation;

      (e) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments;

      (f) Other resources of the institution; and

      (g) The investment policy of the institution.

      (2) To limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection (1) of this section, a gift instrument must specifically state the limitation.

      (3) Terms in a gift instrument designating a gift as an endowment, or a direction or authorization in the gift instrument to use only “income,” “interest,” “dividends” or “rents, issues or profits,” or “to preserve the principal intact,” or words of similar import:

      (a) Create an endowment fund of permanent duration unless other language in the gift instrument limits the duration or purpose of the fund; and

      (b) Do not otherwise limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) The appropriation for expenditure in any year of an amount greater than seven percent of the fair market value of an endowment fund, calculated on the basis of market values determined at least quarterly and averaged over a period of not less than three years immediately preceding the year in which the appropriation for expenditure was made, creates a rebuttable presumption of imprudence. For an endowment fund in existence for fewer than three years, the fair market value of the endowment fund must be calculated for the period the endowment fund has been in existence. This subsection does not:

      (a) Apply to an appropriation for expenditure permitted under law other than ORS 128.305 to 128.336 or by the gift instrument; or

      (b) Create a presumption of prudence for an appropriation for expenditure of an amount less than or equal to seven percent of the fair market value of the endowment fund. [2007 c.554 §3]

 

      128.325 [1975 c.707 §4; repealed by 2007 c.554 §11]

 

      128.326 Delegation of management and investment functions. (1) Subject to any specific limitation set forth in a gift instrument or in law other than ORS 128.305 to 128.336, an institution may delegate to an external agent the management and investment of an institutional fund to the extent that an institution could prudently delegate under the circumstances. An institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, in:

      (a) Selecting an agent;

      (b) Establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes of the institution and the institutional fund; and

      (c) Periodically reviewing the agent’s actions in order to monitor the agent’s performance and compliance with the scope and terms of the delegation.

      (2) In performing a delegated function, an agent owes a duty to the institution to exercise reasonable care to comply with the scope and terms of the delegation.

      (3) An institution that complies with subsection (1) of this section is not liable for the decisions or actions of an agent to which the function was delegated.

      (4) By accepting delegation of a management or investment function from an institution that is subject to the laws of this state, an agent submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state in all proceedings arising from or related to the delegation or the performance of the delegated function.

      (5) An institution may delegate management and investment functions to its committees, officers or employees as authorized by law of this state other than ORS 128.305 to 128.336. [2007 c.554 §4]

 

      128.328 Release or modification of restrictions on management, investment or purpose. (1) If the donor consents in a record, an institution may release or modify, in whole or in part, a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the management, investment or purpose of an institutional fund. A release or modification may not allow a fund to be used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose of the institution.

      (2) The court, upon application of an institution, may modify a restriction contained in a gift instrument regarding the management or investment of an institutional fund if the restriction has become impracticable or wasteful, the restriction impairs the management or investment of the fund or, because of circumstances not anticipated by the donor, a modification of a restriction will further the purposes of the fund. The institution shall notify the Attorney General of the application, and the Attorney General must be given an opportunity to be heard. To the extent practicable, any modification must be made in accordance with the donor’s probable intention.

      (3) If a particular charitable purpose or a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the use of an institutional fund becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, the court, upon application of an institution, may modify the purpose of the fund or the restriction on the use of the fund in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument. The institution shall notify the Attorney General of the application, and the Attorney General must be given an opportunity to be heard.

      (4) If an institution determines that a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the management, investment or purpose of an institutional fund is unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, the institution, within 60 days after notification to the Attorney General, may release or modify the restriction, in whole or part, if:

      (a) The institutional fund subject to the restriction has a total value of less than $25,000;

      (b) More than 20 years have elapsed since the fund was established; and

      (c) The institution uses the property in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument.

      (5) The provisions of this section apply to property and other interests given by private donors as a gift to a public body, as defined by ORS 174.109, or to any instrumentality of a public body. This subsection does not limit any other authority that a public body or an instrumentality of a public body may have to release or modify a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the management, investment or purpose of funds. [2007 c.554 §5]

 

      128.330 [1975 c.707 §5; repealed by 2007 c.554 §11]

 

      128.332 Reviewing compliance. Compliance with ORS 128.305 to 128.336 is determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time a decision is made or action is taken, and not by hindsight. [2007 c.554 §6]

 

      128.334 Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. ORS 128.305 to 128.336 modify, limit and supersede the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., but do not modify, limit or supersede 15 U.S.C. 7001(a), or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in 15 U.S.C. 7003(b). [2007 c.554 §8]

 

      128.335 [1975 c.707 §6; repealed by 2007 c.554 §11]

 

      128.336 Uniformity of application and construction. In applying and construing ORS 128.305 to 128.336, consideration must be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act.

A “business trust” is any association, including a real estate investment trust, engaged in or operating a business under a written trust agreement or declaration of trust, the beneficial interest under which is divided into transferable certificates of participation or shares, other than a trust engaged solely in exercising the voting rights pertaining to corporate shares or other securities in accordance with the terms of a written instrument.

Except as otherwise provided in its trust agreement or declaration of trust, or any amendments thereto, any business trust shall also be subject to the other provisions of ORS chapter 60 and other rights and duties existing under the common law and statutes of this state applicable to domestic and foreign corporations. Title to any real or personal property may be held in the name of the trust, one or more of the trustees or any other person as nominee. [1971 c.491 §5; 1973 c.367 §13; 1979 c.208 §6; 1987 c.94 §99]

The trustees, shareholders or beneficiaries of a business trust shall not, as such, be personally liable for any obligations of such business trust arising after June 25, 1971. Persons becoming trustees, shareholders or beneficiaries after June 25, 1971, shall not be personally liable, as such, for obligations of the business trust existing on June 25, 1971. [1971 c.491 §6; 1973 c.367 §14]

 

      128.590 Filing of trust instrument as conclusive evidence of compliance with laws; exception. For purposes of ORS 128.585, filing of the trust instrument by the Secretary of State shall be conclusive evidence that all conditions precedent required to be performed by the business trust have been complied with and that the business trust is authorized to do business in this state, except as against this state in a proceeding to cancel or revoke the filing for violations of the provisions of ORS 128.580. [1971 c.491 §7; 1985 c.728 §82]

 

      128.595 Annual report; due date; content; notice of requirement; effect of failure to file. (1) A business trust by the trust’s anniversary date shall deliver to the office of the Secretary of State for filing an annual report accompanied by the annual fee.

      (b) The names and addresses of the business trust’s trustees;

      (c) The physical street address of the business trust’s registered office in this state, which must be a location at which process may be personally served on the registered agent and which may not be a commercial mail receiving agency, a mail forwarding business or a virtual office, and the name of the trust’s registered agent at the registered office;

      (4) The Secretary of State shall mail the report form to any address shown for the business trust in the current records of the office of the Secretary of State. The business trust’s failure to receive the report form from the Secretary of State does not relieve the business trust of the trust’s duty under this section to deliver a report to the office.

      (5) If the Secretary of State finds the report conforms to the requirements of this section, the Secretary of State shall file the report.

      (6) If the Secretary of State finds that the annual report does not conform to the requirements of this section, the Secretary of State shall return the report to the business trust. The business trust shall correct the annual report and return the corrected report to the Secretary of State within 45 days after the Secretary of State returns the report.

      (7) If a business trust has not filed the report by the reporting date or has not filed a corrected report within the 45-day period, the Secretary of State shall send to the business trust a final notice advising that a report has not been filed and the Secretary of State, therefore, assumes that the business trust is no longer active unless a report is filed within 45 days after the mailing of the final notice.

      (8) Not less than 45 days after the mailing date of the final notice specified in subsection (7) of this section, the Secretary of State may assume and note on the records of the Secretary of State that the business trust is inactive. [Formerly 128.075; 1983 c.717 §29; 1985 c.351 §22; 1985 c.728 §82b; 1987 c.94 §130; 1987 c.843 §18; 1993 c.190 §17; 1995 c.215 §25; 2007 c.186 §17; 2011 c.147 §25; 2013 c.158 §33; 2017 c.705 §31]

 

      128.597 Inactivation of business trust. The Secretary of State may commence a proceeding to inactivate the trust instrument of a business trust if:

      (1) The business trust does not pay when due any fees imposed by ORS 128.560 to 128.600;

      (2) The business trust does not deliver its annual report to the Secretary of State when due;

      (3) The business trust is without a registered agent or registered office in this state;

      (4) The business trust does not notify the Secretary of State that its registered agent or registered office has been changed, that its registered agent has resigned or that its registered office has been discontinued; or

      128.599 Reinstatement of business trust following inactivation. (1) A business trust that the Secretary of State inactivated under ORS 128.597 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement within five years from the date of inactivation. The application must state:

      (a) The name of the business trust and effective date of the business trust’s administrative inactivation; and

      (b) That the ground or grounds for inactivation either did not exist or have been eliminated.

      (2) If the Secretary of State determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (1) of this section, that the information is correct and that the business trust’s name satisfies the requirements of ORS 60.094, the Secretary of State shall reinstate the business trust.

      (3) When effective, the reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative inactivation and the business trust is considered to resume carrying on the business trust’s business as if the administrative inactivation had never occurred.

      (4) The Secretary of State may waive the requirement under subsection (1) of this section that the business trust apply for reinstatement within five years after the date of administrative inactivation if the business trust requests the waiver and provides evidence of the business trust’s continued existence as an active concern during the period of administrative inactivation. [1995 c.215 §28; 2011 c.147 §26]

 

      128.600 Filing, service, copying and certification fees.

      (2) The Attorney General may classify trusts and other relationships concerning property held for a charitable purpose as to purpose, nature of assets, duration of the trust or other relationship, amount of assets, amounts to be devoted to charitable purposes, nature of trustee, or otherwise, and may establish different rules for the different classes as to time and nature of the reports required to the ends that:

      (a) The Attorney General shall receive reasonably current, annual reports as to all charitable trusts or other relationships of a similar nature, which will enable the Attorney General to ascertain whether they are being properly administered; and

      (b) The annual reports do not unreasonably add to the expense of the administration of charitable trusts and similar relationships.

      (3) The Attorney General may suspend the filing of reports as to a particular charitable trust or relationship for a reasonable, specifically designated time after the Attorney General has filed in the register of charitable trusts a written statement that the interests of the beneficiaries will not be prejudiced thereby and that annual reports are not required for proper supervision by the Attorney General’s office.

      (4) A copy of an account filed by the trustee in any court having jurisdiction of the trust or other relationship, if the account substantially complies with the rules of the Attorney General, may be filed as a report required by this section.

      (5) The first report for a trust or similar relationship hereafter established, unless the filing thereof is suspended as provided in subsection (3) of this section, shall be filed not later than four months and 15 days following the close of the first calendar or fiscal year in which any part of the income or principal is authorized or required to be applied to a charitable purpose. Subsequent annual reports shall be submitted not later than four months and 15 days following the close of each calendar or fiscal year adopted by the charitable organization.

      (A) A fee that the department shall set according to a scale graduated on the basis of the charitable organization’s receipts and income during the time covered by the report, with a lower fee applying to lower receipts and income and a higher fee applying to higher receipts and income. The minimum applicable fee is $10 and the maximum applicable fee is $400.

      (B) A fee based on a percentage of the fund balance the charitable organization has at the close of the organization’s calendar or fiscal year. The department shall set the fee under this subparagraph at not more than 0.02 of one percent of the fund balance or $2,000, whichever is less.

      (c) The charitable organization shall pay a fee that consists of both elements set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection at the time the organization files a report required under this section.

      (d) In calculating the fee element set forth in paragraph (b)(B) of this subsection, the department may not include in the fund balance any fixed assets that the charitable organization uses for operations.

      (e) The department shall ensure that the aggregate amount of fees paid under this section is sufficient to pay the department’s expenses in administering ORS 128.610 to 128.769 and 128.801 to 128.898.

      (8)(a) If the charitable organization does not pay the fee prescribed by rules adopted under subsection (7) of this section or fails to file a report by the date due, the charitable organization, in addition to the fee due, shall pay a delinquency fee in an amount the department specifies by rule. The department may increase the delinquency fee or charge additional delinquency fees based on the length of time the payment or report is delinquent.

      (b) In addition to charging any delinquency fee required under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Attorney General, in compliance with the procedures set forth in ORS chapter 183, may take either or both of these actions:

      (A) Impose a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 on any charitable organization that fails to file a delinquent report or fails to pay a delinquency fee or a fee due under subsection (7) of this section within 90 days after receiving notice of the delinquency; or

      (B) Order any charitable organization to cease soliciting contributions until the charitable organization has paid a fee or delinquency fee imposed under this section or has filed a report required under this section.

      (c) In any judicial review of the order of the Attorney General, the order shall be reversed or modified only if the court finds that the Attorney General lacked authority to issue the order or impose the penalty or that the amount of the penalty imposed was unconscionable in the circumstances.

      (d) The Attorney General may grant an extension of time for a reasonable period for filing a report upon written application filed by or on behalf of the charitable organization stating the reason that additional time should be allowed for filing the report beyond the ordinary due date. If the request is submitted on or prior to the due date for filing the report, the delinquency fee described in paragraph (a) of this subsection will not be due unless the report and fee are thereafter not filed within the extended period granted for filing the report, or, if the request is denied, within 10 days after the denial is received by the corporation.

      (9) All fees and penalties received by the Department of Justice under subsections (7) and (8) of this section shall be paid over to the State Treasurer monthly for deposit in the Department of Justice Operating Account created under the provisions of ORS 180.180.

      128.680 Investigatory authority of Attorney General.

The Attorney General may require any agent, trustee, fiduciary, beneficiary, institution, association or corporation, or other person to appear, at a named time and place, in the county designated by the Attorney General, where the person resides or is found, to give information under oath and to produce books, memoranda, papers, documents of title, and evidence of assets, liabilities, receipts or disbursements in the possession or control of the person ordered to appear.

When the Attorney General requires the attendance of any person, as provided in ORS 128.680, the Attorney General shall issue an order setting forth the time when and the place where attendance is required and shall cause the same to be delivered to or sent by registered or certified mail to the person at least 14 days before the date fixed for attendance. Such order shall have the same force and effect as a subpoena and, upon application of the Attorney General, obedience to the order may be enforced by any court having jurisdiction of charitable trusts in the county where the trust may be in existence or administered or the person receiving it resides or is found, in the same manner as though the notice were a subpoena. The court, after hearing, for cause, and upon application of any person aggrieved by the order, shall have the right to alter, amend, revise, suspend or postpone all or any part of its provisions. [1963 c.583 §11]

 

      128.700 [1963 c.583 §12; repealed by 1973 c.794 §34]

 

      128.710 Enforcement; jurisdiction of court. (1) The Attorney General may institute appropriate proceedings to secure compliance with ORS 128.610 to 128.769 and to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. A court may issue a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction to restrain violations of ORS 128.610 to 128.769 and may require a charitable organization or responsible charitable fiduciary to provide or pay for an accounting, or may order other appropriate relief. Willful failure to comply with an order of any court having jurisdiction of charitable trusts shall constitute grounds for removal of the officers, directors, trustees or other charitable fiduciary and the appointment by the court of successor officers, directors, trustees or other charitable fiduciaries. The powers and duties of the Attorney General provided in ORS 128.610 to 128.769 are in addition to existing powers and duties.

      (2) Nothing in ORS 128.610 to 128.769 shall impair or restrict the jurisdiction of any court with respect to any of the matters covered by it, except that no court shall have jurisdiction to modify or terminate any trust of property for charitable purposes unless the Attorney General is a party to the proceedings.

      128.760 Issuance of disqualification order by Attorney General; hearing request; legal effect. (1) The Attorney General may issue an order disqualifying a charitable organization from receiving contributions that are deductible as charitable donations for the purpose of Oregon income tax and corporate excise tax if the Attorney General finds that the organization has failed to expend at least 30 percent of the organization’s total annual functional expenses on program services when those expenses are averaged over the most recent three fiscal years for which the Attorney General has reports containing expense information. The calculation of program services expenses and total functional expenses shall be based on the amounts of program services expenses and total functional expenses identified by the organization in the organization’s Internal Revenue Service Form 990 return or other Internal Revenue Service return required to be filed as part of the organization’s report to the Attorney General.

      (2) A charitable organization may request a contested case hearing within 60 days after notification from the Attorney General that the Attorney General proposes to issue a disqualification order under this section. Notwithstanding a finding that the charitable organization’s program services expenses fall below the minimum percentage specified in subsection (1) of this section, the Attorney General may decline to issue a disqualification order if the organization establishes:

      (a) That the organization made payments to affiliates that should be considered in calculating the organization’s program services expenses;

      (b) That the organization is accumulating revenue for a specific program purpose consistent with representations in solicitations; or

      (c) Such other mitigating circumstances as may be identified by the Attorney General by rule.

      (3) A disqualification order under this section remains in effect until such time as the charitable organization submits sufficient information to the Attorney General to demonstrate that the organization’s program services expenses meet the minimum percentage specified in subsection (1) of this section. A charitable organization may submit information under this subsection no earlier than one year after the disqualification order becomes final, and may not submit information under this subsection more than once each year after the initial submission is made. The information submitted under this subsection must include all Internal Revenue Service Form 990 returns, or equivalent Internal Revenue Service returns, filed by the organization after the disqualification order became final.

      (4) A disqualification order under this section may not be issued to:

      (a) A private foundation as defined in section 509 of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on October 7, 2013;

      (b) A community trust or foundation operating as described in 26 C.F.R. 1.170A-9(f)(10) and (11), as in effect on October 7, 2013;

      (c) A qualified charitable remainder trust described in section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on October 7, 2013;

      (d) An organization that does not qualify to receive tax deductible contributions;

      (e) An organization that is not required to file annual reports with the Attorney General;

      (h) An organization that has been in existence for less than four years.

      (5) When a disqualification order is issued under this section, the charitable organization that is the subject of the order does not qualify for and may not claim exemption from taxation under ORS 307.130 for the tax year following the tax year in which the order went into effect and subsequent tax years in which the order remains in effect. [2013 c.260 §2]

 

      128.763 Disclosure of disqualification required in solicitations; legal effect of failure to disclose. (1) When a disqualification order issued under ORS 128.760 to 128.769 becomes effective, the charitable organization named in the order shall provide a disclosure as described in this section in all solicitations made by the organization to persons in Oregon. The disclosure must clearly and conspicuously state that contributions to the organization are not deductible as charitable donations for Oregon income tax purposes. The disclosure also must appear in any written document provided to a donor acknowledging the donation or referring to the amount of the donation. The Attorney General may specify additional disclosure requirements by rule.

      (2) Failure to provide the disclosures required by this section is a false or misleading representation for the purposes of ORS 128.886. [2013 c.260 §3]

 

      128.766 Publication of disqualified organizations on Internet; report to Department of Revenue. (1) When a disqualification order issued under ORS 128.760 to 128.769 becomes effective, the Attorney General shall publish on the Internet and otherwise make publicly available information identifying the charitable organization named in the order, the date that the order became effective and the date that the information was published on the Internet.

      (2) At least once every year the Attorney General shall file a written report with the Department of Revenue that:

      (a) Identifies all charitable organizations that are subject to disqualification orders during the period covered by the report;

      (b) The date the disqualification orders became effective;

      (c) The date that information required by subsection (1) of this section was published on the Internet for each order; and

      (d) The methods by which the public can obtain a listing of charitable organizations that are subject to disqualification orders. [2013 c.260 §4]

CHARITABLE SOLICITATIONS ACT

 

      128.801 Definitions for ORS 128.801 to 128.898. As used in ORS 128.801 to 128.898:

      (1) “Charitable purpose” means any purpose to promote the well-being of the public at large, or for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, including but not limited to educational, literary or scientific purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the benefit of religion, rehabilitation services, public recreation, civic improvement or services which lessen the burdens of government.

      (2) “Commercial fund raising solicitation” means the solicitation of funds for nonprofit beneficiaries, whether named or unspecified, through the sale of goods or services, whether the goods or services are delivered to a purchaser or donated to third parties, and where the solicitation is conducted by a commercial fund raising firm or commercial coventurer. If donors receive insubstantial items or other benefits in return for contributions, such a solicitation of funds is not a commercial fund raising solicitation if the items or benefits received are considered premiums and do not affect the deductibility of the contributions for federal income tax purposes. A solicitation is conducted by a commercial fund raising firm or commercial coventurer if the soliciting agents are under the direction and control of a commercial fund raising firm or commercial coventurer; the fact that the solicitors are paid by the beneficiary is of no consequence.

      (3) “Commercial coventurer” means any sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or any other legal entity, organized for profit or formed as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, who is regularly and primarily engaged in trade or commerce in this state other than in conjunction with the raising of funds for nonprofit purposes and who conducts commercial fund raising solicitations on an infrequent basis.

      (4) “Commercial fund raising firm” means any sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or any other legal entity, organized for profit or formed as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, who, for compensation or other consideration regularly conducts commercial fund raising solicitations.

      (5) “Professional fund raising firm” means any sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or any other legal entity, organized for profit or as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, who, for compensation or other consideration, manages or conducts the solicitation of funds, not including commercial fund raising solicitations, on behalf of any nonprofit organization.

      (6)(a) “Solicitation” means any oral or written request for a contribution, including the solicitor’s offer or attempt to sell any property, rights, services or other thing, in connection with which:

      (A) The name of any nonprofit organization is used as an inducement for making the contribution or consummating the sale; or

      (B) Any statement is made which implies that the whole or any part of the contribution or proceeds from the sale will be donated to any nonprofit organization.

      (b) “Solicitation” does not include the making of any request or appeal on behalf of a candidate, political committee or measure as defined in ORS 260.005, unless the appeal states or implies that contributions will be used, in whole or in part, for a charitable purpose or includes a representation that a ticket to an event may be donated by a contributor to the solicitors for use by another. [1985 c.729 §3; 1991 c.532 §1]

 

      128.802 Registration of professional fund raising firms required; fee; renewal; notice of change of information.

      (2) In the case of solicitation campaigns which are directed at targeted individual donors, such as in telemarketing or direct mail solicitations, the plan shall specify whether each campaign is directed toward new donor acquisitions, individual donor renewals or some combination thereof.
