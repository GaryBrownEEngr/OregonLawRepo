Absent a substantial change of circumstances, the trustee may assume that the original place of administration is also the appropriate place of administration. The duty to administer the trust at an appropriate place may prevent a trustee from moving the place of administration.

      (3)(a) A trustee may transfer the trust’s principal place of administration to another state, country or other jurisdiction if the transfer is in furtherance of the duty imposed by subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) A trustee shall notify qualified beneficiaries of the trust of a proposed transfer of the trust’s principal place of administration not fewer than 60 days before initiating the transfer. The notice of proposed transfer must include all of the following:

      (d) The trustee may transfer some or all of the trust property to a successor trustee designated in the terms of the trust or appointed pursuant to ORS 130.615 in connection with a transfer of the trust’s principal place of administration. [2005 c.348 §8]

      (1) The law of the state, country or other jurisdiction designated in the terms of the trust unless the designation of the law of that state, country or other jurisdiction is contrary to a strong public policy of the state, country or other jurisdiction having the most significant relationship to the matter at issue; or

      130.105 UTC 302. Representation by holder of testamentary power of appointment.

If the beneficiaries who are represented do not have principal that is attributable to them, compensation is an administrative expense of the trust.

      (7) Upon completion of the responsibilities of the special representative, the special representative shall move the court for an order discharging the special representative. Upon order of the court, a special representative appointed under this section shall be discharged from any further responsibility with respect to the trust. [2005 c.348 §20]

      (a) By transfer of property to another person as trustee during the settlor’s lifetime or by will or other disposition taking effect upon the settlor’s death;

      (b) By declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds identifiable property as trustee;

      (c) By exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trustee;

      (d) By an agent or attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney that expressly grants authority to create the trust; or

      (e) Pursuant to a statute or judgment that requires property to be administered in the manner of an express trust.

      (2) The following apply to trusts for death benefits:

      (a) A trustee may be named as beneficiary of any death benefits, and the death benefits shall be paid to the trustee and be held and disposed of by the trustee as provided in a trust created by the designator during the lifetime of the designator. A trust is valid even though the trust does not have a trust corpus other than the right of the trustee to receive death benefits as beneficiary.

      (b) A trustee named by will may be designated as beneficiary of death benefits if the designation is made in accordance with the provisions of the policy, contract, plan, trust or other governing instrument. Upon probate of the will, or upon the filing of a small estate affidavit under ORS 114.515, the death benefits are payable to the trustee to be held and disposed of under the terms of the designator’s will in the same manner as other testamentary trusts are administered. Unless otherwise provided by the designator, an obligor may make payment of death benefits to the personal representative of the designator, or to the persons who are otherwise entitled to the death benefits, if a qualified trustee does not claim the death benefits within one year after the death of the designator, or if satisfactory evidence is furnished within the one-year period showing that there is no trustee who can qualify to receive the death benefits. The obligor is discharged from any liability for the death benefits upon making the payment.

      (c) Death benefits received by the trustee are not subject to the debts of the designator or to inheritance or estate taxes to any greater extent than if the death benefits were payable to the beneficiaries named in the trust and not to the estate of the designator.

      (d) Death benefits held in trust may be commingled with any other assets that may properly become a part of the trust.

      (3) As used in this section:

      (a) “Death benefits” means death benefits of any kind, including proceeds of life insurance policies, payments under annuity or endowment contracts, and funds payable in connection with pension, retirement, stock bonus or profit-sharing plans, or any trust administered in connection with these arrangements.

      (b) “Designator” means the person entitled to designate the beneficiary of death benefits upon the death of the person.

      (c) “Obligor” means the insurer or other person obligated to pay death benefits. [2005 c.348 §21; 2009 c.275 §8; 2019 c.165 §24]

 

      130.155 UTC 402. Requirements for creation. (1) A trust is created only if all of the following requirements are met:

      (e) The same person is not the sole trustee and sole beneficiary.

      (2) A beneficiary is definite for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) of this section if the beneficiary can be ascertained when the trust is created or at any time thereafter, subject to any applicable rule against perpetuities.

      (3) A power of a trustee to select a beneficiary from an indefinite class is valid. If the power is not exercised within a reasonable time, the power fails and the property subject to the power passes to the persons who would have taken the property had the power not been conferred. [2005 c.348 §22; 2019 c.162 §5]

 

      130.160 UTC 403. Trusts created in other states, countries or jurisdictions. A trust not created by will is validly created if the creation of the trust complies with the law of the state, country or other jurisdiction in which the trust instrument was executed, or the law of the state, country or other jurisdiction in which, at the time of creation:

      (1) The settlor was domiciled, had a place of abode or was a national;

      (2) A trustee was domiciled or had a place of business; or

      130.165 UTC 404. Trust purposes. A trust may be created only to the extent the purposes of the trust are lawful, not contrary to public policy and possible to achieve. A trust and its terms must be for the benefit of the trust’s beneficiaries. [2005 c.348 §24]

 

      130.170 UTC 405. Charitable trusts; enforcement. (1) A charitable trust is a trust that:

      (a) Expressly designates one or more charitable organizations, or one or more classes of charitable organizations, to receive distributions as beneficiaries of the trust unless the combined interests of all charitable beneficiaries are negligible or all charitable beneficiaries are remote interest beneficiaries; or

      (b) Is created for the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, the promotion of health, governmental or municipal purposes, or other purposes beneficial to the community, but that does not contain contingencies that make the charitable interest negligible.

      (2) If the terms of a charitable trust do not indicate a particular charitable purpose or beneficiary, the court may select one or more charitable purposes or beneficiaries. The selection must be consistent with the settlor’s intention to the extent that intent can be ascertained.

      (3) The settlor of a charitable trust, in addition to other persons authorized by law or the trust instrument, may maintain a proceeding to enforce the trust.

      (4) A court may modify or terminate a charitable trust only if the Attorney General is a party to the proceedings. [2005 c.348 §25; 2009 c.275 §9; 2013 c.529 §3]

 

      130.175 UTC 406. Creation of trust induced by fraud, duress or undue influence. A trust is void to the extent the creation of the trust was induced by fraud, duress or undue influence. [2005 c.348 §26]

 

      130.180 UTC 407. Evidence of oral trust. Except as required by a statute other than this chapter, a trust need not be evidenced by a trust instrument. The creation of an oral trust, and the terms of an oral trust, must be established by clear and convincing evidence. [2005 c.348 §27]

 

      130.185 UTC 408. Pet trust. (1) A trust may be created to provide for the care of one or more animals that are alive during the settlor’s lifetime. The trust terminates upon the death of the animal or, if the trust was created to provide for the care of more than one animal, upon the death of the last surviving animal. An oral or written declaration shall be liberally construed in favor of finding the creation of a trust under this section. There is a presumption against merely precatory or honorary disposition on behalf of an animal.

      (2) A trust authorized by this section may be enforced by a person appointed in the terms of the trust or, if a person is not appointed in the terms of the trust, by a person appointed by the court. A person having an interest in the welfare of the animal may request the court to appoint a person to enforce the trust or to remove a person appointed. Reasonable compensation for a person appointed by the court may be paid from the assets of the trust.

      (3) Property of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to its intended use. Upon termination of the trust, property of the trust must be distributed to those persons designated in the trust. In the absence of a designation, the property shall be distributed to the settlor if the settlor is living when the distribution is made, or to the settlor’s successors in interest if the settlor is not living when the distribution is made.

      (4) Except as ordered by a circuit court or required by the trust instrument, a trustee for a trust authorized under this section need not pay any fee or make any filing, report, registration, periodic accounting, separate maintenance of funds or appointment by reason of the existence of the fiduciary relationship of the trustee. A person appointed to enforce the trust may request a report under ORS 130.710 (3). [2005 c.348 §28]

 

      130.190 UTC 409. Noncharitable trust without ascertainable beneficiary. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 130.185 or by another statute:

      (1) A trust may be created for a noncharitable purpose without a definite or definitely ascertainable beneficiary or for a noncharitable but otherwise valid purpose to be selected by the trustee. The trust may not be enforced for more than 90 years.

      (2) A trust authorized by this section may be enforced by a person appointed in the terms of the trust or, if a person is not appointed in the terms of the trust, by a person appointed by the court.

      (3) Property of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to its intended use, except to the extent the court determines that the value of the trust property exceeds the amount required for the intended use. Trust property not required for the intended use must be distributed to those persons designated in the trust. In the absence of a designation, the property shall be distributed to the settlor if the settlor is living when the distribution is made, or to the settlor’s successors in interest if the settlor is not living when the distribution is made. [2005 c.348 §29]

      (3) A stewardship trust may be enforced by one or more trust enforcers appointed in the terms of the trust, and the terms of the trust may provide a process for appointing successor trust enforcers. If at any time no person is acting as trust enforcer, the court shall name one or more trust enforcers. Each trust enforcer shall enforce the purpose and the terms of the trust and shall exercise authority as a fiduciary. If more than one person is acting as a trust enforcer, action may be taken by a majority of the persons acting as trust enforcers. A trust enforcer is not a beneficiary of a trust created pursuant to this section, but a trust enforcer has the rights of a qualified beneficiary.

      (4) A stewardship trust must have a trust stewardship committee with at least three persons as members. Each member of the trust stewardship committee shall exercise authority as a fiduciary. The terms of the trust may appoint the initial members of the trust stewardship committee and may provide a process for appointing successor members. A vacancy on the trust stewardship committee must be filled if the trust stewardship committee has fewer than three members.

      (5) A vacancy on the trust stewardship committee that is required to be filled must be filled in the following order of priority:

      (a) By a person designated in the terms of the trust or selected through a process provided in the terms of the trust;

      (b) By a person appointed by unanimous agreement of the trust enforcers; or

      (c) By a person appointed by the court.

      (6) Unless the terms of the trust provide otherwise and except as provided in subsections (7)(d) and (11) of this section, the trust stewardship committee may take action by a majority vote of its members.

      (10) A trustee of a stewardship trust shall act in accordance with a direction from the trust stewardship committee unless the action is manifestly contrary to the terms of the trust or the trustee knows that the action would constitute a serious breach of a fiduciary duty that the trust stewardship committee, the trust enforcer or the trustee owes to the trust. A trustee is liable only for willful misconduct and is not liable for reliance on documents provided by the trust stewardship committee or the trust enforcer.

      (11) Unless the terms of the trust provide otherwise, the trust stewardship committee and the trust enforcers, acting together, may modify or terminate a stewardship trust by unanimous agreement of the members of the trust stewardship committee and unanimous agreement of the trust enforcers.

      (12) Upon termination of a stewardship trust, the trustee shall distribute all remaining trust property as the terms of the trust provide, or if the terms of the trust do not provide for complete distribution of the property, as a court determines to be consistent with the purposes for which the trust was created.

      (13) A person serving as a trustee may not serve as a trust enforcer or as a member of the trust stewardship committee, and a person serving as a trust enforcer may not serve as a member of the trust stewardship committee.

      (14) A stewardship trust may be enforced for more than 90 years if the terms of the trust provide that the trust will be enforceable for a specific period not less than 90 years or in perpetuity.

      (15) This section does not apply to trusts created pursuant to ORS 60.254. [2019 c.162 §2]

      (6) A binding nonjudicial settlement agreement relating to modification or termination of a trust may be entered into by all interested persons, as defined in ORS 130.045. [2005 c.348 §31; 2007 c.129 §21; 2009 c.275 §11; 2013 c.529 §5]

 

      130.205 UTC 412. Modifications or termination because of unanticipated circumstances or inability to administer trust effectively. (1) The court may modify the administrative or dispositive terms of a trust or terminate the trust if modification or termination will further the purposes of the trust and the modification or termination is requested by reason of circumstances not anticipated by the settlor. To the extent practicable, the modification must be made in accordance with the settlor’s probable intention.

      (2) The court may modify the administrative terms of a trust if continuation of the trust on its existing terms would be impracticable or wasteful, or would impair the trust’s administration.

      (3) A trustee may terminate a trust if:

      (a) Termination is appropriate by reason of circumstances not anticipated by the settlor;

      (b) Termination will not be inconsistent with the material purposes of the trust;

      (4) Upon termination of a trust under this section, the trustee shall distribute the trust property in a manner consistent with the purposes of the trust. [2005 c.348 §32; 2007 c.515 §1; 2009 c.275 §12]

 

      130.210 UTC 413. Cy pres. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, if a particular charitable purpose of a trust becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful:

      (2) If a provision in the terms of a charitable trust would result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable beneficiary, a court may not apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust under subsection (1)(c) of this section if, when the provision takes effect:

      (a) The trust property is to revert to the settlor and the settlor is still living; or

      (b) Fewer than 50 years have elapsed since the date of the trust’s creation. [2005 c.348 §33; 2009 c.275 §13]

 

      130.215 UTC 414. Modification or termination of uneconomic trust. (1) After notice to the qualified beneficiaries, a trustee may terminate a trust if the trustee concludes that the value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration. A trustee may not terminate a trust under this section if the trustee is a qualified beneficiary of the trust or has a duty of support for a qualified beneficiary of the trust.

      (2) The court may modify or terminate a trust, or remove the trustee and appoint a different trustee, if the court finds that the value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration.

      (3) Upon termination of a trust under this section, the trustee shall distribute the trust property in a manner consistent with the purposes of the trust.

      (4) This section does not apply to an easement for conservation or preservation. [2005 c.348 §34; 2013 c.529 §6]

 

      130.220 UTC 415. Reformation to correct mistakes.

[2005 c.348 §35]

 

      130.225 UTC 416. Modification to achieve settlor’s tax objectives.

      (a) Provide notice to all qualified beneficiaries in accordance with ORS 130.733;

      (b) Consider the individual rights of each beneficiary;

      (c) Exercise due care and prudent judgment;

      (d) Consider the terms of the trust instrument and amendments, if any, as well as all applicable statutory law; and

      (e) Take the action only if the result does not materially impair the rights of any beneficiary or adversely affect achievement of the intent of the trustor. [2005 c.348 §37; 2015 c.126 §2]

 

      Note: Section 5, chapter 126, Oregon Laws 2015, provides:

      Sec. 5. The amendments to ORS 130.230, 130.232, 130.715 and 130.730 by sections 1 to 4, chapter 126, Oregon Laws 2015, apply only to trusts executed on or after January 1, 2016, and to trust proceedings commenced on or after the effective date of this 2017 Act [May 15, 2017], regardless of when the trust at issue was executed. [2015 c.126 §5; 2017 c.54 §1]

 

      130.232 Division of trust into separate shares or portions; legal effect. (1) If the occurrence of an event, satisfaction of a condition or exercise of a power allows or creates an obligation for the trustee to divide a trust or any portion of a trust into separate shares or portions for the benefit of separate beneficiaries:

      (a) A separate share of a trust comes into existence at the earliest possible time that a trustee may reasonably determine, based upon the facts, that a separate economic interest exists for a beneficiary;

      (b) Each income beneficiary’s share resulting from the division of the trust will be deemed to have the beneficiary’s share of income based upon the beneficiary’s share of the distributable net income for the trust’s tax year relative to that of the other beneficiaries;

      (c) All of the terms of the trust instrument will be applied independently to each beneficiary’s share created pursuant to this section except as terms are specifically limited in the trust instrument; and

      (d) The trust or portion of the trust from which a beneficiary’s share originates will be deemed to terminate to the extent of the beneficiary’s share, subject only to the proper administration of the terminated trust occasioned by the terminating event, condition or exercise.

      (2) The provisions of this section are not elective and must be read so as to be consistent with section 663(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on December 31, 2013. Application of this section shall apply for all tax years that the trust is in existence unless an event occurs, the result of which is that the terms of the trust prevail, in which case the requirements of appropriate trust administration may require and result in a different treatment than would otherwise result in accordance with the provisions of this section. [2013 c.529 §24; 2015 c.126 §1]

 

      Note: See note under 130.230.

 

      130.235 In terrorem clause. (1) Except as provided in this section, an in terrorem clause in a trust is valid and enforceable. If a beneficiary challenges a trust that contains an in terrorem clause that applies to the beneficiary, the court shall enforce the clause against the beneficiary even though the beneficiary establishes that there was probable cause for the challenge.

      (2) The court shall not enforce an in terrorem clause if the beneficiary challenging the trust establishes that the beneficiary has probable cause to believe that the trust is a forgery or that the trust has been revoked.

      (3) The court shall not enforce an in terrorem clause if the challenge is brought by a fiduciary acting on behalf of a protected person under the provisions of ORS chapter 125, a guardian ad litem appointed for a minor or a guardian ad litem appointed for an incapacitated or financially incapable person.

      (4) For the purposes of this section, “in terrorem clause” means a provision in a trust that reduces or eliminates the interest of a beneficiary under the trust if the beneficiary challenges the validity of part or all of the trust. [2005 c.348 §38]

 

      130.237 Abatement due to insufficiency of trust property. (1) As used in this section, “abate” or “abatement” means to reduce or the reduction of a gift from a trust at the settlor’s death on account of the insufficiency of the trust property to pay all claims and expenses and distribute all gifts in full.

      (2) If the trust instrument expresses an order of abatement, or if the plan of distribution or the express or implied purpose of the distribution from the trust would be defeated by the order of abatement stated in subsection (3) of this section, the shares of the distributees abate as may be found necessary to give effect to the intention of the settlor.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 130.555 as to the shares of pretermitted children, and in ORS 114.600 to 114.725 relating to the elective share of the surviving spouse, shares of distributees abate without any preference or priority as between real and personal property in the following order:

      (a) Property of the trust not disposed of by the terms of the trust instrument.

      (b) Residuary gifts, which are gifts paid from the trust after all claims and expenses are paid and all general gifts and specific gifts are distributed under the terms of the trust instrument.

      (c) General gifts, which are gifts chargeable generally on the trust corpus and which are not distinguishable from other parts of the trust corpus and are not given under the terms of the trust instrument as a gift of a specific thing or of a specified part of the trust corpus.

      (d) Specific gifts, which are gifts of a specific thing or of a specified part of the trust corpus as described under the terms of the trust instrument and that are capable of identification.

      (4) A general gift charged on any specific property or fund is considered, for purposes of abatement, to be property specifically given to the extent of the value of the property or fund on which the general gift is charged. Upon the failure or insufficiency of the property or fund on which the general gift is charged, the gift is considered a general gift to the extent of the failure or insufficiency.

      (5) Abatement within each classification is in proportion to the amounts of property each of the distributees would have received had full distribution of the property been made in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument.

      (6) Persons to whom the trust instrument gives tangible personal property not used in trade, agriculture or other business are not required to contribute from that property unless the property forms a substantial amount of the total estate and the court specifically orders contribution because of the gift.

      (7) When the subject matter of a preferred gift is sold or used incident to administration, abatement shall be achieved by appropriate adjustments in, or contribution from, other interests in the remaining assets. [2013 c.529 §26]

 

      130.240 Marital deduction gifts. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Marital deduction” means the federal estate tax deduction allowed for transfers under section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on January 1, 2008, or the federal gift tax deduction allowed for transfers under section 2523 of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on January 1, 2008.

      (b) “Marital deduction gift” means a transfer of property that the settlor intended to qualify for the marital deduction.

      (2) If a trust contains a marital deduction gift:

      (a) The provisions of the trust, including any power, duty or discretionary authority given to a fiduciary, must be construed as necessary to comply with the marital deduction provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (b) The fiduciary may not take any action or have any power that impairs the tax deduction for the marital deduction gift.

      (c) The marital deduction gift may be satisfied only with property that qualifies for the tax deduction.

      (3) If a trust executed before September 12, 1981, indicates the settlor intended that a gift provide the maximum allowable marital deduction, the trust gives the recipient an amount equal to the maximum amount of the marital deduction that would have been allowed as of the date of the gift under federal law as it existed before September 12, 1981, with adjustments for:

      (a) The provisions of section 2056(c)(1)(B) and (C) of the Internal Revenue Code in effect immediately before September 12, 1981.

      (b) Reduction of the amount passing under the gift by the final federal estate tax values of any other property that passes under the trust, or by other means, that qualifies for the marital deduction. This paragraph does not apply to qualified terminable interest property under section 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on January 1, 2008.

      (4) If a marital deduction gift is made in trust:

      (a) The settlor’s spouse is the only beneficiary of income or principal of the marital deduction property as long as the spouse lives. Nothing in this paragraph prevents exercise by the settlor’s spouse of a power of appointment included in a trust that qualifies as a general power of appointment marital deduction trust.

      (b) Subject to paragraph (d) of this subsection, the settlor’s spouse is entitled to all of the income of the marital deduction property at least once a year, as long as the spouse is alive.

      (c) The settlor’s spouse has the right to require that the trustee of the trust make unproductive marital deduction property productive or convert it into productive property within a reasonable time.

      (d) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 129, upon the death of the settlor’s spouse all remaining accrued or undistributed income from qualified terminable interest property under sections 2056(b)(7) or 2523(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on January 1, 2008, passes to the estate of the settlor’s spouse, unless the trust provides a different disposition that qualifies for the marital deduction.

      (5)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if a trust that makes a marital deduction gift includes a requirement that the settlor’s spouse survive the settlor by a period of more than six months, or contains provisions that could result in a loss of the spouse’s interest in the trust if the spouse fails to survive the settlor by at least six months, the spouse need only survive the settlor by six months to receive the marital deduction gift.

      (b) If a trust that makes a marital deduction gift includes a requirement that the settlor’s spouse survive a common disaster that results in the death of the settlor, the spouse need only survive until the final audit of the federal estate tax return for the settlor’s estate, if any, to receive the marital deduction gift.

      (6) A trustee is not liable for a good faith decision whether to make any election referred to in sections 2056(b)(7) or 2523(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on January 1, 2008.

      (7) Subsections (4) and (6) of this section do not apply to a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under 26 U.S.C. 2056, as described in 26 C.F.R. 2056(c)-2(b)(1), as in effect on January 1, 2008. [Formerly 128.398; 2009 c.275 §14]

 

CREDITOR’S CLAIMS; SPENDTHRIFT AND DISCRETIONARY TRUSTS

 

      130.300 UTC 501. Rights of beneficiary’s creditor or assignee. To the extent a beneficiary’s interest is not protected by a spendthrift provision, the court may authorize a creditor or assignee of the beneficiary to reach the beneficiary’s interest by garnishment or other execution against present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary or by other means. The court may limit the award to such relief as is appropriate under the circumstances. [2005 c.348 §39]

 

      130.305 UTC 502. Spendthrift provision. (1) A spendthrift provision is valid only if the provision restrains both voluntary and involuntary transfer of a beneficiary’s interest.

      (2) A term of a trust providing that the interest of a beneficiary is held subject to a spendthrift trust, or words of similar import, is sufficient to restrain both voluntary and involuntary transfer of the beneficiary’s interest.

      (3) A beneficiary may not transfer an interest in a trust in violation of a valid spendthrift provision. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 130.300 to 130.325, a creditor or assignee of a beneficiary may not reach the interest of a beneficiary or a distribution by the trustee before the distribution is received by the beneficiary.

      (4) A settlement agreement entered into under ORS 130.045 is not, by itself, a transfer in violation of a valid spendthrift provision. [2005 c.348 §40; 2013 c.529 §7]

 

      130.310 UTC 503. Exceptions to spendthrift provisions. (1) As used in this section, “child” means any individual for whose benefit a judgment, court order or administrative order for child support has been entered in any state, country or other jurisdiction.

      (2) Even if a trust contains a spendthrift provision, the holder of a judgment, court order or administrative order against a beneficiary for support or maintenance of the beneficiary’s child, spouse or former spouse or a judgment creditor who has provided services for the protection of a beneficiary’s interest in the trust, may obtain an order from a court of this state authorizing garnishment or other execution against present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. The court may issue an order authorizing execution against such amount as the court determines to be equitable under the circumstances but not more than the amount the trustee is required to distribute to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. Distributions subject to execution under this subsection include distributions required by the express terms of the trust, such as mandatory payments of income, and distributions the trustee has otherwise decided to make, such as through the exercise of discretion.

      (3) A spendthrift provision is unenforceable against a claim of this state or the United States to the extent a statute of this state or federal law so provides. [2005 c.348 §41; 2013 c.529 §8]

 

      130.315 UTC 505. Creditor’s claim against settlor. (1) Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision:

      (a) During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor’s creditors.

      (b) A creditor or assignee of the settlor of an irrevocable trust may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor’s benefit. If an irrevocable trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor’s interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor’s contribution.

      (c) If a trust was revocable at the settlor’s death, the property of the trust becomes subject to creditors’ claims as provided in ORS 130.350 to 130.450 when the settlor dies. The payment of claims is subject to the settlor’s right to direct the priority of the sources from which liabilities of the settlor are to be paid.

      (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this subsection, the assets of an irrevocable trust may not be subject to the claims of an existing or subsequent creditor or assignee of the settlor, in whole or in part, solely because of the existence of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust or any other provision of law to pay the amount of tax owed directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal that is payable or has been paid by the settlor under the law imposing the tax.

      (2) For the purpose of creditors’ claims, the holder of a power of withdrawal is treated in the same manner as the settlor of a revocable trust to the extent property of the trust is subject to the power. The provisions of this subsection apply to the holder of a power of withdrawal only during the period that the power may be exercised.

      (3) Upon the lapse, release or waiver of a power of withdrawal, the property of the trust that is the subject of the lapse, release or waiver becomes subject to claims of creditors of the holder of the power only to the extent the value of the property exceeds the greatest of:

      (a) The amount specified in section 2041(b)(2) or 2514(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on December 31, 2012;

      (b) The amount specified in section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on December 31, 2012; or

      (c) Twice the amount specified in section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on December 31, 2012, if the donor was married at the time of the transfer to which the power of withdrawal applies.

      (4) The assets of an irrevocable trust that are attributable to a contribution to an inter vivos marital deduction trust described in section 2523(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect on December 31, 2012, after the death of the spouse of the settlor of the inter vivos marital deduction trust shall be deemed to have been contributed by the settlor’s spouse and not by the settlor.

      (5) The assets of an irrevocable trust for the benefit of a person, including the settlor, are not subject to claims of creditors of the settlor to the extent that the property of the trust is subject to a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by a person other than the settlor.

      (6) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not apply to a person other than a settlor who is a beneficiary of a revocable or irrevocable trust and who is also a trustee of the trust, if the power to withdraw for the person’s own benefit is limited by an ascertainable standard. [2005 c.348 §42; 2013 c.529 §9; 2017 c.17 §5]

 

      130.320 UTC 506. Overdue distribution. Whether or not a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor or assignee of a beneficiary may reach a mandatory distribution of income or principal, including a distribution upon termination of the trust, if the trustee has not made the distribution to the beneficiary within a reasonable time after the designated distribution date. [2005 c.348 §43]

 

      130.325 UTC 507. Personal obligations of trustee. Trust property is not subject to personal obligations of the trustee, even if the trustee becomes insolvent or bankrupt. [2005 c.348 §44]

 

CLAIMS AGAINST TRUST BASED ON DEBTS OF SETTLOR

 

      130.350 Statute of limitations.

      (b) The trust came into existence during the settlor’s lifetime and was a revocable trust at any time after the trust was created and before the death of the settlor;

      (c) The claim is based on the debts or liabilities of the settlor; and

      (d) The claim is made against the assets of the trust after the death of the settlor.

      (3) ORS 130.350 to 130.450 apply to all claims against a trust described in subsection (2) of this section, without regard to whether the claims are contingent, unliquidated or not yet due. [Formerly 128.256]

 

      130.355 Commencement of proceeding.

      (b) In any county where assets of the trust were located at the time of death or are located at the time the proceeding is commenced; or

      (c) In the county where the settlor died.

      (4) The court has personal jurisdiction over a trustee that files a petition under this section, whether the trustee is a resident or nonresident of this state, for the purposes of any proceeding relating to the trust that may be instituted by an interested person. [Formerly 128.258; 2009 c.363 §1; 2010 c.107 §§43,44; 2011 c.595 §131]

 

      130.360 Limitation on presentation of claims when notice to claimants given. Not later than four months after a petition under ORS 130.355 is entered in the register of the court, the trustee of the trust shall give notice to persons with claims against the trust estate in the manner provided by ORS 130.365 and 130.370. All claims against the trust estate are barred unless those claims are submitted before the later of:

      (1) Four months after the date of first publication of notice to claimants in the manner provided by ORS 130.365; or

      (2) If the trustee delivers or mails a notice to a claimant under ORS 130.370, 30 days after a notice meeting the requirements of ORS 130.370 is delivered or mailed to the last-known address of the person having or asserting the claim. [Formerly 128.262]

 

      130.365 Publication of notice. After filing a petition under ORS 130.355, a trustee must cause a notice to claimants to be published once in each of three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the petition is filed. The notice must include:

      (1) The name of the settlor;

      (2) The name of the trustee and the address at which claims must be presented;

      (3) The date of the first publication of the notice; and

      (4) A statement that claims against the trust estate may be barred unless presented to the trustee at the address specified in the notice within four months after the date of the first publication of the notice. [Formerly 128.264]

 

      130.370 Notice to individual claimants. (1) Within three months after a petition is entered in the register of the court under ORS 130.355, or within such longer time as the court allows, a trustee must make reasonably diligent efforts to investigate the financial records and affairs of the settlor and to take such further actions as are reasonably necessary to ascertain the identity and address of each person who has or asserts a claim against the trust estate. The court shall allow the trustee as much time as requested by the trustee for the purpose of determining the claims against the trust estate. The trustee must thereafter cause to be delivered or mailed a notice containing the information required in subsection (2) of this section to the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority, or as otherwise provided by rule adopted by the authority, and to each person known by the trustee to have or to assert a claim against the trust estate. Notice under this section is not required for any claim that has already been presented, accepted or paid in full or on account of a claim that is merely conjectural.

      (2) The notice required by this section must include:

      (a) The name of the settlor and the last four digits of the settlor’s Social Security number;

      (b) The name of the trustee and the address at which claims must be presented;

      (d) The date of the notice, which shall be the date on which the notice is delivered or mailed; and

      (e) A certified copy of the settlor’s death record. [Formerly 128.266; 2009 c.363 §2; 2009 c.595 §90; 2011 c.720 §63; 2013 c.366 §63]

 

      130.375 Form of claim; evidence in support. (1) A claim presented under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 must:

      (a) Be in writing.

      (b) Describe the nature and the amount of the claim, if ascertainable.

      (c) State the name and address of the claimant and any attorney for the claimant.

      (2) A defect of form of a claim timely presented may be waived by the trustee or by the court.

      (3) Upon demand of a trustee, a claimant must produce any written evidence supporting a claim made under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 and account for any written evidence supporting a claim that is not produced. [Formerly 128.268]

 

      130.380 Claim based on debt due or judgment. (1) If a claim on a debt due is presented and allowed, allowance shall be in the amount of the debt remaining unpaid on the date of allowance.

      (2) If a judgment was entered on a claim prior to the death of the settlor, the claim shall be presented under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 in the same manner as if no judgment had been entered, and a copy of the judgment shall be attached to the claim. The claim may be disallowed only if the judgment was void or voidable, or if the judgment could have been set aside on the date of the settlor’s death, or if the claim is not presented within the time required by ORS 130.350. If the judgment was a lien against the property of the trust estate on the date of the settlor’s death, the judgment shall be treated as a claim on a debt due for which the creditor holds security. In all other respects, a claim that has been reduced to judgment shall have the same priority under ORS 130.425 as a claim that has not been reduced to judgment. [Formerly 128.272]

 

      130.385 Claim on debts not yet due. A claim on a debt not due, whether or not the creditor holds security for the claim, may be presented under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 as a claim on a debt due. If the claim is allowed, allowance shall be in an amount equal to the value of the debt on the date of allowance. The creditor, after allowance of the claim, may withdraw the claim without prejudice to other remedies. Payment on the basis of the amount allowed discharges the debt and the security, if any, held by the creditor for the claim. [Formerly 128.274]

 

      130.390 Claim on secured debt that is due. (1) A claim on a debt due for which the creditor holds security may be presented under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 as a claim on an unsecured debt due, or the creditor may elect to rely entirely on the security without presentation of the claim.

      (2) If the claim is presented under this section, the claim shall describe the security. If the security is an encumbrance that is recorded, the encumbrance may be described by reference to the book, page, date and place of recording.

      (3) If a claim is presented and allowed under this section, payment shall be on the basis of the amount of the debt remaining unpaid on the date that the claim is allowed.

      (4) If the creditor surrenders the security for a claim presented and allowed under this section, payment shall be on the basis of the amount allowed.

      (5)(a) If the creditor does not surrender the security for a claim presented and allowed under this section, and the creditor exhausts the security before receiving payment on the claim, payment shall be on the basis of the amount allowed less the amount realized on exhausting the security unless otherwise provided by law.

      (b) If the creditor does not surrender the security for a claim presented and allowed under this section, and the creditor does not exhaust the security before receiving payment or does not have the right to exhaust the security, payment shall be on the basis of the amount allowed less the value of the security determined by agreement or as the court may order.

      (6) The trustee may convey the secured property to the creditor in consideration of the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the claim. [Formerly 128.276]

 

      130.395 Claim on contingent or unliquidated debt. (1) A claim on a contingent or unliquidated debt shall be presented under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 in the same manner as other claims. If the debt becomes absolute or liquidated before distribution of the trust estate, the claim shall be paid in the same manner as a claim on an absolute or liquidated debt.

      (2) If a contingent or unliquidated debt does not become absolute or liquidated before distribution of the trust estate, the trustee may provide for payment of the claim by any of the following methods:

      (a) The creditor and trustee may determine, by agreement, arbitration or compromise, the value of the debt and the claim may be allowed and paid in the same manner as a claim on an absolute or liquidated debt.

      (b) The trustee may distribute the trust estate, but retain sufficient funds to pay the claim if and when the debt becomes absolute or liquidated. Distribution of trust assets may not be delayed under this paragraph for more than two years after distribution would otherwise be required by the terms of the trust. If the debt does not become absolute or liquidated within that time, the funds retained, after payment therefrom of any expenses accruing during that time, shall be distributed to the beneficiaries.

      (3) A court may order the trustee to make distribution of the trust estate as though the claim did not exist.

      (4) If after distribution under subsection (2)(b) or (3) of this section the debt becomes absolute or liquidated, the beneficiaries are liable to the creditor to the extent of the trust estate received by them. Payment of the debt may be arranged by creating a trust, giving a mortgage, securing a bond from a distributee or by other method. [Formerly 128.278]

 

      130.400 Allowance and disallowance of claims. (1) The trustee may compromise a claim against the trust estate.

      (2) A claim presented to a trustee under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 shall be considered allowed as presented unless within 60 days after the date of presentment of the claim the trustee mails or delivers a notice of disallowance of the claim in whole or in part to the claimant and to the attorney of the claimant if the claimant has an attorney.

      (3) A notice of disallowance of a claim shall inform the claimant that the claim has been disallowed in whole or in part and, to the extent disallowed, will be barred unless the claimant requests a summary determination or brings an action in the manner provided by subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) If a trustee disallows a claim submitted under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 in whole or in part, the claimant, within 30 days after the date of mailing or delivery of the notice of disallowance, may:

      (a) File a request for summary determination of the claim in the probate court, with proof of service of a copy of the request upon the trustee or the attorney of the trustee; or

      (b) Commence a separate action against the trustee on the claim in the probate court.

      (5) If the claimant fails either to request a summary determination or commence a separate action as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the claim is barred to the extent the claim has been disallowed by the trustee.

      (6) If a claimant prevails in a proceeding or action under subsection (4) of this section, the claim shall be allowed or judgment entered in the full amount determined to be due to the claimant. The claim or judgment shall be paid from the assets of the trust estate only to the extent that funds are available after payment of other claims with higher priority under ORS 130.425.

      (7) If the claimant files a request for summary determination of a claim under subsection (4) of this section, the trustee may notify the claimant in writing that the claimant must commence a separate action against the trustee on the claim within 60 days after the claimant receives the notice. Notice under this subsection must be given by the trustee within 30 days after the request for summary determination is served on the trustee or the attorney of the trustee. If the claimant fails to commence a separate action within the time allowed, the claim is barred to the extent the claim has been disallowed by the trustee.

      (8) In a proceeding for summary determination under this section:

      (a) The trustee shall make response to the claim as though the claim were a complaint filed in an action.

      (b) The court shall hear the matter without a jury, after notice to the claimant and trustee. The court shall determine the claim in a summary manner, and shall make an order allowing or disallowing the claim in whole or in part.

      (c) No appeal may be taken from the order of the court made in a proceeding for summary determination under this section.

      (9) If a civil action is commenced under subsection (4) of this section, a trustee, or beneficiary, may petition the court to approve a proposed disposition of claims or to provide instructions on the treatment of claims.

      (10) A claimant filing a request for summary determination of a claim under subsection (4) of this section must pay the filing fee required of a defendant or respondent under ORS 21.135 and other fees applicable to civil actions in circuit court. [Formerly 128.280; 2009 c.275 §15; 2010 c.107 §§46,47; 2011 c.595 §133]

 

      130.405 Creditor may obtain order for payment. A creditor whose claim has been allowed or established by summary determination or separate action, and who has not received payment within six months after the date of the first publication of notice to interested persons, may apply to the court for an order directing the trustee to pay the claim. The trustee may recover amounts owing under the claim from any beneficiary who received a distribution from the trust estate. The right of recovery is limited to the extent the beneficiary’s distribution would have been reduced by timely payment of all allowed or established claims. [Formerly 128.282]

 

      130.410 Evidence required to allow court approval of claim disallowed by trustee. A claim that has been disallowed by a trustee under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 may not be allowed by any court except upon some competent, satisfactory evidence other than the testimony of the claimant. [Formerly 128.284]

 

      130.415 Waiver of statute of limitations. A claim subject to ORS 130.350 to 130.450 that is barred by a statute of limitations may not be allowed by the trustee or by any court except upon the written direction or consent of those interested persons who would be adversely affected by allowance of the claim. [Formerly 128.286]

 

      130.420 Tolling of statute of limitations on claim. If a claim is not barred by the statute of limitations on the date of death of the settlor, the claim is not barred by any statute of limitations until at least one year after the date of death. [Formerly 128.288]

 

      130.425 Priority of claims. (1) Claims allowed against the trust estate under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 must be paid by the trustee in the following order of priority:

      (g) Child support arrearages.

      (h) Claims of the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority for the net amount of public assistance, as defined in ORS 411.010, and for the net amount of medical assistance that may be recovered from an estate under ORS 416.350.

      (j) All other claims against the trust estate.

      (2) If the assets of the trust estate are insufficient to pay in full all expenses or claims of any one class specified in subsection (1) of this section, each expense or claim of that class shall be paid only in proportion to the amount thereof. [Formerly 128.290; 2009 c.595 §91; 2011 c.720 §64; 2013 c.688 §22]

 

      130.430 Applicability of time limitations to public bodies. Notwithstanding ORS 12.250, all statutes of limitations and other time limitations imposed under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 apply to actions brought in the name of the state, or brought in the name of any county or public corporation, and to actions brought for the benefit of the state or for the benefit of any county or public corporation. [Formerly 128.292]

 

      130.435 Applicability of time limitations to certain claims based on liens against property and liability of settlor or trustee. The statutes of limitations and time limitations provided by ORS 130.350 to 130.450 do not affect:

      (1) Any proceeding to enforce a mortgage, pledge or other lien upon property of the trust estate;

      (2) Any proceeding to quiet title or reform any instrument with respect to title to property; or

      (3) To the limits of the insurance protection only, any proceeding to establish liability of the settlor or the trustee for which the settlor or trustee is protected by liability insurance at the time the proceeding is commenced. [Formerly 128.294]

 

      130.440 Petition to close case. (1) Not earlier than four months after the publication of notice to claimants, or the date on which all claims against the trust estate have been resolved, whichever is later, a trustee that has filed a petition under ORS 130.355 must file a petition to close the case with a statement that all claims received by the trustee have been paid in full or otherwise resolved in the manner required by ORS 130.350 to 130.450. The trustee must attach to the petition an affidavit attesting to compliance with ORS 130.365 and 130.370. The trustee must attach to the affidavit a copy of the notice published under ORS 130.365 and a copy of any notice delivered or mailed under ORS 130.370.

      (2) Upon the filing of the petition to close the case in compliance with the provisions of this section, the court shall enter an order closing the case. [Formerly 128.296]

 

      130.445 Dismissal for want of prosecution. (1) If the trustee does not file a petition to close the case under ORS 130.440 within one year after filing a petition under ORS 130.355, the court clerk shall mail a notice to the trustee, or the attorney for the trustee if the trustee is represented by counsel, informing the trustee that a judgment of dismissal will be entered in the case for want of prosecution unless an application for a continuance is made to the court and good cause is shown within 60 days after the date of the notice. Good cause for a continuance includes the pendency of a separate action under ORS 130.400 (4).

      (2) If an application for a continuance is not made under this section, or the court fails to find good cause for a continuance, the court shall enter a judgment of dismissal of the proceeding without prejudice. The dismissal does not bar a claimant’s right to pursue claims against a trustee, and a claimant shall have the same rights as if the trustee filed no proceeding. [Formerly 128.298]

 

      130.450 Consolidation of proceedings. If the proceeding to determine claims against a deceased settlor is pending under ORS 130.350 to 130.450 at the same time as probate proceedings under ORS chapter 115, upon motion of any party or upon the court’s own motion, any of the courts conducting proceedings may:

      (2) Order that the proceedings be consolidated; or

      (3) Make orders concerning the proceedings to avoid unnecessary costs for delays. [Formerly 128.300]

      (2) A revocable trust remains a revocable trust for the purposes of ORS 130.520 to 130.575 even though the trust cannot be revoked because:

[Formerly 128.378]

 

      130.540 Contract of sale of property not revocation. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the trust instrument, a contract of sale made by a trustee to convey property that is the subject of a specific distribution is not a revocation of the specific distribution.

[Formerly 128.380]

 

      130.545 Encumbrance or disposition of property after trust instrument executed. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the trust instrument:

      130.550 When trust assets pass to descendants of beneficiary; class gifts. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the trust instrument, when property is to be distributed under the trust to any beneficiary who is related by blood or adoption to the settlor, and the beneficiary dies leaving lineal descendants either before the settlor dies or before the time set in the trust instrument for distribution, the descendants take by right of representation the property the beneficiary would have taken if the beneficiary had not died. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the trust instrument, this section applies to a beneficiary who is entitled to receive property under a class gift if the beneficiary dies after the trust instrument is executed. [Formerly 128.385]

 

      130.555 Children of settlors; pretermitted children. (1) As used in this section, “pretermitted child” means a child of a settlor who, after the execution of the trust instrument, is born or adopted during the lifetime of the settlor or is in gestation at the time of the settlor’s death, who is not acknowledged or mentioned, either by name or by class, in the trust instrument or in the settlor’s will, and who survives the settlor.

      (2) If a settlor has one or more children living when the settlor executes a trust instrument and no provision is made in the trust for any of those children, a pretermitted child is not entitled to any share of the trust estate.

      (3) If a settlor has one or more children living when the settlor executes a trust instrument and provision is made in the trust for any of those children, a pretermitted child is entitled to share in the trust estate as follows:

      (a) The pretermitted child may share only in the portion of the trust estate intended to benefit living children.

      (b) The share of each pretermitted child is equal to the total value of the portion of the trust estate intended to benefit the living children divided by the number of pretermitted children plus the number of living children for whom provision, other than nominal provision, is made in the trust.

      (c) To the extent possible, the interest of each pretermitted child in the trust estate shall be of the same character, whether equitable or legal, as the interest the settlor gave to the living children under the trust.

      (4) If a settlor has no child living when the settlor executes a trust instrument, the pretermitted children are entitled to the following share of the trust estate:

      (a) If the settlor dies leaving a surviving spouse and all pretermitted children are the issue of the surviving spouse, the pretermitted children are not entitled to any share of the trust estate.

      (b) If the settlor dies leaving a surviving spouse and not all pretermitted children are the issue of the surviving spouse, the pretermitted children, as a class, are entitled to one-half of the trust estate, with shares of the trust to be divided equally.

      (c) If the settlor dies without leaving a surviving spouse, the pretermitted children are entitled to the entire trust estate, with shares of the trust to be divided equally.

      (5) A pretermitted child may recover the share of the trust estate to which the child is entitled as follows:

      (a) If the pretermitted child is entitled to a share of the trust estate under subsection (3) of this section, the share must be recovered from the other children.

      (b) If the pretermitted child is entitled to a share of the trust estate under subsection (4) of this section, the share must be recovered from the beneficiaries on a pro rata basis, out of the portions of the trust estate passing to those persons under the trust.

      (c) In reducing the shares of the beneficiaries under this subsection, the character of the dispositive plan adopted by the settlor in the trust must be preserved to the extent possible. [Formerly 128.388; 2013 c.529 §11]

 

      130.560 Failure of specific distribution. (1) Subject to this section, a specific distribution does not fail by reason of the destruction, damage, sale, condemnation or change in form of the property that is the subject of the specific distribution unless:

      (a) The trust instrument provides that the specific distribution fails under the particular circumstances; or

      (b) The settlor, during the lifetime of the settlor, or the trustee gives property to the beneficiary of the specific distribution with the intent of satisfying the specific distribution.

      (2) If part of the property that is the subject of a specific distribution is destroyed, damaged, sold or condemned, the remaining interest in the property passes pursuant to the specific distribution. The part of the property that is destroyed, damaged, sold or condemned is subject to subsections (3) to (6) of this section if the property would have been adeemed under the common law had the property been subject to probate in the settlor’s estate.

      (3) If property that is the subject of a specific distribution is insured and the property is destroyed or damaged, the beneficiary of the specific distribution is entitled to receive the following amounts, less any amount expended or incurred by the settlor or trust estate in restoration or repair of the property:

      (a) Any insurance proceeds for the destroyed or damaged property unpaid at the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution; and

      (b) An amount equal to all insurance payments paid to the settlor, and such proceeds or awards paid to the trustee for the destroyed or damaged property, during the six-month period immediately preceding the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution.

      (4) If property that is the subject of a specific distribution is sold by the settlor or the trustee, the beneficiary of the specific distribution is entitled to receive:

      (a) Any balance of the purchase price unpaid at the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution, including any security interest in the property and interest accruing before the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution; and

      (b) An amount equal to all payments paid to the settlor or the trustee for the property during the six-month period immediately preceding the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution. Acceptance of a promissory note of the purchaser or a third party is not considered payment under this paragraph, but payment on the note is payment on the purchase price.

      (5) If property that is the subject of a specific distribution is taken by condemnation before the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution, the beneficiary of the specific distribution is entitled to receive:

      (a) Any amount of the condemnation award unpaid at the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution; and

      (b) An amount equal to the sums paid under the condemnation award to the settlor or the trustee during the six-month period immediately preceding the time set in the trust instrument for the specific distribution.

      (6) If securities as defined in ORS 59.015 are the subject of a specific distribution, and after the execution of the trust instrument other securities of the same or another entity are distributed to the trustee or trust estate by reason of a partial liquidation, stock dividend, stock split, merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, redemption, exchange or any other similar transaction, the specific distribution includes the additional or substituted securities.

      (7) The amount that a beneficiary of a specific distribution receives under this section must be reduced by any expenses of the sale or of the collection of the proceeds of insurance, sale or condemnation award and by any amount by which income is increased by reasons of items provided for in this section. Expenses subject to this subsection include attorney fees. [Formerly 128.390]

 

      130.565 Effect of failure of specific distribution. If a specific distribution, other than a specific distribution that governs the residue of the trust estate, fails for any reason, the property that is the subject of the specific distribution becomes part of the residue and must be distributed as provided by the terms of the trust instrument for the residue. [Formerly 128.392]

 

      130.570 Advancement against share of trust. Property that the settlor gives during the settlor’s lifetime to a beneficiary of the trust is an advancement against the beneficiary’s share of the trust only if either the settlor makes a written statement that the property constitutes an advancement or the beneficiary makes a written statement acknowledging that the property constitutes an advancement. For purposes of applying the property against the beneficiary’s share of the trust, the property must be valued as of the time the beneficiary takes possession or enjoyment of the property, or as of the time of death of the settlor, whichever occurs first. [Formerly 128.395]

 

      130.575 Effect of advancement on distribution. (1) If the value of an advancement made to a beneficiary under ORS 130.570 exceeds the beneficiary’s share in the trust estate, the beneficiary shall be excluded from any further share of the trust estate, but the beneficiary is not required to refund any part of the advancement. If the value of the beneficiary’s share in the trust estate is greater than the value of all property received as advancements, the beneficiary is entitled to receive from the trust estate the balance of the share owing to the beneficiary after deducting all amounts received as advancements.

      (2) For the purpose of determining the shares of the beneficiaries of either a residuary gift or a class gift under a trust, the value of all advancements made by the settlor to beneficiaries of such gift shall be added to the value of the total property distributed pursuant to the gift, the sum then divided among all beneficiaries of the gift, and the value of the advancement then deducted from the share of the beneficiary to whom the advancement was made. [Formerly 128.397]

      (3) The terms of a trust may confer upon a trustee or other person a power to direct the modification or termination of the trust.

      (4) A person other than a beneficiary who holds a power to direct is rebuttably presumed to be a fiduciary and is required to act in good faith with regard to the purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries.

      (a) Clearly informs the beneficiary of the right to object, the manner in which to object and the date by which the objection must be received by the trustee;

      (b) States that the beneficiary’s right to object may be barred if the beneficiary does not object within the time and in the manner allowed for objection; and

ADVISERS

 

      130.735 Appointment of adviser; liability of trustee. (1) A trust instrument may appoint a person to act as an adviser for the purpose of directing or approving decisions made by the trustee, including decisions related to distribution of trust assets and to the purchase, sale or exchange of trust investments. The appointment must be made by a provision of the trust that specifically refers to this section. The appointment may provide for succession of advisers and for a process for the removal of advisers. An adviser shall exercise all authority granted under the trust instrument as a fiduciary unless the trust instrument provides otherwise. A person who agrees to act as an adviser is subject to Oregon law and submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.

      (2) If a trust instrument provides that a trustee is to follow the direction of an adviser, and that trustee acts in accordance with the adviser’s directions, the trustee is not liable for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from the trustee’s decision unless the decision constitutes reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries.

      (3) If a trust instrument provides that a trustee is to make decisions with the approval of an adviser, and the adviser does not provide approval within a reasonable time after the trustee has made a request for approval of a decision, the trustee is not liable for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from the decision unless the decision constitutes reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries.

      (4) Except to the extent specifically provided by the trust instrument, a trustee has no duty to monitor an adviser’s conduct, provide advice to the adviser, consult with the adviser or give notice to any beneficiary or third party about decisions made pursuant to the adviser’s direction that the trustee would have decided differently.

      (5) Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, all actions taken by a trustee for the purpose of implementing directions from an adviser, including confirming that the adviser’s directions have been carried out and recording and reporting activities requested by the adviser, are presumed to be administrative actions taken by the trustee solely for the purpose of allowing the trustee to perform the duties assigned to the trustee under the trust instrument. Administrative actions taken by a trustee for the purpose of implementing directions from an adviser do not constitute monitoring of the adviser or other participation in decisions that are within the scope of the adviser’s authority.

      (6) A court may remove an adviser if the court finds:

      (a) The adviser has committed a serious breach of trust; or

      (b) Removal of the adviser best serves the interests of the beneficiaries because the adviser is unfit or unwilling, or has persistently failed to timely and effectively advise the trustee in matters assigned to the adviser in the trust instrument under subsection (1) of this section. [2009 c.275 §21; 2013 c.529 §22]

Within a reasonable time after accepting a trusteeship or receiving trust assets, a trustee shall review the trust assets and make and implement decisions concerning the retention and disposition of assets in order to bring the trust portfolio into compliance with the requirements of ORS 130.750 to 130.775 and with the purposes, terms, distribution requirements and other circumstances of the trust. [2005 c.348 §80]

 

      130.770 Determination of compliance with prudent investor rule. Compliance with the prudent investor rule is determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of a trustee’s decision or action and not by hindsight. [2005 c.348 §81]

LIABILITY OF TRUSTEE AND RIGHTS OF PERSONS DEALING WITH TRUSTEE

 

      130.800 UTC 1001. Remedies for breach of trust. (1) A violation by a trustee of a duty the trustee owes to a beneficiary is a breach of trust. A breach of trust may occur by reason of an action or by reason of a failure to act.

      (2) To remedy a breach of trust that has occurred or to prevent a breach of trust, the court may:

      (a) Compel the trustee to perform the trustee’s duties;

      (b) Enjoin the trustee from committing a breach of trust;

      (c) Compel the trustee to pay money or restore property;

      (d) Order a trustee to account;

      (e) Appoint a special fiduciary to take possession of the trust property and administer the trust;

      (f) Suspend the trustee;

      (g) Remove the trustee as provided in ORS 130.625;

      (h) Reduce or deny compensation to the trustee;

      (i) Subject to ORS 130.855, void an act of the trustee, impose a lien or a constructive trust on trust property, or trace trust property wrongfully disposed of and recover the property or its proceeds; or

      (j) Order any other appropriate relief. [2005 c.348 §83]

 

      130.805 UTC 1002. Damages for breach of trust. (1) A trustee who commits a breach of trust is liable to the beneficiaries affected for the greatest of:

      (a) The amount of damages caused by the breach;

      (b) The amount required to restore the value of the trust property and trust distributions to what they would have been had the breach not occurred; or

      (c) The profit the trustee made by reason of the breach.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if more than one trustee is liable to the beneficiaries for a breach of trust, a trustee is entitled to contribution from the other trustee or trustees. In determining the amount of contribution, the court shall consider the degree of fault of each trustee and whether any trustee or trustees acted in bad faith or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries. A trustee who received a benefit from the breach of trust is not entitled to contribution from another trustee to the extent of the benefit received. [2005 c.348 §84; 2017 c.17 §6]

 

      130.810 UTC 1003. Damages in absence of breach. (1) Except as provided by ORS 130.725 (4) and (15) or 709.175 or other law of this state, a trustee is accountable to an affected beneficiary for any profit made by the trustee arising from the administration of the trust, without regard to whether the profit resulted from a breach of trust.

      (2) Unless there is a breach of trust, a trustee is not liable to a beneficiary for a loss or depreciation in the value of trust property or for not having made a profit. [2005 c.348 §85]

 

      130.815 UTC 1004. Attorney fees and costs. In a judicial proceeding involving the validity or administration of a trust, the court may award costs and expenses and reasonable attorney’s fees to any party, to be paid by another party or from the trust. [2005 c.348 §86]

 

      130.820 UTC 1005. Limitation of action against trustee. (1) Notwithstanding ORS chapter 12 or any other provision of law, but subject to subsection (2) of this section, a civil action against a trustee based on any act or omission of the trustee, whether based in tort, contract or other theory of recovery, must be commenced within six years after the date the act or omission is discovered, or six years after the date the act or omission should have been discovered, whichever is earlier.

      (2) A beneficiary may not commence a proceeding against a trustee more than one year after the date the beneficiary or a representative of the beneficiary is sent a report by certified or regular mail that adequately discloses the existence of a potential claim and that informs the beneficiary of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding. A copy of this section must be attached to the report. The report must provide sufficient information so that the beneficiary or representative knows of the potential claim or should have inquired into its existence.

      (3) If subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not apply, a judicial proceeding against a trustee must be commenced within 10 years from the date of the act or omission complained of, or two years from the termination of any fiduciary account established under the trust, whichever is later. [2005 c.348 §87]

 

      130.825 UTC 1006. Reliance on trust instrument. A trustee who acts in reasonable reliance on the terms of the trust as expressed in the trust instrument is not liable to a beneficiary for a breach of trust to the extent the breach resulted from the reliance. [2005 c.348 §88]

 

      130.830 UTC 1007. Event affecting administration or distribution. A trustee is not liable for failing to determine whether a marriage, a divorce, a death, the performance of educational requirements or another event affecting the administration or distribution of a trust has occurred if the trustee has exercised reasonable care in attempting to determine whether the event has occurred. [2005 c.348 §89]

 

      130.835 UTC 1008. Exculpation of trustee. (1) A term of a trust relieving a trustee of liability for breach of trust is unenforceable to the extent that the term:

      (a) Relieves the trustee of liability for breach of trust committed in bad faith or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries; or

      (b) Was inserted as the result of an abuse by the trustee of a fiduciary or confidential relationship to the settlor.

      (2) An exculpatory term drafted or caused to be drafted by the trustee is invalid as an abuse of a fiduciary or confidential relationship unless:

      (a) The settlor is represented by an independent counsel who reviewed the term; or

      (b) The trustee proves that the exculpatory term is fair under the circumstances and that the term’s existence and contents were adequately communicated to the settlor. [2005 c.348 §90]

 

      130.840 UTC 1009. Beneficiary’s consent, release or ratification. If a beneficiary consents to conduct of a trustee that constitutes a breach of trust, releases a trustee from liability for a breach of trust or ratifies a transaction entered into by a trustee that constitutes a breach of trust, the trustee is not liable to the beneficiary for the breach of trust unless:

      (1) The consent, release or ratification of the beneficiary was induced by improper conduct of the trustee; or

      (2) At the time of the consent, release or ratification, the beneficiary did not know of the beneficiary’s rights or know of the material facts relating to the breach. [2005 c.348 §91]

 

      130.845 UTC 1010. Limitation on personal liability of trustee. (1) Except as otherwise provided in the contract, a trustee is not personally liable on a contract properly entered into in the trustee’s fiduciary capacity in the course of administering the trust if the trustee disclosed the trustee’s fiduciary capacity in the contract.

      (2) A trustee is personally liable for torts committed in the course of administering a trust or for obligations arising from ownership or control of trust property, including liability for violation of environmental law, only if the trustee is personally at fault.

      (3) The following claims may be asserted in a judicial proceeding against the trustee in the trustee’s fiduciary capacity, whether or not the trustee is personally liable for the claim:

      (a) A claim based on a contract entered into by a trustee in the trustee’s fiduciary capacity.

      (b) A claim based on an obligation arising from ownership or control of trust property.

      (c) A claim based on a tort committed in the course of administering a trust.

      (4) This section does not impose personal liability on a trustee solely because the trustee holds property under an instrument that shows title in the name of the trustee but does not state that the trustee holds the property in a representative capacity. [2005 c.348 §92]

 

      130.850 UTC 1011. Interest as general partner. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section or unless personal liability is imposed in the contract, a trustee who holds an interest as a general partner in a general or limited partnership is not personally liable on a contract entered into by the partnership after the trust’s acquisition of the interest if the trustee’s fiduciary capacity is disclosed.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a trustee who holds an interest as a general partner is not personally liable for torts committed by the partnership or for obligations arising from ownership or control of the interest unless the trustee is personally at fault.

      (3) The immunity provided by this section does not apply if an interest in a partnership is held by the trustee in a capacity other than that of trustee.

      (4) If the trustee of a revocable trust holds an interest as a general partner, the settlor is personally liable for contracts and other obligations of the partnership to the same extent that the settlor would be liable if the settlor were a general partner. [2005 c.348 §93]

 

      130.855 UTC 1012. Protection of person dealing with trustee. (1) A person other than a beneficiary who in good faith assists a trustee, or who in good faith and for value deals with a trustee, is not liable for acts of the trustee that exceed the trustee’s powers or for the improper exercise of the trustee’s powers, unless the person knows that the trustee has exceeded the trustee’s powers or improperly exercised those powers.

      (2) A person other than a beneficiary who deals with a trustee in good faith is not required to inquire about the extent of the trustee’s powers or about the propriety of the trustee’s exercise of those powers.

      (3) A person who in good faith delivers assets to a trustee need not ensure that the assets are properly applied.

      (4) Any person other than a beneficiary who in good faith assists a former trustee, or who in good faith and for value deals with a former trustee, without knowledge that the trusteeship has terminated, is not liable solely because the former trustee is no longer a trustee.

      (5) Comparable protective provisions of other laws relating to commercial transactions or transfer of securities by fiduciaries prevail over the protection provided by this section. [2005 c.348 §94]

 

      130.860 UTC 1013. Certification of trust. (1) A person who is not a beneficiary and who proposes to deal with the trustee of a trust may require that all trustees execute and furnish to the person a certification of trust.

      (2) The certification of trust shall contain the following information:

      (a) That the trust exists and the date the trust instrument was executed;

      (b) The identity of the settlor;

      (c) The identity and address of the currently acting trustee;

      (d) The powers of the trustee;

      (e) The revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;

      (f) The existence or nonexistence of any power to modify or amend the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to modify or amend the trust;

      (g) The authority of cotrustees to sign or otherwise authenticate and whether all cotrustees or fewer than all are required in order to exercise powers of the trustee;

      (h) The last four digits of the settlor’s Social Security number, or the trust’s employer identification number;

      (i) The manner of taking title to trust property; and

      (j) The state, country or other jurisdiction under the laws of which the trust was established.

      (3) A certification of trust must be signed or otherwise authenticated by all the trustees.

      (4) A certification of trust must state that the trust has not been revoked, modified or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect.

      (5) A certification of trust need not contain the dispositive terms of a trust.

      (6) A recipient of a certification of trust may not require the trustee to furnish the entire trust instrument, but may require the trustee to furnish copies of excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments that designate the trustee and confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction.

      (7) A person may require that the certification of trust:

      (a) Include facts other than those listed in this section that are reasonably related to the administration of the trust;

      (b) Be executed by one or more of the settlors;

      (c) Be executed by one or more of the beneficiaries if the certification is reasonably related to a pending or contemplated transaction with the person; and

      (d) Be adapted to the person’s own standard form, which may be incorporated in an account signature agreement or other account document.

      (8) A certification of trust may contain the identity of any successor trustee or trustees and the circumstances under which any successor trustee or trustees will assume trust powers.

      (9)(a) A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without actual knowledge that the representations contained in the certification are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification. A person does not have actual knowledge that the representations contained in the certification are incorrect solely by reason of having a copy of all or part of the trust instrument.

      (b) Any transaction, and any lien created by that transaction, is enforceable against a trust if the transaction is entered into by a person acting in reliance on a certification of trust containing the information set forth in this section without actual knowledge that the representations contained in the certification are incorrect.

      (c) If a person has actual knowledge that the trustee or trustees are acting outside the scope of the trust, and the actual knowledge was acquired by the person before entering into the transaction or making a binding commitment to do so, the transaction is not enforceable against the trust.

      (10) A person is not liable for acting in reliance on a certification of trust solely because the certification fails to contain all the information required in this section.

      (11) This section does not limit the rights of the beneficiaries of the trust against a trustee.

      (12) A person’s failure to demand or refusal to accept and rely solely upon a certification of trust does not affect the protection provided the person by ORS 130.855, and no inference as to whether the person has acted in good faith may be drawn from the failure to demand or the refusal to accept and rely solely upon a certification.

      (13) This section applies to all trusts, whether established under the laws of this state or under the law of another state, country or other jurisdiction. [2005 c.348 §95; 2009 c.363 §3]
