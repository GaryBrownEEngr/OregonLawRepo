      (1) “Accusatory instrument” means a grand jury indictment, an information or a complaint.

      (2) “Bench warrant” means a process of a court in which a criminal action is pending, directing a peace officer to take into custody a defendant in the action who has previously appeared before the court upon the accusatory instrument by which the action was commenced, and to bring the defendant before the court. The function of a bench warrant is to achieve the court appearance of a defendant in a criminal action for some purpose other than the initial arraignment of the defendant in the action.

      (3) “Complaint” means a written accusation, verified by the oath of a person and bearing an indorsement of acceptance by the district attorney having jurisdiction thereof, filed with a magistrate, and charging another person with the commission of an offense, other than an offense punishable as a felony. A complaint serves both to commence an action and as a basis for prosecution thereof.

      (4) “Complainant’s information” means a written accusation, verified by the oath of a person and bearing an indorsement of acceptance by the district attorney having jurisdiction thereof, filed with a magistrate, and charging another person with the commission of an offense punishable as a felony. A complainant’s information serves to commence an action, but not as a basis for prosecution thereof.

      (5) “Correctional facility” means any place used for the confinement of persons charged with or convicted of a crime or otherwise confined under a court order. “Correctional facility” does not include a youth correction facility as defined in ORS 162.135 and applies to a state hospital only as to persons detained therein charged with or convicted of a crime, or detained therein after being found guilty except for insanity under ORS 161.290 to 161.370.

      (6) “Criminal action” means an action at law by means of which a person is accused of the commission of a violation, misdemeanor or felony.

      (7) “Criminal proceeding” means any proceeding which constitutes a part of a criminal action or occurs in court in connection with a prospective, pending or completed criminal action.

      (8) “District attorney,” in addition to its ordinary meaning, includes a city attorney as prosecuting officer in the case of municipal ordinance offenses, a county counsel as prosecuting officer under a county charter in the case of county ordinance offenses, and the Attorney General in those criminal actions or proceedings within the jurisdiction of the Attorney General.

      (9) “District attorney’s information” means a written accusation by a district attorney and:

      (a) If filed with a magistrate to charge a person with the commission of an offense, other than an offense punishable as a felony, serves both to commence an action and as a basis for prosecution thereof; or

      (b) If filed with a magistrate to charge a person with the commission of an offense punishable as a felony, serves to commence an action, but not as a basis for prosecution thereof; or

      (c) If, as is otherwise authorized by law, filed in circuit court to charge a person with the commission of an offense, serves as a basis for prosecution thereof.

      (10) “Information” means a district attorney’s information or a complainant’s information.

      (11) “Probable cause” means that there is a substantial objective basis for believing that more likely than not an offense has been committed and a person to be arrested has committed it.

      (12) “Trial court” means a court which by law has jurisdiction over an offense charged in an accusatory instrument and has authority to accept a plea thereto, or try, hear or otherwise dispose of a criminal action based on the accusatory instrument.

      (13) “Ultimate trial jurisdiction” means the jurisdiction of a court over a criminal action or proceeding at the highest trial level.

      (14) “Warrant of arrest” means a process of a court, directing a peace officer to arrest a defendant and to bring the defendant before the court for the purpose of arraignment upon an accusatory instrument filed therewith by which a criminal action against the defendant has been commenced.

Specific ORS references have not been substituted, pursuant to 173.160. These sections may be determined by referring to the 1973 Comparative Section Table located in Volume 20 of ORS.

A law enforcement officer may communicate with a person who is represented by counsel without obtaining the prior consent of counsel, and an attorney who prosecutes violations of the criminal laws of this state or the United States is not required to forbid or otherwise prevent the communication, if:

      (15) “Weapon” means any instrument of offensive or defensive combat or anything used, or designed to be used, to destroy, defeat or injure a person. [2005 c.830 §1; 2007 c.71 §30; 2009 c.874 §5]

 

      131.553 Legislative findings; effect on local laws; remedy not exclusive. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Prohibited conduct is undertaken in the course of activities that result in, and are facilitated by, the acquisition, possession or transfer of property subject to criminal forfeiture under ORS 131.550 to 131.600;

      (b) Transactions involving property subject to criminal forfeiture under ORS 131.550 to 131.600 escape taxation;

      (c) Perpetrators of crimes should not be allowed to keep the proceeds and instrumentalities of their crimes;

      (d) Governments attempting to respond to prohibited conduct require additional resources to meet their needs; and

      (e) There is a need to provide for the forfeiture of certain property subject to criminal forfeiture under ORS 131.550 to 131.600, to provide for the protection of the rights and interests of affected persons and to provide for uniformity throughout this state with respect to the laws of this state that pertain to the criminal forfeiture of real and personal property based upon prohibited conduct.

      (2) ORS 131.550 to 131.600 do not impair the right of any city or county to enact ordinances providing for the criminal forfeiture of property based upon prohibited conduct if:

      (a) The property was used to commit the conduct described in the ordinances, or constitutes proceeds of the conduct; and

      (b) The criminal forfeiture is subject to procedures and limitations set forth in ORS 131.550 to 131.600.

      (3) Nothing in ORS 131.550 to 131.600 may be construed to limit or impair any right or remedy that any person or entity may have under ORS 166.715 to 166.735. Criminal forfeiture is a remedy separate and apart from any other criminal penalty and from civil forfeiture or any other civil penalty. [2005 c.830 §2]

 

      131.556 Right, title and interest in forfeited property vests in seizing agency. Subject to ORS 131.550 to 131.600, all right, title and interest in property forfeited under ORS 131.550 to 131.600 vest in the seizing agency upon commission of the prohibited conduct. [2005 c.830 §3]

 

      131.558 Property subject to forfeiture. The following are subject to criminal forfeiture:

      (1) All controlled substances that have been manufactured, distributed, dispensed, possessed or acquired in the course of prohibited conduct;

      (2) All raw materials, products and equipment of any kind that are used, or intended for use, in providing, manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting any service or substance in the course of prohibited conduct;

      (3) All property that is used, or intended for use, as a container for property described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section;

      (4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles and vessels, that are used, or are intended for use, to transport or facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession or concealment of property described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, and all conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles and vessels, that are used or intended for use in prohibited conduct or to facilitate prohibited conduct, except that:

      (a) No conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as a common carrier is subject to criminal forfeiture under the provisions of this section unless the owner or other person in charge of such conveyance was a consenting party or knew of and acquiesced in the prohibited conduct; and

      (b) No conveyance is subject to criminal forfeiture under the provisions of this section by reason of any act or omission established by the owner thereof to have been committed or omitted by any person other than such owner while such conveyance was unlawfully in the possession of a person other than the owner in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any state;

      (5) All books, records, computers and research, including formulae, microfilm, tapes and data that are used or intended for use to facilitate prohibited conduct;

      (6) All moneys, negotiable instruments, balances in deposit or other accounts, securities or other things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in the course of prohibited conduct, all proceeds of or from prohibited conduct, and all moneys, negotiable instruments, balances in deposit and other accounts and securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any prohibited conduct;

      (7) All real property, including any right, title and interest in the whole of any lot or tract of land and any appurtenances or improvements, that is used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate the commission of prohibited conduct;

      (8) All weapons possessed, used or available for use to facilitate conduct giving rise to criminal forfeiture;

      (9) All property described in this section that is intended for use in committing or facilitating an attempt to commit a crime as described in ORS 161.405, a solicitation as described in ORS 161.435 or a conspiracy as described in ORS 161.450; and

      (10) All personal property that is used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate prohibited conduct. [2005 c.830 §4]

 

      131.561 Seizure of property subject to forfeiture. (1) A person who delivers property in obedience to an order or direction to deliver the property under this section is not liable:

      (a) To any person on account of obedience to the order or direction; or

      (b) For any costs incurred on account of any contamination of the delivered property. This includes, but is not limited to, any disposal costs for any property forfeited under ORS 131.558, any hazardous waste or material, any contraband or any other contamination contained in property seized under this section.

      (2) In addition to seizures authorized by ORS 133.535, a police officer may seize property without a court order if the police officer has probable cause to believe that the property is subject to criminal forfeiture.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 131.564, with regard to cash or other assets that at the time of seizure are held in any form of account in a financial institution, if the property is in whole or in part intangible, the person having control or custody of the property shall deliver the same over to the police officer.

      (4)(a) A police officer may seize property pursuant to an order of the court. Forfeiture counsel or a seizing agency may apply for an ex parte order directing seizure of specified property.

      (b) Application may be made to any judge as defined in ORS 133.525. The application must be supported by one or more affidavits setting forth the facts and circumstances tending to show where the objects of the seizure are to be found. The court shall issue the order upon a finding of probable cause to believe that the described property is subject to criminal forfeiture. The order may be set out on the face of a search warrant.

      (c) Except as provided in ORS 131.564, with regard to cash or other assets that at the time of seizure are held in any form of account in a financial institution, if the property is in whole or in part intangible, the order shall direct any person having control or custody of the property to deliver the same over to the seizing agency or to the court to abide judgment.

      (5) Property may be constructively seized by posting notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture on it or by filing notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture or notice of pending criminal forfeiture in the public records that impart constructive notice of matters relating to such property. A notice that is filed must include a description of the property that is the subject of the seizure. Real property, including interests arising out of land sale contracts, may be seized only upon recording a notice of seizure containing a legal description of the property in the mortgage records of the county in which the real property is located.

      (6) Promptly upon seizure, the officer who seized the property shall make an inventory of the property seized and shall deliver a receipt embodying the inventory to the person from whose possession the property is taken or to the person in apparent control of the property at the time it is seized. If the property is unoccupied or there is no one present in apparent control, the officer shall leave the receipt suitably affixed to the property. If the property is physically removed from the location of seizure and it is unoccupied or there is no one present in apparent control, then the officer shall promptly file the receipt in the public records of the seizing agency. Every receipt prepared under this subsection shall contain, in addition to an inventory of the property seized, the following information:

      (a) The identity of the seizing agency; and

      (b) The address and telephone number of the office or other place where the person may obtain further information concerning the criminal forfeiture.

      (7) In the event that property is seized from the possession of a person who asserts a possessory lien over such property pursuant to applicable law, notwithstanding any other provision of law, any lien of the person from whom the property was seized remains in effect and is enforceable as fully as though the person had retained possession of the property. [2005 c.830 §5]

 

      131.564 Status of seized property; release; maintenance and use. (1)(a) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 131.550 to 131.600, property seized for criminal forfeiture is not subject to replevin, conveyance, sequestration or attachment. The seizure of property or the commencement of a criminal forfeiture proceeding under ORS 131.550 to 131.600 does not abate, impede or in any way delay the initiation or prosecution of a suit or action by a financial institution for the possession of seized property in which the financial institution has or purports to have a lien or security interest or for the foreclosure of such lien or security interest. A financial institution may proceed with any suit or action involving property in which it has a lien or security interest even though a seizure has occurred and criminal forfeiture proceedings have been or will be commenced. If property that may be subject to criminal forfeiture is sold prior to the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings, the sheriff, trustee or other person who is conducting the sale and who has actual notice of the forfeiture proceedings shall distribute the sale proceeds as follows:

      (A) To the expenses of the sale;

      (B) If the property is a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, to reimburse the seizing agency for the cost of disabling the hidden compartment;

      (C) To the payment of the obligations owed to the foreclosing financial institution that are secured by the property and to any other person whose lien or security interest in the property has been foreclosed in the suit or action in the order determined by the court; and

      (D) The surplus, if any, shall be distributed to the seizing agency, or to the court in which the forfeiture proceedings are pending.

      (b) The sheriff, trustee or other person who distributes the sale proceeds as provided in this subsection is not liable to any person who has or asserts an interest in the property.

      (2) Within 30 days following seizure of property for criminal forfeiture, the seizing agency, in consultation with the district attorney of the county in which the property was seized for forfeiture, shall determine whether it will seek the forfeiture of the property. If the seizing agency elects not to seek forfeiture, it shall pay all costs and expenses relating to towing and storage of the property, and shall cause to be discharged any possessory chattel liens arising under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 that have attached to the property since its seizure and release the property. The property may be released to a person other than the person from whose custody or control the property was taken if the seizing agency or forfeiture counsel first mails to the last-known addresses of all persons known to have an interest in the property a notice of intent to release the property. The notice must specify the person to whom the property is to be released and must detail the time and place of the release. An agency that complies with the provisions of this subsection by paying costs and expenses of towing and storage, discharging possessory liens, mailing any required notices and releasing the property is not liable for its actions under this subsection or for any consequences thereof. If the property is a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, the seizing agency is not liable for any diminution in the value of the property as a result of disabling the compartment.

      (3) A seizing agency shall, pending criminal forfeiture and final disposition and subject to the need to retain the property in any criminal proceeding, provide that property in the physical custody of the seizing agency be serviced or maintained as may be reasonably appropriate to preserve the value of the property.

      (4) A seizing agency may, pending criminal forfeiture and final disposition and subject to the need to retain seized property in any criminal proceeding:

      (a) Provide that the seized property be transferred for criminal forfeiture to any city, county, state or federal agency with criminal forfeiture authority, provided that no such transfer may have the effect of diminishing or reducing the rights of any third party under ORS 131.550 to 131.600.

      (b) Apply to the court for an order providing that the seized property may be sold, leased, rented or operated in the manner and on the terms that may be specified in the court’s order. The court shall deny any application unless the sale, lease, rental or operation of the property will be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner and will not result in a material reduction of the property’s value. The court may enter an order only:

      (A) After notice and opportunity to be heard is provided to all persons known to have or to claim an interest in the property; and

      (B) With the consent of all persons holding security interests of record in the property.

      (c) Provide that the seized property be removed to a storage area for safekeeping.

      (5) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the seizing agency shall hold the proceeds of the sale, leasing, renting or operation under subsection (4) of this section and the rights of holders of security interests of record in the property attach to the proceeds of the sale, leasing, renting or operation in the same order of priority as interests attached to the property.

      (6)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection and except for currency with apparent or known intrinsic collector value, all cash seized for criminal forfeiture, together with all cash received from the sale, leasing, renting or operation of the property, must be immediately deposited in an insured interest-bearing forfeiture trust account or accounts maintained by the seizing agency exclusively for this purpose. Cash may be retained as evidence in a criminal proceeding but must be deposited immediately when the need to retain it as evidence is discharged.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, all cash seized for criminal forfeiture that at the time of seizure is deposited in any form of account in a financial institution may remain in the account in the financial institution. From the time of seizure until the criminal forfeiture proceeding is abandoned, or until a court ultimately enters a judgment granting or denying criminal forfeiture or enters a judgment of dismissal, all deposits except the deposit of interest by the financial institution, withdrawals or other transactions involving the account are prohibited, unless approved by the court.

      (c) Subject to any court order, interest earned upon cash deposited in a forfeiture trust account or held in an account in a financial institution under this subsection must be disbursed as follows:

      (A) If the criminal forfeiture proceeding is abandoned, or if the court ultimately enters a judgment denying criminal forfeiture or a judgment of dismissal, the seizing agency shall pay any interest earned, together with the cash deposited in the forfeiture trust account in connection with the seizure in question, to the person from whom it was seized, and the seizing agency shall release any interest earned, together with the cash deposited in an account in a financial institution, to the person from whom it was seized.

      (B) If a judgment of criminal forfeiture is entered, but parties other than the seizing agency establish rights to portions of the amount that are in the aggregate larger than or equal to the cash on deposit plus interest earned thereon, the seizing agency shall disburse the interest, together with the cash on deposit, to the parties in the order of their priority.

      (C) If a judgment of criminal forfeiture is entered and the total amount arising out of the seizure that is on deposit in the forfeiture trust account or in an account in a financial institution, including interest earned on moneys deposited, is greater than the aggregate amount needed to satisfy the established interests of security interest holders, lienholders and other claimants, the seizing agency shall retain the balance remaining after payment by the seizing agency to parties.

      (7) If the property seized for criminal forfeiture consists of stocks, bonds, promissory notes or other security or evidence of indebtedness, and the property is held in some form of account in a financial institution, the property may remain in the account pending a final decision in the criminal forfeiture proceedings. Unless otherwise allowed by order of the court, no transactions involving the account may be permitted other than the deposit or reinvestment of dividends or other normally recurring payments on the property. Any accrual to the value of the property during the pendency of criminal forfeiture proceedings must be disbursed in the manner provided for the disbursement of interest under subsection (6) of this section.

      (8) When property has been seized for criminal forfeiture or a notice of criminal forfeiture has been filed, an owner of or interest holder in the property may file a motion seeking an order to show cause. The motion must be filed no later than 15 days after the owner or interest holder received notice or actual knowledge of the seizure, whichever is earlier. At the time a person files a motion under this subsection, the person must serve a copy of the motion on the forfeiture counsel and the defendant, if any. When a motion is filed under this subsection, the court shall issue an order to show cause to the seizing agency for a hearing on the sole issue of whether probable cause for criminal forfeiture of the property exists. If the court finds that there is no probable cause for criminal forfeiture of the property, the property seized for criminal forfeiture or subjected to the notice of criminal forfeiture must be released pending the outcome of a judicial proceeding under ORS 131.582. As used in this subsection, “owner” or “interest holder” does not include the defendant. [2005 c.830 §6; 2009 c.874 §4]

 

      131.566 Motor vehicle with hidden compartment. (1) When a seizing agency lawfully seizes a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, the agency shall disable the hidden compartment, unless the motor vehicle is forfeited and the agency:

      (a) Retains the motor vehicle for law enforcement purposes; or

      (b) Determines that the cost of disabling the hidden compartment exceeds the value of the motor vehicle.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 131.594 or 131.597, if the motor vehicle with a hidden compartment is forfeited and the seizing agency:

      (a) Retains the motor vehicle for law enforcement purposes, the agency shall deduct the cost of disabling the hidden compartment from the value of the motor vehicle before making the distribution described in ORS 131.594 or 131.597.

      (b) Does not retain the motor vehicle for law enforcement purposes and determines that the cost of disabling the hidden compartment exceeds the value of the motor vehicle, the agency shall sell the motor vehicle for scrap or salvage and distribute the proceeds of the sale according to ORS 131.594 or 131.597. The seizing agency shall ensure that the person to whom the motor vehicle is sold disables the hidden compartment or the motor vehicle.

      (3) If a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment is forfeited and the seizing agency sells the motor vehicle, the agency shall deduct the cost of disabling the hidden compartment from the proceeds of the sale under ORS 131.594 (1)(a) or 131.597 (1)(a). [2009 c.874 §2]

 

      131.567 Recorded notice of intent to forfeit real property; form. (1) Whenever a seizing agency intends to forfeit any real property under ORS 131.550 to 131.600, the seizing agency may have recorded by the county clerk or other recorder of deeds of every county in which any part of the premises or real property lies a notice of intent to forfeit real property under ORS 205.246. The notice must contain the legal description of the real property, the common address of the property, if any, and the name of the forfeiture counsel. From the time of recording the notice, and from that time only, the intent to forfeit is notice to purchasers and holders of encumbrances of the rights and equities in the premises of the party filing the notice. The notice must be recorded in the same book and in the same manner in which mortgages are recorded and may be discharged in like manner as mortgages are discharged, either by such party or the attorney signing the notice.

      (2) Unless otherwise prescribed by law, a seizing agency recording a notice of intent to forfeit shall use substantially the following form:

      131.570 Notice of seizure for forfeiture; service on persons other than defendant; publication of notice. (1) As soon as practicable after seizure for criminal forfeiture, the seizing agency shall review the inventory prepared by the police officer under ORS 131.561. Within 30 days after seizure for criminal forfeiture, the forfeiture counsel shall file a criminal information or an indictment alleging facts sufficient to establish that the property is subject to criminal forfeiture. Within 30 days after seizure for criminal forfeiture, the seizing agency or forfeiture counsel shall prepare a notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture containing a copy of the inventory prepared pursuant to ORS 131.561, the identity of the person from whom the property was seized, the name, address and telephone number of the seizing agency and the address and telephone number of the office or other place where further information concerning the seizure and criminal forfeiture may be obtained, and shall make reasonable efforts to serve the notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture on all persons, other than the defendant, known to have an interest in the seized property. A person may be served as provided in ORCP 7 D except that the notice must also include information regarding the right to file a claim under subsection (2) of this section, if applicable, and the deadline for filing the claim. If the property is cash in the amount of $1,000 or less or if the fair market value of the property is $1,000 or less, the seizing agency may publish notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture in a newspaper as provided in ORCP 7 D(6)(b) to D(6)(d). In all other cases, the seizing agency shall publish notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture in a newspaper as provided in ORCP 7 D(6)(b) to D(6)(d). The seizing agency shall provide a copy of the notice, inventory and estimate of value to the forfeiture counsel.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 131.579 (1) to (3), if notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture:

      (a) Is given in a manner other than by publication, any person, other than the defendant, claiming an interest in the property must file a claim with the forfeiture counsel within 21 days after service of notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture.

      (b) Is published, any person, other than the defendant, claiming an interest in the property must file a claim with the forfeiture counsel within 21 days after the last publication date.

      (3) An extension for the filing of a claim under subsection (2) of this section may not be granted. The claim must be signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury and must set forth all of the following:

      (a) The true name of the claimant;

      (b) The address at which the claimant will accept future mailings from the court or the forfeiture counsel; and

      (c) A statement that the claimant has an interest in the seized property.

      (4) If a seizing agency publishes notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture in a newspaper in the manner provided by subsection (1) of this section, the agency may include in a single publication as many notices of criminal forfeiture as the agency considers convenient. The publication may contain a single statement of matters from the notices of criminal forfeiture that are common to all of the notices and that would otherwise result in needless repetition. The publication must contain for each notice of criminal forfeiture a separate copy of the inventory prepared pursuant to ORS 131.561, and a separate statement of the identity of the person from whose custody the property was seized. The published inventory need not contain estimates of value for the property seized. [2005 c.830 §8]

 

      131.573 Petition for expedited hearing. (1) A person, other than the defendant, claiming an interest in property seized under ORS 131.550 to 131.600 may file a petition for an expedited hearing within 15 days after notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture or within such further time as the court may allow for good cause shown.

      (2) A petition for an expedited hearing must contain a claim if no claim has previously been filed. The petition must reflect whether the petitioner seeks one or more of the following:

      (a) A determination at the hearing that the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value and did not acquiesce in the prohibited conduct.

      (b) An order restoring custody of seized property to the petitioner during the pendency of the proceedings if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it is probable that the property will remain available for forfeiture at the completion of the proceedings and that there is a reasonable possibility that the petitioner will ultimately prevail in the proceeding.

      (c) Appointment of a receiver.

      (3) A person filing a petition under this section shall serve a copy of the petition on all persons known to have an interest. Service must be accomplished as provided in ORCP 7 D. Service by publication is not required prior to an expedited hearing.

      (4) The court shall hold a hearing within 15 days after service of all persons known to have an interest or at such later time as the court may allow for good cause shown. The hearing is limited to:

      (a) Deciding whether the petitioner can prove that the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value and did not acquiesce in the prohibited conduct;

      (b) Determining whether an order should be entered directing the return of the seized property to the claimant during the pendency of the hearing; and

      (c) Determining whether an order should be entered directing the appointment of a receiver to manage property seized pursuant to ORS 131.550 to 131.600 pending a final determination as to the disposition of the property, if the petitioner or the seizing agency requests that order.

      (5) The parties to a proceeding under ORS 131.582 may at any time stipulate to the entry of an order restoring custody of seized property to a petitioner who claims an interest in the property. The order must comply with the requirements of ORS 131.576 (1). [2005 c.830 §9]

 

      131.576 Order restoring custody of property after expedited hearing. (1) An order restoring custody to a petitioner under ORS 131.573 shall:

      (a) Prohibit the petitioner from using the property in unlawful conduct of any kind, or from allowing the property to be used by any other person in unlawful conduct;

      (b) Require the petitioner to service and maintain the property as may be reasonably appropriate to preserve the value of the property; and

      (c) Require the petitioner to inform the court of the exact location of the property at the time of any judicial proceeding under ORS 131.582 and to deliver the property to the seizing agency immediately upon the issuance of a judgment of criminal forfeiture.

      (2) An order restoring custody to a petitioner under ORS 131.573 may include such other requirements as the court finds appropriate pending a final determination as to the disposition of the property.

      (3) An order restoring custody to a petitioner under ORS 131.573 is enforceable by a contempt proceeding brought on the relation of forfeiture counsel, by a further order directing the petitioner to deliver the property to the custody of the seizing agency, by an order awarding to the seizing agency its reasonably incurred attorney fees, costs and investigative expenses, and by such other remedies or relief as the court finds appropriate. [2005 c.830 §10]

 

      131.579 Affidavit in response to notice of seizure for forfeiture. (1)(a) A financial institution holding an interest in property seized under ORS 131.550 to 131.600 shall respond to a notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture by filing an affidavit with the court establishing that the financial institution’s interest in the property was acquired:

      (A) In the regular course of business as a financial institution;

      (B) For valuable consideration;

      (C) Without knowledge of the prohibited conduct;

      (D) In good faith and without intent to defeat the interest of any potential seizing agency; and

      (E) With respect to personal property, prior to the seizure of the property, or with respect to real property, recorded prior to the recording of notice of the seizure of the real property in the mortgage records of the county in which the real property is located.

      (b) Failure to file an affidavit constitutes a default. The affidavit must be filed within 30 days from the date of service under ORS 131.570.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, any person, other than a financial institution, who transfers or conveys an interest in real property pursuant to a contract for transfer or conveyance of an interest in real property as defined in ORS 93.905 and who retains an interest in the real property, or any successor in interest, may respond to a notice of seizure for criminal forfeiture by filing an affidavit with the court establishing that the person:

      (a) Received the interest in return for valuable consideration or by way of devise or intestate succession;

      (b) Had no knowledge at the time of transfer or conveyance of the prohibited conduct;

      (c) Acted in good faith and without intent to defeat the interest of any potential seizing agency;

      (d) Recorded the interest in the mortgage records of the county in which the real property is located prior to the recording of any notice of intent to seize or notice of seizure; and

      (e) Continued to hold the interest without acquiescing in the prohibited conduct.

      (3) The affidavit permitted by subsection (2) of this section must be filed within 30 days from the date of service under ORS 131.570. Failure to file an affidavit as set forth in subsection (2) of this section constitutes a default.

      (4) In response to an affidavit filed under subsection (2) of this section, the seizing agency may controvert any or all of the assertions made in the affidavit. The affidavit of the seizing agency must be filed with the court within 20 days after the date the affidavit is filed under subsection (2) of this section. The transferor, conveyor or successor in interest may respond, within five days after the filing of the affidavit of the seizing agency, with a supplemental affidavit limited to the matters stated in the affidavit of the seizing agency. If the seizing agency does not file an affidavit within the time allowed, the transferor, conveyor or successor in interest is considered to be a financial institution for all purposes under ORS 131.550 to 131.600.

      (5) If the seizing agency files an affidavit under subsection (4) of this section, the court shall decide the issues raised in the affidavit in a proceeding under ORS 131.582. [2005 c.830 §11]

 

      131.582 Prosecution of criminal forfeiture; indictment or information; burden of proof; judgment; notice to claimants. (1) If a district attorney decides to proceed with a criminal forfeiture, the district attorney must present the criminal forfeiture to the grand jury for indictment. The indictment must allege facts sufficient to establish that the property is subject to criminal forfeiture and must comply with ORS 132.510, 132.540, 132.550, 132.557, 132.560 and 132.580.

      (2) If the grand jury returns an indictment for criminal forfeiture, the defendant may admit or deny that the property is subject to criminal forfeiture. If the defendant fails to admit or deny that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall enter a denial on behalf of the defendant.

      (3) When the underlying criminal conduct is a Class A misdemeanor, a city or county attorney may prosecute a criminal forfeiture by filing an information in the municipal or justice court.

      (4) A criminal forfeiture proceeding and the underlying criminal case must be tried in the same proceeding.

      (5) The criminal procedure laws of this state apply to criminal forfeiture proceedings.

      (6) The court shall enter a judgment of criminal forfeiture if the forfeiture counsel proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the property for which forfeiture is sought is an instrumentality or the proceeds of the crime of conviction or past prohibited conduct that is similar to the crime of conviction.

      (7) Forfeiture counsel may move the court at any time for an order finding that the defendant is a fugitive and in default. The court may enter an order finding the defendant in default under this subsection and enter a judgment of criminal forfeiture if the court finds that the defendant is not confined or held in custody by another jurisdiction, and that the defendant, after notice or knowledge of the fact that a warrant has been issued for the defendant:

      (a) Purposely left the state to avoid prosecution;

      (b) Declines to return to the state and allow execution of the warrant; or

      (c) Otherwise evades the jurisdiction of the court issuing the warrant.

      (8) No later than 21 days after the entry of a judgment of criminal forfeiture under this section, the forfeiture counsel shall notify by mail all persons who filed claims under ORS 131.570 or affidavits under ORS 131.579 of the judgment of criminal forfeiture. The notice must inform the person of the requirements of subsection (9) of this section.

      (9) If a person who receives notice under subsection (8) of this section wishes to assert the person’s interest in the property but was not eligible to file an affidavit under ORS 131.579, the person must file an affidavit with the trial court, and must serve the forfeiture counsel with a copy of the affidavit, no later than 21 days after the date the notice required by subsection (8) of this section was mailed. The person must allege facts in an affidavit filed under this subsection that if true would prove that the person took the property or the interest that the person holds in the property:

      (a)(A) Before it was seized for criminal forfeiture; and

      (B) In good faith and without intent to defeat the interest of any seizing agency; or

      (b) As a bona fide purchaser for value without acquiescing in the prohibited conduct.

      (10)(a) If an affidavit is timely filed under subsection (9) of this section and the forfeiture counsel:

      (A) Does not contest the affidavit, the forfeiture counsel shall submit a form of judgment to the court for entry under ORS 131.588.

      (B) Does contest the affidavit, the forfeiture counsel shall request a hearing with the trial court no later than 21 days after receiving the affidavit.

      (b) If no affidavit is filed under subsection (9) of this section but the seizing agency filed an affidavit under ORS 131.579 (4), the forfeiture counsel shall request a hearing with the trial court no later than 21 days after the last date for receiving affidavits under subsection (9) of this section.

      (11)(a) A hearing pursuant to subsection (10) of this section is an ancillary proceeding and the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure apply. At the hearing:

      (A) Forfeiture counsel has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the person claiming an interest in the property:

      (i) Took the property with the intent to defeat the interest of a seizing agency; or

      (ii) Is not a bona fide purchaser for value or acquiesced in the prohibited conduct.

      (B) Forfeiture counsel may present evidence and witnesses and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.

      (C) The person claiming an interest in the property may testify, present evidence and witnesses and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.

      (b) In addition to testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the court shall consider relevant portions of the record of the criminal case that resulted in the judgment of criminal forfeiture.

      (c) The court shall amend the judgment of criminal forfeiture in accordance with its determination if, after the hearing, the court determines that the claimant:

      (A) Did take the property before it was seized for criminal forfeiture and in good faith and without intent to defeat the interest of the seizing agency; or

      (B) Is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title or interest in the property and did not acquiesce in the prohibited conduct.

      (d) Notwithstanding ORS 19.255 (1), a person may file a notice of appeal within 30 days after entry in the register of an order disposing of the matters at issue in the ancillary proceeding. An appeal under this paragraph is governed by the provisions of ORS chapter 19 relating to appeals in civil actions.

      (12) When a court enters a judgment of criminal forfeiture under this section, the jurisdiction of the court continues for purposes of subsection (11) of this section and the property continues to be subject to the court’s jurisdiction. [2005 c.830 §12]

 

      131.585 Extent of judgment. (1) The court shall enter judgment to the extent that the property is proceeds of the crime of conviction or of past prohibited conduct that is similar to the crime of conviction.

      (2) With respect to property that is an instrumentality of the crime of conviction or of past prohibited conduct that is similar to the crime of conviction, the court shall consider:

      (a) Whether the property constitutes the defendant’s lawful livelihood or means of earning a living.

      (b) Whether the property is the defendant’s residence.

      (c) The degree of relationship between the property and the prohibited conduct, including the extent to which the property facilitated the prohibited conduct or could facilitate future prohibited conduct.

      (d) The monetary value of the property in relation to the risk of injury to the public from the prohibited conduct.

      (e) The monetary value of the property in relation to the actual injury to the public from the prohibited conduct.

      (f) The monetary value of the property in relation to objective measures of the potential or actual criminal culpability of the person or persons engaging in the prohibited conduct, including:

      (A) The inherent gravity of the prohibited conduct;

      (B) The potential sentence for similar prohibited conduct under Oregon law;

      (C) The defendant’s prior criminal history; and

      (D) The sentence actually imposed on the defendant.

      (g) Any additional relevant evidence. [2005 c.830 §13]

 

      131.588 Judgment of forfeiture; contents; effect. (1) If no financial institution has filed the affidavit described in ORS 131.579 (1), and if the court has failed to uphold the claim or affidavit of any other person claiming an interest in the property, the effect of the judgment is that:

      (a) Title to the property passes to the seizing agency free of any interest or encumbrance thereon in favor of any person who has been given notice;

      (b) The seizing agency may transfer good and sufficient title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee, and all courts, the state and the departments and agencies of this state, and any political subdivision shall recognize the title. In the case of real property, the seizing agency shall warrant the title against constitutional defect. A warranty under this paragraph is limited to the purchase price of the real property; and

      (c) Any department, agency or officer of this state or any political subdivision whose official functions include the issuance of certificates or other evidence of title is immune from civil or criminal liability when such issuance is pursuant to a judgment of criminal forfeiture.

      (2) If an affidavit is filed by a financial institution under ORS 131.579 (1), or if a person files an affidavit under ORS 131.579 (2):

      (a) The court shall foreclose all security interests, liens and vendor’s interests of financial institutions and claimants as to which the court determines that there is a legal or equitable basis for foreclosure; and

      (b) All other interests applicable to the property that are not foreclosed or otherwise eliminated through a judgment of foreclosure, if and to the extent that they are valid and subsisting, remain in effect and the property remains subject to them upon completion of the criminal forfeiture proceeding.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a financial institution or other person has filed an affidavit described in ORS 131.579, or if the court has upheld the claim of any claimant, then as to each item of property seized:

      (a) If the court has determined that the property should not be forfeited and has not foreclosed the security interests, liens or other interests covering the property, the court shall render judgment in favor of the owner of the property, the property must be returned to the owner and all security interests, liens and other interests applicable to the property remain in effect as though the property had never been seized. If the property is a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, the seizing agency is not liable for any diminution in the value of the property as a result of disabling the compartment. Upon the return of the property to the owner, the seizing agency shall pay all costs and expenses relating to towing and storage of the property and shall cause to be discharged any possessory chattel liens on the property arising under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 that have attached to the property since the seizure.

      (b) If the court has determined that the property should not be forfeited and has foreclosed one or more interests covering the property, including security interests or liens covering the property or contracts for the transfer or conveyance of the property, the seizing agency shall pay all costs and expenses relating to towing and storage of the property and shall cause to be discharged any possessory chattel liens on the property arising under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 that have attached to the property since the seizure, and the court shall order the property sold pursuant to a sheriff’s sale or other sale authorized by the court within such time as may be prescribed by the court following entry of the judgment. If any interests covering the property have not been foreclosed, including any liens or security interests of a claimant whose claim has been upheld, or of a financial institution that has filed the affidavit described in ORS 131.579, the property must be sold subject to those interests. The judgment shall order the proceeds of the sale applied in the following order:

      (A) To the payment of the costs of the sale;

      (B) If the property is a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, to reimburse the seizing agency for the cost of disabling the hidden compartment;

      (C) To the satisfaction of the foreclosed liens, security interests and contracts in order of their priority; and

      (D) The excess, if any, to the owner of the property.

      (c) If the court has determined that the property should be forfeited and has foreclosed one or more security interests, liens, contracts or other interests covering the property, the seizing agency shall pay all costs and expenses relating to towing and storage of the property and shall cause to be discharged any possessory chattel liens on the property arising under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 that have attached to the property since the seizure, and the court shall order the property sold pursuant to a sheriff’s sale or other sale authorized by the court. If any interest in the property was claimed by a financial institution or other claimant and the interest was upheld but not foreclosed, the property must be sold subject to the interest. The sale of the property must be held within such time as may be prescribed by the court following entry of the judgment. The judgment shall also order the proceeds of such sale applied in the following order:

      (A) To the payment of the costs of the sale;

      (B) If the property is a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, to reimburse the seizing agency for the cost of disabling the hidden compartment;

      (C) To the satisfaction of the foreclosed liens, security interests and contracts in the order of their priority; and

      (D) The excess, if any, to the seizing agency to be disposed of as provided in ORS 131.594 or 131.597.

      (d) If the court has determined that the property should be forfeited and has not foreclosed the interests of any party in the property, the seizing agency shall pay all costs and expenses relating to towing and storage of the property and shall cause to be discharged any possessory chattel liens on the property arising under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 that have attached to the property since the seizure. The court shall enter a judgment awarding the property to the seizing agency, subject to the interests of any claimants whose claims or affidavits were upheld by the court, and subject to the interests of any financial institutions that filed affidavits under ORS 131.579 (1), that remain in full force and effect. If the property is a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, the interests of any claimants or financial institutions shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by the cost of disabling the hidden compartment.

      (4) Upon motion of the state, the court may include in the judgment of criminal forfeiture an order that directs the seizing agency to distribute to the victim of the crime of conviction a portion of any proceeds from property received by the seizing agency if the court included an order of restitution in the criminal judgment.

      (5) The seizing agency is not liable to any person as a consequence of obedience to a judgment directing conveyance to a financial institution.

      (6)(a) On entry of judgment for a claimant in any proceeding to forfeit property under ORS 131.550 to 131.600, unless the court has foreclosed one or more security interests, liens or other interests covering the property, the property or interest in property must be returned or conveyed immediately to the claimant designated by the court.

      (b) If it appears that there was reasonable suspicion that the property was subject to criminal forfeiture, the court shall cause a finding to be entered and no claimant or financial institution is entitled to damages nor is the person who made the seizure, the seizing agency or forfeiture counsel liable to suit or judgment on account of the seizure or action. An order directing seizure issued under ORS 131.561 constitutes a finding of reasonable suspicion that the property was subject to criminal forfeiture.

      (7) Except for deficiencies resulting from disabling a hidden compartment in a motor vehicle with a hidden compartment, nothing in this section prevents a claimant or financial institution from obtaining any deficiency to which the claimant or financial institution would otherwise be entitled.

      (8) Nothing in this section or in ORS 131.564 prevents a seizing agency from entering into an agreement with a claimant or other person for the reimbursement of the seizing agency for the costs and expenses relating to towing and storage of property or the cost of discharging any possessory chattel lien on the property arising under ORS 87.152 to 87.162 that attached to the property in the period between the seizure of the property and the release or criminal forfeiture of the property. [2005 c.830 §14; 2009 c.617 §4; 2009 c.874 §3; 2011 c.504 §3]

 

      131.591 Equitable distribution of property or proceeds; intergovernmental agreements. Distribution of property or proceeds in accordance with ORS 131.550 to 131.600 must be made equitably and may be made pursuant to intergovernmental agreement under ORS chapter 190. Intergovernmental agreements providing for such distributions and in effect on September 2, 2005, remain valid unless changed by the parties. The equitable distribution of proceeds targeted for law enforcement must involve sharing the proceeds between the seizing agency and forfeiture counsel. [2005 c.830 §15]

      131.597 Disposition and distribution of forfeited property when seizing agency is the state.

LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACTS POLICY AND DATA REVIEW COMMITTEE

 

      131.905 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Surveys of the trust and confidence placed by Oregonians in state and local law enforcement indicate that there are Oregonians who believe that some law enforcement officers have engaged in practices that inequitably and unlawfully discriminate against individuals solely on the basis of their race, color or national origin.

      (2) State and local law enforcement agencies can perform their missions more effectively when all Oregonians have trust and confidence that law enforcement stops and other contacts with individuals are free from inequitable and unlawful discrimination based on race, color or national origin.

      (3) Representatives of community interest groups and state and local law enforcement agencies agree that collecting certain demographic data about contacts between individuals and state or local law enforcement officers will provide a statistical foundation to ensure that future contacts are free from inequitable and unlawful discrimination based on race, color or national origin.

      (4) Demographic data collection can establish a factual and quantifiable foundation for measuring progress in eliminating discrimination based on race, color or national origin during law enforcement stops and other contacts with individuals, but data collection alone does not provide a sufficient basis for corrective action. Proper analysis of the demographic data and enactment of meaningful reforms in response to the results of that analysis require careful consideration of all relevant factors including the context of the community in which the data has been collected.

      (5) It is the goal of this state that all law enforcement agencies perform their missions without inappropriate use of race, color or national origin as the basis for law enforcement actions. This goal may be achieved by providing assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies and the communities that they serve.

      (6) This state shall foster, encourage and support the collection and analysis of demographic data by state and local law enforcement agencies. [2001 c.687 §5]

 

      131.906 Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee; duties; report. (1) There is created the Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee consisting of 11 members appointed by the Governor.

      (2) The purpose of the committee is to receive and analyze demographic data to ensure that law enforcement agencies perform their missions without inequitable or unlawful discrimination based on race, color or national origin.

      (3) To achieve its purpose, the committee shall collect and analyze demographic data to:

      (a) Provide information to assist communities and state and local law enforcement agencies in evaluating the policies, training and procedures of law enforcement agencies regarding the treatment of individuals during stops and other contacts with law enforcement;

      (b) Inform state and local law enforcement agencies and communities about law enforcement practices; and

      (c) Provide opportunities for communities and state and local law enforcement agencies to work together to increase public trust and confidence in law enforcement and to enhance the capacity of communities and law enforcement agencies to provide more effective public safety services.

      (4) The committee shall:

      (a) Solicit demographic data concerning law enforcement stops and other contacts between state and local law enforcement agencies and individuals;

      (b) Publicize programs, procedures and policies from communities that have made progress toward eliminating discrimination based on race, color or national origin during law enforcement stops and other contacts with individuals;

      (c) Provide technical assistance, including refinement of the minimum data elements as necessary for effective analysis, to state and local law enforcement agencies that desire to begin collecting demographic data;

      (d) Provide technical assistance to communities and state and local law enforcement agencies that desire to engage in local efforts to involve individuals in the establishment and implementation of programs, procedures and policies that will advance the goal of ORS 131.905;

      (e) Obtain resources for independent analysis and interpretation of demographic data collected by state or local law enforcement agencies;

      (f) Accept and analyze demographic data collected by a state or local law enforcement agency if requested by a state or local law enforcement agency and if resources are available; and

      (g) Report to the public the results of analyses of demographic data.

      (5) In carrying out its purpose, the committee may request and receive data files from participating law enforcement agencies and may analyze data for each reported contact. These data files should contain as many of the following items of information as are collected by the participating law enforcement agency:

      (a) The reason for the law enforcement stop or other contact;

      (b) The law enforcement officer’s perception of the race, color or national origin of the individual involved in the contact;

      (c) The individual’s gender;

      (d) The individual’s age;

      (e) Whether a search was conducted in connection with the contact, and if so, what resulted from the search;

      (f) The disposition of the law enforcement action, if any, resulting from the contact; and

      (g) Additional data as recommended by the committee that state and local law enforcement agencies should collect and submit.

      (6) Data received by the committee for analysis under this section may not identify a particular law enforcement officer or a particular individual whose demographic data is collected by a state or local law enforcement agency.

      (7) The committee shall elect one of its members to serve as chairperson.

      (8) Members of the committee who are not members of the Legislative Assembly are not entitled to compensation, but may be reimbursed for actual and necessary travel and other expenses incurred by them in the performance of their official duties in the manner and amounts provided for in ORS 292.495. Claims for expenses incurred in performing functions of the committee shall be paid out of funds appropriated to Portland State University for purposes of the committee.

      (11) The committee shall make findings and issue recommendations for action to achieve the purpose of this section. The committee shall submit a report containing its findings and recommendations to the appropriate interim legislative committees annually on or before December 1.

      (12) After completion of the analysis of the data from at least two state or local law enforcement agencies, the committee may recommend the collection of additional data elements.

      (13) This section does not prohibit a state or local law enforcement agency from collecting data in addition to the information listed in subsection (5) of this section. [2001 c.687 §6; 2007 c.190 §2; 2009 c.859 §1]

 

      131.908 Funding contributions. Portland State University may accept contributions of funds from the United States, its agencies, or from any other source, public or private, and agree to conditions thereon not inconsistent with the purposes of the Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee. [2001 c.687 §8; 2007 c.190 §3]

 

      131.909 Moneys received. All moneys received by Portland State University under ORS 131.908 shall be paid into the State Treasury and deposited into the General Fund to the credit of Portland State University. Such moneys are appropriated continuously to Portland State University for the purposes of ORS 131.906. [2001 c.687 §9; 2007 c.190 §4]
