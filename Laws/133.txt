The notice shall consist of handing each person a copy of the following statement:

______________________________________________________________________________

      IF YOU ARE THE VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR ABUSE, you can ask the district attorney to file a criminal complaint. You also have the right to go to the circuit court and file a petition requesting any of the following orders for relief: (a) An order restraining your attacker from abusing you; (b) an order directing your attacker to leave your household; (c) an order preventing your attacker from entering your residence, school, business or place of employment; (d) an order awarding you or the other parent custody of or parenting time with a minor child or children; (e) an order restraining your attacker from molesting or interfering with minor children in your custody; (f) an order awarding you other relief the court considers necessary to provide for your or your children’s safety, including emergency monetary assistance. Such orders are enforceable in every state.

      You may also request an order awarding support for minor children in your care or for your support if the other party has a legal obligation to support you or your children.

      You also have the right to sue for losses suffered as a result of the abuse, including medical and moving expenses, loss of earnings or support, and other out-of-pocket expenses for injuries sustained and damage to your property.

      133.073 Electronic filing of criminal citation; court rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 133.065, a peace officer, following procedures established by court rule, may file a criminal citation with or without a form of complaint with the court by electronic means, without an actual signature of the officer, in lieu of filing a duplicate paper copy of the citation. A criminal citation filed under this section may be of a different size or format than a uniform citation adopted by the Supreme Court under ORS 1.525. A peace officer who files a criminal citation under this section is deemed to certify the citation and any complaint included with the citation by that filing and has the same rights, responsibilities and liabilities in relation to the citation and any complaint included with the citation as an officer has in relation to citations and complaints that are filed with the court in paper form and are certified by actual signature.

      (2) A court may allow electronic filing of criminal citations as described under subsection (1) of this section. Procedures established to allow electronic filing of criminal citations under this section shall be established by court rule and shall include procedures necessary to ensure that:

      (a) An electronically filed criminal citation with or without a form of complaint includes all information required on a uniform citation adopted by the Supreme Court under ORS 1.525. However, an electronically filed criminal citation containing all required information, but of a different size or format than a uniform citation adopted by the Supreme Court under ORS 1.525, shall not be prohibited by or found in violation of a rule established under this subsection.

      (b) An electronically filed criminal citation with or without a form of complaint is verifiable as being filed by a specific peace officer.

      (c) Members of the public can obtain copies of and review a criminal citation with or without a form of complaint that is electronically filed and maintained under this section in the same manner as the manner used for those filed on paper.

      (3) For a criminal citation with a form of complaint issued under ORS 133.069, the district attorney’s review required by ORS 133.069 and, if necessary, amendments for legal sufficiency, must be completed before the electronic filing of the citation with the form of complaint is made with a court under this section.

      133.076 Failure to appear on criminal citation. (1) A person commits the offense of failure to appear on a criminal citation if the person has been served with a criminal citation issued under ORS 133.055 to 133.076 and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following:

      (a) Make an appearance in the manner required by ORS 133.060.

      (b) Make appearance at the time set for trial in the criminal proceeding.

      (c) Appear at any other time required by the court or by law.

When a crime is committed in the presence of a magistrate, the magistrate may, by a verbal or written order, command any person to arrest the offender and may thereupon proceed as if the offender had been brought before the magistrate upon a warrant of arrest.

      133.350 [Repealed by 1973 c.836 §358]

 

      133.360 Arrests on warrant or order transmitted by telegraph. Whenever any person has been indicted or accused on oath of any public offense, or thereof convicted, and a warrant of arrest has been issued, the magistrate issuing the warrant, or any judge of the Supreme Court, or of the Court of Appeals, or of a circuit or county court, may indorse thereon an order signed by the magistrate or judge authorizing the service thereof by telegraph. Thereupon the warrant and order may be sent by telegraph to any marshal, sheriff, constable or police officer and on receipt of the telegraphic copy thereof, as defined in ORS 165.840, by any such officer, the officer shall have the same authority and be under the same obligations to arrest, take into custody and detain the person as if the original warrant of arrest with the proper direction for its service duly indorsed thereon had been placed in the hands of the officer. The telegraphic copy shall be entitled to full faith and credit and shall have the same force and effect in all courts and places as the original. Prior to indictment or conviction, no such order shall be made by any officer unless in the judgment of the officer there is probable cause to believe the accused person guilty of the offense charged, but the making of such order by any officer is prima facie evidence of the regularity thereof and of all proceedings prior thereto. The original warrant and order, or a copy thereof certified by the officer making the order, shall be preserved in the telegraph office from which the same is sent and in telegraphing the same, the original or the certified copy may be used. [Amended by 1969 c.198 §61; 1991 c.67 §26]

      (a) In connection with an investigation into aggravated murder as defined in ORS 163.095 or a crime listed in ORS 137.700 or 137.707; or

      (b) With a person under 18 years of age in connection with an investigation into a felony, or an allegation that the person being interviewed committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to:

      (a) A statement made before a grand jury;

      (b) A statement made on the record in open court;

      (c) A custodial interview conducted in another state in compliance with the laws of that state;

      (d) A custodial interview conducted by a federal law enforcement officer in compliance with the laws of the United States;

      (i) A custodial interview for which the state demonstrates good cause for the failure to electronically record the interview.

      (3)(a) If the state offers an unrecorded statement made under the circumstances described in subsection (1)(a) of this section in a criminal proceeding alleging the commission of aggravated murder or a crime listed in ORS 137.700 or 137.707, or under the circumstances described in subsection (1)(b) of this section in a criminal proceeding alleging the commission of a felony, and the state is unable to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an exception described in subsection (2) of this section applies, upon the request of the defendant, the court shall instruct the jury regarding the legal requirement described in subsection (1) of this section and the superior reliability of electronic recordings when compared with testimony about what was said and done.

      (b) The court may not exclude the defendant’s statement or dismiss criminal charges as a result of a violation of this section.

      (c) If each of the statements made by the defendant that the state offers into evidence is recorded, the court may not give a cautionary jury instruction regarding the content of the defendant’s statements.

      (4) If the state offers an unrecorded statement made under the circumstances described in subsection (1)(b) of this section in a juvenile delinquency proceeding alleging the commission of an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, and the state is unable to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an exception described in subsection (2) of this section applies, the court shall consider the superior reliability of electronic recordings when compared with testimony about what was said and done when determining the evidentiary value of the statement.

      (5) A law enforcement agency that creates an electronic recording of a custodial interview shall preserve the recording until the defendant’s conviction or youth’s adjudication for the offense is final and all direct, post-conviction relief and habeas corpus appeals are exhausted, or until the prosecution of the offense is barred by law.

      (6) The state shall provide an electronic copy of a defendant’s or youth’s custodial interview to a defendant or youth in accordance with ORS 135.805 to 135.873. Providing an electronic copy of the custodial interview to the defendant or youth constitutes compliance with ORS 135.815 (1)(b), and the state is not required to provide the defendant or youth with a transcript of the contents of the interview. Unless the court orders otherwise, the defendant’s or youth’s attorney may not copy, disseminate or republish the electronic copy of the custodial interview, except to provide a copy to an agent of the defendant’s or youth’s attorney for the limited purpose of case preparation.

      (7) An electronic recording of a custodial interview, and any transcription of the recording, that is certified as containing a complete recording, or a complete transcription, of the entirety of the custodial interview, from the advisement of constitutional rights to the conclusion of the custodial interview, is admissible in any pretrial or post-trial hearing for the purpose of establishing the contents of a statement made in the recording and the identity of the person who made the statement, if the statement is otherwise admissible. A certification that complies with this subsection satisfies the requirements of ORS 40.505 and 132.320 for the recording or transcription. This subsection does not prohibit a party from calling a witness to testify regarding the custodial interview.

      (8) As used in this section:

      (a) “Custodial interview” means an interview in which the person questioned is in custody and is required to be advised of the person’s constitutional rights.

      (b) “Good cause” includes, but is not limited to, situations in which:

      (A) The defendant or youth refused, or expressed an unwillingness, to have the custodial interview electronically recorded;

      (B) The failure to electronically record the custodial interview was the result of equipment failure and a replacement device was not immediately available;

      (C) The person operating the recording equipment believed, in good faith, that the equipment was recording the custodial interview;

      (D) Electronically recording the custodial interview would jeopardize the safety of any person or the identity of a confidential informant;

      (E) Exigent circumstances prevented the recording of the custodial interview; or

      (F) The peace officer conducting the custodial interview reasonably believed, at the time the custodial interview began, that the custodial interview:

      (ii) Was conducted in connection with a crime other than a felony, or an allegation that the person being interviewed committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, if the person is under 18 years of age.

If the court does not order the return of the vehicle or conveyance, the movant shall obtain the return only as provided in ORS 133.465.

      (5) If the court orders the return of the vehicle or conveyance to the movant, the movant shall not be liable for any towing or storage costs incurred as a result of the seizure.

      (2) The sheriff, after deducting the expense of keeping the property and the cost of sale, shall pay, according to their priorities, all liens which are established by intervention or otherwise at such hearing or in other proceedings brought for said purpose and shall pay the balance of the proceeds into the general fund of the county.

      (3) No claim of ownership or of any right, title or interest in the vehicle or other conveyance shall be held invalid unless the state shows to the satisfaction of the court, by clear and convincing evidence that the claimant had knowledge that the vehicle or other conveyance was used or to be used in violation of law.

All liens against property sold under this section or ORS 133.475 or 133.485 shall be transferred from the property to the proceeds of the sale of the property. [Formerly 142.100]

(Search and Seizure Pursuant to Warrant)

 

      133.545 Issuance of search warrant; where executable; form of application. (1) A search warrant may be issued only by a judge. A search warrant issued by a judge of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals may be executed anywhere in the state. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, a search warrant issued by a judge of a circuit court may be executed only within the judicial district in which the court is located. A search warrant issued by a justice of the peace may be executed only within the county in which the justice court is located. A search warrant issued by a municipal judge authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of a justice of the peace may be executed only in the municipality in which the court is located.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a circuit court judge may authorize execution of a search warrant outside the judicial district in which the court is located, if the judge finds from the application that one or more of the objects of the search relate to an offense committed or triable within the judicial district in which the court is located. If the warrant authorizes the installation or tracking of a mobile tracking device, the officer may track the device in any county to which it is transported.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a circuit court judge duly assigned pursuant to ORS 1.615 to serve as a judge pro tempore in a circuit court may authorize execution of a search warrant in any judicial district in which the judge serves as judge pro tempore if the application requesting the warrant includes an affidavit showing that a regularly elected or appointed circuit court judge for the judicial district is not available, whether by reason of conflict of interest or other reason, to issue the warrant within a reasonable time.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a circuit court judge may authorize execution of a search warrant outside the judicial district in which the court is located if the judge finds that:

      (a) The search relates to one of the following offenses involving a victim who was 65 years of age or older at the time of the offense:

      (A) Criminal mistreatment in the first degree as described in ORS 163.205 (1)(b)(D) or (E);

      (B) Identity theft;

      (C) Aggravated identity theft;

      (D) Computer crime;

      (E) Fraudulent use of a credit card;

      (F) Forgery in any degree;

      (G) Criminal possession of a forged instrument in any degree;

      (H) Theft in any degree; or

      (I) Aggravated theft in the first degree;

      (b) The objects of the search consist of financial records; and

      (c) The person making application for the search warrant is not able to ascertain at the time of the application the proper place of trial for the offense described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (5) Application for a search warrant may be made only by a district attorney, a police officer or a special agent employed under ORS 131.805.

      (6) The application shall consist of a proposed warrant in conformance with ORS 133.565, and shall be supported by one or more affidavits particularly setting forth the facts and circumstances tending to show that the objects of the search are in the places, or in the possession of the individuals, to be searched. If an affidavit is based in whole or in part on hearsay, the affiant shall set forth facts bearing on any unnamed informant’s reliability and shall disclose, as far as possible, the means by which the information was obtained.

      (7) Instead of the written affidavit described in subsection (6) of this section, the judge may take an oral statement under oath. The oral statement shall be recorded and a copy of the recording submitted to the judge who took the oral statement. In such cases, the judge shall certify that the recording of the sworn oral statement is a true recording of the oral statement under oath and shall retain the recording as part of the record of proceedings for the issuance of the warrant. The recording shall constitute an affidavit for the purposes of this section. The applicant shall retain a copy of the recording and shall provide a copy of the recording to the district attorney if the district attorney is not the applicant.

      (8)(a) In addition to the procedure set out in subsection (7) of this section, the proposed warrant and the affidavit may be sent to the court by facsimile transmission or any similar electronic transmission that delivers a complete printable image of the signed affidavit and proposed warrant. The affidavit may have a notarized acknowledgment, or the affiant may swear to the affidavit by telephone. A judge administering an oath telephonically under this subsection must execute a declaration that recites the manner and time of the oath’s administration. The declaration must be filed with the return.

      (b) When a court issues a warrant upon an application made under paragraph (a) of this subsection:

      (A) The court may transmit the signed warrant to the person making application under subsection (5) of this section by means of facsimile transmission or similar electronic transmission, as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The court shall file the original signed warrant and a printed image of the application with the return.

      (B) The person making application shall deliver the original signed affidavit to the court with the return. If the affiant swore to the affidavit by telephone, the affiant must so note next to the affiant’s signature on the affidavit. [1973 c.836 §83; 1985 c.344 §1; 1989 c.983 §3; 1995 c.658 §73; 1999 c.56 §1; 2007 c.547 §1; 2009 c.334 §1; 2013 c.155 §11; 2013 c.225 §1; 2015 c.415 §1]

      133.555 Hearing. (1) Before acting on the application, the judge may examine on oath the affiants, and the applicant and any witnesses the applicant may produce, and may call such witnesses as the judge considers necessary to a decision. The judge shall make and keep a record of any testimony taken before the judge. The record shall be admissible as evidence on any motion to suppress.

      (2) If the judge finds that the application meets the requirements of ORS 133.545 and that, on the basis of the record made before the judge, there is probable cause to believe that the search will discover things specified in the application and subject to seizure under ORS 133.535, the judge shall issue a search warrant based on the finding of the judge and in accordance with the requirements of ORS 133.545 to 133.615. If the judge does not so find, the judge shall deny the application.

      (3) The judge may orally authorize a police officer, a district attorney or a special agent employed under ORS 131.805 to sign the judge’s name on a duplicate original warrant. A duplicate original warrant shall be a search warrant for the purposes of ORS 133.535 to 133.615, and it shall be returned to the judge as provided in ORS 133.615. In such cases a judge shall enter on the face of the original warrant the exact time of the issuance of the warrant and shall sign and file the original warrant in the manner provided by law.

      (4) Until the warrant is executed, the proceedings upon application for a search warrant shall be conducted with secrecy appropriate to the circumstances. [1973 c.836 §84; 2009 c.334 §2]

 

      133.560 [Repealed by 1973 c.836 §358]

      (2) The executing officer shall, before entering the premises, give appropriate notice of the identity, authority and purpose of the officer to the person to be searched, or to the person in apparent control of the premises to be searched, as the case may be.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 133.619, before undertaking any search or seizure pursuant to the warrant, the executing officer shall read and give a copy of the warrant to the person to be searched, or to the person in apparent control of the premises to be searched.

[1973 c.836 §88; 1989 c.983 §5]

 

      133.605 Use of force in executing warrants. (1) The executing officer and other officers accompanying and assisting the officer may use the degree of force, short of deadly physical force, against persons, or to effect an entry, or to open containers, as is reasonably necessary for the execution of the search warrant with all practicable safety.

      (2) The use of deadly physical force in the execution of a search warrant is justifiable only:

      (a) If the officer reasonably believes that there is a substantial risk that things to be seized will be used to cause death or serious physical injury if their seizure is delayed and that the force used creates no substantial risk of injury to persons other than those obstructing the officer; or

      (b) If the officer reasonably believes that the use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the officer or another person from the use or threatened imminent use of deadly physical force. [1973 c.836 §89]

      (4) If the issuing judge does not have jurisdiction to inquire into the offense in respect to which the warrant was issued or the offense apparently disclosed by the things seized, the judge shall transmit the warrant and the record of proceedings for its issuance, together with the documents submitted on the return, to the clerk of the appropriate court having jurisdiction to inquire into such offense. [1973 c.836 §90]

      (2) If an officer makes an arrest in connection with the seizure, the officer shall, as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, make a written list of the things seized and furnish a copy of the list to the defendant.

      (3) If no claim to rightful possession has been established under ORS 133.633 to 133.663, the things seized may be disposed of in accordance with ORS 98.245 or the court may order that the things be delivered to the officials having responsibility under the applicable laws for selling, destroying or otherwise disposing of contraband, forfeited or unclaimed goods in official custody. If the responsible officials are state officials and the property is forfeited, the clear proceeds shall be deposited with the State Treasury in the Common School Fund.

      (4) If things seized in connection with an arrest are not needed for evidentiary purposes, and if a person having a rightful claim establishes identity and right to possession beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the seizing officer, the officer may summarily return the things seized to their rightful possessor. If the things seized are perishable and it is not possible to return them to their rightful possessor, the seizing officer may dispose of the items as justice and the necessities of the case require. [1973 c.836 §109; 1987 c.858 §1; 1997 c.480 §3]

      (b) Any other person asserting a claim to rightful possession of the things seized may move the appropriate court to restore the things seized to the movant.

      (2) The appropriate court to consider such motion is:

      (a) The court having ultimate trial jurisdiction over any crime charged in connection with the seizure;

      (b) If no crime is charged in connection with the seizure, the court to which the warrant was returned; or

      (c) If the seizure was not made under a warrant and no crime is charged in connection with the seizure, any court having authority to issue search warrants in the county in which the seizure was made.

      (3) The movant shall serve a copy of the motion upon the district attorney or the city attorney, whichever is appropriate, of the jurisdiction in which the property is in custody.

      (4) No filing, appearance or hearing fees may be charged for filing or hearing a motion under this section.

      (5)(a) The things seized that are the subject of a motion for return under this section may include raw data obtained from the forensic imaging of a portable electronic device or of a computer.

      133.643 Ground for motion for return or restoration of things seized. A motion for the return or restoration of things seized shall be based on the ground that the movant has a valid claim to rightful possession thereof, because:

      (1) The things had been stolen or otherwise converted, and the movant is the owner or rightful possessor;

      (2) The things seized were not in fact subject to seizure under ORS 131.550 to 131.600 or 133.525 to 133.703;

      (3) The movant, by license or otherwise, is lawfully entitled to possess things otherwise subject to seizure under ORS 133.525 to 133.703;

      (4) Although the things seized were subject to seizure under ORS 133.525 to 133.703, the movant is or will be entitled to their return or restoration upon the court’s determination that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes; or

      (2) An order granting a motion for return or restoration of things seized shall be reviewable on appeal in regular course. An order denying such a motion or entered under ORS 133.663 shall be reviewable on appeal upon certification by the court having custody of the things in question that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes.

      (3)(a) An order granting a motion for return of raw data obtained from the forensic imaging of a portable electronic device or of a computer shall include a provision that a law enforcement agency may not retain a copy of the raw data to be returned.

      133.707 Custodian’s obligation to preserve biological evidence; effect of inability to produce in judicial proceeding; rules. (1) A custodian shall preserve biological evidence in accordance with ORS 133.705 to 133.717 if the evidence:

      (a) Is collected as part of a criminal investigation into a covered offense; or

      (b) Is otherwise in the possession of the custodian and reasonably may be used to incriminate or exculpate any person for a covered offense.

      (2) When a custodian is required to preserve biological evidence under subsection (1) of this section, the custodian shall preserve the evidence in an amount and manner that is sufficient to develop a DNA profile. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 133.705 to 133.717, the biological evidence must be preserved:

      (a) If the covered offense is aggravated murder, murder, rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree or unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree, for 60 years from the date each person is convicted of the offense or until each person convicted of the offense has died, whichever is earlier.

      (b) If the covered offense is aggravated vehicular homicide, manslaughter in the first degree or manslaughter in the second degree, until each person convicted of the offense has served the person’s sentence.

      (c) If no person is convicted of the covered offense or the law enforcement agency investigating the covered offense closes the case for a reason other than the conviction of a person, until the expiration of the statute of limitations.

      (3) A custodian is not required to preserve physical evidence solely because the physical evidence contains biological evidence if the physical evidence is of such a size, bulk or physical character as to render retention impracticable. When the retention of physical evidence is impracticable, the custodian shall remove and preserve portions of the physical evidence likely to contain biological evidence in a quantity sufficient to permit future DNA testing before returning or disposing of the physical evidence.

      (4) Upon the conclusion of any trial or hearing involving a covered offense, the court shall return any biological evidence in the possession of the court to the custodian responsible for preserving the biological evidence under ORS 133.705 to 133.717, unless the evidence was collected by the defense. If the evidence was collected by the defense, the court shall return the evidence to the attorney for the defendant.

      (5) If a custodian is required to preserve biological evidence under ORS 133.705 to 133.717 and the custodian is unable to produce the evidence in a judicial proceeding, the individual to whom the custodian has delegated the duty to preserve the evidence shall prepare, sign and file with the court a sworn affidavit that indicates that the custodian is unable to produce the evidence and describes the efforts taken to locate the evidence.

      (6) If a court finds that biological evidence was destroyed in violation of ORS 133.705 to 133.717, the court, after determining whether the evidence was destroyed maliciously, may impose appropriate sanctions and order appropriate remedies. The court may not order the reversal of a conviction under this subsection on the sole grounds that the biological evidence is no longer available.

      (7)(a) The Attorney General shall adopt rules establishing:

      (A) Standards for the proper collection, retention, preservation and cataloging of biological evidence applicable to criminal investigations into, and criminal prosecutions for, covered offenses; and

      (B) A standard form for use by custodians in providing the written notice described in ORS 133.709 (1).

      (b) The Attorney General shall consult with the Department of State Police and custodians before adopting rules under this subsection. [2009 c.489 §1; 2011 c.275 §1]

 

      Note: See note under 133.705.

 

      133.709 Notice of intent to dispose; motion to preserve. (1)(a) A custodian may seek to dispose of biological evidence before the period of time specified in ORS 133.707 (2), by providing written notice, in the form developed under ORS 133.707 (7), to the district attorney having jurisdiction over the prosecution of the covered offense. Upon receipt of the notice, the district attorney shall determine whether to object to the disposal of any of the biological evidence identified in the custodian’s notice.

      (b) If the district attorney objects to the disposal of any of the biological evidence identified in the custodian’s notice, the district attorney shall provide written notice of the objection to the custodian that identifies the biological evidence that the district attorney determines must be preserved. The custodian shall preserve any biological evidence identified by the district attorney in the notice until the period of time specified in ORS 133.707 (2) has elapsed.

      (c) If the district attorney does not object to the disposal of all or a portion of the biological evidence identified in the custodian’s notice, the district attorney shall provide written notice of the intent to dispose of biological evidence, identifying the biological evidence that the district attorney has determined may be disposed of, to:

      (A) The defendant;

      (B) The most recent attorney of record for the defendant; and

      (C) The Department of Justice.

      (2) If evidence that is subject to ORS 133.707 is the property of the victim, the victim may request that the district attorney determine whether the property may be returned to the victim. The request must be in writing and must identify the property that the victim seeks to have returned. If the district attorney:

      (a) Objects to the return of any of the property to the victim, the district attorney shall notify the victim of that determination.

      (b) Does not object to the return of all or a portion of the property, the district attorney shall provide written notice of the intent to dispose of biological evidence, identifying the property the district attorney has determined may be returned, to:

      (A) The victim;

      (B) The defendant;

      (C) The most recent attorney of record for the defendant; and

      (D) The Department of Justice.

      (3)(a) Not later than 120 days after the date the district attorney provides written notice to the defendant under subsection (1)(c) or (2)(b) of this section, the defendant may file a motion to preserve biological evidence in the convicting court. The defendant shall provide a copy of the motion to the district attorney and the custodian. If the motion is timely filed, the court shall enter an order as provided in ORS 133.715.

      (b) If the defendant fails to file a motion to preserve biological evidence before the expiration of the 120-day period specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the district attorney shall file with the court a copy of the notice of intent to dispose of biological evidence sent to the defendant under subsection (1)(c) or (2)(b) of this section. Following the filing of the notice, the court shall, without hearing, enter an order authorizing the disposal of the biological evidence described in the notice. The court shall provide a copy of the order to the custodian, the district attorney and each person or entity described in subsection (1)(c) or (2)(b) of this section, as applicable.

      (c) The 120-day period specified in this subsection begins on the date the notice is mailed. [2011 c.275 §3]

      133.710 [Renumbered 135.115]

 

      133.713 Inventory; right to review. (1) Upon written request by the defendant, the district attorney shall provide the defendant with an inventory of biological evidence that has been preserved under ORS 133.705 to 133.717 and is related to the covered offense for which the defendant was convicted.

      (2) A defendant or, if the defendant is represented by an attorney, the defendant’s attorney has the right to reasonably review biological evidence that is the subject of a written notice of intent to dispose of biological evidence under ORS 133.709 for the purpose of preparing a motion to preserve biological evidence. [2011 c.275 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 133.705.

 

      133.715 Order; appeal. (1) Upon receipt of a timely motion to preserve biological evidence under ORS 133.709 (3), the court shall:

      (a) Conduct a hearing to resolve the motion; or

      (b) Enter an order directing the custodian to preserve the biological evidence.

      (2)(a) In determining whether to order the preservation of biological evidence, the court shall consider, in addition to other factors the court considers appropriate, the following factors:

      (A) Whether the identification of the offender was a disputed issue;

      (B) Whether other biological evidence in the case contains DNA in an amount that is sufficient to develop a DNA profile and will not be disposed of;

      (C) If the biological evidence has not previously been tested, whether it is possible to perform testing on the biological evidence;

      (D) Whether the defendant has served all of the sentence imposed; and

      (E) Whether the defendant has exhausted the defendant’s appellate or post-conviction rights.

      (b) If the defendant has not exhausted the defendant’s appellate and post-conviction rights, there is a presumption that the biological evidence should be preserved.

      (c) In making the determination described in this subsection, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the court may assign the weight the court deems appropriate to the factors described in paragraph (a) of this subsection and to any other factor the court determines is appropriate.

      (d) For purposes of subparagraph (2)(a)(A) of this section, the court need not presume that identification of the offender is not a disputed issue solely because the defendant has pleaded guilty or no contest to the crime, has confessed to the crime or has made an admission.

      (3) If the court enters an order authorizing the disposal of biological evidence, the order may not authorize disposal to occur sooner than 45 days after the date the order is entered. The court shall provide a copy of the order to the custodian, the district attorney and the defendant.

      (4) Either the state or the defendant may appeal from an order entered under this section in the manner provided in ORS chapter 19 for appeals from judgments. Notwithstanding ORS 19.330, the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays an order entered under this section. [2011 c.275 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 133.705.

 

      133.717 Provision of notice or order to defendant. When a provision of ORS 133.705 to 133.717 requires a district attorney or the court to provide written notice or an order to the defendant and the defendant:

      (1) Is incarcerated for any offense in a Department of Corrections institution, the notice must be sent by regular United States mail in an envelope prominently displaying the words “Legal Mail.”

      (2) Is supervised by a supervisory authority for any offense, the notice must be sent by regular United States mail to the defendant’s last-known address on record with the supervisory authority.

      (3) Is no longer supervised by a supervisory authority, the notice must be sent by certified mail to the defendant’s last-known address. [2011 c.275 §6]

Extensions of any order may be granted, but only when application for an extension is made in accordance with subsection (1)(k) of this section and the court makes the findings required by subsection (3) of this section. The period of extension shall be no longer than the authorizing judge deems necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is granted and in no event for longer than 30 days. Every order and extension of that order shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept must be executed as soon as practicable, must be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception, and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in 30 days.

      (6) Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to this section, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. Such reports shall be made at such intervals as the judge may require. [1979 c.716 §4 (enacted in lieu of 133.725); 1989 c.639 §1; 1989 c.983 §7a; 1995 c.224 §1; 2001 c.385 §6; 2005 c.708 §45; 2007 c.442 §1; 2011 c.151 §8; 2013 c.720 §6]

 

      133.725 [Formerly 141.720; repealed by 1979 c.716 §3 (133.724 enacted in lieu of 133.725)]

 

      133.726 Interception of oral communication without order; order for interception of oral communication; application; grounds for issuance; contents of order; penalties. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 133.724, under the circumstances described in this section, a law enforcement officer is authorized to intercept an oral communication to which the officer or a person under the direct supervision of the officer is a party, without obtaining an order for the interception of a wire, electronic or oral communication under ORS 133.724.

      (2) For purposes of this section and ORS 133.736, a person is a party to an oral communication if the oral communication is made in the person’s immediate presence and is audible to the person regardless of whether the communication is specifically directed to the person.

      (3) An ex parte order for intercepting an oral communication in any county of this state under this section may be issued by any judge as defined in ORS 133.525 upon written application made upon oath or affirmation of the district attorney or a deputy district attorney authorized by the district attorney for the county in which the order is sought or upon the oath or affirmation of any peace officer as defined in ORS 133.005. The application shall include:

      (a) The name of the applicant and the applicant’s authority to make the application;

      (b) A statement demonstrating that there is probable cause to believe that a person whose oral communication is to be intercepted is engaged in committing, has committed or is about to commit a particular felony, or a misdemeanor under ORS 167.007 or 167.008, and that intercepting the oral communication will yield evidence thereof; and

      (c) The identity of the person, if known, suspected of committing the crime and whose oral communication is to be intercepted.

      (4) The judge may require the applicant to furnish further testimony or documentary evidence in support of the application.

      (5) Upon examination of the application and evidence, the judge may enter an ex parte order, as requested or as modified, authorizing or approving the interception of an oral communication within the state if the judge determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that:

      (a) There is probable cause to believe that a person is engaged in committing, has committed or is about to commit a particular felony, or a misdemeanor under ORS 167.007 or 167.008; and

      (b) There is probable cause to believe that the oral communication to be obtained will contain evidence concerning that crime.

      (6) An order authorizing or approving the interception of an oral communication under this section must specify:

      (a) The identity of the person, if known, whose oral communication is to be intercepted;

      (b) A statement identifying the particular crime to which the oral communication is expected to relate;

      (c) The agency authorized under the order to intercept the oral communication;

      (d) The name and office of the applicant and the signature and title of the issuing judge;

      (e) A period of time after which the order shall expire; and

      (f) A statement that the order authorizes only the interception of an oral communication to which a law enforcement officer or a person under the direct supervision of a law enforcement officer is a party.

      (7) An order under ORS 133.724 or this section is not required when a law enforcement officer intercepts an oral communication to which the officer or a person under the direct supervision of the officer is a party if the oral communication is made by a person whom the officer has probable cause to believe has committed, is engaged in committing or is about to commit:

      (a) A crime punishable as a felony under ORS 475.752, 475.806 to 475.894 or 475.906 or as a misdemeanor under ORS 167.007 or 167.008; or

      (b) Any other crime punishable as a felony if the circumstances at the time the oral communication is intercepted are of such exigency that it would be unreasonable to obtain a court order under ORS 133.724 or this section.

      (8) A law enforcement officer who intercepts an oral communication pursuant to this section may not intentionally fail to record and preserve the oral communication in its entirety. A law enforcement officer, or a person under the direct supervision of the officer, who is authorized under this section to intercept an oral communication is not required to exclude from the interception an oral communication made by a person for whom probable cause does not exist if the officer or the person under the officer’s direct supervision is a party to the oral communication.

      (9) A law enforcement officer may not divulge the contents of an oral communication intercepted under this section before a preliminary hearing or trial in which an oral communication is going to be introduced as evidence against a person except:

      (a) To a superior officer or other official with whom the law enforcement officer is cooperating in the enforcement of the criminal laws of this state or the United States;

      (b) To a magistrate;

      (c) In a presentation to a federal or state grand jury; or

      (d) In compliance with a court order.

      (10) A law enforcement officer may intercept an oral communication under this section only when acting within the scope of the officer’s employment and as a part of assigned duties.

      (11) As used in this section, “law enforcement officer” means:

      (a) An officer employed to enforce criminal laws by:

      (A) The United States, this state or a municipal government within this state;

      (B) A political subdivision, agency, department or bureau of the governments described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; or

      (C) A police department established by a university under ORS 352.121 or 353.125;

      (b) An authorized tribal police officer as defined in ORS 181A.680; or

      (c) A regulatory specialist as defined in ORS 471.001.

      (12) Violation of subsection (9) of this section is a Class A misdemeanor. [1983 c.824 §8; 1995 c.224 §2; 2001 c.385 §2; 2003 c.577 §13; 2005 c.708 §46; 2007 c.442 §§2,3; 2011 c.151 §§9,10; 2011 c.644 §§18,19,63,64,71; 2012 c.54 §§12,13; 2013 c.180 §§14,15; 2015 c.174 §7; 2015 c.614 §§143,144]

 

      133.727 Proceeding under expired order prohibited. Any officer who knowingly proceeds under an order which has expired and has not been renewed as provided in ORS 133.724 is deemed to act without authority under ORS 133.724 and shall be subject to the penalties provided in ORS 165.543, as though the officer had never obtained any such order or warrant. [Formerly 141.730; 1979 c.716 §14; 1983 c.824 §7]

 

      133.729 Recording intercepted communications; method; delivery to court; custody. The contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication intercepted in accordance with the provisions of ORS 133.724 shall, if possible, be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device. The recording of the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication under this section shall be done in such way as will protect the recording from editing or other alterations. Immediately upon the expiration of the period of the order issued under ORS 133.724, or extensions thereof, such recordings shall be made available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under the direction of the judge. Custody of the recordings shall be wherever the judge orders. They shall not be destroyed before the expiration of the minimum retention period established by the State Court Administrator under ORS 8.125. Duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of ORS 133.737 (1) and (2) for investigations. The presence of the seal provided for by this section, or a satisfactory explanation for the absence thereof, shall be a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom under ORS 133.737 (3). [1979 c.716 §7; 1989 c.983 §8; 1997 c.872 §12]

      (2) The judge, upon the filing of a motion, may in the judge’s discretion make available to such person or the person’s counsel for inspection such portions of the intercepted communications, applications and orders as the judge determines to be in the interest of justice. On an ex parte showing of good cause to a judge of the circuit court, the serving of the inventory required by this section may be postponed. [1979 c.716 §8; 1989 c.983 §9]

 

      133.733 Procedure for introduction as evidence. The contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication intercepted under ORS 133.724, or evidence derived therefrom, shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing or other proceeding in any court of this state unless each party, not less than 10 days before the trial, hearing or proceeding, has been furnished with a copy of the court order, and accompanying application, under which the interception was authorized or approved. This 10-day period may be waived by the judge if the judge finds that it was not possible to furnish the party with the above information 10 days before the trial, hearing or proceeding and that the party will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving such information. [1979 c.716 §9; 1989 c.983 §10]

 

      133.735 Suppression of intercepted communications; procedure; grounds; appeal.

      (a) The communication was unlawfully intercepted;

      (b) The order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or

      (c) The interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval.

      (2) Such motion shall be made before the trial, hearing or proceeding unless there was no opportunity to make such motion or the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion. If the motion is granted, the contents of the intercepted wire, electronic or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, shall be treated as having been unlawfully obtained. The judge, upon the filing of such motion by the aggrieved person, may in the judge’s discretion make available to the aggrieved person or the person’s counsel for inspection such portions of the intercepted communications or evidence derived therefrom as the judge determines to be in the interests of justice.

      (3) In addition to any other right to appeal, the state shall have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion to suppress under subsection (1) of this section. [1979 c.716 §10; 1989 c.983 §11]

      (2) Any investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means authorized by ORS 133.721 to 133.739, has obtained knowledge of the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication under ORS 133.724, or evidence derived therefrom, may use such contents to the extent such use is appropriate to the proper performance of official duties.

Such contents and any evidence derived therefrom may be used under subsection (3) of this section when authorized or approved by a judge of the circuit court if the judge finds on subsequent application that the contents were otherwise intercepted in accordance with the provisions of ORS 133.724. Such application shall be made as soon as practicable. [1979 c.716 §6; 1989 c.983 §12; 2003 c.14 §56]

      Note: 133.745 was added to and made a part of 133.743 to 133.857 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      133.747 Fugitives from other states; Governor to cause arrest and delivery of criminals. Subject to the qualifications of ORS 133.743 to 133.857 and the provisions of the Constitution of the United States controlling, and Acts of Congress in pursuance thereof, it is the duty of the Governor of this state to have arrested and delivered up to the executive authority of any other state of the United States any person charged in that state with treason, felony, or other crime, who has fled from justice and is found in this state. [Formerly 147.020]

[Formerly 147.040]

 

      133.760 [Amended by 1973 c.836 §140; renumbered 135.165]

 

      133.763 Facts documents must show. A warrant of extradition must not be issued unless the documents presented by the executive authority making the demand show that:

      (1) Except in cases arising under ORS 133.767, the accused, when demanded upon a charge of crime, was present in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime and thereafter fled from that state;

The Governor of this state may also surrender, on demand of the executive authority of any other state, any person in this state charged in such other state in the manner provided in ORS 133.763 with committing an act in this state, or in a third state, intentionally resulting in a crime in the state whose executive authority is making the demand. The provisions of ORS 133.743 to 133.857 not otherwise inconsistent shall apply to such cases, notwithstanding that the accused was not in that state at the time of the commission of the crime and has not fled therefrom.

The warrant must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issue. [Formerly 147.070]

 

      133.777 Execution of the warrant. Such warrant shall authorize the officer or other person to whom directed to arrest the accused at any place where the accused may be found within the state and to command the aid of all sheriffs and other peace officers in the execution of the warrant, and to deliver the accused, subject to the provisions of ORS 133.743 to 133.833 and 133.839 to 133.855, to the duly authorized agent of the demanding state. [Formerly 147.080]

 

      133.780 [Renumbered 136.347]

 

      133.783 Authority of arresting officer to command assistance. Every such officer or other person empowered to make the arrest shall have the same authority in arresting the accused to command assistance therein as sheriffs and other officers have by law in the execution of any criminal process directed to them, with the like penalties against those who refuse their assistance. [Formerly 147.090]

 

      133.787 Rights of arrested person. No person arrested upon such warrant shall be delivered over to the agent whom the executive authority demanding the person shall have appointed to receive the person unless the person has been informed of the demand made for surrender and of the crime with which the person is charged, and that the person has the right to demand legal counsel; and if the prisoner, the friends, or counsel of the prisoner shall state the desire to test the legality of the arrest, the prisoner shall be taken forthwith before a judge of a court of record in this state, who shall fix a reasonable time to be allowed the prisoner within which to apply for a writ of habeas corpus. And when such writ is applied for, notice thereof, and of the time and place of hearing thereon, shall be given to the public prosecuting officer of the county in which the arrest is made and in which the accused is in custody, and to the said agent of the demanding state. [Formerly 147.100]

 

      133.793 Penalty for disobedience to ORS 133.787. Any officer who shall deliver to the agent for extradition of the demanding state a person in the custody of the officer under the Governor’s warrant in disobedience to ORS 133.787 commits a Class B misdemeanor. [Formerly 147.110]

 

      133.797 Confinement of prisoner. (1) The officer or person executing the Governor’s warrant of arrest, or the agent of the demanding state to whom the prisoner may have been delivered, may, when necessary, confine the prisoner in the jail of any county or city through which the officer, person or agent may pass; and the keeper of such jail must receive and safely keep the prisoner until the person having charge of the prisoner is ready to proceed on the route, such person being chargeable with the expense of keeping.

      (2) The officer or agent of a demanding state to whom a prisoner may have been delivered following extradition proceedings in another state, or to whom a prisoner may have been delivered after waiving extradition in such other state, and who is passing through this state with such a prisoner for the purpose of immediately returning such prisoner to the demanding state may, when necessary, confine the prisoner in the jail of any county or city through which the officer or agent may pass; and the keeper of such jail must receive and safely keep the prisoner until the officer or agent having charge of the prisoner is ready to proceed on the route, such officer or agent, however, being chargeable with the expense of keeping; provided, however, that such officer or agent shall produce and show to the keeper of such jail satisfactory written evidence of the fact that the officer or agent is actually transporting such prisoner to the demanding state after a requisition by the executive authority of such demanding state.

      133.803 Arrest prior to requisition. Whenever any person within this state shall be charged on the oath of any credible person before any judge or other magistrate of this state with the commission of a crime in any other state and, except in cases arising under ORS 133.767, with having fled from justice, or with having been convicted of a crime in that state and having escaped from confinement, or having broken the terms of security release, probation or parole, or whenever complaint shall have been made before any judge or other magistrate in this state setting forth on the affidavit of any creditable person in another state that a crime has been committed in such other state and that the accused has been charged in such state with the commission of the crime, and, except in cases arising under ORS 133.767, has fled therefrom or has been convicted of a crime in that state and escaped from confinement, or has broken the terms of security release, probation or parole, and is believed to be in this state, the judge or magistrate shall issue a warrant directed to any peace officer commanding the peace officer to apprehend the person named therein, wherever the person may be found in this state, and bring the person before the same or any other judge, court or magistrate who may be convenient of access to the place where the arrest may be made, to answer the charge or complaint and affidavit, and a certified copy of the sworn charge or complaint and affidavit upon which the warrant is issued shall be attached to the warrant.

The arrest of a person may be lawfully made also by an officer or a private citizen without a warrant, upon reasonable information that the accused stands charged in the courts of another state with a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, but when so arrested the accused must be taken before a judge or magistrate with all practicable speed and complaint must be made against the accused under oath setting forth the ground for the arrest as in ORS 133.803; and thereafter the answer of the accused shall be heard as if the accused had been arrested on a warrant.

If from the initial examination before the judge or magistrate it appears that the person held is the person charged with having committed the crime alleged, the judge or magistrate must commit the person to jail by a warrant reciting the accusation for a period of at least 45 days to enable the arrest of the accused to be made under a warrant of the Governor on a requisition of the executive authority of the state having jurisdiction of the defense, unless the accused is released as provided in ORS 133.809, or until the accused shall be legally discharged. The period of time may be extended upon good cause shown demonstrating the need for additional time to allow the executive authority of the state having jurisdiction of the defense to comply with procedural requirements of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, 18 U.S.C. 3182, or section 2, Article IV of the United States Constitution. [Formerly 147.150; 1999 c.553 §1]

 

      133.809 Release. Unless the offense with which the prisoner is charged is shown to be an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment under the laws of the state in which it was committed, the judge or magistrate must make a release decision concerning the person arrested under ORS 135.230 to 135.290, for the appearance of the person at a time specified in the security release or in the release agreement.

[Formerly 147.180]

 

      133.817 Persons under criminal prosecution in this state at time of requisition.
