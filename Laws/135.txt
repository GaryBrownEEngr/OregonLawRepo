The arraignment consists of reading the accusatory instrument to the defendant, causing delivery to the defendant of a copy thereof and indorsements thereon, including the list of witnesses indorsed on it or appended thereto if the accusatory instrument is an indictment, asking the defendant how the defendant pleads to the charge. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §131; 1983 c.344 §2]

[Formerly 135.110; 1983 c.344 §3; 2005 c.566 §5]

 

      135.035 Bringing in defendant not yet arrested or held to answer.

      (4) At the conclusion of the hearing and prior to trial the court shall prepare and file an order setting forth all rulings of the court on issues raised under subsection (2) of this section. The court shall further prepare and file a memorandum of other matters agreed upon at the hearing.

The court may decline to accept the waiver of counsel if the defendant is charged with a capital offense.

      (d) If the court accepts a defendant’s waiver of counsel, the court may allow an attorney to serve as the defendant’s legal advisor and may, in accordance with ORS 135.050, appoint an attorney as the defendant’s legal advisor.

      (3) Appointed counsel may not be denied to any defendant merely because the defendant’s friends or relatives have resources adequate to retain counsel or because the defendant has deposited or is capable of depositing security for release. However, appointed counsel may be denied to a defendant if the defendant’s spouse has adequate resources which the court determines should be made available to retain counsel.

      (4) The defendant’s financial statement under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall include, but not be limited to:

      (6) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the appointment of counsel under this section shall continue during all criminal proceedings resulting from the defendant’s arrest through acquittal or the imposition of punishment. The court having jurisdiction of the case may not substitute one appointed counsel for another except pursuant to the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.216.

      (7) If, at any time after the appointment of counsel, the court having jurisdiction of the case finds that the defendant is financially able to obtain counsel, the court may terminate the appointment of counsel. If, at any time during criminal proceedings, the court having jurisdiction of the case finds that the defendant is financially unable to pay counsel whom the defendant has retained, the court may appoint counsel as provided in this section.

      (8) The court may order the defendant in a circuit court to pay to the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, through the clerk of the court, in full or in part the administrative costs of determining the eligibility of the defendant for appointed counsel and the costs of the legal and other services that are related to the provision of appointed counsel under ORS 151.487.

      (b) In a county or justice court, the request must be in the form of a motion to the court. The motion must be accompanied by a supporting affidavit that sets out in detail the purpose of the requested expenditure, the name of the service provider or other recipient of the funds, the dollar amount of the requested expenditure that may not be exceeded without additional authorization and the date or dates during which the service will be rendered or events will occur for which the expenditure is requested.

Before proceeding against the defendant as provided in this subsection, the court shall attempt to determine the true name of the defendant. If a certified copy of the record of live birth for the defendant was never issued, the court shall ask the defendant, under oath or affirmation, to give the defendant’s true name. The court shall proceed under the name given unless the court is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that the name is not the defendant’s true name.

If a defendant, on or after August 12, 2003, fails to provide the defendant’s true name under ORS 135.060 or 135.065 and is on personal recognizance, conditional release or security release having deposited less than the full security amount set by the magistrate, the magistrate who released the defendant, upon a motion filed by the district attorney and supported by probable cause, shall cause the defendant to be brought before the magistrate. The magistrate shall conduct a hearing to establish release according to ORS 135.245. [2003 c.645 §7]

      135.245 Release decision. (1) Except as provided in ORS 135.240, a person in custody has the right to immediate security release or to be taken before a magistrate without undue delay.

      (2) If a person in custody does not request a security release at the time of arraignment, the magistrate shall make a release decision regarding the person within 48 hours after the arraignment.

      (3) If the magistrate, having given priority to the primary release criteria, decides to release a defendant or to set security, the magistrate shall impose the least onerous condition reasonably likely to ensure the safety of the public and the victim and the person’s later appearance and, if the person is charged with an offense involving domestic violence, ensure that the person does not engage in domestic violence while on release. A person in custody, otherwise having a right to release, shall be released upon the personal recognizance unless:

      (a) Release criteria show to the satisfaction of the magistrate that such a release is unwarranted; or

      (b) Subsection (6) of this section applies to the person.

      (4) Upon a finding that release of the person on personal recognizance is unwarranted, the magistrate shall impose either conditional release or security release.

      (5) At the release hearing:

      (a) The district attorney has a right to be heard in relation to issues relevant to the release decision; and

      (b) The victim has the right:

      (A) Upon request made within the time period prescribed in the notice required by ORS 147.417, to be notified by the district attorney of the release hearing;

      (6) If a person refuses to provide a true name under the circumstances described in ORS 135.060 and 135.065, the magistrate may not release the person on personal recognizance or on conditional release. The magistrate may release the person on security release under ORS 135.265 except that the magistrate shall require the person to deposit the full security amount set by the magistrate.

      (7) This section shall be liberally construed to carry out the purpose of relying upon criminal sanctions instead of financial loss to assure the appearance of the defendant. [1973 c.836 §149; 1993 c.731 §5; 1997 c.313 §20; 2003 c.645 §6; 2009 c.178 §27]

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an order described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section:

      (a) Shall apply at any time during which the defendant is held in custody on the charge; and

      (b) Shall remain valid until the defendant is sentenced for the crime, the charge is dismissed or the defendant is acquitted of the crime.

      (4) Upon petition of the victim, the court may enter an order terminating an order entered under subsection (1) or (2) of this section if the court finds, after a hearing on the petition, that terminating the order is in the best interests of the parties and the community.

      (5) An order described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall not limit contact with the victim by the defense attorney, or an agent of the defense attorney other than the defendant, in the manner prescribed by ORS 135.970 (2).

      (a) “Domestic violence” has the meaning given that term in ORS 135.230.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court may enter an order waiving the condition that the defendant have no contact with the victim if:

      (A) The victim petitions the court for a waiver; and

      (B) The court finds, after a hearing on the petition, that waiving the condition is in the best interests of the parties and the community.

      (c) If the defendant was provided notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court shall also include in the agreement, when appropriate, terms and findings sufficient under 18 U.S.C. 922 (d)(8) and (g)(8) to affect the defendant’s ability to possess firearms and ammunition or engage in activities involving firearms.

      (d) ORS 107.720 applies to release agreements executed by defendants charged with an offense that constitutes domestic violence, except that proof of service of the release agreement is not required and the agreement may not be terminated at the request of the victim without a hearing. [1973 c.836 §150; 1991 c.111 §10; 1993 c.731 §6; 1999 c.617 §3; 2013 c.151 §2]

[2016 c.24 §53f]

 

      135.255 Release agreement. (1) The defendant shall not be released from custody unless the defendant files with the clerk of the court in which the magistrate is presiding a release agreement duly executed by the defendant containing the conditions ordered by the releasing magistrate or deposits security in the amount specified by the magistrate in accordance with ORS 135.230 to 135.290.

      (2) A failure to appear as required by the release agreement shall be punishable as provided in ORS 162.195 or 162.205.

      (3) “Custody” for purposes of a release agreement does not include temporary custody under the citation procedures of ORS 133.055 to 133.076. [1973 c.836 §151]

 

      135.260 Conditional release. (1) Conditional release may include one or more of the following conditions:

      (a) Release of the defendant into the care of a qualified person or organization responsible for supervising the defendant and assisting the defendant in appearing in court. The supervisor shall not be required to be financially responsible for the defendant, nor to forfeit money in the event the defendant fails to appear in court.

      135.265 Security release. (1) If the defendant is not released on personal recognizance under ORS 135.255, or granted conditional release under ORS 135.260, or fails to agree to the provisions of the conditional release, the magistrate shall set a security amount that will reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance. The defendant shall execute the security release in the amount set by the magistrate.

      (2) The defendant shall execute a release agreement and deposit with the clerk of the court before which the proceeding is pending a sum of money equal to 10 percent of the security amount, but in no event shall such deposit be less than $25. The clerk shall issue a receipt for the sum deposited. Upon depositing this sum the defendant shall be released from custody subject to the condition that the defendant appear to answer the charge in the court having jurisdiction on a day certain and thereafter as ordered by the court until discharged or final order of the court. Once security has been given and a charge is pending or is thereafter filed in or transferred to a court of competent jurisdiction the latter court shall continue the original security in that court subject to ORS 135.280 and 135.285. When conditions of the release agreement have been performed and the defendant has been discharged from all obligations in the cause, the clerk of the court shall return to the person shown by the receipt to have made the deposit, unless the court orders otherwise, 85 percent of the sum which has been deposited and shall retain as security release costs 15 percent, but not less than $5 nor more than $750, of the amount deposited. The interest that has accrued on the full amount deposited shall also be retained by the clerk. The amount retained by the clerk of a circuit court shall be paid over as directed by the State Court Administrator for deposit in the General Fund. The amount retained by a justice of the peace shall be deposited in the county treasury. The amount retained by the clerk of a municipal court shall be deposited in the municipal corporation treasury. At the request of the defendant the court may order whatever amount is repayable to defendant from such security amount to be paid to defendant’s attorney of record.

      (3) Instead of the security deposit provided for in subsection (2) of this section the defendant may deposit with the clerk of the court an amount equal to the security amount in cash, stocks, bonds, or real or personal property situated in this state with equity not exempt owned by the defendant or sureties worth double the amount of security set by the magistrate. The stocks, bonds, real or personal property shall in all cases be justified by affidavit. The magistrate may further examine the sufficiency of the security as the magistrate considers necessary. [1973 c.836 §153; 1979 c.878 §1; 1981 c.837 §1; 1981 s.s. c.3 §112; 1983 c.763 §44; 1987 c.905 §14; 2009 c.659 §§9,11; 2011 c.595 §§158,159]

 

      135.270 Taking of security. (1) When a security amount has been set by a magistrate for a particular offense or for a defendant’s release, any person designated by the magistrate may take the security and release the defendant to appear in accordance with the conditions of the release agreement. The person designated by the magistrate shall give a receipt to the defendant for the security so taken and within a reasonable time deposit the security with the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of the offense.

      (2) If a magistrate has designated a person to take security and release defendants under subsection (1) of this section, the clerk of the court shall continue to accept the security release deposits described in ORS 135.265 during the normal business hours of the court. [1973 c.836 §154; 2015 c.493 §3]

 

      135.275 Seizure of security by law enforcement agency. (1) A law enforcement agency may not seize any cash, cashier’s checks, money orders, credit cards, stocks, bonds or real or personal property that a person deposits, or attempts to deposit, with the clerk of the court, or a person designated by a magistrate to take security under ORS 135.270, in order to obtain security release as described in ORS 135.265 unless the law enforcement agency first obtains:

      (a) A search warrant issued pursuant to ORS 133.545 authorizing seizure of the cash, cashier’s checks, money orders, credit cards, stocks, bonds or real or personal property as items subject to search and seizure as described in ORS 133.535; or

      (b) A court order under ORS 131A.060 directing seizure of the cash, cashier’s checks, money orders, credit cards, stocks, bonds or real or personal property as property subject to forfeiture under ORS 131A.020.

      (2) After seizing cash, cashier’s checks, money orders, credit cards, stocks, bonds or real or personal property under subsection (1) of this section, a law enforcement agency may not further transfer or distribute the cash, cashier’s checks, money orders, credit cards, stocks, bonds or real or personal property to any person or entity without a court order specifically authorizing the transfer or distribution.

      (3) As used in this section, “law enforcement agency” has the meaning given that term in ORS 131A.005. [2015 c.493 §2]

 

      135.280 Arrest warrant; forfeiture. (1) Upon failure of a person to comply with any condition of a release agreement or personal recognizance, the court having jurisdiction may, in addition to any other action provided by law, issue a warrant for the arrest of the person at liberty upon a personal recognizance, conditional or security release.

      (2) A warrant issued under subsection (1) of this section by a municipal judge may be executed by any peace officer authorized to execute arrest warrants.

      (3) If the defendant does not comply with the conditions of the release agreement, the court having jurisdiction shall enter an order declaring the entire security amount to be forfeited. Notice of the order of forfeiture shall be given forthwith by personal service, by mail or by such other means as are reasonably calculated to bring to the attention of the defendant and, if applicable, of the sureties the order of forfeiture. If, within 30 days after the court declares the forfeiture, the defendant does not appear or satisfy the court having jurisdiction that appearance and surrender by the defendant was, or still is, impossible and without fault of the defendant, the court shall enter judgment for the state, or appropriate political subdivision thereof, against the defendant and, if applicable, the sureties for the entire security amount set under ORS 135.265 and the costs of the proceedings. At any time before or after entry of the judgment, the defendant or the sureties may apply to the court for a remission of the forfeiture or to modify or set aside the judgment. The court, upon good cause shown, may remit the forfeiture or any part thereof or may modify or set aside the judgment as in other criminal cases, except the portion of the security deposit that the court ordered to be applied to child support under subsection (4) of this section, as the court considers reasonable under the circumstances of the case. The court shall adopt procedures to ensure that the amount deposited under ORS 135.265 is available for a reasonable period of time for disposition under subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) After entry of a judgment for the state, the court, upon a motion filed under ORS 25.715, may order that a portion of the security deposit be applied to any unsatisfied child support award owed by the defendant and to provide security for child support payments in accordance with ORS 25.230. The portion of the security deposit that may be applied to the child support award:

      (a) Is limited to the amount deposited under ORS 135.265 (2);

      (b) May not exceed 66 percent of the entire security amount set under ORS 135.265 if the deposit has been made under ORS 135.265 (3); and

      (c) Does not reduce the money award in the judgment entered under subsection (3) of this section that is owed to the state.

      (5) When judgment is entered in favor of the state, or any political subdivision of the state, on any security given for a release, the judgment may be enforced as a judgment in a civil action. If entered in circuit court, the judgment shall be entered in the register, and the clerk of the court shall note in the register that the judgment creates a judgment lien. The district attorney, county counsel or city attorney may have execution issued on the judgment and deliver same to the sheriff to be executed by levy on the deposit or security amount made in accordance with ORS 135.265, or may collect the judgment as otherwise provided by law. The proceeds of any execution or collection shall be used to satisfy the judgment and costs and paid into the treasury of the municipal corporation wherein the security was taken if the offense was defined by an ordinance of a political subdivision of this state, or paid into the treasury of the county wherein the security was taken if the offense was defined by a statute of this state and the judgment was entered by a justice court, or paid over as directed by the State Court Administrator for deposit in the Criminal Fine Account, if the offense was defined by a statute of this state and the judgment was entered by a circuit court. The provisions of this section shall not apply to amounts deposited upon appearance under ORS 153.061.

      (6) When the judgment of forfeiture is entered, the security deposit or deposit with the clerk is, by virtue of the judgment alone and without requiring further execution, forfeited to and may be kept by the state or its appropriate political subdivision. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the clerk shall reduce, by the value of the deposit so forfeited, the debt remaining on the judgment and shall cause the amount on deposit to be transferred to the revenue account of the state or political subdivision thereof entitled to receive the proceeds of execution under this section.

      (7) The stocks, bonds, personal property and real property shall be sold in the same manner as in execution sales in civil actions and the proceeds of such sale shall be used to satisfy all court costs, prior encumbrances, if any, and from the balance a sufficient amount to satisfy the judgment shall be paid into the treasury of the municipal corporation wherein the security was taken if the offense was defined by an ordinance of a political subdivision of this state, or paid into the treasury of the county wherein the security was taken if the offense was defined by a statute of this state and the judgment was entered by a justice court, or deposited in the General Fund available for general governmental expenses if the offense was defined by a statute of this state and the judgment was entered by a circuit court. The balance shall be returned to the owner. The real property sold may be redeemed in the same manner as real estate may be redeemed after judicial or execution sales in civil actions. [1973 c.836 §155; 1981 s.s. c.3 §113; 1983 c.763 §45; 1987 c.710 §1; 1987 c.905 §15; 1995 c.658 §74; 1997 c.801 §64; 1999 c.1051 §250; 2001 c.705 §2; 2001 c.829 §10b; 2003 c.576 §161; 2005 c.700 §5; 2011 c.597 §41]

Judgments based upon such pleas and sentences entered upon the pleas are as effective as though heard and determined in open court in the county where the accusation is pending.

      (c) When the offense charged is one for which a different or additional penalty is authorized by reason of the fact that the defendant may be adjudged a dangerous offender, that this fact may be established after a plea in the present action, thereby subjecting the defendant to different or additional penalty.

      (d) That if the defendant is not a citizen of the United States conviction of a crime may result, under the laws of the United States, in deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States or denial of naturalization.

      (e) That if the defendant is entering a guilty plea pursuant to a plea offer and agreed disposition recommendation under ORS 135.405, the court will agree to impose sentence as provided in the agreed disposition recommendation.

      (f) That if the defendant enters a plea of guilty or no contest to an offense involving domestic violence, as defined in ORS 135.230, and is convicted of the offense, federal law may prohibit the defendant from possessing, receiving, shipping or transporting any firearm or firearm ammunition and that the conviction may negatively affect the defendant’s ability to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States as defined in ORS 348.282 or to be employed in law enforcement.

      (3) If the plea agreement includes an agreement that the district attorney will seek or not oppose dismissal of a charge in exchange for the defendant’s plea of guilty or no contest to another charge, the court may not accept the plea of guilty or no contest unless:

      (a) The agreement includes a written provision that indicates whether the court is required to reinstate charges that are dismissed pursuant to the agreement if the plea of guilty or no contest is withdrawn under ORS 135.365 or the judgment of conviction is subsequently reversed, vacated or set aside; and

      (b) If the agreement requires the court to reinstate charges under the circumstances described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the defendant has provided the court with a written waiver of the statute of limitations and any statutory or constitutional speedy trial or double jeopardy rights, applicable to the dismissed charges.

      (4) If the district attorney has agreed to seek charge or sentence concessions which must be approved by the court, the court shall advise the defendant personally that the recommendations of the district attorney are not binding on the court.

      (5)(a) If the district attorney has provided a plea offer and agreed disposition recommendation to the defendant as provided in ORS 135.405 and the defendant is entering a guilty plea based on the plea offer and agreed disposition recommendation, the court shall determine whether the plea is voluntarily made. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if the court finds that the plea is voluntarily made, the court shall impose sentence as provided in the agreed disposition recommendation.

      (b) If the court determines that the agreed disposition recommendation is inappropriate in a particular case, the court shall so advise the parties and allow the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea. [1973 c.836 §168; 2001 c.635 §11; 2009 c.356 §1]

      135.407 Plea agreement must contain defendant’s criminal history classification; stipulations. In cases arising from felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989:

      (1) Whenever a plea agreement is presented to the sentencing judge, the defendant’s criminal history classification, as set forth in the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, shall be accurately represented to the trial judge in the plea agreement. If a controversy exists as to whether a prior conviction or juvenile adjudication should be included in the defendant’s criminal history, or as to its classification under rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, the district attorney and the defendant may stipulate to the inclusion, exclusion or classification of the conviction or adjudication as part of the plea agreement subject to approval of the court.

      (2) The district attorney and the defendant may stipulate to the grid block classification within the sentencing guidelines grid established by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission that will provide the presumptive sentence range for the offender. The sentencing judge may accept the stipulated classification and impose the presumptive sentence provided in the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission for that grid block.

      (3) If the district attorney and the defendant stipulate to a grid block classification within the sentencing guidelines grid, and the sentencing judge accepts the stipulated classification but imposes a sentence other than the presumptive sentence provided by rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, the sentence is a departure sentence and is subject to rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission related to departures.

      (1) The defendant by the plea of the defendant has aided in insuring the prompt and certain applications of correctional measures to the defendant.

      (2) The defendant has acknowledged guilt and shown a willingness to assume responsibility for the conduct of the defendant.

      (3) The concessions made by the state will make possible alternative correctional measures which are better adapted to achieving rehabilitative, protective, deterrent or other purposes of correctional treatment, or will prevent undue harm to the defendant from the form of conviction.

      (4) The defendant has made public trial unnecessary when there are good reasons for not having the case dealt with in a public trial.

      (5) The defendant has given or offered cooperation when the cooperation has resulted or may result in the successful prosecution of other offenders engaged in equally serious or more serious criminal conduct.

      (6) The defendant by the plea of the defendant has aided in avoiding delay in the disposition of other cases and thereby has increased the probability of prompt and certain application of correctional measures to other offenders. [1973 c.836 §171]

 

      135.420 [Amended by 1973 c.836 §158; renumbered 135.305]

 

      135.425 Responsibilities of defense counsel. (1) Defense counsel shall conclude a plea agreement only with the consent of the defendant, and shall insure that the decision whether to enter a plea of guilty or no contest is ultimately made by the defendant.

      (D) As provided in subsection (5) of this section.

      (b) Any other judge, at the request of both the prosecution and the defense, or at the direction of the presiding judge, may participate in plea discussions. Participation by a judge in the plea discussion process shall be advisory, and shall in no way bind the parties. If no plea is entered pursuant to these discussions, the advice of the participating judge shall not be reported to the trial judge. If the discussion results in a plea of guilty or no contest, the parties, if they both agree to do so, may proceed with the plea before a judge involved in the discussion. This plea may be entered pursuant to a tentative plea agreement as provided in subsections (2) to (4) of this section.

      (2) If a tentative plea agreement has been reached which contemplates entry of a plea of guilty or no contest in the expectation that charge or sentence concessions will be granted, the trial judge, upon request of the parties, may permit the disclosure to the trial judge of the tentative agreement and the reasons therefor in advance of the time for tender of the plea. The trial judge may then advise the district attorney and defense counsel whether the trial judge will concur in the proposed disposition if the information in the presentence report or other information available at the time for sentencing is consistent with the representations made to the trial judge.

      (3) If the trial judge concurs, but later decides that the final disposition of the case should not include the sentence concessions contemplated by the plea agreement, the trial judge shall so advise the defendant and allow the defendant a reasonable period of time in which to either affirm or withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest.

      (4) When a plea of guilty or no contest is tendered or received as a result of a prior plea agreement, the trial judge shall give the agreement due consideration, but notwithstanding its existence, the trial judge is not bound by it, and may reach an independent decision on whether to grant sentence concessions under the criteria set forth in ORS 135.415.

      (5) With the consent of the parties and upon receipt of a written waiver executed by the defendant, the trial judge may participate in plea discussions. [1973 c.836 §173; 1987 c.202 §1; 1997 c.313 §4; 2009 c.178 §33]

      (b) The fact that the defendant or the attorney of the defendant made a plea agreement with the district attorney.

      (c) Any statement or admission made by the defendant or the attorney of the defendant to the district attorney and as a part of the plea discussion or agreement.

      135.440 [Repealed by 1973 c.836 §358]

(Related Procedure)

 

      135.455 Notice prior to trial of intention to rely on alibi evidence; content of notice; effect of failure to supply notice. (1) If the defendant in a criminal action proposes to rely in any way on alibi evidence, the defendant shall, not less than five days before the trial of the cause, file and serve upon the district attorney a written notice of the purpose to offer such evidence, which notice shall state specifically the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time or times of the alleged offense together with the name and residence or business address of each witness upon whom the defendant intends to rely for alibi evidence. If the defendant fails to file and serve such notice, the defendant shall not be permitted to introduce alibi evidence at the trial of the cause unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.

      (3) An order to dismiss the accusatory instrument on grounds of former jeopardy is a bar to a future prosecution of the defendant for the offense charged in the accusatory instrument. [1973 c.836 §177]

 

      135.510 Grounds for motion to set aside the indictment. (1) The indictment shall be set aside by the court upon the motion of the defendant in either of the following cases:

      (a) When it is not found, indorsed and presented as prescribed in ORS 132.360, 132.400 to 132.430 and 132.580.

      (b) When the names of the witnesses examined before the grand jury are not inserted at the foot of the indictment or indorsed thereon.

      (2) Nothing in subsection (1)(b) of this section shall affect the application of ORS 132.580. [Amended by 1959 c.426 §2; 1973 c.836 §178]

 

      135.520 Time of making motion; hearing. A motion to set aside the indictment or dismiss the accusatory instrument shall be made and heard at the time of the arraignment or within 10 days thereafter, unless for good cause the court allows additional time. If not so made, the defendant is precluded from afterwards taking the objections to the indictment or accusatory instrument. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §179]

 

      135.530 Effect of allowance of motion. (1) If the motion to set aside or dismiss is allowed, the court shall order that the defendant, if in custody, be discharged therefrom or, if the defendant has been released, that the release agreement be discharged and the security deposit be refunded as provided by law, unless the court allows the case to be refiled or resubmitted to the same or another grand jury.

      (2) If the court allows the case to be resubmitted or refiled, it must be resubmitted or refiled by the state within 30 days from the date on which the court enters the order. If the case is not resubmitted or refiled within that time, the defendant shall be released from custody or the release agreement discharged or the security deposit returned. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §180]

 

      135.540 Effect of resubmission of case. Subject to the limitations of ORS 135.530 (2), if the court allows the case to be resubmitted or refiled, the defendant, if then in custody, shall so remain, unless the defendant is released as provided by law. If the defendant has already been released, the release agreement or any security deposited as provided by law, shall continue to insure the appearance of the defendant to answer a new indictment or information, if one is filed. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §181]

 

      135.550 [Repealed by 1973 c.836 §358]

 

      135.560 Order to set aside is no bar to future prosecution. Except for an order dismissing an accusatory instrument on grounds of former jeopardy, an order to set aside an indictment or to dismiss an accusatory instrument is no bar to a future prosecution for the same crime. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §182]

 

DEMURRERS

 

      135.610 Demurrer; generally. (1) The demurrer shall be entered either at the time of the arraignment or at such other time as may be allowed to the defendant for that purpose.

      (2) The demurrer shall be in writing, signed by the defendant or the attorney of the defendant and filed. It shall distinctly specify the ground of objection to the accusatory instrument. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §183]

 

      135.620 [Repealed by 1973 c.836 §358]

 

      135.630 Grounds of demurrer. The defendant may demur to the accusatory instrument when it appears upon the face thereof:

      (1) If the accusatory instrument is an indictment, that the grand jury by which it was found had no legal authority to inquire into the crime charged because the same is not triable within the county;

      (2) If the accusatory instrument is an indictment, that it does not substantially conform to the requirements of ORS 132.510 to 132.560, 135.713, 135.715, 135.717 to 135.737, 135.740 and 135.743;

      (3) That the accusatory instrument charges more than one offense not separately stated;

      (4) That the facts stated do not constitute an offense;

      (5) That the accusatory instrument contains matter which, if true, would constitute a legal justification or excuse of the offense charged or other legal bar to the action; or

      (6) That the accusatory instrument is not definite and certain. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §184]

 

      135.640 When objections that are grounds for demurrer may be taken. When the objections mentioned in ORS 135.630 appear upon the face of the accusatory instrument, they can only be taken by demurrer, except that the objection to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject of the accusatory instrument, or that the facts stated do not constitute an offense, may be taken at the trial, under the plea of not guilty and in arrest of judgment. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §185]

 

      135.650 Hearing of objections specified by demurrer. Upon the filing of the demurrer, the objections presented thereby shall be heard either immediately or at such time as the court may direct.

 

      135.660 Judgment on demurrer; entry in register. Upon considering the demurrer, the court shall give judgment, either allowing or disallowing it, and an entry to that effect shall be made in the register. [Amended by 1985 c.540 §33]

 

      135.670 Allowance of demurrer. (1) If the demurrer is allowed, the judgment is final upon the accusatory instrument demurred to and is a bar to another action for the same crime unless the court, being of the opinion that the objection on which the demurrer is allowed may be avoided in a new accusatory instrument, allows the case to be resubmitted or refiled.

      (2) If the court allows the case to be resubmitted or refiled, it must be resubmitted or refiled by the state within 30 days from the date on which the court enters the order. If the case is not resubmitted or refiled within that time, the defendant shall be discharged from custody or the release agreement discharged or the security deposit returned as provided in ORS 135.680. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §186]

 

      135.680 Procedure if resubmission of case not allowed. If the court does not allow the case to be resubmitted or an amended complaint or information filed, the defendant, if in custody, shall be discharged. If the defendant has been released, the release agreement shall be discharged. If the defendant has deposited any security, the security shall be returned to the defendant as provided by law. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §187]

 

      135.690 Resubmission of case. If the court allows the case to be resubmitted, the same proceedings shall be had thereon as are prescribed in ORS 135.540. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §188]

 

      135.700 Disallowance of demurrer. If the demurrer is disallowed, the court shall permit the defendant, at the election of the defendant, to plead, which the defendant must do forthwith or at such time as the court may allow; but if the defendant does not plead, a plea of not guilty shall be entered. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §189]

 

COMPROMISE

 

      135.703 Crimes subject to being compromised; exceptions. (1) When a defendant is charged with a crime punishable as a misdemeanor for which the person injured by the act constituting the crime has a remedy by a civil action, the crime may be compromised, as provided in ORS 135.705, except when it was committed:

      (a) By or upon a peace officer while in the execution of the duties of office;

      (b) Riotously;

      (c) With an intent to commit a crime punishable only as a felony; or

      (d) By one family or household member upon another family or household member, as defined in ORS 107.705, or by a person upon an elderly person or a person with a disability as defined in ORS 124.005 and the crime was:

      (A) Assault in the fourth degree under ORS 163.160;

      (B) Assault in the third degree under ORS 163.165;

      (C) Menacing under ORS 163.190;

      (D) Recklessly endangering another person under ORS 163.195;

      (E) Harassment under ORS 166.065; or

      (F) Strangulation under ORS 163.187.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, when a defendant is charged with violating ORS 811.700, the crime may be compromised as provided in ORS 135.705. [Formerly 134.010; 1991 c.938 §1; 1995 c.657 §21; 1995 c.666 §26; 1999 c.738 §9; 2003 c.264 §9; 2003 c.577 §5; 2007 c.70 §35]

 

      135.705 Satisfaction of injured person; dismissal of charges. (1)(a) If the person injured acknowledges in writing, at any time before trial on an accusatory instrument for the crime, that the person has received satisfaction for the injury, the court may, in its discretion, on payment of the costs and expenses incurred, enter a judgment dismissing the accusatory instrument.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, a written acknowledgment that a civil penalty under ORS 30.875 has been paid is not evidence that the person injured has received full satisfaction for the injury and is not a compromise under this section.

      (2) As used in this section, “costs” includes those expenses specially incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant, including costs under ORS 151.505 for the compensation of counsel appointed pursuant to ORS 135.045 or 135.050 and fees and expenses paid under ORS 135.055. [Formerly 134.020; 1981 s.s. c.3 §121; 1985 c.540 §34; 1985 c.710 §4; 1987 c.803 §25; 1999 c.925 §1; 2003 c.449 §28; 2009 c.484 §9]

 

      135.707 Discharge as bar to prosecution. A judgment entered under ORS 135.705 is a bar to another prosecution for the same crime. [Formerly 134.030; 2009 c.484 §10]

 

      135.709 Exclusiveness of procedure. No crime can be compromised nor can any proceeding for the prosecution or punishment thereof be stayed upon a compromise, except as provided in ORS 135.703 to 135.709 and 135.745 to 135.757. [Formerly 134.040]

 

SUFFICIENCY OF ACCUSATORY INSTRUMENTS

 

      135.711 Facts constituting crime or subcategory of crime required. For any felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, the accusatory instrument shall allege facts sufficient to constitute a crime or a specific subcategory of a crime in the Crime Seriousness Scale established by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. [1989 c.790 §4]

 

      135.713 Necessity of stating presumptions of law and matters judicially noticed. Neither presumptions of law nor matters of which judicial notice is taken need be stated in an accusatory instrument. [Formerly 132.570]

 

      135.715 Effect of nonprejudicial defects in form of accusatory instrument. No accusatory instrument is insufficient, nor can the trial, judgment or other proceedings thereon be affected, by reason of a defect or imperfection in a matter of form which does not tend to the prejudice of the substantial rights of the defendant upon the merits. [Formerly 132.590]

 

      135.717 Time of crime. The precise time at which the offense was committed need not be stated in the accusatory instrument, but it may be alleged to have been committed at any time before the finding thereof and within the time in which an action may be commenced therefor, except where the time is a material element in the offense. [Formerly 132.610]

 

      135.720 Place of crime in certain cases. In an accusatory instrument for an offense committed as described in ORS 131.315 and 131.325, it is sufficient to allege that the offense was committed within the county where the accusatory instrument is found. [Formerly 132.620]

 

      135.725 Person injured or intended to be injured. When a crime involves the commission of or an attempt to commit a private injury and is described with sufficient certainty in other respects to identify the act, an erroneous allegation as to the person injured or intended to be injured is not material. [Formerly 132.630]

 

      135.727 Description of animal. When an offense involves the taking of or injury to an animal, the accusatory instrument is sufficiently certain in that respect if it describes the animal by the common name of its class. [Formerly 132.640]

 

      135.730 Judgments; facts conferring jurisdiction. In pleading in an accusatory instrument a judgment or other determination of or proceeding before a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction; but the judgment, determination or proceeding may be stated to have been duly given or made. The facts conferring jurisdiction, however, must be established on the trial. [Formerly 132.660]

 

      135.733 Defamation. An accusatory instrument for criminal defamation need not set forth any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the application to the party defamed of the defamatory matter on which the accusatory instrument is founded; but it is sufficient to state generally that the same was published concerning the party; and the fact that it was so published must be established on the trial. [Formerly 132.670]

 

      135.735 Forgery; misdescription of forged instrument. When an instrument which is the subject of an accusatory instrument for forgery has been destroyed or withheld by the act or procurement of the defendant and the fact of the destruction or withholding is alleged in the accusatory instrument and established on the trial, the misdescription of the instrument is immaterial. [Formerly 132.680]

 

      135.737 Perjury. In an accusatory instrument for perjury, attempted perjury, solicitation of perjury or conspiracy to commit perjury it is sufficient to set forth the substance of the controversy or matter in respect to which the crime was committed, in what court or before whom the oath alleged to be false was taken and that the court or person before whom it was taken had authority to administer it, with proper allegations of the falsity of the matter on which the perjury is assigned; but the accusatory instrument need set forth neither the pleadings, record or proceedings with which the oath is connected nor the commission or authority of the court or person before whom the perjury was committed. [Formerly 132.690]

 

      135.740 Construction of words and phrases used. The words used in an accusatory instrument must be construed in their usual acceptation in common language, except words and phrases defined by law, which are to be construed according to their legal meaning. [Formerly 132.710]

 

      135.743 Fictitious or erroneous name; insertion of true name. When a defendant is charged in an accusatory instrument by a fictitious or erroneous name and in any stage of the proceedings the true name of the defendant is discovered, it may be inserted in the subsequent proceedings, referring to the fact of the defendant being charged by the name mentioned in the accusatory instrument. [Formerly 132.720]

 

SPEEDY TRIAL PROVISIONS

 

      135.745 Delay in finding an indictment or filing an information. When a person has been held to answer for a crime, if an indictment is not found against the person within 30 days or the district attorney does not file an information in circuit court within 30 days after the person is held to answer, the court shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, unless good cause to the contrary is shown. [Formerly 134.110]

 

      135.746 Time period within which trial must commence. (1) Except as provided in ORS 135.748:

      (a) A trial in which the most serious charge alleged in the charging instrument is designated by statute as a misdemeanor must commence within two years from the date of the filing of the charging instrument.

      (b) A trial in which the most serious charge alleged in the charging instrument is designated by statute as a felony must commence within three years from the date of the filing of the charging instrument.

      (c) A trial in which two or more charges have been consolidated pursuant to ORS 132.560 must commence within the applicable time period required in this subsection for the most serious offense alleged in the charging instrument.

      (d) A joint trial in which two or more defendants are charged in the same charging instrument must commence within the applicable time period required in this subsection for the most serious offense alleged in the charging instrument.

      (2) The time limits required in subsection (1) of this section cease to apply to a defendant who fails to appear at the date and time scheduled for trial.

      (3) If a trial date is scheduled by the court for a defendant represented by counsel and neither the defendant nor the defendant’s counsel objects within seven days of the notice of the trial date to the fact that the scheduled trial date is not within the time limit required in subsection (1) of this section, the time limit is extended until the scheduled trial date, and may be further extended as provided in ORS 135.748. [2014 c.73 §1]

 

      Note: 135.746, 135.748 and 135.752 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 135 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      135.747 [Formerly 134.120; repealed by 2013 c.431 §1]

 

      135.748 Periods of time excluded from time limits. (1) All applicable periods of elapsed time as follows are excluded from the time limits described in ORS 135.746:

      (a) A period of time during which the defendant is:

      (A) Under observation or examination for fitness to proceed under ORS 161.365, beginning when the issue of the defendant’s possible lack of fitness to proceed has been raised by the defendant or the defendant’s counsel, until a final determination regarding the defendant’s fitness to proceed has been made by the court;

      (B) Determined to be unfit to proceed by the court pursuant to ORS 161.360 and 161.370;

      (C) Under observation or examination after notice of the issue of the defendant’s qualifying mental disorder, partial responsibility, diminished capacity, insanity or other mental defense is raised by the defendant or the defendant’s counsel, until the trial date; or

      (D) Unable to appear by reason of illness or physical disability.

      (b) A period of time following the filing of an interlocutory appeal or an appeal from the dismissal of the charge or charging instrument, or that results from a stay issued by an appellate court in a mandamus or habeas proceeding, until the appellate judgment is issued or the stay is lifted by the appellate court.

      (c) A period of time between a scheduled court appearance at which the defendant fails to appear and the next scheduled court appearance other than an appearance that occurs for the purpose of addressing a warrant resulting from the defendant’s failure to appear.

      (d) A period of time during which the defendant’s location is known but the defendant’s presence for trial cannot be obtained, or during which the defendant is outside this state and resists being returned to this state for trial.

      (e) A period of time during which the defendant’s location is unknown and:

      (A) The defendant has attempted to avoid apprehension or prosecution; or

      (B) The defendant’s location cannot be determined by due diligence.

      (f) A period of time while the defendant is on trial or engaged in court proceedings in an unrelated matter, whether in the same court or a different court, and was therefore physically unavailable for trial.

      (g) A period of time between a mistrial on the charging instrument and a subsequent trial on the charging instrument, not to exceed three months for each mistrial. The three-month limit may be extended by the court for good cause upon request from either party or upon the court’s own motion.

      (h) A period of time between a continuance or a rescheduling of a trial date, granted at the request of, or with the consent of, the defendant or the defendant’s counsel, and the new trial date. A defendant who is proceeding without counsel may not consent to a continuance or a rescheduling unless the court has advised the defendant of the defendant’s right to a speedy trial within the time limit required in ORS 135.746 and the consequences of the defendant’s consent to the continuance or rescheduling.

      (2) Any period of time excluded pursuant to subsection (1) of this section from the time limits described in ORS 135.746 that applies to a defendant shall apply to all other defendants charged in the charging instrument. However, if the court finds that it is clearly inappropriate to apply the time exclusion to all of the other defendants, the court may order any relief that justice requires. [2014 c.73 §2; 2017 c.634 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 135.746.

 

      135.750 Where there is reason for delay. If the defendant is not proceeded against as provided in ORS 135.745, and sufficient reason therefor is shown, the court may order the action to be continued and in the meantime may release the defendant from custody as provided in ORS 135.230 to 135.290, for the appearance of the defendant to answer the charge or action. [Formerly 134.130; 2013 c.431 §2]

 

      135.752 When trial not commenced within time limit. If a trial is not commenced as required by ORS 135.746, the court shall order the charging instrument to be dismissed without prejudice unless the court finds on the record substantial and compelling reasons to allow the proceeding to continue. [2014 c.73 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 135.746.

 

DISMISSAL OF ACTION

 

      135.753 Effect of dismissal. (1) If the court directs the charge or action to be dismissed, the defendant, if in custody, shall be discharged. If the defendant has been released, the release agreement is exonerated and security deposited shall be refunded to the defendant.

      (2) An order for the dismissal of a charge or action, as provided in ORS 135.703 to 135.709 and 135.745 to 135.757, is a bar to another prosecution for the same crime if the crime is a Class B or C misdemeanor; but it is not a bar if the crime charged is a Class A misdemeanor or a felony.

      (3) If any charge or action is dismissed for the purpose of consolidation with one or more other charges or actions, then any such dismissal shall not be a bar to another prosecution for the same offense. [Formerly 134.140; 1975 c.198 §1]

 

      135.755 Dismissal on motion of court or district attorney. The court may, either of its own motion or upon the application of the district attorney, and in furtherance of justice, order the proceedings to be dismissed. The reasons for the dismissal shall be set forth in the order, which shall be entered in the register. [Formerly 134.150; 1985 c.540 §35]

 

      135.757 Nolle prosequi; discontinuance by district attorney. The entry of a nolle prosequi is abolished, and the district attorney cannot discontinue or abandon a prosecution for a crime, except as provided in ORS 135.755. [Formerly 134.160]

 

PROSECUTION OF PRISONERS

 

      135.760 Notice requesting early trial on pending charge. (1) Any inmate in the custody of the Department of Corrections or of the supervisory authority of a county pursuant to a commitment under ORS 137.124 (2) against whom there is pending at the time of commitment or against whom there is filed at any time during imprisonment, in any court of this state, an indictment, information or criminal complaint charging the inmate with the commission of a crime, may give written notice to the district attorney of the county in which the inmate is so charged requesting the district attorney to prosecute and bring the inmate to trial on the charge forthwith.

      (2) The notice provided for in subsection (1) of this section shall be signed by the inmate and set forth the place and term of imprisonment. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the court in which the inmate has been charged by indictment, information or complaint. [Formerly 134.510; 1987 c.320 §19; 1995 c.423 §9b]

 

      135.763 Trial within 90 days of notice unless continuance granted. (1) The district attorney, after receiving a notice requesting trial under ORS 135.760, shall, within 90 days of receipt of the notice, bring the inmate to trial upon the pending charge.

      (2) The court shall grant any reasonable continuance with the consent of the defendant. Notwithstanding the defendant’s lack of consent, the court may grant a continuance on motion of the district attorney or on its own motion, for good cause shown. The fact of imprisonment is not good cause for the purposes of this subsection. [Formerly 134.520; 1993 c.542 §1]

 

      135.765 Dismissal of criminal proceeding not brought to trial within allowed time; exceptions. (1) On motion of the defendant or the counsel of the defendant, or on its own motion, the court shall dismiss any criminal proceeding not brought to trial in accordance with ORS 135.763.

      (2) This section shall not apply:

      (a) When failure to bring the inmate to trial within 90 days after the district attorney receives notice under ORS 135.760 was the result of motions filed on behalf of the inmate, or of a grant by the court of a continuance on motion of the district attorney or on its own motion, for good cause shown; or

      (b) When the inmate is unavailable for trial, other than by imprisonment, or because of other pending criminal proceedings against the inmate. [Formerly 134.530; 1993 c.542 §2]

 

      135.767 Presence of prisoner at proceedings. (1) Whenever the presence of an inmate in the custody of the Department of Corrections or of the supervisory authority of a county pursuant to a commitment under ORS 137.124 (2) is necessary in any criminal proceeding under ORS 135.760 to 135.773, the court wherein the inmate is charged with the commission of a crime may:

      (a) Issue an order directing the Director of the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county to surrender the inmate to the sheriff of the county where the inmate is to be tried; or

      (b) Ensure that arrangements for the inmate to appear by simultaneous electronic transmission as described in ORS 131.045 have been made.

      (2) The county where an inmate is charged with commission of a crime shall pay the costs of:

      (a) Transportation and maintenance of the inmate removed under this section; or

      (b) Providing for the inmate to appear by simultaneous electronic transmission.

      (3) If an inmate is transported under this section for a criminal proceeding under ORS 135.760 to 135.773, at the conclusion of the proceeding, notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 137.167, the inmate shall be returned by the sheriff to the custody of the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of the county in which the inmate is imprisoned.

      (4) The time during which an inmate is in the custody of the sheriff under this section is part of and shall be counted as time served under the original sentence. [Formerly 134.540; 1983 c.740 §14; 1987 c.320 §20; 1995 c.423 §9c; 2005 c.566 §8]

 

      135.770 Release of prisoner prohibited. No inmate in the custody of a sheriff under ORS 135.767 shall be released pending a criminal proceeding under ORS 135.760 to 135.773 or any appeal therefrom. [Formerly 134.550]

 

      135.773 District attorney to furnish certain documents. The district attorney shall, in all proceedings against inmates under ORS 135.760 to 135.773, obtain for and furnish to the court a certified copy of the judgment, sentence or commitment order pursuant to which the inmate is imprisoned. [Formerly 134.560]

 

DETAINER

 

      135.775 Agreement on Detainers. The Agreement on Detainers is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS

      The contracting states solemnly agree that:

ARTICLE I

      The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

      As used in this agreement:

      (a) “State” shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

      (b) “Sending state” shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that the prisoner initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III of this agreement or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV of this agreement.

ARTICLE III

      (a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, the prisoner shall be brought to trial within 180 days after the prisoner shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer’s jurisdiction written notice of the place of imprisonment and the request of the prisoner for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint: Provided, that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or the counsel of the prisoner being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.

      (b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) of this Article shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden or other official having custody of the prisoner, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.

      (c) The warden or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform the prisoner of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against the prisoner and shall also inform the prisoner of the right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.

      (d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Article shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner’s request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner’s written notice, request and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

      (e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Article shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) of this Article, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon the prisoner, after completion of the term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of the body of the prisoner in any court where the presence of the prisoner may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.

      (b) Upon receipt of the officer’s written request as provided in paragraph (a) of this Article, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Such authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.

      (c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this Article, trial shall be commenced within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or the counsel of the prisoner being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.

      (d) Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which the prisoner may have to contest the legality of the delivery of the prisoner as provided in paragraph (a) of this Article, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.

      (e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner’s being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to paragraph (e) of Article V of this agreement, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

ARTICLE V

      (a) In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV of this agreement, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner’s presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.

      (b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:

      (1) Proper identification and evidence of authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given.

      (2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.

      (c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of such prisoner, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV of this agreement, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.

      (d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for attendance of the prisoner at court and while being transported to or from any place at which the presence of the prisoner may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.

      (e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.

      (f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.

      (g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.

      (h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.

ARTICLE VI

      (a) In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of such time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.

      (b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be a person with mental illness.

ARTICLE VII

      Each state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

      This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the agreement into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the agreement. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by prisoners or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.

ARTICLE IX

      This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party to this agreement, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

MISCELLANEOUS

 

      135.970 Information required when victim contacted by defense; deposition of victim; when contact with victim prohibited; effect of threats by defendant. (1) If the victim or a witness requests, the court shall order that the victim’s or witness’s address and phone number not be given to the defendant unless good cause is shown to the court.

      (2) If contacted by the defense or any agent of the defense, the victim must be clearly informed by the defense or other contacting agent, either in person or in writing, of the identity and capacity of the person contacting the victim, that the victim does not have to talk to the defendant’s attorney, or other agents of the defendant, or provide other discovery unless the victim wishes, and that the victim may have a district attorney, assistant attorney general or other attorney or advocate present during any interview or other contact.

      (3) A victim may not be required to be interviewed or deposed by or give discovery to the defendant, the defendant’s attorney or any agent of the defense unless the victim consents. This subsection does not prohibit the defendant from:

      (a) Subpoenaing or examining the victim at trial or in a pretrial proceeding when the purpose is other than for discovery; or

      (b) Subpoenaing books, papers or documents as provided in ORS 136.580.

      (4)(a) Any pretrial release order must prohibit any contact with the victim, either directly or indirectly, unless specifically authorized by the court having jurisdiction over the criminal charge. This subsection shall not limit contact by the defense attorney, or an agent of the defense attorney, other than the defendant, in the manner set forth in subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) If a victim notifies the district attorney that the defendant, either directly or indirectly, threatened or intimidated the victim, the district attorney shall notify the court with jurisdiction over the criminal matter and the defense attorney. If the defendant is not in custody and the court finds there is probable cause to believe the victim has been threatened or intimidated by the defendant, either directly or indirectly, the court shall immediately issue an order to show cause why defendant’s release status should not be revoked. After conducting such hearing as it deems appropriate, if the court finds that the victim has been threatened or intimidated by the defendant, either directly or indirectly, the defendant’s release status shall be revoked and the defendant shall be held in custody with a security amount set in an amount sufficient to ensure the safety of the victim and the community.

      (5) As used in this section, “victim” means the person or persons who have suffered financial, social, psychological or physical harm as a result of a crime against the person or a third person and includes, in the case of a homicide or abuse of corpse in any degree, a member of the immediate family of the decedent and, in the case of a minor victim, the legal guardian of the minor. In no event shall the criminal defendant be considered a victim. [1987 c.2 §3; 1997 c.313 §7; 1999 c.1051 §251; 2013 c.144 §1]

 

      135.973 Medication use by specialty court entrant. (1) As used in this section, “specialty court” has the meaning given that term in ORS 137.680.

      (2) An individual may not be denied entry into a specialty court in this state solely for the reason that the individual is taking, or intends to take, medication prescribed by a licensed health care practitioner for the treatment of drug abuse or dependency. [2017 c.683 §6]

      (f) The capacity of the program for new cases.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Corrections shall make the directory available to the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and to judges in a form that will allow sentencing judges to determine what rehabilitative programs are appropriate and available to the offender during any period of probation, imprisonment or local incarceration and post-prison supervision. The Director of the Department of Corrections shall also make the directory available to its employees who prepare presentence reports and proposed release plans for submission to the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.

      (3) The directory shall be updated as frequently as is practical, but no less often than every six months. [1989 c.790 §7a; 2011 c.673 §4]
