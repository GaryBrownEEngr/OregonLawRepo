JUDGMENT

 

(Generally)

 

      137.010 Duty of court to ascertain and impose punishment. (1) The statutes that define offenses impose a duty upon the court having jurisdiction to pass sentence in accordance with this section or, for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, in accordance with rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission unless otherwise specifically provided by law.

      (2) If it cannot be determined whether the felony was committed on or after November 1, 1989, the defendant shall be sentenced as if the felony had been committed prior to November 1, 1989.

      (3) Except when a person is convicted of a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, if the court is of the opinion that it is in the best interests of the public as well as of the defendant, the court may suspend the imposition or execution of any part of a sentence for any period of not more than five years. The court may extend the period of suspension beyond five years in accordance with subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) If the court suspends the imposition or execution of a part of a sentence for an offense other than a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, the court may also impose and execute a sentence of probation on the defendant for a definite or indefinite period of not more than five years. However, upon a later finding that a defendant sentenced to probation for a felony has violated a condition of the probation and in lieu of revocation, the court may order the period of both the suspended sentence and the sentence of probation extended until a date not more than six years from the date of original imposition of sentence. Time during which the probationer has absconded from supervision and a bench warrant has been issued for the probationer’s arrest shall not be counted in determining the time elapsed since imposition of the sentence of probation.

      (5) If the court announces that it intends to suspend imposition or execution of any part of a sentence, the defendant may, at that time, object and request imposition of the full sentence. In no case, however, does the defendant have a right to refuse the court’s order, and the court may suspend imposition or execution of a part of the sentence despite the defendant’s objection or request. If the court further announces that it intends to sentence the defendant to a period of probation, the defendant may, at that time, object and request that a sentence of probation or its conditions not be imposed or that different conditions be imposed. In no case, however, does the defendant have the right to refuse a sentence of probation or any of the conditions of the probation, and the court may sentence the defendant to probation subject to conditions despite the defendant’s objection or request.

      (6) The power of the judge of any court to suspend execution of any part of a sentence or to sentence any person convicted of a crime to probation shall continue until the person is delivered to the custody of the Department of Corrections.

      (7) When a person is convicted of an offense and the court does not suspend the imposition or execution of any part of a sentence or when a suspended sentence or sentence of probation is revoked, the court shall impose the following sentence:

      (a) A term of imprisonment;

      (b) A fine;

      (c) Both imprisonment and a fine; or

      (d) Discharge of the defendant.

      (8) This section does not deprive the court of any authority conferred by law to enter a judgment for the forfeiture of property, suspend or cancel a license, remove a person from office or impose any other civil penalty. An order exercising that authority may be included as part of the judgment of conviction.

      (9) When imposing sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, the court shall submit sentencing information to the commission in accordance with rules of the commission.

      (10) A judgment of conviction that includes a term of imprisonment for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, shall state the length of incarceration and the length of post-prison supervision. The judgment of conviction shall also provide that if the defendant violates the conditions of post-prison supervision, the defendant shall be subject to sanctions including the possibility of additional imprisonment in accordance with rules of the commission. [Amended by 1971 c.743 §322; 1981 c.181 §1; 1987 c.320 §27; 1989 c.790 §6; 1989 c.849 §1; 1993 c.14 §1; 2003 c.576 §388; 2005 c.10 §2]

 

      137.012 Suspension of imposition or execution of sentence of person convicted of certain sexual offenses; term of probation. If the court suspends the imposition or execution of a part of a sentence of, or imposes a sentence of probation on, any person convicted of violating or attempting to violate ORS 163.365, 163.375, 163.395, 163.405, 163.408, 163.411, 163.425 or 163.427, the court shall sentence the defendant to probation for a period of at least five years and no more than the maximum statutory indeterminate sentence for the offense. [1991 c.831 §2; 1993 c.14 §2; 1993 c.301 §2; 1999 c.161 §3]

 

      Note: 137.012 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 137 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      137.013 Appearance by victim at time of sentencing. At the time of sentencing, the victim or the victim’s next of kin has the right to appear personally or by counsel, and has the right to reasonably express any views concerning the crime, the person responsible, the impact of the crime on the victim, and the need for restitution and compensatory fine. [1987 c.2 §10]

 

      137.015 [1971 c.328 §1; 1973 c.346 §1; 1979 c.341 §1; 1983 c.125 §1; 1985 c.277 §1; 1989 c.844 §1; repealed by 1987 c.905 §37]

 

      137.017 Disposition of fines, costs and security deposits received by court. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all fines, costs, security deposits and other amounts ordered or required to be paid in criminal actions in circuit courts are monetary obligations payable to the state and shall be deposited in the Criminal Fine Account. [1981 s.s. c.3 §102; 1983 c.763 §42; 1987 c.905 §5; 1999 c.1051 §253; 2011 c.597 §122; 2012 c.89 §2]

 

      137.020 Time for pronouncing judgment; delay; notice of right to appeal. (1) After a plea or verdict of guilty, or after a verdict against the defendant on a plea of former conviction or acquittal, if the judgment is not arrested or a new trial granted, the court shall appoint a time for pronouncing judgment.

      (2)(a) The time appointed shall be at least two calendar days after the plea or verdict if the court intends to remain in session so long. If the court does not intend to remain in session at least two calendar days, the time appointed may be sooner than two calendar days, but shall be as remote a time as can reasonably be allowed. However, in the latter case, the judgment shall not be given less than six hours after the plea or verdict, except with the consent of the defendant.

      (b) Except for good cause shown or as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a court shall not delay for more than 31 calendar days after the plea or verdict the sentencing of a defendant held in custody on account of the pending proceedings. Except for good cause shown or as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a court shall not delay for more than 56 calendar days after the plea or verdict the sentencing of a defendant not held in custody on account of the pending proceedings. If the defendant is not in custody and the court does not pronounce judgment within 56 calendar days after the plea or verdict, any period of probation imposed as a part of a subsequent judgment shall begin to run from the date of the plea or verdict.

      (3) If the defendant is in custody following the verdict, the court shall pronounce judgment as soon as practicable, but in any case within seven calendar days following the verdict if no presentence investigation is ordered, and within seven calendar days after delivery of the presentence report to the court if a presentence investigation has been ordered; however, the court may delay pronouncement of judgment beyond the limits of this subsection for good cause shown.

      (4) If the final calendar day a defendant must be sentenced is not a judicial day then sentencing may be delayed until the next judicial day.

      (5)(a) At the time a court pronounces judgment the defendant, if present, shall be advised of the right to appeal and of the procedure for protecting that right. If the defendant is not present, the court shall advise the defendant in writing of the right to appeal and of the procedure for protecting that right.

      (b) If the trial court sentences the defendant subsequent to a plea of guilty or no contest or upon probation revocation or sentence suspension, or if the trial court sentences the defendant after judgment of an appellate court or a post-conviction relief court, the court shall advise the defendant of the limitations on reviewability imposed by ORS 138.105 in person or, if the defendant is not present, in writing.

      (6) If the defendant is financially eligible for appointment of counsel at state expense on appeal under ORS 138.500, trial counsel shall determine whether the defendant wishes to pursue an appeal. If the defendant wishes to pursue an appeal, trial counsel shall transmit to the office of public defense services established under ORS 151.216, on a form prepared by the office, information necessary to perfect the appeal. [Amended by 1971 c.565 §18a; 1987 c.242 §1; 1991 c.111 §12; 2001 c.644 §4; 2003 c.14 §57; 2017 c.529 §23]

 

      137.030 Presence of defendant at pronouncement of judgment. For the purpose of giving judgment, if the conviction is for:

      (1) A felony, the defendant shall be personally present.

      (2) A misdemeanor, judgment may be given in the absence of the defendant. [Amended by 1993 c.581 §1; 1997 c.827 §1; 2005 c.566 §9]

 

      137.040 Bringing defendant in custody to pronouncement of judgment. If the defendant is in custody, the court shall:

      (1) Direct the officer in whose custody the defendant is to bring the defendant before the court for judgment and the officer shall do so accordingly; or

      (2) Ensure that arrangements for the defendant to appear for judgment by simultaneous electronic transmission as described in ORS 131.045 have been made. [Amended by 2005 c.566 §10]

 

      137.050 Nonattendance or nonappearance of released defendant when attendance required by court. (1) If the defendant has been released on a release agreement or security deposit and does not appear for judgment when personal attendance is required by the court, the court may order a forfeiture of the security deposit as provided in ORS 135.280. In addition, if the defendant fails to appear as required by the release agreement or security deposit, the court may direct the clerk to issue a bench warrant for the defendant’s arrest.

      (2) At any time after the making of the order for the bench warrant, the clerk, on the application of the district attorney, shall issue such warrant, as by the order directed, whether the court is sitting or not. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §257]

      (5) For the purposes of determining the defendant’s age at the time of committing an offense under subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) If the defendant is convicted of two or more offenses occurring on different days, the defendant’s age shall be calculated using the earliest date.

      (a) The person shall, whether or not ordered to do so by the court under paragraph (b) of this subsection, provide a blood or buccal sample at the request of the appropriate agency designated in paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (b) The court shall include in the judgment of conviction an order stating that a blood or buccal sample is required to be obtained at the request of the appropriate agency and, unless the convicted person lacks the ability to pay, that the person shall reimburse the appropriate agency for the cost of obtaining and transmitting the blood or buccal sample. If the judgment sentences the convicted person to probation, the court shall order the convicted person to submit to the obtaining of a blood or buccal sample as a condition of the probation.

      (c) The appropriate agency shall cause a blood or buccal sample to be obtained and transmitted to the Department of State Police. The agency shall cause the sample to be obtained as soon as practicable after conviction. The agency shall obtain the convicted person’s thumbprint at the same time the agency obtains the blood or buccal sample. The agency shall include the thumbprint with the identifying information that accompanies the sample. Whenever an agency is notified by the Department of State Police that a sample is not adequate for analysis, the agency shall obtain and transmit a blood sample. The appropriate agency shall be:

      (A) The Department of Corrections, whenever the convicted person is committed to the legal and physical custody of the department.

The sample shall also be obtained and transmitted in accordance with any procedures that may be established by the Department of State Police. However, no test result or opinion based upon a test result shall be rendered inadmissible as evidence solely because of deviations from procedures adopted by the Department of State Police that do not affect the reliability of the opinion or test result.

      (4) No sample is required to be obtained if:

      (a) The Department of State Police notifies the court or the appropriate agency that it has previously received an adequate blood or buccal sample obtained from the convicted person in accordance with this section or ORS 161.325 or 419C.473; or

      (b) The court determines that obtaining a sample would create a substantial and unreasonable risk to the health of the convicted person.

(Presentence Report)

 

      137.077 Presentence report; general principles of disclosure. The presentence report is not a public record and shall be available only to:

      (1) The sentencing court for the purpose of assisting the court in determining the proper sentence to impose and to other judges who participate in a sentencing council discussion of the defendant. The sentencing judge may disclose information from the presentence report that is necessary to address the content of the report, examine the reasoning for a sentencing recommendation or to explain the reasons for the sentence imposed. Appellate judges may disclose information from the presentence report that is necessary for legal analysis of the case or to report the reasoning of the appellate court.

      (2) The Department of Corrections, State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision and other persons or agencies having a legitimate professional interest in the information likely to be contained therein. These agencies or persons may make the presentence report, or any reports based on the contents of that report, available to the victim.

      (3) Appellate or review courts where relevant to an issue on which an appeal is taken or post-conviction relief sought.

      (4) The district attorney, the defendant or the counsel of the defendant, as provided in ORS 137.079. The district attorney and counsel of the defendant may retain a copy of the presentence report as a part of the permanent records of the case. The district attorney and counsel of the defendant may disclose the contents of the presentence report to individuals or agencies when preparing for the sentencing of the defendant. “Individuals and agencies” include victims, psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians licensed under ORS 677.100 to 677.228 and any other person or agency who may assist the state or the defendant at the time of sentencing. [1973 c.836 §260; 1987 c.320 §28; 1989 c.408 §1; 2017 c.409 §6]

 

      137.079 Presentence report; other writings considered in imposing sentence; disclosure to parties; court’s authority to except parts from disclosure. (1) A copy of the presentence report and all other written information concerning the defendant that the court considers in the imposition of sentence shall be made available to the district attorney, the defendant or defendant’s counsel at least five judicial days before the sentencing of the defendant. All other written information, when received by the court outside the presence of counsel, shall either be summarized by the court in a memorandum available for inspection or summarized by the court on the record before sentence is imposed.

      (2) The court may except from disclosure parts of the presentence report or other written information described in subsection (1) of this section which are not relevant to a proper sentence, diagnostic opinions which might seriously disrupt a program of rehabilitation if known by the defendant, or sources of information which were obtainable with an expectation of confidentiality.

      (3) If parts of the presentence report or other written information described in subsection (1) of this section are not disclosed under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall inform the parties that information has not been disclosed and shall state for the record the reasons for the court’s action. The action of the court in excepting information shall be reviewable on appeal.

      (4) A defendant who is being sentenced for felonies committed prior to November 1, 1989, may file a written motion to correct the criminal history contained in the presentence report prior to the date of sentencing. At sentencing, the court shall consider defendant’s motion to correct the presentence report and shall correct any factual errors in the criminal history contained in that report. An order allowing or denying a motion made pursuant to this subsection shall not be reviewable on appeal. If corrections are made by the court, only corrected copies of the report shall be provided to individuals or agencies pursuant to ORS 137.077.

      (5)(a) The provisions of this subsection apply only to a defendant being sentenced for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989.

      (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the defendant’s criminal history as set forth in the presentence report shall satisfy the state’s burden of proof as to the defendant’s criminal history.

      (c) Prior to the date of sentencing, the defendant shall notify the district attorney and the court in writing of any error in the criminal history as set forth in the presentence report. Except to the extent that any disputed portion is later changed by agreement of the district attorney and defendant with the approval of the court, the state shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence any disputed part of the defendant’s criminal history. The court shall allow the state reasonable time to produce evidence to meet its burden.

      (d) The court shall correct any error in the criminal history as reflected in the presentence report.

      (e) If corrections to the presentence report are made by the court, only corrected copies of the report shall be provided to individuals or agencies pursuant to ORS 137.077.

      (f) Except as provided in ORS 138.105 and 138.115, the court’s decision on issues relating to a defendant’s criminal history shall not be reviewable on appeal. [1973 c.836 §261; 1977 c.372 §11; 1983 c.649 §1; 1989 c.408 §2; 1989 c.790 §8; 2017 c.529 §24]

 

(Aggravation or Mitigation)

 

      137.080 Consideration of circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of punishment. (1) After a plea or verdict of guilty, or after a verdict against the defendant on a plea of former conviction or acquittal, in a case where discretion is conferred upon the court as to the extent of the punishment to be inflicted, the court, upon the suggestion of either party that there are circumstances which may be properly considered in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment, may, in its discretion, hear the same summarily at a specified time and upon such notice to the adverse party as it may direct.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances as to felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, including the maximum sentence that may be imposed because of aggravating circumstances, shall be in accordance with rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. [Amended by 1989 c.790 §9]

 

      137.085 Age and physical disability of victim as factors in sentencing. When a court sentences a defendant convicted of any crime involving a physical or sexual assault, the court shall give consideration to a victim’s particular vulnerability to injury in such case, due to the victim’s youth, advanced age or physical disability. Such particular vulnerability of the victim is a fact enhancing the seriousness of any assault, and the court shall consider it as such in imposing the sentence within the limits otherwise provided by law. [1985 c.767 §1]

 

      Note: 137.085 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 137 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      137.090 Considerations in determining aggravation or mitigation. (1) In determining aggravation or mitigation, the court shall consider:

      (a) Any evidence received during the proceeding;

      (b) The presentence report, where one is available; and

      (c) Any other evidence relevant to aggravation or mitigation that the court finds trustworthy and reliable.

      (2) In determining mitigation, the court may consider:

      (a) Evidence regarding the defendant’s status as a servicemember as defined in ORS 135.881.

      (b) Whether the defendant committed the crime while under duress, compulsion, direction or pressure from another person who has:

      (A) Committed acts of domestic violence, as defined in ORS 135.230, against the defendant;

      (B) Committed acts of abuse as a family or household member of the defendant, as those terms are defined in ORS 107.705, against the defendant; or

      (C) Used force, intimidation, fraud or coercion to cause the defendant to engage, or attempt to engage, in a commercial sex act.

      (3) When a witness is so sick or infirm as to be unable to attend, the deposition of the witness may be taken out of court at such time and place, and upon such notice to the adverse party, and before such person authorized to take depositions, as the court directs. [Amended by 1965 c.400 §1; 1973 c.836 §259; 1989 c.790 §10; 2013 c.331 §1; 2017 c.123 §1]

 

      137.100 Defendant as witness in relation to circumstances. If the defendant consents thereto, the defendant may be examined as a witness in relation to the circumstances which are alleged to justify aggravation or mitigation of the punishment; but if the defendant gives testimony at the request of the defendant, then the defendant must submit to be examined generally by the adverse party.

 

(Compensatory Fine)

 

      137.101 Compensatory fine. (1) Whenever the court imposes a fine as penalty for the commission of a crime resulting in injury for which the person injured by the act constituting the crime has a remedy by civil action, unless the issue of punitive damages has been previously decided on a civil case arising out of the same act and transaction, the court may order that the defendant pay any portion of the fine separately to the clerk of the court as compensatory fines in the case. The clerk shall pay over to the injured victim or victims, as directed in the court’s order, moneys paid to the court as compensatory fines under this subsection. This section shall be liberally construed in favor of victims.

      (2) Compensatory fines may be awarded in addition to restitution awarded under ORS 137.103 to 137.109.

      (3) Nothing in this section limits or impairs the right of a person injured by a defendant’s criminal acts to sue and recover damages from the defendant in a civil action. Evidence that the defendant has paid or been ordered to pay compensatory fines under this section may not be introduced in any civil action arising out of the facts or events which were the basis for the compensatory fine. However, the court in such civil action shall credit any compensatory fine paid by the defendant to a victim against any judgment for punitive damages in favor of the victim in the civil action. [1981 c.637 §2; 1987 c.2 §11]

 

(Restitution)

      137.105 Authority of trial court during pendency of appeal. (1) The trial court retains authority during the pendency of an appeal to determine restitution and to enter a supplemental judgment specifying the amount and terms of restitution or an order denying restitution.

      (2) If the trial court enters a supplemental judgment or an order under subsection (1) of this section during the pendency of an appeal, the trial court administrator shall immediately provide a copy of the supplemental judgment or the order to the appellate court. [2017 c.529 §19]

 

      Note: 137.105 was added to and made a part of 137.101 to 137.109 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      137.106 Restitution to victims; objections by defendant; disclosure to defendant. (1)(a) When a person is convicted of a crime, or a violation as described in ORS 153.008, that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, at the time of sentencing or within 90 days after entry of the judgment, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. The court may extend the time by which the presentation must be made for good cause. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall enter a judgment or supplemental judgment requiring that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim’s economic damages as determined by the court. The lien, priority of the lien and ability to enforce the specific amount of restitution established under this paragraph by a supplemental judgment relates back to the date of the original judgment that is supplemented.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, a court may order that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that is less than the full amount of the victim’s economic damages only if:

      (A) The victim or, if the victim is an estate, successor in interest, trust or other entity, an authorized representative of the victim consents to the lesser amount, if the conviction is not for a person felony; or

      (B) The victim or, if the victim is an estate, successor in interest, trust or other entity, an authorized representative of the victim consents in writing to the lesser amount, if the conviction is for a person felony.

      (c) As used in this subsection, “person felony” has the meaning given that term in the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.

      (2) After the district attorney makes a presentation described in subsection (1) of this section, if the court is unable to find from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, the court shall make a finding on the record to that effect.

      (3) No finding made by the court or failure of the court to make a finding under this section limits or impairs the rights of a person injured to sue and recover damages in a civil action as provided in ORS 137.109.

      (4)(a) If a judgment or supplemental judgment described in subsection (1) of this section includes restitution, a court may delay the enforcement of the monetary sanctions, including restitution, only if the defendant alleges and establishes to the satisfaction of the court the defendant’s inability to pay the judgment in full at the time the judgment is entered. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay, the court may establish or allow an appropriate supervising authority to establish a payment schedule, taking into consideration the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the defendant. The supervising authority shall be authorized to modify any payment schedule established under this section.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “supervising authority” means any state or local agency that is authorized to supervise the defendant.

      (5) If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount or distribution of the restitution, the court shall allow the defendant to be heard on such issue at the time of sentencing or at the time the court determines the amount of restitution.

      (6)(a) At least 10 days prior to the presentation described in subsection (1) of this section, the district attorney shall:

      (A) Disclose to the defendant the names of any witnesses that may be called during the presentation; and

      (B) Provide the defendant with copies of, or allow the defendant to inspect, any exhibits that will be used or introduced during the presentation.

      (b) If the court finds that the district attorney has violated the requirements of this subsection, the court shall grant a continuance to allow additional time for preparation upon request of the defendant. Any additional time granted under this paragraph may not count toward the 90-day time limitation described in subsection (1) of this section. [1977 c.371 §2; 1983 c.724 §1; 1993 c.533 §1; 1997 c.313 §23; 1999 c.1051 §124; 2003 c.670 §1; 2005 c.564 §2; 2007 c.425 §1; 2007 c.482 §1; 2013 c.388 §1; 2015 c.9 §2]

 

      137.107 Authority of court to amend part of judgment relating to restitution. At any time after entry of a judgment upon conviction of a crime, the court may amend that part of the judgment relating to restitution if, in the original judgment, the court included language imposing, recommending or requiring restitution but failed to conform the judgment to the requirements of ORS 18.048 or any other law governing the form of judgments in effect before January 1, 2004. [1997 c.526 §2; 2003 c.576 §163]

 

      Note: 137.107 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 137 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      137.108 Restitution when defendant has entered into diversion agreement. (1) When a person has entered into a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion agreement and the person’s actions resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court within 90 days of when the diversion agreement is entered, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, the court shall order the defendant to pay restitution and include in the diversion agreement one of the following:

      (a) A requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim’s economic damages as determined by the court.

      (b) A requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that is less than the full amount of the victim’s economic damages, with the consent of the victim.

      (2) After the district attorney makes a presentation described in subsection (1) of this section, if the court is unable to find from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, the court shall make a finding on the record to that effect.

      (3) A finding made by the court under this section, or a failure of the court to make a finding, does not limit or impair the right of a person injured to sue and recover damages in a civil action as provided in ORS 137.109.

      (4) If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount or distribution of the restitution, the court shall allow the defendant to be heard on such issue at the time the court determines the amount of restitution.

      (5) As used in this section, “victim” includes any person the court determines has suffered economic damages as a result of the act that has brought the defendant before the court for the purpose of entering into a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion agreement.

(1) A sentence imposed by the court may be made concurrent or consecutive to any other sentence which has been previously imposed or is simultaneously imposed upon the same defendant. The court may provide for consecutive sentences only in accordance with the provisions of this section. A sentence shall be deemed to be a concurrent term unless the judgment expressly provides for consecutive sentences.

      (2) If a defendant is simultaneously sentenced for criminal offenses that do not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, or if the defendant previously was sentenced by any other court within the United States to a sentence which the defendant has not yet completed, the court may impose a sentence concurrent with or consecutive to the other sentence or sentences.

      (4) When a defendant has been found guilty of more than one criminal offense arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, the sentences imposed for each resulting conviction shall be concurrent unless the court complies with the procedures set forth in subsection (5) of this section.

      (5) The court has discretion to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment for separate convictions arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct only if the court finds:

      (a) That the criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated was not merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision in the course of the commission of a more serious crime but rather was an indication of defendant’s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or

      (b) The criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or caused or created a risk of causing loss, injury or harm to a different victim than was caused or threatened by the other offense or offenses committed during a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct. [1987 c.2 §12; 1991 c.67 §29; 1991 c.111 §14; 1995 c.657 §2; 2003 c.14 §58]

      (a) The court shall not designate the correctional facility in which the defendant is to be confined but shall commit the defendant to the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections; and

      (b) If the judgment provides that the term of incarceration be served consecutively to a term of incarceration of 12 months or less that was imposed in a previous proceeding by a court of this state upon conviction of a felony, the defendant shall serve any remaining part of the previously imposed term of incarceration in the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections.

      (2)(a) If the court imposes a sentence upon conviction of a felony that includes a term of incarceration that is 12 months or less, the court shall commit the defendant to the legal and physical custody of the supervisory authority of the county in which the crime of conviction occurred.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, when the court imposes a sentence upon conviction of a felony that includes a term of incarceration that is 12 months or less, the court shall commit the defendant to the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections if the court orders that the term of incarceration be served consecutively to a term of incarceration that exceeds 12 months that was imposed in a previous proceeding or in the same proceeding by a court of this state upon conviction of a felony.

      (3) After assuming custody of the convicted person the Department of Corrections may transfer adults in custody from one correctional facility to another such facility for the purposes of diagnosis and study, rehabilitation and treatment, as best seems to fit the needs of the adult in custody and for the protection and welfare of the community and the adult in custody.

      (4) If the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment upon conviction of a misdemeanor, it shall commit the defendant to the custody of the supervisory authority of the county in which the crime of conviction occurred.

      (5)(a) When a person under 18 years of age at the time of committing the offense and under 20 years of age at the time of sentencing is committed to the Department of Corrections under ORS 137.707 or due to the fact that criminal proceedings were initiated after the person attained 18 years of age, the Department of Corrections shall transfer the physical custody of the person to the Oregon Youth Authority as provided in ORS 420.011 if:

      (A) The person will complete the sentence imposed before the person attains 25 years of age;

      (B) The Department of Corrections and the Oregon Youth Authority determine that, because of the person’s age, immaturity, mental or emotional condition or risk of physical harm to the person, the person should not be incarcerated initially in a Department of Corrections institution; or

      (C) The person is under 18 years of age at the time of sentencing and commitment.

      (b) A person placed in the custody of the Oregon Youth Authority under this subsection who is at least 18 years of age shall be returned to the physical custody of the Department of Corrections whenever the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority, after consultation with the Department of Corrections, determines that the conditions or circumstances that warranted the transfer of custody under this subsection are no longer present.

      (c) Notwithstanding ORS 137.320, the sheriff may by agreement with the Department of Corrections transfer the person described in this subsection directly to a youth correction facility for physical custody without first delivering the person to the Department of Corrections.

      (6)(a) When a person under 18 years of age at the time of committing the offense and under 20 years of age at the time of sentencing is committed to the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county following waiver under ORS 419C.349 (1)(b), 419C.352, 419C.364 or 419C.370 or sentencing under ORS 137.707 (5)(b)(A) or (7)(b) or 137.712, the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county shall transfer the person to the physical custody of the Oregon Youth Authority for placement as provided in ORS 420.011 (3). The terms and conditions of the person’s incarceration and custody are governed by ORS 420A.200 to 420A.206. Notwithstanding ORS 137.320, the sheriff may by agreement with the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county transfer the person described in this subsection directly to a youth correction facility for physical custody without first delivering the person to the Department of Corrections or supervisory authority of the county. As part of the agreement with the Department of Corrections or supervisory authority of the county, the sheriff may designate the county juvenile department or the Oregon Youth Authority to conduct the direct transfer described in this paragraph if the sheriff has entered into a written agreement with the county juvenile department, the Oregon Youth Authority, or both, to provide the direct transfer.

      (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section, the department or the supervisory authority of a county may not transfer the physical custody of the person under subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section if the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority, after consultation with the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county, determines that, because of the person’s age, mental or emotional condition or risk of physical harm to other persons, the person should not be incarcerated in a youth correction facility.

      (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstances may a person under 18 years of age be incarcerated in a Department of Corrections institution.

      (9) If a defendant is transferred under subsection (5) of this section, the defendant shall also be transferred after a resentencing on the same charges resulting from an appellate decision or a post-conviction relief proceeding or for any other reason, even if the defendant is 20 years of age or older at the time of the resentencing.

      (10) For the purposes of determining the person’s age at the time of committing an offense under this section:

      (a) If the person is convicted of two or more offenses occurring on different days, the person’s age shall be calculated using the earliest date.

      (b) If the person is convicted of an offense occurring within a range of dates, the person’s age shall be calculated using the date at the beginning of the range.

      (v) The person has not been convicted of, found guilty except for insanity of or found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court based on a crime for which the court is prohibited from setting aside the conviction under this section; and

      (vi) Each conviction or finding described in this subparagraph involved the same victim.

      (7) Notwithstanding subsection (5) of this section, the provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to:

      (a) A conviction for a state or municipal traffic offense.

      (b) A person convicted, within the 10-year period immediately preceding the filing of the motion pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, of any other offense, excluding motor vehicle violations, whether or not the other conviction is for conduct associated with the same criminal episode that caused the arrest, citation, charge or conviction that is sought to be set aside. A single violation, other than a motor vehicle violation, within the last 10 years is not a conviction under this subsection. Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a conviction that has been set aside under this section shall be considered for the purpose of determining whether this paragraph is applicable.

      (c) A person who at the time the motion authorized by subsection (1) of this section is pending before the court is under charge of commission of any crime.

      (8) The provisions of subsection (1)(b) of this section do not apply to:

An arrest, citation or charge that has been set aside under this section may not be considered for the purpose of determining whether this paragraph is applicable.

      (9) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section apply to convictions, arrests, citations and charges that occurred before, as well as those that occurred after, September 9, 1971. There is no time limit for making an application.

      (10) For purposes of any civil action in which truth is an element of a claim for relief or affirmative defense, the provisions of subsection (3) of this section providing that the conviction, arrest, citation, charge or other proceeding be deemed not to have occurred do not apply and a party may apply to the court for an order requiring disclosure of the official records in the case as may be necessary in the interest of justice.

      (11) Upon motion of any prosecutor or defendant in a case involving records sealed under this section, supported by affidavit showing good cause, the court with jurisdiction may order the reopening and disclosure of any records sealed under this section for the limited purpose of assisting the investigation of the movant. However, such an order has no other effect on the orders setting aside the conviction or the arrest, citation or charge record.

      (12) Unless the court makes written findings by clear and convincing evidence that granting the motion would not be in the best interests of justice, the court shall grant the motion and enter an order as provided in subsection (3) of this section if the defendant has been convicted of one of the following crimes and is otherwise eligible for relief under this section:

      (2) The court shall designate agencies or organizations to perform the evaluations required under subsection (1) of this section. The designated agencies or organizations must meet the standards set by the Oregon Health Authority to perform the evaluations for drug dependency and must be approved by the authority. Wherever possible, a court shall designate agencies or organizations to perform the evaluations that are separate from those that may be designated to carry out a program of treatment for alcohol or drug dependency. [1991 c.630 §1; 2009 c.595 §94]

 

      Note: 137.227 to 137.229 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 137 by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      137.228 Finding that defendant is alcoholic or drug-dependent person; effect. (1) When a defendant is sentenced for a crime, the court may enter a finding that the defendant is an alcoholic or a drug-dependent person, as those terms are defined in ORS 430.306. The finding may be based upon any evidence before the court, including, but not limited to, the facts of the case, stipulations of the parties and the results of any evaluation conducted under ORS 137.227.

      (2) When the court finds that the defendant is an alcoholic or a drug-dependent person, the court, when it sentences the defendant to a term of imprisonment, shall direct the Department of Corrections to place the defendant in an appropriate alcohol or drug treatment program, to the extent that resources are available. The alcohol or drug treatment program shall meet the standards promulgated by the Oregon Health Authority pursuant to ORS 430.357. [1991 c.630 §§2,3; 2005 c.271 §1; 2009 c.595 §95]

(Effects of Felony Conviction)

 

      137.230 Definitions for ORS 137.260. As used in ORS 137.260, “conviction” or “convicted” means an adjudication of guilt upon a verdict or finding entered in a criminal proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction. [1961 c.412 §1; 1987 c.158 §20]

 

      137.240 [Formerly 421.110; 1973 c.56 §1; 1973 c.836 §266; 1974 c.36 §2; repealed by 1975 c.781 §10]

 

      137.250 [Formerly 421.112; 1973 c.836 §267; repealed by 1975 c.781 §10]

 

      137.260 Political rights restored to persons convicted of felony before August 9, 1961, and subsequently discharged. Any person convicted of a felony prior to August 9, 1961, and subsequently discharged from probation, parole or imprisonment prior to or after August 9, 1961, is hereby restored to the political rights of the person. [1961 c.412 §4]

 

      137.270 Effect of felony conviction on property of defendant. No conviction of any person for crime works any forfeiture of any property, except in cases where the same is expressly provided by law; but in all cases of the commission or attempt to commit a felony, the state has a lien, from the time of such commission or attempt, upon all the property of the defendant for the purpose of satisfying any judgment which may be given against the defendant for any fine on account thereof and for the costs and disbursements in the proceedings against the defendant for such crime; provided, however, such lien shall not attach to such property as against a purchaser or incumbrancer in good faith, for value, whose interest in the property was acquired before the entry of the judgment against the defendant. [Formerly 137.460; 2003 c.576 §191]

 

      137.275 Effect of felony conviction on civil and political rights of felon. Except as otherwise provided by law, a person convicted of a felony does not suffer civil death or disability, or sustain loss of civil rights or forfeiture of estate or property, but retains all of the rights of the person, political, civil and otherwise, including, but not limited to, the right to vote, to hold, receive and transfer property, to enter into contracts, including contracts of marriage, and to maintain and defend civil actions, suits or proceedings. [1975 c.781 §1]

 

      137.280 [1975 c.781 §2; repealed by 1983 c.515 §1 (137.281 enacted in lieu of 137.280)]

 

      137.281 Withdrawal of rights during term of incarceration; restoration of rights. (1) In any felony case, when the defendant is sentenced to a term of incarceration, the defendant is deprived of all rights and privileges described in subsection (3) of this section from the date of sentencing until:

      (a) The defendant is released from incarceration; or

      (b) The defendant’s conviction is set aside.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies to any term of incarceration, whether the term of incarceration was imposed as a result of conviction or as a sanction or revocation resulting from the defendant’s violation of the terms and conditions of probation, parole or post-prison supervision.

      (3) The rights and privileges of which a person may be deprived under this section are:

      (a) Holding a public office or an office of a political party or becoming or remaining a candidate for either office;

      (b) Holding a position of private trust;

      (c) Acting as a juror; or

      (d) Exercising the right to vote.

      (4) If the court under subsection (1) of this section temporarily stays execution of sentence for any purpose other than probation, the defendant nonetheless is sentenced for purposes of subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) A person convicted of any crime and serving a term of imprisonment in any federal correctional institution in this state is deprived of the rights to register to vote, update a registration or vote in any election in this state from the date of sentencing until:

      (a) The person is discharged or paroled from imprisonment; or

      (b) The person’s conviction is set aside.

      (6) The county clerk or county official in charge of elections in any county may cancel the registration of any person serving a term of imprisonment in any federal correctional institution in this state.

      (7) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 10.030, the rights and privileges withdrawn by this section are restored automatically upon release from incarceration, but in the case of parole shall be automatically withdrawn upon a subsequent imprisonment for violation of the terms of the parole. [1983 c.515 §2 (enacted in lieu of 137.280); 1987 c.320 §32; 1993 c.14 §4; 1997 c.313 §10; 1999 c.499 §1; 2008 c.35 §6]

 

      137.285 Retained rights of felon; regulation of exercise. ORS 137.275 to 137.285 do not deprive the Director of the Department of Corrections, or the director’s authorized agents, of the authority to regulate the manner in which these retained rights of convicted persons may be exercised as is reasonably necessary for the control of the conduct and conditions of confinement of convicted persons in the custody of the Department of Corrections. [1975 c.781 §3; 1979 c.284 §116; 1987 c.320 §33]

 

(Minimum Fine)

 

      137.286 Minimum fines for misdemeanors and felonies; retention of jurisdiction. (1) Unless a specific minimum fine is provided by law, the minimum fine for a misdemeanor is $100.

      (2) Unless a specific minimum fine is provided by law, the minimum fine for a felony is $200.

      (3) A court may waive payment of the minimum fine established by this section, in whole or in part, if the court finds that requiring payment of the minimum fine would be inconsistent with justice in the case. In making its determination under this subsection, the court shall consider:

      (a) The financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of the minimum fine will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the defendant; and

      (b) The extent to which that burden can be alleviated by allowing the defendant to pay the monetary obligations imposed by the court on an installment basis or on other conditions to be fixed by the court.

      (4) This section does not affect the manner in which a court imposes or reduces monetary obligations other than fines.

      (5) During any period of supervision that is part of the defendant’s sentence, the court retains jurisdiction under this subsection for the limited purpose of waiving any unpaid portion of a fine previously imposed if the defendant is able to establish a financial hardship that prevents the defendant from completing an alcohol or drug treatment program that was required as a condition of supervision. Any moneys received in payment of the fine prior to the waiver may not be returned to the defendant. [2011 c.597 §10; 2015 c.186 §1]

      (7) The Department of Revenue shall establish by rule a process for distributing moneys in the Criminal Fine Account. The department may not distribute more than one-eighth of the total biennial allocation to an entity during a calendar quarter. [1987 c.905 §6; 2001 c.829 §§1,1a; 2005 c.700 §2; 2011 c.597 §52; 2012 c.89 §14; 2013 c.40 §2; 2013 c.628 §10; 2013 c.685 §27; 2017 c.151 §2; 2017 c.712 §5]

      137.301 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Systems critical components of the Oregon criminal justice system exist that require the highest priority considerations for funding from the Criminal Fine Account.

      (2) The systems critical components of the Oregon criminal justice system are interrelated and essential to the initiation and successful conclusion of criminal investigations.

      (3) The interests of victims of crime and other Oregonians are advanced by the ability of the public safety community to respond professionally to reports of criminal activity and to successfully investigate criminal cases in a manner that protects the constitutional rights of all Oregonians.

      (4) The effective training of police officers, corrections officers, parole and probation officers and other first responders increases the likelihood that crimes will be solved quickly and that the needs of victims of crime will be met.

      (5) The collection of evidence at crime scenes, the forensic processing of the evidence by qualified, well-trained technicians and the work of medical examiners are critical statewide functions that allow all Oregonians an equal opportunity to justice.

      (6) The collection of criminal information such as that retained in the Law Enforcement Data System enhances the ability of investigators to identify criminals and the unnamed victims of violent crimes.

      (7) Timely intervention on behalf of victims of crime through effective assistance programs makes recovery from victimization possible and is necessary to the well-being of Oregonians adversely affected by violent crime. [2005 c.700 §1; 2011 c.597 §52b]

      137.310 Authorizing execution of judgment; detention of defendant. (1) When a judgment has been pronounced, a certified copy of the entry thereof in the register shall be forthwith furnished by the clerk to the officer whose duty it is to execute the judgment; and no other warrant or authority is necessary to justify or require its execution.

      (2) The defendant may be arrested and detained in any county in the state by any peace officer and held for the authorities from the county to which the execution is directed. Time spent by the defendant in such detention shall be credited toward the term specified in the judgment. [Amended by 1961 c.358 §1; 1967 c.372 §4; 1985 c.540 §37]

 

      137.315 Electronic telecommunication of notice of judgment authorized. Whenever it is necessary that a copy of the entry of judgment against a defendant be delivered to the Department of Corrections or any other correctional authority of this state, or to the correctional authority of any political subdivision of this state, the court or the sheriff may transmit notice of the judgment by electronic telecommunication. The notice of judgment shall serve as authority for imprisonment under this chapter. The notice need not be a duplicate or photographic copy of judgment, but if it is not a duplicated or photographic copy, then it must be followed in due course by a duplicate or photographic copy with a notation that notice had been sent previously. [1987 c.251 §2]

 

      137.320 Delivery of defendant when committed to Department of Corrections; credit on sentence. (1) Except as provided in ORS 137.124, when a judgment includes commitment to the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections, the sheriff shall deliver the defendant, together with a copy of the entry of judgment and a statement signed by the sheriff of the number of days the defendant was imprisoned prior to delivery, to the superintendent of the Department of Corrections institution to which the defendant is initially assigned pursuant to ORS 137.124. If at the time of entry of a judgment, the defendant was serving a term of incarceration at the direction of the supervisory authority of a county upon conviction of a prior felony, the sheriff shall also deliver to the Department of Corrections a copy of the prior entry of judgment committing the defendant to the supervisory authority of the county of conviction and a statement of the number of days the defendant has remaining to be served on the term or incarceration imposed in the prior judgment.

      (2) If the defendant is surrendered to another legal authority prior to delivery to an institution of the Department of Corrections, the sheriff shall forward to the Department of Corrections copies of the entry of all pertinent judgments, a statement of the number of days the defendant was imprisoned prior to surrender, a statement of the number of days the defendant has remaining to be served on any term of incarceration the defendant was serving at the direction of the supervisory authority of a county upon conviction of a prior felony and an identification of the authority to whom the prisoner was surrendered.

      (3) Upon receipt of the information described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the Department of Corrections shall establish a case file and compute the defendant’s sentence in accordance with the provisions of ORS 137.370.

The sheriff shall compute the time the defendant was imprisoned after arrest and prior to the commencement of the term specified in the judgment. Such time shall be credited toward the term of the sentence. [Amended by 1955 c.660 §14; 1967 c.232 §1; 1967 c.585 §5; 1971 c.619 §1; 1973 c.631 §1; 1981 c.424 §1; 1987 c.320 §34; 1995 c.423 §29; 2014 c.31 §2]

(1) Except as provided in ORS 137.167, 137.333 or 423.478, a judgment of imprisonment in the county jail shall be executed by confinement in the jail of the county where the judgment is given, except that when the place of trial has been changed, the confinement shall take place in the jail of the county where the action was commenced.

      (2) The jailor of any county jail to which a prisoner is ordered, sentenced or delivered pursuant to ORS 137.167 shall receive and keep such prisoner in the same manner as if the prisoner had been ordered, sentenced or delivered to the jailor by an officer or court of the jailor’s own county; but the county in which the prisoner would be imprisoned except for the provisions of ORS 137.167 shall pay all the expenses of keeping and maintaining the prisoner in said jail. [Amended by 1987 c.550 §4; 1996 c.4 §3]

 

      137.333 Exception to ORS 137.330. Whenever a judge sentences a person to a term of incarceration in a county jail, the judgment may be executed by confinement in another county or in a state correctional facility if the county in which the person would otherwise be imprisoned:

      (1) Has entered into an intergovernmental agreement as provided in ORS 169.053; or

      (2) Is located within an intergovernmental corrections entity formed under ORS 190.265. [1996 c.4 §2]

 

      Note: 137.333 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 137 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      137.370 Commencement and computation of term of imprisonment in state correctional institution; sentences concurrent unless court orders otherwise. (1) When a person is sentenced to imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections, the term of confinement therein commences from the day the person is delivered to the custody of an officer of the Department of Corrections for the purpose of serving the sentence executed, regardless of whether the sentence is to be served in a state or federal institution.

      (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, when a person is sentenced to imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections, for the purpose of computing the amount of sentence served the term of confinement includes only:

      (a) The time that the person is confined by any authority after the arrest for:

      (A) The crime for which sentence is imposed;

      (B) A lesser included or greater inclusive offense of the crime for which sentence was imposed; and

      (C) Any other crime constituting a violation of Oregon law within the same county designated by the sentencing court in the judgment as having been committed as part of the same criminal episode as the crime for which sentence was imposed; and

      (b) The time that the person is authorized by the Department of Corrections to spend outside a confinement facility, in a program conducted by or for the Department of Corrections.

      (3) When a judgment of conviction is vacated and a new sentence is thereafter imposed upon the defendant for the same crime, a lesser included or greater inclusive offense of the crime, or any crime constituting a violation of Oregon law within the same county designated by the sentencing court in the judgment as having been committed as part of the same criminal episode as the crime, the period of detention and imprisonment theretofore served shall be deducted from the maximum term, and from the minimum, if any, of the new sentence.

      (4) Unless the court expressly orders otherwise, a person who is confined as the result of a sentence for a crime or conduct that is not directly related to the crime for which the sentence is imposed, or for violation of the conditions of probation, parole or post-prison supervision, shall not receive presentence incarceration credit for the time served in jail toward service of the term of confinement.

      (5) Unless the court expressly orders otherwise, a term of imprisonment shall be concurrent with that portion of any sentence previously imposed that remains unexpired at the time the court imposes sentence. This subsection applies regardless of whether the earlier sentence was imposed by the same or any other court, and regardless of whether the earlier sentence is being or is to be served in the same penal institution or under the same correctional authority as will be the later sentence.

      (6) As used in this section, “criminal episode” has the meaning given that term in ORS 131.505. [Amended by 1955 c.660 §15; 1965 c.463 §19; 1967 c.232 §2; 1973 c.562 §2; 1973 c.631 §4; 1981 c.424 §2; 1987 c.251 §4; 1987 c.320 §35; 1995 c.657 §20; 2015 c.508 §§1,4]

 

      137.372 Credit for time served as part of probationary sentence; diversion program or specialty court program. (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 137.370 (2), an offender who has been revoked from a probationary sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, and whose sentence was imposed as a downward dispositional departure under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, shall receive credit for the time served in jail after arrest and before commencement of the probationary sentence and for the time served in jail as part of the probationary sentence. However, if the credit for the time served in jail as described in this paragraph is greater than 90 days, the sentencing judge may limit or deny credit for any of that time that exceeds 90 days.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 137.370 (2), an offender who has been revoked from a probationary sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, and whose sentence was imposed as a presumptive or optional probationary sentence under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, shall receive credit for the time served in jail after arrest and before commencement of the probationary sentence and for the time served in jail as part of the probationary sentence, unless the sentencing judge orders otherwise.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 137.370 (2), an offender who is sentenced to imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections following the failure to complete a diversion program described in ORS 430.450 to 430.555 or a specialty court program in which the offender was not on probation shall receive credit for the time served in jail after arrest and before commencement of the program and for the time served in jail as a sanction for violating the terms of the program, unless the sentencing judge orders otherwise.

      (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 137.320 (4), an offender who has been ordered confined as part of a probationary sentence for a felony committed on or after July 18, 1995, shall receive credit for the time served in jail after arrest and before commencement of the term unless the sentencing judge orders otherwise.

      (4) As used in this section, “specialty court” has the meaning given that term in ORS 137.680. [1989 c.790 §81; 1993 c.692 §4; 1995 c.657 §13; 2015 c.508 §2; 2018 c.120 §13]

      137.375 Release of prisoners whose terms expire on weekends or legal holidays. When the date of release from imprisonment of any prisoner in an adult correctional facility under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, or any prisoner in a county or city jail, falls on Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, the prisoner shall be released, at the discretion of the releasing authority, on the first, second or third day preceding the date of release which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Prisoners of a county or city jail serving a mandatory minimum term specifically limited to weekends shall be released only at the time fixed in the sentence. [1953 c.532 §1; 1955 c.660 §16; 1971 c.290 §1; 1979 c.487 §10; 1987 c.320 §36; 2001 c.851 §7]

 

      137.380 Discipline, treatment and employment of prisoners. A judgment of commitment to the custody of the Department of Corrections need only specify the duration of confinement as provided in ORS 137.120. Thereafter the manner of the confinement and the treatment and employment of a person shall be regulated and governed by whatever law is then in force prescribing the discipline, treatment and employment of persons committed. [Amended by 1955 c.32 §1; 1955 c.660 §17; 1959 c.687 §1; 1973 c.836 §268; 1987 c.320 §37]

[Amended by 1967 c.471 §4]

 

      137.450 Enforcement of money judgment in criminal action. A judgment against the defendant or complainant in a criminal action, so far as it requires the payment of a fine, fee, assessment, costs and disbursements of the action or restitution, may be enforced as a judgment in a civil action.

      137.452 Satisfaction of monetary obligation imposed as part of sentence; release of judgment lien from real property; authority of Attorney General. When a person is convicted of an offense and sentenced to pay any monetary obligation, the following provisions apply to obtaining a satisfaction of the money award portion of the judgment or a release of a judgment lien from a specific parcel of real property when the money award portion of the judgment is not satisfied:

      (1) The Attorney General, by rule, may do any of the following:

      (a) Authorize the Attorney General’s office, a district attorney’s office, any state agency within the executive branch of government or any specific individual or group within any of these to:

      (A) Issue satisfactions of the money award portions of judgments; or

      (B) Release a judgment lien from a specific parcel of real property when either the judgment lien does not attach to any equity in the real property or the amount of equity in the real property to which the judgment lien attaches, less costs of sale or other reasonable expenses, is paid upon the judgment.

      (b) Establish procedures and requirements that any person described under paragraph (a) of this subsection must follow to issue satisfactions or releases.

      (2) Authorization of a person under subsection (1) of this section is permissive and such person is not required to issue satisfactions or releases if authorized. However, if a person is authorized under subsection (1) of this section and does issue satisfactions or releases, the person must comply with the procedures and requirements established by the Attorney General by rule.

      (3) If the Attorney General establishes a program under subsection (1) of this section, the Attorney General’s office shall issue satisfactions and releases under the program unless the Attorney General determines that there are sufficient other agencies authorized under subsection (1) of this section who are actually participating in the program to provide reasonable access to satisfactions and releases on a statewide basis.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, when the entries in the register and the financial accounting records for the court show conclusively that a monetary obligation imposed in a criminal action has been paid in full, the clerk of the court may note in the register that the money award portion of the judgment has been paid in full. Notation in the register under this paragraph constitutes a satisfaction of the money award portion of the judgment. The clerk of the court is not civilly liable for any act or omission in making the notation in the register in the manner authorized by this paragraph.

      (b) When a monetary obligation imposed in a criminal action is paid by a negotiable instrument, the clerk of the court shall proceed as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection only after the expiration of 21 days from the date the negotiable instrument is received by the court. The clerk may proceed as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection before the expiration of the 21-day period if the judgment debtor or any other interested person makes a request that the clerk proceed and provides information that establishes to the satisfaction of the clerk that the instrument has been honored.

      (c) This subsection does not authorize the clerk of a court to compromise, settle or partially satisfy a monetary obligation imposed in a criminal action, or to release part of any property subject to a judgment lien.

      (5) Any satisfaction issued by a person authorized under this section may be entered in the same manner and has the same effect on the money award portion of a judgment as a satisfaction issued for the money award portions of a judgment from a civil action or proceeding.

      (6) The release of judgment liens on specific parcels of real property by the Attorney General or by a person authorized by the Attorney General under subsection (1) of this section is discretionary. The money award portion of the judgment shall remain a lien against all real property not specifically released. [1989 c.472 §4; 1993 c.145 §1; 1997 c.801 §68; 2003 c.576 §164]

(Death Sentence)

 

      137.463 Death warrant hearing; death warrant. (1) When a sentence of death is pronounced, the clerk of the court shall deliver a copy of the judgment of conviction and sentence of death to the sheriff of the county. The sheriff shall deliver the defendant within 20 days from the date the judgment is entered to the correctional institution designated by the Director of the Department of Corrections pending the determination of the automatic and direct review by the Supreme Court under ORS 138.052.

      (2) If the Supreme Court affirms the sentence of death, a death warrant hearing shall take place in the court in which the judgment was rendered within 30 days after the effective date of the appellate judgment or, upon motion of the state, on a later date. The following apply to a death warrant hearing under this subsection:

      (a) The defendant must be present; and

      (b) The defendant may be represented by counsel. If the defendant was represented by appointed counsel on automatic and direct review, that counsel’s appointment continues for purposes of the death warrant hearing and any related matters. If that counsel is unavailable, the court shall appoint counsel pursuant to the procedure in ORS 135.050 and 135.055.

      (3)(a) If the defendant indicates the wish to waive the right to counsel for the purpose of the death warrant hearing, the court shall inquire of the defendant on the record to ensure that the waiver is competent, knowing and voluntary.

      (b) If the court finds that the waiver is competent, knowing and voluntary, the court shall discharge counsel.

      (c) If the court finds on the record that the waiver of the right to counsel granted by this section is not competent, knowing or voluntary, the court shall continue the appointment of counsel.

      (d) Notwithstanding the fact that the court finds on the record that the defendant competently, knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to counsel, the court may continue the appointment of counsel as advisor only for the purposes of the death warrant hearing.

      (4) At the death warrant hearing, the court:

      (a) After appropriate inquiry, shall make findings on the record whether the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the death sentence or its implication. The defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the death sentence or its implication.

      (b) Shall advise the defendant that the defendant is entitled to counsel in any post-conviction proceeding and that counsel will be appointed if the defendant is financially eligible for appointed counsel at state expense.

      (c) Shall determine whether the defendant intends to pursue any challenges to the sentence or conviction. If the defendant states on the record that the defendant does not intend to challenge the sentence or conviction, the court after advising the defendant of the consequences shall make a finding on the record whether the defendant competently, knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to pursue:

      (A) A petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court;

      (B) Post-conviction relief under ORS 138.510 to 138.680; and

      (C) Federal habeas corpus review under 28 U.S.C. 2254.

      (5) Following the death warrant hearing, a death warrant, signed by the trial judge of the court in which the judgment was rendered and attested by the clerk of that court, shall be drawn and delivered to the superintendent of the correctional institution designated by the Director of the Department of Corrections. The death warrant shall specify a day on which the sentence of death is to be executed and shall authorize and command the superintendent to execute the judgment of the court. The trial court shall specify the date of execution of the sentence, taking into consideration the needs of the Department of Corrections. The trial court shall specify a date not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days following the effective date of the appellate judgment.

      (6)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, if the court finds that the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the sentence of death or its implications, the court may not issue a death warrant until such time as the court, after appropriate inquiries, finds that the defendant is able to comprehend the reasons for the sentence of death and its implications.

      (b)(A) If the court does not issue a death warrant because it finds that the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the sentence of death or its implications, the court shall conduct subsequent hearings on the issue on motion of the district attorney or the defendant’s counsel or on the court’s own motion, upon a showing that there is substantial reason to believe that the defendant’s condition has changed.

      (B) The court may hold a hearing under this paragraph no more frequently than once every six months.

      (C) The state and the defendant may obtain an independent medical, psychiatric or psychological examination of the defendant in connection with a hearing under this paragraph.

      (D) In a hearing under this paragraph, the defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant continues to suffer from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the sentence of death or its implications.

      (7) If for any reason a sentence of death is not executed on the date appointed in the death warrant, and the sentence of death remains in force and is not stayed under ORS 138.686 or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, the court that issued the initial death warrant, on motion of the state and without further hearing, shall issue a new death warrant specifying a new date on which the sentence is to be executed. The court shall specify a date for execution of the sentence, taking into consideration the needs of the Department of Corrections. The court shall specify a date not more than 20 days after the date on which the state’s motion was filed.

      (8) No appeal may be taken from an order issued pursuant to this section. [1984 c.3 §5; 1999 c.1055 §2; 2001 c.962 §96]

 

      137.464 Administrative assessment of defendant’s mental capacity. (1)(a) At the death warrant hearing under ORS 137.463, the court shall order that the Oregon Health Authority or its designee perform an assessment of the defendant’s mental capacity to engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options if:

      (A) The defendant indicates the wish to waive the right to counsel; and

      (B) The court has substantial reason to believe that, due to mental incapacity, the defendant cannot engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options.

      (b) The court also shall order an assessment described in paragraph (a) of this subsection upon motion by the state.

      (2) If the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are met, the court may order the defendant to be committed to a state mental hospital designated by the authority for a period not exceeding 30 days for the purpose of assessing the defendant’s mental capacity. The report of any competency assessment performed under this section must include, but need not be limited to, the following:

      (a) A description of the nature of the assessment;

      (b) A statement of the mental condition of the defendant; and

      (c) A statement regarding the defendant’s mental capacity to engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options.

      (3) If the competency assessment cannot be conducted because the defendant is unwilling to participate, the report must so state and must include, if possible, an opinion as to whether the unwillingness of the defendant is the result of a mental condition affecting the defendant’s mental capacity to engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options.

      (4) The authority shall file three copies of the report of the competency assessment with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the district attorney and to counsel for the defendant. [1999 c.1055 §3; 2009 c.595 §96]

(1) If the court has ordered the Oregon Health Authority to perform a competency assessment of the defendant under ORS 137.464 and the assessment has been completed, the court shall determine the issue of the defendant’s mental capacity to engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options. If neither the state nor counsel for the defendant contests the finding of the report filed under ORS 137.464, the court may make the determination of the defendant’s mental capacity to engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options on the basis of the report. If the finding is contested, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue. If the report is received in evidence at the hearing, the party contesting the finding has the right to summon and to cross-examine the psychiatrist or psychologist who submitted the report and to offer evidence on the issue. Either party may introduce other evidence regarding the defendant’s mental capacity to engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options.

      (2) If the court determines that, due to mental incapacity, the defendant cannot engage in reasoned choices of legal strategies and options, the court shall continue the appointment of counsel provided under ORS 137.463.

When a court paroles a defendant under this subsection and the defendant is serving a sentence or sanction imposed under ORS 423.478 (2)(d) or (e), the court may order the local supervisory authority to supervise the defendant. The committing magistrate may also authorize, limit or prohibit the release of a sentenced defendant upon pass, furlough, leave, work or educational release.

      (2) The committing magistrate, having sentenced a defendant to probation and having confined the defendant as a condition of that probation in a county jail for a period up to one year, or having imposed a sentence of probation with confinement in the county jail in accordance with rules adopted by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, may authorize, limit or prohibit the release of such person upon pass, furlough, leave, work or educational release.

The defendant’s net earnings shall be paid to the sheriff, who shall deduct therefrom and pay such sums as may be ordered by the court for the defendant’s board, restitution, fine, support of dependents and necessary personal expense. Any balance remaining shall be retained by the sheriff until the defendant’s discharge from custody, whereupon the balance shall be paid to the defendant. [Amended by 1959 c.345 §1; 1973 c.836 §270; 1981 c.568 §1; 1989 c.790 §15; 1993 c.14 §8; 1999 c.661 §1]

      (2) When the judge recommends a custodial facility or program other than jail as a condition of probation, the judge shall sentence the defendant directly to the custody of the supervisory authority, as defined in rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, with jurisdiction over the facility or program.

(1) If a person pleads guilty or no contest to, or is found guilty of, a crime described in ORS 163.305 to 163.467, and if the court contemplates sentencing the person to probation, the court, before entering judgment, may order that the person undergo an examination by a psychiatrist or other physician found qualified and appointed by the court to determine whether available medical treatment would be likely to reduce such biological, emotional or psychological impulses, including any paraphilia, which may be the cause of the criminal conduct and, if so, whether the person is a suitable candidate medically for such treatment. Such medical treatments may include the taking of prescribed medication.

      (2) If the examining psychiatrist or other physician reports that available medical treatment would be likely to reduce the biological, emotional or psychological impulses that were a probable cause of the criminal conduct, and that the person is a suitable candidate medically for such treatment, the court may include as a condition of probation that the person participate in a prescribed program of medicine and accept medical treatment at the person’s own expense under the care of the psychiatrist or other physician appointed by the court and that the person faithfully participate in the prescribed program of medical treatment during the course of the probation.

      (3) A sentence of probation under this section shall not be imposed except upon the written consent of the convicted person. Probation under this section may be revoked upon any failure of the convicted person to cooperate in the treatment program, including, but not limited to, any failure to meet with the treating physician as directed by the physician or to take medication or otherwise to participate in the prescribed program of medical treatment during the course of the probation. [1987 c.908 §3; 1993 c.14 §9]

 

      137.530 Investigation and report of parole and probation officers; statement of victim. (1) Parole and probation officers, when directed by the court, shall fully investigate and report to the court in writing on the circumstances of the offense, criminal record, social history and present condition and environment of any defendant.

      (2) Whenever a presentence report is made, the preparer of the report shall make a reasonable effort to contact the victim and obtain a statement describing the effect of the defendant’s offense upon the victim. If the victim is under 18 years of age, the preparer shall obtain the consent of the victim’s parent or guardian before contacting the victim. The preparer of the report shall include the statement of the victim in the presentence investigation report. If the preparer is unable to contact the victim or if the victim declines to make a statement, the preparer shall report that the preparer was unable to contact the victim after making reasonable efforts to do so, or, if contact was made with the victim, that the victim declined to make a statement for purposes of this section. Before taking a statement from the victim, the preparer of the report shall inform the victim that the statement will be made available to the defendant and the defendant’s attorney prior to sentencing as required under ORS 137.079.

      (3) Whenever desirable, and facilities exist for conducting physical and mental examinations, the investigation shall include physical and mental examinations of such defendants.

      137.533 Probation without entering judgment of guilt; when appropriate; effect of violating condition of probation. (1) Whenever a person pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a misdemeanor other than driving while under the influence of intoxicants or other than a misdemeanor involving domestic violence as defined in ORS 135.230, the court may defer further proceedings and place the person on probation, upon motion of the district attorney and without entering a judgment of guilt, if the person:

      (a) Consents to the disposition;

      (b) Has not previously been convicted of any offense in any jurisdiction;

      (c) Has not been placed on probation under ORS 475.245;

      (d) Has not completed a diversion under ORS 135.881 to 135.901; and

      (e) Agrees to pay a fee equal to $100. The person must pay the amount within 90 days of imposition unless the court allows payment at a later time.

      (2) A district attorney may submit a motion under subsection (1) of this section if, after considering the factors listed in subsection (3) of this section, the district attorney finds that disposition under this section would be in the interests of justice and of benefit to the person and the community.

      (3) In determining whether disposition under this section is in the interests of justice and of benefit to the person and the community, the district attorney shall consider at least the following factors:

      (a) The nature of the offense. However, the offense must not have involved injury to another person.

      (b) Any special characteristics or difficulties of the person.

      (c) Whether there is a probability that the person will cooperate with and benefit from alternative treatment.

      (d) Whether an available program is appropriate to the needs of the person.

      (e) The impact of the disposition upon the community.

      (f) Recommendations, if any, of the involved law enforcement agency.

      (h) Provisions for restitution.

      (i) Any mitigating circumstances.

      (4) Upon violation of a term or condition of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon the person’s fulfillment of the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. A discharge and dismissal under this section is without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime. A person may be discharged and have proceedings dismissed only once under this section.

      (5) Subsections (1) to (4) of this section do not affect any domestic violence sentencing programs. [1999 c.819 §§1,2; 2011 c.597 §124]

      (B) The person demonstrates to the court by a preponderance of the evidence that no mental intimidation or pressure was brought to bear during the commission of the crime;

      (C) The person demonstrates to the court by a preponderance of the evidence that imposition of the condition will deprive the person of a residence that would be materially significant in aiding in the rehabilitation of the person or in the success of the probation; or

      (D) The person resides in a halfway house. As used in this subparagraph, “halfway house” means a publicly or privately operated profit or nonprofit residential facility that provides rehabilitative care and treatment for sex offenders.

      (b) A victim may request imposition of the special condition of probation described in this subsection at the time of sentencing in person or through the prosecuting attorney.

      (c) If the court imposes the special condition of probation described in this subsection and if at any time during the period of probation the victim moves to within three miles of the probationer’s residence, the court may not require the probationer to change the probationer’s residence in order to comply with the special condition of probation.

      (6) When a person who is a sex offender, as defined in ORS 163A.005, is released on probation, the Department of Corrections or the county community corrections agency, whichever is appropriate, shall notify the city police department, if the person is going to reside within a city, and the county sheriff’s office of the county in which the person is going to reside of the person’s release and the conditions of the person’s release.

      (7) Failure to abide by all general and special conditions of probation may result in arrest, modification of conditions, revocation of probation or imposition of structured, intermediate sanctions in accordance with rules adopted under ORS 137.595.

      (8) The court may order that probation be supervised by the court. If the court orders that probation be supervised by the court, the defendant shall pay a fee of $100 to the court. Fees imposed under this subsection in the circuit court shall be deposited by the clerk of the court in the General Fund. Fees imposed in a justice court under this subsection shall be paid to the county treasurer. Fees imposed in a municipal court under this subsection shall be paid to the city treasurer.

      (9)(a) The court may at any time modify the conditions of probation.

      (b) When the court orders a defendant placed under the supervision of the Department of Corrections or a community corrections agency, the supervising officer may file with the court a proposed modification to the special conditions of probation. The supervising officer shall provide a copy of the proposed modification to the district attorney and the probationer. If the district attorney:

      (A) Files an objection to the proposed modification less than five judicial days after the proposed modification was filed, the court shall schedule a hearing no later than 10 judicial days after the proposed modification was filed, unless the court finds good cause to schedule a hearing at a later time.

      (B) Does not file an objection to the proposed modification less than five judicial days after the proposed modification was filed, the proposed modification becomes effective five judicial days after the proposed modification was filed.

      (10) A court may not order revocation of probation as a result of the probationer’s failure to pay restitution unless the court determines from the totality of the circumstances that the purposes of the probation are not being served.

      (11) It is not a cause for revocation of probation that the probationer failed to apply for or accept employment at any workplace where there is a labor dispute in progress. As used in this subsection, “labor dispute” has the meaning for that term provided in ORS 662.010.

      (12)(a) If the court determines that a defendant has violated the terms of probation, the court shall collect a $25 fee from the defendant and may impose a fee for the costs of extraditing the defendant to this state for the probation violation proceeding if the defendant left the state in violation of the conditions of the defendant’s probation. The fees imposed under this subsection become part of the judgment and may be collected in the same manner as a fine.

      (b) Probation violation fees collected under this subsection in the circuit court shall be deposited by the clerk of the court in the General Fund. Extradition cost fees collected in the circuit court under this subsection shall be deposited by the clerk of the court in the Arrest and Return Account established by ORS 133.865. Fees collected in a justice court under this subsection shall be paid to the county treasurer. Fees collected in a municipal court under this subsection shall be paid to the city treasurer.

      (13) As used in this section, “attends,” “institution of higher education,” “works” and “carries on a vocation” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 163A.005. [Amended by 1965 c.346 §1; 1969 c.597 §125; 1977 c.371 §3; 1977 c.380 §2; 1981 c.671 §1; 1983 c.588 §2; 1985 c.818 §2; 1987 c.780 §3; 1989 c.790 §16; 1991 c.196 §1; 1991 c.630 §5; 1991 c.731 §1; 1993 c.14 §11; 1993 c.680 §16; 1997 c.313 §24; 1999 c.626 §11; amendments by 1999 c.626 §34 repealed by 2001 c.884 §1; 2001 c.726 §§1,2; 2001 c.884 §5; 2005 c.264 §3; 2005 c.558 §1; 2005 c.567 §8; 2005 c.576 §1a; 2005 c.642 §1; 2009 c.111 §1; 2009 c.204 §5; 2009 c.659 §§21,23; 2009 c.713 §11; 2011 c.595 §162; 2013 c.649 §24; 2015 c.198 §1; 2015 c.350 §2; 2017 c.21 §40; 2017 c.670 §3; 2017 c.689 §1; 2018 c.120 §10]

 

      137.542 Probation conditions related to medical use of cannabis. (1) As used in this section, “cannabinoid concentrate,” “cannabinoid extract,” “medical cannabinoid product,” “registry identification card” and “usable marijuana” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 475B.791.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 137.540, if a person who holds a registry identification card is sentenced to probation, supervision conditions related to the use of usable marijuana, medical cannabinoid products, cannabinoid concentrates or cannabinoid extracts must be imposed in the same manner as the court would impose supervision conditions related to prescription drugs. [2016 c.24 §51; 2019 c.292 §8]

 

      137.545 Period of probation; discharge from probation; proceedings in case of violation of conditions. (1) Subject to the limitations in ORS 137.010 and to rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989:

      (a) The period of probation shall be as the court determines and may, in the discretion of the court, be continued or extended.

      (b) The court may at any time discharge a person from probation.

      (2) At any time during the probation period, the court may issue a warrant and cause a defendant to be arrested for violating any of the conditions of probation. Any parole and probation officer, police officer or other officer with power of arrest may arrest a probationer without a warrant for violating any condition of probation, and a statement by the parole and probation officer or arresting officer setting forth that the probationer has, in the judgment of the parole and probation officer or arresting officer, violated the conditions of probation is sufficient warrant for the detention of the probationer in the county jail until the probationer can be brought before the court or until the parole and probation officer or supervisory personnel impose and the offender agrees to structured, intermediate sanctions in accordance with the rules adopted under ORS 137.595. Disposition shall be made during the first 36 hours in custody, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, unless later disposition is authorized by supervisory personnel. If authorized by supervisory personnel, the disposition shall take place in no more than five judicial days. If the offender does not consent to structured, intermediate sanctions imposed by the parole and probation officer or supervisory personnel in accordance with the rules adopted under ORS 137.595, the parole and probation officer, as soon as practicable, but within one judicial day, shall report the arrest or detention to the court that imposed the probation. The parole and probation officer shall promptly submit to the court a report showing in what manner the probationer has violated the conditions of probation.

      (3) Except for good cause shown or at the request of the probationer, the probationer shall be brought before a magistrate during the first 36 hours of custody, excluding holidays, Saturdays and Sundays. That magistrate, in the exercise of discretion, may order the probationer held pending a violation or revocation hearing or pending transfer to the jurisdiction of another court where the probation was imposed. In lieu of an order that the probationer be held, the magistrate may release the probationer upon the condition that the probationer appear in court at a later date for a probation violation or revocation hearing. If the probationer is being held on an out-of-county warrant, the magistrate may order the probationer released subject to an additional order to the probationer that the probationer report within seven calendar days to the court that imposed the probation.

      (4) When a probationer has been sentenced to probation in more than one county and the probationer is being held on an out-of-county warrant for a probation violation, the court may consider consolidation of some or all pending probation violation proceedings pursuant to rules made and orders issued by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court under ORS 137.547:

      (a) Upon the motion of the district attorney or defense counsel in the county in which the probationer is held; or

      (b) Upon the court’s own motion.

      (5)(a) For defendants sentenced for felonies committed prior to November 1, 1989, and for any misdemeanor, the court that imposed the probation, after summary hearing, may revoke the probation and:

      (A) If the execution of some other part of the sentence has been suspended, the court shall cause the rest of the sentence imposed to be executed.

      (B) If no other sentence has been imposed, the court may impose any other sentence which originally could have been imposed.

      (b) For defendants sentenced for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, the court that imposed the probationary sentence may revoke probation supervision and impose a sanction as provided by rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.

      (6) Except for good cause shown, if the revocation hearing is not conducted within 14 calendar days following the arrest or detention of the probationer, the probationer shall be released from custody.

      (7) A defendant who has been previously confined in the county jail as a condition of probation pursuant to ORS 137.540 or as part of a probationary sentence pursuant to the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission may be given credit for all time thus served in any order or judgment of confinement resulting from revocation of probation.

      (8) In the case of any defendant whose sentence has been suspended but who has not been sentenced to probation, the court may issue a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested and brought before the court at any time within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced. Thereupon the court, after summary hearing, may revoke the suspension of sentence and cause the sentence imposed to be executed.

      (9) If a probationer fails to appear or report to a court for further proceedings as required by an order under subsection (3) of this section, the failure to appear may be prosecuted in the county to which the probationer was ordered to appear or report.

      (10) The probationer may admit or deny the violation by being physically present at the hearing or by means of simultaneous electronic transmission as described in ORS 131.045.

      (11) The victim has the right:

      (a) Upon request made within the time period prescribed in the notice required by ORS 147.417, to be notified of any hearing before the court that may result in the revocation of the defendant’s probation for a felony or person Class A misdemeanor. The notification shall be provided by:

      (A) The district attorney if the defendant is not supervised by the supervisory authority or if the defendant is supervised by the supervisory authority and the district attorney initiates a request with the court for a probation violation or revocation hearing.

      (B) The supervisory authority if the defendant is supervised by the supervisory authority and the supervisory authority initiates a request with the court for a probation violation or revocation hearing.

      (b) To appear personally at the hearing.

      (c) If present, to reasonably express any views relevant to the issues before the court.

      (12) As used in this section:

      (a) “Person Class A misdemeanor” has the meaning given that term in the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.

      (b) “Supervisory authority” has the meaning given that term in ORS 144.087. [Formerly 137.550; 2003 c.577 §14; 2005 c.264 §4; 2005 c.566 §11; 2009 c.178 §28; 2009 c.660 §§20,32; 2011 c.596 §§1,5]

 

      137.547 Consolidation of probation violation proceedings; rules. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may make rules or issue orders under ORS 1.002 to establish procedures for the consolidation of probation violation proceedings pending against a probationer in multiple circuit courts.

      (2) Rules made or orders issued under this section:

      (a) Shall require the consent of the probationer to a consolidated probation violation proceeding and written waivers by the probationer as determined necessary or fair.

      (b) Shall require the approval of the judge of any responding court, the initiating court and any appropriate court being considered for a consolidated probation violation proceeding.

      (c) Shall require the approval of the district attorney of the county for any responding court, the initiating court and any court being considered as an appropriate court. [1999 c.614 §1; 2005 c.264 §5; 2013 c.155 §1]

      137.551 Revocation of probationary sentences; release dates; rules. (1) The State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision shall adopt rules to establish release dates for revocations of probationary sentences imposed for felonies committed before November 1, 1989.

      (2) To the extent permissible under law, the release dates for revocation of probationary sentences imposed for felonies committed before November 1, 1989, shall be set consistent with sanctions for probation revocations as provided by rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989. [1989 c.790 §18a]

      137.553 Use of citations for probation violations authorized. (1) In addition to any authority granted under ORS 137.545, a court may authorize the use of citations to direct its probationers who violate conditions of probation to appear before the court. The following apply to the use of citations under this subsection:

      (a) A court may authorize issuance of citations under this subsection only by officers who are permitted under ORS 137.545 to make an arrest without a warrant.

      (b) Nothing in this subsection limits the authority, under ORS 137.545, of a parole and probation officer, police officer or other officer to arrest for violation of conditions of probation even if the officer is authorized under this section to issue a citation.

      (c) A court may impose any conditions upon an authorization under this subsection that the court considers appropriate. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements that citation authority be sought on a case-by-case basis, provision for citation in all cases that meet certain conditions, allowance of citation for certain types of cases or designation of certain cases where citations shall not be used.

      (2) The cited probationer shall appear before the court at the time, date and court specified in the citation. If the probationer fails to appear at the time, date and court specified in the citation, the court may issue a warrant of arrest, upon the request of the supervisor of probation, or upon request of the district attorney, or upon the court’s own motion. [1987 c.761 §2; 2005 c.264 §6]

 

      137.557 Citation; procedure; contents. (1) If a citation is issued under ORS 137.553, the officer who issues the citation shall serve one copy of the citation to the probationer who is cited to appear and shall, as soon as practicable, file a duplicate copy with the court in which the probationer is cited to appear, along with proof of service.

      (c) A brief description of the asserted probation violation, the date, the time and the place at which the violation occurred, the date on which the citation was issued and the name of the officer who issued the citation.

      (d) The time, date and place at which the cited probationer is to appear in court.

      (e) A notice to the effect that:

      (A) The citation is not itself a motion to revoke probation, but that such a motion will be filed and a copy provided to the probationer when the probationer appears at court;

      (B) The probationer must appear in court at the time set in the citation; and

      (C) If the probationer fails to appear as directed, the court may immediately issue a warrant for the probationer’s arrest or the probationer may immediately be taken into custody by the officer responsible for supervising the probation. [1987 c.761 §3]

 

      137.560 Copies of certain judgments to be sent to Department of Corrections. Within 10 days following the issuing of any judgment of suspension of imposition or execution of sentence or of probation of any person convicted of a crime, or of the continuation, extension, modification or revocation of any such judgment, or of the discharge of such person, or the recommendation by the court to the Governor of the pardon of such person, provided such person is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, the court issuing such a judgment shall cause prompt delivery of a copy of the same to the Director of the Department of Corrections. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §271; 1979 c.75 §1; 1987 c.320 §39; 1991 c.111 §16; 1993 c.18 §23]

 

      137.570 Authority to transfer probationer from one agency to another; procedure. A court may transfer a person on probation under its jurisdiction from the supervision of one probation agency to that of another probation agency. Whenever a person sentenced to probation resides in or is to remove to a locality outside the jurisdiction of the court that sentenced the person to probation, the court may transfer the person to a parole and probation officer appointed to serve for the locality in which the person resides or to which the person is to remove:

      (1) If the parole and probation officer sends to the court desiring to make such transfer a written statement that the parole and probation officer will exercise supervision over the person.

      (2) If the statement is approved in writing by the judge of the court to which the parole and probation officer is attached. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §272; 1993 c.14 §13; 2005 c.264 §7]

 

      137.580 Effect of transfer of probationer from one agency to another. Whenever the transfer mentioned in ORS 137.570 is made, the court making it shall send to the probation agency to whose supervision the probationer is transferred a copy of all the records of the court as to the offense, criminal record and social history of the probationer. The probation agency shall report concerning the conduct and progress of the probationer to the court that sentenced the probationer to probation. Parole and probation officers or agencies shall have, with respect to persons transferred to their supervision from any other jurisdiction, all the powers and be subject to all the duties now imposed by law upon them in regard to probationers received on probation from courts in their own jurisdiction. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §273; 1993 c.14 §14; 2005 c.264 §8]

 

      137.590 Appointment of parole and probation officers and assistants; chief parole and probation officer. The judge or judges of any court of criminal jurisdiction, including municipal courts, may appoint, with the prior approval of the governing body of the county or city involved, and at pleasure remove, parole and probation officers and clerical assistants that may be necessary. Parole and probation officers appointed by the court shall be selected because of definite qualifications as to character, personality, ability and training. In courts where more than one parole and probation officer is appointed, one shall be designated chief parole and probation officer and shall have general supervision of the probation work of parole and probation officers appointed by and under the direction of the court. Appointments shall be in writing and entered on the records of the court. Parole and probation officers and clerical assistants appointed under this section are not state officers or employees, and their compensation and expenses shall not be paid by the state. [Amended by 1971 c.633 §12; 1973 c.836 §274; 1981 s.s. c.3 §38; 2005 c.264 §9]

 

      137.592 Policy regarding probation violations. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) To protect the public, the criminal justice system must compel compliance with the conditions of probation by responding to violations with swift, certain and fair punishments.

      (2) Decisions to incarcerate offenders in state prisons for violation of the conditions of probation must be made upon a reasonably systematic basis that will insure that available prison space is used to house those offenders who constitute a serious threat to the public, taking into consideration the availability of both prison space and local resources. [1993 c.680 §8]

 

      Note: 137.592 to 137.599 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 137 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      137.593 Duty of corrections agencies to impose structured, intermediate sanctions for probation violations. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, when a court suspends the imposition or execution of sentence and places a defendant on probation, or sentences a defendant to probation under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and orders a defendant placed under the supervision of the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency, the Department of Corrections or the county community corrections agency shall impose structured, intermediate sanctions for the violation of conditions of probation in accordance with rules adopted under ORS 137.595. Under no circumstances may the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency revoke probation.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 137.124 and 423.478 and any other provision of law, the sentencing judge shall retain authority:

      (a) To revoke probation and receive recommendations regarding revocation of probation from the supervising officer made in accordance with rules adopted under ORS 137.595;

      (b) To determine whether conditions of probation have been violated and to impose sanctions for the violations if the court, at the time of sentencing, states on the record that the court is retaining such authority;

      (c) To cause a probationer to be brought before the court for a hearing upon motion of the district attorney or the court’s own motion prior to the imposition of any structured, intermediate sanctions or within four judicial days after receiving notice that a structured, intermediate sanction has been imposed on the probationer pursuant to rules adopted under ORS 137.595 and to revoke probation or impose such other or additional sanctions or modify the conditions of probation as authorized by law; and

      (d) To impose and require an offender to serve a period of incarceration not to exceed 180 days as a sanction for revocation of probation.

      (3) In no case may the sentencing judge cause a probationer to be brought before the court for a hearing and revoke probation or impose other or additional sanctions after the probationer has completed a structured, intermediate sanction imposed by the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency pursuant to rules adopted under ORS 137.595. [1993 c.680 §10; 1995 c.423 §9a]

 

      Note: See note under 137.592.

 

      137.595 Establishing system of sanctions; rules. (1) The Department of Corrections shall adopt rules to carry out the purposes of chapter 680, Oregon Laws 1993, by establishing a system of structured, intermediate probation violation sanctions that may be imposed by the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency, taking into consideration the severity of the violation behavior, the prior violation history, the severity of the underlying criminal conviction, the criminal history of the offender, protection of the community, deterrence, the effective capacity of the state prisons and the availability of appropriate local sanctions including, but not limited to, jail, community service work, house arrest, electronic surveillance, restitution centers, work release centers, day reporting centers or other local sanctions.

      (2) Rules adopted by the Department of Corrections under this section shall establish:

      (a) A system of structured, intermediate probation violation sanctions that may be imposed by the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency on a probationer who waives in writing a probation violation hearing, admits or affirmatively chooses not to contest the violations alleged in a probation violation report and consents to the sanctions;

      (b) Procedures to provide a probationer with written notice of the probationer’s right to a hearing before the court to determine whether the probationer violated the conditions of probation alleged in a probation violation report, and if so, whether to continue the probationer on probation subject to the same or modified conditions, or order sanctions for any violations and the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing if the probationer is financially eligible;

      (c) Procedures for a probationer to waive in writing a probation violation hearing, admit or not contest the violations alleged in the probation violation report and consent to the imposition of structured, intermediate sanctions by the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency;

      (e) The level and type of violation behavior warranting a recommendation to the court that probation be revoked;

      (f) Procedures for notifying district attorneys and the courts of probation violations admitted by probationers and the sanctions imposed by the Department of Corrections or county community corrections agencies; and

      (g) Such other policies or procedures as are necessary to carry out the purposes of chapter 680, Oregon Laws 1993.

      (3) Jail confinement imposed as a custodial sanction by the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency pursuant to rules adopted under this section may not exceed 60 days per violation report. The total number of days of jail confinement for all violation reports per conviction may not exceed the maximum number of available jail custody units under rules adopted by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.

      (4) Nonjail confinement imposed as a custodial sanction by the Department of Corrections or a county community corrections agency pursuant to rules adopted under this section may not exceed the maximum number of available nonjail custody units under rules adopted by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.
