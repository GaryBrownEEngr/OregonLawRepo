[1953 c.191 §1; 1973 c.836 §287; 1987 c.320 §50; 1989 c.790 §27]

 

      144.079 Determination of total term of certain consecutive sentences of imprisonment; summing of sentences; exceptions. (1)(a) If a prisoner is sentenced to terms of imprisonment that are consecutive to one another and result from crimes committed during the period before the prisoner’s first initial parole hearing, or if a prisoner is sentenced to terms of imprisonment that are consecutive to one another and result from crimes committed during the period between any two initial parole hearings, the total term resulting from the crimes committed during each such separate period shall be determined by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision as follows, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, and the total terms so determined shall then be summed as provided in ORS 144.783 (1):

      (A) First, the board shall establish the appropriate range for the felony determined by the board, according to its rules, to be the most serious of the felonies committed during the period. If two or more felonies are determined to be equally the most serious, the board shall establish the appropriate range under this paragraph only for one of those felonies.

      (B) Second, the board shall establish a range for each of the remaining felonies committed during the same period. For purposes of establishing the ranges for the remaining felonies under this paragraph, the board shall not consider prior criminal history.

      (C) Third, the board shall determine the total range applicable in the offender’s case for crimes committed during the same period by summing the ranges established under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph with the range established under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and shall determine an appropriate term within that range.

      (D) Finally, the board shall vary the term determined under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph according to rules established under ORS 144.785 (1), if the board finds aggravating or mitigating factors in the case. The board shall consider as an aggravating factor the fact that the prisoner has been sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment.

      (b) Whenever a prisoner is committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections for a crime that was committed during a period already considered at an initial parole hearing and upon a sentence consecutive to any sentence imposed for crimes committed during that period, the board shall conduct a hearing to consider the previously unconsidered crime. The hearing shall be a hearing supplemental to the original initial hearing concerning crimes committed during the period. Time limitations and other procedural provisions applicable to initial hearings shall apply to a supplemental hearing under this subsection. Upon conclusion of the supplemental hearing, the board shall redetermine the appropriate total term for the period. The redetermination shall be conducted de novo under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) The method established by this section for determining, where applicable, the total term resulting from the summing of consecutive sentences shall apply only if none of the crimes involved is:

      (a) Murder, as defined in ORS 163.115 or any aggravated form thereof;

      (b) Assault in the first degree, as defined in ORS 163.185;

      (c) Kidnapping in the first degree, as defined in ORS 163.235;

      (d) Rape in the first degree, as defined in ORS 163.375;

      (e) Sodomy in the first degree, as defined in ORS 163.405;

      (f) Unlawful sexual penetration, as defined in ORS 163.411;

      (h) Treason, as defined in ORS 166.005.

      (3) The duration of imprisonment pursuant to consecutive sentences may be less than the sum of the terms under subsection (1) of this section if the board finds, by affirmative vote of a majority of three board members or, if the chairperson requires all voting members to participate, a majority of all voting members, that consecutive sentences are not appropriate penalties for the criminal offenses involved and that the combined terms of imprisonment are not necessary to protect community security.

      (4) The board shall use the method set forth in subsections (1) to (3) of this section to determine the parole release date for any person serving a sentence in the custody of the Department of Corrections for crimes committed before or after July 11, 1987. [1987 c.634 §§4,7; 1989 c.641 §1; 1991 c.126 §4; 1991 c.386 §7; 2015 c.820 §42]

If the board is not satisfied that the waiver was made knowingly or intelligently or if it believes more information is necessary before making its decision, it may order a hearing.

      (2) In setting the initial parole release date for a prisoner pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the board shall apply the appropriate range established pursuant to ORS 144.780. Variations from the range shall be in accordance with ORS 144.785.

      (3) In setting the initial parole release date for a prisoner pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the board shall consider the presentence investigation report specified in ORS 144.791 or, if no such report has been prepared, a report of similar content prepared by the Department of Corrections.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, in the case of a prisoner whose offense included particularly violent or otherwise dangerous criminal conduct or whose offense was preceded by two or more convictions for a Class A or Class B felony or whose record includes a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis of severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, the board may choose not to set a parole date.

      (5) After the expiration of six months after the admission of the prisoner to any Department of Corrections institution, the board may defer setting the initial parole release date for the prisoner for a period not to exceed 90 additional days pending receipt of psychiatric or psychological reports, criminal records or other information essential to formulating the release decision.

      (6) When the board has set the initial parole release date for a prisoner, it shall inform the sentencing court of the date.

(1) After the initial parole release date has been set under ORS 144.120 and after a minimum period of time established by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision under subsection (2)(a) of this section, the prisoner may request that the parole release date be reset to an earlier date. The board may grant the request upon a determination by the board that continued incarceration is cruel and inhumane and that resetting the release date to an earlier date is not incompatible with the best interests of the prisoner and society and that the prisoner:

      (a) Has demonstrated an extended course of conduct indicating outstanding reformation;

      (b) Suffers from a severe medical condition including terminal illness; or

      (c) Is elderly and is permanently incapacitated in such a manner that the prisoner is unable to move from place to place without the assistance of another person.

      (2) The Advisory Commission on Prison Terms and Parole Standards may propose to the board and the board shall adopt rules:

      (a) Establishing minimum periods of time to be served by prisoners before application may be made for a reset of release date under subsection (1) of this section;

      (b) Detailing the criteria set forth under subsection (1) of this section for the resetting of a parole release date; and

      (c) Establishing criteria for parole release plans for prisoners released under this section that, at a minimum, must ensure appropriate supervision and services for the person released.

      (3) The provisions of subsection (1)(b) of this section apply to prisoners sentenced in accordance with ORS 161.610.

      (4) The provisions of this section do not apply to prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole under ORS 138.052 or 163.150.

      (5) If the victim has requested notification of the release of the prisoner, the board shall notify the victim as described in ORS 144.750 (3) prior to any hearing or administrative decision under this section.

      144.125 Review of parole plan, psychological reports and conduct prior to release; release postponement; elements of parole plan; Department of Corrections assistance; rules. (1) Prior to the scheduled release of any prisoner on parole and prior to release rescheduled under this section, the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision may upon request of the Department of Corrections or on its own initiative interview the prisoner to review the prisoner’s parole plan and psychiatric or psychological report, if any, and the record of the prisoner’s conduct during confinement. To accommodate such review by the board, the Department of Corrections shall provide to the board any psychiatric or psychological reports held by the department regarding the prisoner. However, if the psychiatrist or psychologist who prepared any report or any treating psychiatrist or psychologist determines that disclosure to the prisoner of the contents of the report would be detrimental to the prisoner’s mental or emotional health, the psychiatrist or psychologist may indorse upon the report a recommendation that it not be disclosed to the prisoner. The department may withhold from the board any report so indorsed.

      (2) The board shall postpone a prisoner’s scheduled release date if it finds, after a hearing, that the prisoner engaged in serious misconduct during confinement. The board shall adopt rules defining serious misconduct and specifying periods of postponement for such misconduct.

      (3)(a) If the board finds the prisoner has a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, the board may order the postponement of the scheduled parole release until a specified future date. The board may not postpone a prisoner’s scheduled release date to a date that is less than two years, or more than 10 years, from the date of the hearing, unless the prisoner would be held beyond the maximum sentence. The board shall determine the scheduled release date, and the prisoner may petition for interim review, in accordance with ORS 144.280.

      (b) If the board finds the prisoner has a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, but also finds that the prisoner can be adequately controlled with supervision and mental health treatment and that the necessary supervision and treatment are available, the board may order the prisoner released on parole subject to conditions that are in the best interests of community safety and the prisoner’s welfare.

      (4) Each prisoner shall furnish the board with a parole plan prior to the scheduled release of the prisoner on parole. The board shall adopt rules specifying the elements of an adequate parole plan and may defer release of the prisoner for not more than three months if it finds that the parole plan is inadequate. The Department of Corrections shall assist prisoners in preparing parole plans. [1977 c.372 §6; 1981 c.426 §2; 1987 c.320 §53; 1989 c.790 §68; 1993 c.334 §1; 1999 c.141 §1; 2009 c.660 §3]

      (a) Suffering from a severe medical condition including terminal illness; or

      (b) Elderly and permanently incapacitated in such a manner that the prisoner is unable to move from place to place without the assistance of another person.

The report shall also contain any other information which the examining psychiatrist or psychologist believes will aid the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision in determining whether the examined person is eligible for release. The report shall also state the progress or changes in the condition of the examined person as well as any recommendations for treatment. A certified copy of the report shall be sent to the convicted person, to the convicted person’s attorney and to the executive officer of the Department of Corrections institution in which the convicted person is confined. [1955 c.636 §4; 1961 c.424 §5; 1969 c.597 §114; 1971 c.743 §338; 1973 c.836 §290; 1981 c.644 §4; 1987 c.320 §57; 1989 c.790 §78; 1991 c.318 §1; 1993 c.334 §2; 2005 c.481 §1; 2007 c.70 §36]

 

      144.228 Periodic parole consideration hearings for dangerous offenders; setting of parole date; information to be considered. (1)(a) Within six months after commitment to the custody of the Department of Corrections of any person sentenced under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 as a dangerous offender, the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision shall set a date for a parole consideration hearing instead of an initial release date as otherwise required under ORS 144.120 and 144.125. The parole consideration hearing date shall be the time the prisoner would otherwise be eligible for parole under the board’s rules.

      (b)(A) At the parole consideration hearing, the prisoner shall be given a release date in accordance with the rules of the board if the board finds the prisoner no longer dangerous or finds that the prisoner remains dangerous but can be adequately controlled with supervision and mental health treatment and that the necessary resources for supervision and treatment are available to the prisoner. If the board is unable to make such findings, a review will be conducted no less than two years, and no more than 10 years, from the date of the previous review, until the board is able to make such findings, at which time release on parole shall be ordered if the prisoner is otherwise eligible under the rules.

      (B) The board may not grant the prisoner a review hearing that is more than two years from the date of the previous hearing unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that the prisoner would be granted a release date before the date of the subsequent hearing.

      (C) The board shall determine the date of the review hearing in accordance with rules adopted by the board. Rules adopted under this subparagraph must be based on the foundation principles of criminal law described in section 15, Article I of the Oregon Constitution.

      (D) In no event shall the prisoner be held beyond the maximum sentence less good time credits imposed by the court.

      (c) Nothing in this section precludes a prisoner from submitting a request for a parole consideration hearing prior to the earliest time the prisoner is eligible for parole. If the board grants a prisoner a review hearing that is more than two years from the date of the previous hearing, the prisoner may submit a request for an interim review hearing not earlier than the date that is two years from the date of the previous hearing and at intervals of not less than two years thereafter. Should the board find, based upon a request described in this paragraph, that there is a reasonable cause to believe that the prisoner is no longer dangerous or that necessary supervision and treatment are available based upon the information provided in the request, it shall conduct a review as soon as is reasonably convenient.

      (d) When the board grants a prisoner a review hearing that is more than two years from the date of the previous hearing and when the board denies a petition for an interim hearing, the board shall issue a final order. The order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings of fact shall consist of a concise statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings as to each contested issue of fact and as to each ultimate fact required to support the board’s order. Unless the prisoner bears the burden of persuasion, the order shall include findings necessary to deny the prisoner a release date for any period of time when the prisoner would be presumed to be eligible for a release date.

      (2) For the parole consideration hearing, the board shall cause to be brought before it and consider all information regarding such person. The information shall include:

      (a) The written report of the examining psychiatrist or psychologist which shall contain all the facts necessary to assist the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision in making its determination. The report of the examining psychiatrist or psychologist shall be made within two months of the date of its consideration; and

      (b) A written report to be made by the executive officer of the Department of Corrections institution in which the person has been confined. The executive officer’s report shall contain:

      (A) A detailed account of the person’s conduct while confined, all infractions of rules and discipline, all punishment meted out to the person and the circumstances connected therewith, as well as the extent to which the person has responded to the efforts made in the institution to improve the person’s mental and moral condition.

      (B) A statement as to the person’s present attitude toward society, toward the sentencing judge, toward the prosecuting district attorney, toward the arresting police officer and toward the person’s previous criminal career.

      (C) The work and program record of the person while in or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections. The program history shall include a summary of any psychological or substance abuse treatment and other activities that will assist the board in understanding the psychological adjustment and social skills and habits of the person and that will assist the board in determining the likelihood for successful community reentry.

(1) A person sentenced under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 as a dangerous offender for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, shall be considered for release to post-prison supervision. The offender is eligible for release to post-prison supervision after having served the required incarceration term established under ORS 161.737.

      (2) The State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision shall hold a release hearing no later than 10 days prior to the date on which the offender becomes eligible for release on post-prison supervision as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The dangerous offender’s eligibility for and release to post-prison supervision shall be determined in a manner consistent with the procedures and criteria required by ORS 144.228 for the parole determination process applicable to dangerous offenders sentenced for crimes committed prior to November 1, 1989.

      (4) An offender released under this section shall serve the remainder of the sentence term imposed under ORS 161.725, 161.735 and 161.737 on post-prison supervision, however:

      (a) Notwithstanding ORS 137.010 or the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision may sanction an offender to the supervision of the local authority for a maximum period of 180 days for any supervision violation. The sanction may be imposed repeatedly during the term of post-prison supervision for subsequent supervision violations.

      (b) After release under this section, the board may at any time return the offender to prison and require the offender to submit to a psychiatric or psychological examination as provided for in ORS 144.226. If the board finds that the offender’s dangerousness has returned and cannot be adequately controlled with supervision and mental and physical health treatment, or that resources for supervision and treatment are not available to the offender, the board may defer the offender’s release from prison for an indefinite period of time. An offender returned to prison under this paragraph is entitled to periodic reviews for possible release to post-prison supervision as provided by subsection (3) of this section.

(1) When the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision has set a date on which a prisoner is to be released upon parole, the prisoner shall be released on that date unless the prisoner on that date remains subject to an unexpired minimum term during which the prisoner is not eligible for parole, in which case the prisoner shall not be released until the expiration of the minimum term.

      (2) When the board has not set a date on which a prisoner is to be released upon parole, the prisoner shall be released upon a date six months prior to the expiration of the prisoner’s term as computed under ORS 421.120 and 421.122 unless the prisoner on that date remains subject to an unexpired minimum term during which the prisoner is not eligible for parole, in which case the prisoner shall not be released until the expiration of the minimum term.

      (I) Agreement to consent to a search of the person or the vehicle or residence of the person upon the request of a representative of the board if the representative has reasonable grounds to believe that evidence of a violation of a condition of parole will be found.

      (J) Participation in random polygraph examinations to obtain information for risk management and treatment. The person is responsible for paying the expenses of the examinations. The results of a polygraph examination under this subparagraph may not be used in evidence in a hearing to prove a violation of parole.

As soon as practicable, the supervising officer of a person subject to the requirements of this subparagraph shall review the person’s living arrangement with the person’s sex offender treatment provider to ensure that the arrangement supports the goals of offender rehabilitation and community safety.

      (B) A victim may request imposition of the special condition of parole described in this paragraph at the time of sentencing in person or through the prosecuting attorney. A victim’s request may be included in the judgment document.

      (5) It is not a cause for revocation of parole that the person paroled failed to apply for or accept employment at a workplace where there is a labor dispute in progress.

      (6)(a) When the board grants a person parole from the custody of the Department of Corrections, the board shall order, as a condition of parole, that the person reside for the first six months in the county that last supervised the person, if the person was on active supervision as an adult for a felony at the time of the offense that resulted in the imprisonment.

      (b) If the person paroled was not on active supervision as an adult for a felony at the time of the offense that resulted in the imprisonment, the board shall order as a condition of parole that the person reside for the first six months in the county where the person resided at the time of the offense that resulted in the imprisonment.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection:

      (A) The board shall determine the county where the person resided at the time of the offense by examining records such as:

      (i) An Oregon driver license, regardless of its validity;

      (ii) Records maintained by the Department of Revenue;

      (iii) Records maintained by the Department of State Police;

      (iv) Records maintained by the Department of Human Services;

      (vi) Records maintained by the Oregon Health Authority.

      (B) If the person did not have an identifiable address at the time of the offense, or the address cannot be determined, the person is considered to have resided in the county where the offense occurred.

      (C) If the person is serving multiple sentences, the county of residence is determined according to the date of the last arrest resulting in a conviction.

      (D) If the person is being rereleased after revocation of parole, the county of residence shall be determined according to the date of the arrest resulting in a conviction of the underlying offense.

      (E) In determining the person’s county of residence, a conviction for an offense that the inmate committed while incarcerated in a state correctional institution may not be considered.

      (d) Upon motion of the board, the supervisory authority, the person paroled, a victim or a district attorney, the board may waive the residency condition under paragraph (b) of this subsection only after making a finding that one of the following conditions has been met:

      (A) The person provides proof of employment with no set ending date in a county other than the county of residence determined under paragraph (c) of this section;

      (B) The person is found to pose a significant danger to a victim of the person’s crime residing in the county of residence, or a victim or victim’s family residing in the county of residence is found to pose a significant danger to the person;

      (C) The person has a spouse or biological or adoptive family residing in a county other than the county of residence who will be materially significant in aiding in the rehabilitation of the person and in the success of the parole;

      (D) As another condition of parole, the person is required to participate in a treatment program that is not available or located in the county of residence;

      (E) The person requests to be paroled to another state; or

      (F) The board finds other good cause for the waiver.

      (7) As used in this section:

      (a) “Attends,” “carries on a vocation,” “institution of higher education” and “works” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 163A.005.

      (b)(A) “Dwelling” has the meaning given that term in ORS 469B.100.

      (B) “Dwelling” does not mean a residential treatment facility or a halfway house.

      (c) “Halfway house” means a residential facility that provides rehabilitative care and treatment for sex offenders.

      (d) “Labor dispute” has the meaning given that term in ORS 662.010.

Whenever the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision orders the release on parole of an inmate who has been ordered to pay compensatory fines pursuant to ORS 137.101 or to make restitution pursuant to ORS 137.106, but with respect to whom payment of all or a portion of the fine or restitution was suspended until the release of the inmate from imprisonment, the board may establish a schedule by which payment of the compensatory fine or restitution shall be resumed. In fixing the schedule and supervising the paroled inmate’s performance thereunder, the board shall consider the factors specified in ORS 137.106 (4). The board shall provide to the sentencing court a copy of the schedule and any modifications thereof. [1977 c.271 §6; 1989 c.46 §1; 2003 c.670 §2]

TERMINATION OF PAROLE

 

      144.315 Evidence admissible before board; procedures. Evidence may be received in proceedings conducted by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision even though inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure and the board shall establish procedures to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and evidence and method of taking and furnishing the same in order to afford the inmate a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing. The procedures shall include the means of determining good cause not to allow confrontation of witnesses or disclosure of the identity of informants who would be subject to risk of harm if their identity is disclosed. [1973 c.694 §22]

 

      144.317 Appointment of attorneys; payment. (1) The State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision shall have the power to appoint attorneys, at board expense, to represent indigent parolees and offenders on post-prison supervision if the request and determination provided in ORS 144.343 (3)(f) have been made.

      (2) Upon completion of the parole or post-prison supervision revocation hearing, the board shall determine whether the person for whom counsel was appointed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is able to pay a portion of the attorney fees to be paid by the board. In determining whether the person is able to pay such portion, the board shall take into account the other financial obligations of the person, including any existing fines or orders to make restitution. If the board determines that the person is able to pay such portion, the board may order, as a condition of parole or post-prison supervision, that the person pay the portion to the appropriate officer of the state.

      144.331 Suspension of parole or post-prison supervision; custody of violator; revocation hearing before suspension. (1) The State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision may suspend the parole or post-prison supervision of any person under its jurisdiction upon being informed and having reasonable grounds to believe that the person has violated the conditions of parole or post-prison supervision and may order the arrest and detention of such person. The written order of the board is sufficient warrant for any law enforcement officer to take into custody such person. A sheriff, municipal police officer, constable, parole and probation officer, prison official or other peace officer shall execute the order.

      (2) The board or its designated representative may proceed to hearing as provided in ORS 144.343 without first suspending the parole or post-prison supervision or ordering the arrest and detention of any person under its jurisdiction upon being informed and having reasonable grounds to believe that the person under its jurisdiction has violated a condition of parole and that revocation of parole may be warranted or that the person under its jurisdiction has violated a condition of post-prison supervision and that incarceration for the violation may be warranted.

      (3) During the pendency of any post-prison supervision violation proceedings, the period of post-prison supervision is stayed and the board has jurisdiction over the offender until the proceedings are resolved. [1973 c.694 §9 (enacted in lieu of 144.330); 1977 c.375 §1; 1991 c.108 §1; 2005 c.264 §13]

      144.334 Use of citations for parole or post-prison supervision violators; conditions; appearance. (1) In addition to the authority granted under ORS 144.331 and 144.370, the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision may authorize the use of citations to direct alleged parole or post-prison supervision violators to appear before the board or its designated representative. The following apply to the use of citations under this section:

      (a) The board may authorize issuance of citations only by officers who are permitted under ORS 144.350 to arrest and detain.

      (b) Nothing in this subsection limits the authority, under ORS 144.350, of a supervising officer or other officer to arrest an alleged parole or post-prison supervision violator.

      (2) The board may impose any conditions upon an authorization under this section that the board considers appropriate. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements that citation authority be sought on a case-by-case basis, citation authority be granted in all cases that meet certain conditions, citation authority be allowed for certain types of cases or designation of certain cases be made where citations shall not be used.

      (3) The cited offender shall appear before the board or its designated representative at the time, date and place specified in the citation. If the offender fails to appear as required, the board may issue a suspend and detain order upon its own motion or upon request of the supervising officer. [1991 c.836 §4]

      144.335 Appeal from order of board to Court of Appeals; appointment of master; costs. (1) A person over whom the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision exercises its jurisdiction may seek judicial review of a final order of the board as provided in this section if:

      (a) The person is adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the board; and

      (b) The person has exhausted administrative review as provided by board rule.

      (2) A person requesting administrative review shall provide the person’s current mailing address in the request. The board shall mail its order disposing of the request for administrative review to the person at that address, unless the person has otherwise notified the board in writing of a change of address.

      (3) The order of the board need not be in any special form, and the order is sufficient for purposes of judicial review if it appears that the board acted within the scope of the board’s authority. The Court of Appeals may affirm, reverse or remand the order on the same basis as provided in ORS 183.482 (8). The filing of the petition shall not stay the board’s order, but the board may do so, or the court may order a stay upon application on such terms as it deems proper.

      (4) If a person described in subsection (1) of this section seeks judicial review of a final order of the board, the person shall file a petition for judicial review with the Court of Appeals within 60 days after the date the board mails the order disposing of the person’s request for administrative review. The person shall serve a copy of the petition for judicial review on the board.

      (5) Within 30 days after being served with a copy of the petition for judicial review, or such further time as the court may allow, the board shall:

      (a) Submit to the court the record of the proceeding or, if the petitioner agrees, a shortened record; and

      (b) Deliver a copy of the record to the petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney, if the petitioner is represented by an attorney.

      (6) At any time after submission of the petitioner’s brief, the court, on its own motion or on motion of the board, without submission of the board’s brief and without oral argument, may summarily affirm the board’s order if the court determines that the judicial review does not present a substantial question of law. Notwithstanding ORS 2.570, the Chief Judge, or other judge of the Court of Appeals designated by the Chief Judge, may, on behalf of the Court of Appeals, deny or, if the petitioner does not oppose the motion, grant the board’s motion for summary affirmance. A summary affirmance under this subsection constitutes a decision on the merits of the petitioner’s issues on judicial review.

      (7) During the pendency of judicial review of an order, if the board withdraws the order for the purpose of reconsideration and thereafter issues an order on reconsideration, and the petitioner wishes to proceed with the judicial review, the petitioner need not seek administrative review of the order on reconsideration and need not file a new petition for judicial review. The petitioner shall file, within a time established by the court, a notice of intent to proceed with judicial review.

      (8) In the case of disputed allegations of irregularities in procedure before the board not shown in the record that, if proved, would warrant reversal or remand, the Court of Appeals may refer the allegations to a master appointed by the court to take evidence and make findings of fact upon them.

      (9) If the court determines that a brief filed by the petitioner, when liberally construed, fails to state a colorable claim for review, the court may order the petitioner to pay, in addition to the board’s recoverable costs, attorney fees incurred by the board not to exceed $100. If the petitioner moves to dismiss the petition prior to a summary affirmance described in subsection (6) of this section, the court may not award costs or attorney fees to the board.

      (10) Upon request by the board, the Department of Corrections may draw from or charge to the petitioner’s trust account and pay to the board the amount of any costs or attorney fees awarded to the board by the court in any judicial review under this section.

      (11) If the petitioner prevails on judicial review and is represented by an attorney funded by the Public Defense Services Commission, any recoverable costs shall be paid to the commission. [1973 c.694 §24; 1983 c.740 §18; 1989 c.790 §41; 1993 c.402 §1; 1995 c.108 §3; 1999 c.141 §3; 1999 c.618 §1; 2001 c.661 §1; 2003 c.352 §1; 2007 c.411 §1]

 

      144.337 Public Defense Services Commission to provide counsel for eligible petitioners. (1) Pursuant to ORS 151.216 and 151.219, the Public Defense Services Commission shall provide for the representation of financially eligible persons petitioning for review under ORS 144.335.

      (2) If the commission determines that a person petitioning for review under ORS 144.335 is not financially eligible for appointed counsel at state expense, the commission shall promptly notify the person of the determination and of the person’s right to request review of the determination by the Court of Appeals. The person may request review of the commission’s determination by filing a motion in the Court of Appeals no later than 60 days after the date of the commission’s notice.

      (3) The determination of the Court of Appeals under subsection (2) of this section as to whether the person is financially eligible is final. [1973 c.694 §25; 2001 c.962 §31; 2003 c.420 §1]

 

      144.340 Power to retake and return violators of parole and post-prison supervision. (1) The Department of Corrections, in accordance with the rules and regulations or directions of the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision or the Governor, as the case may be, may cause to have retaken and returned persons to the institution, or to the supervision of the local supervisory authority, whether in or out of the state, whenever they have violated the conditions of their parole or post-prison supervision.

      (2)(a) Persons retaken and returned to this state from outside the state upon order or warrant of the Department of Corrections, the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision or the Governor, for violation of conditions of parole or post-prison supervision, shall be detained in a Department of Corrections facility or a local correctional facility pending any hearing concerning the alleged violation and ultimate disposition by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.

      (b) Persons retaken and returned to this state from outside the state upon order or warrant of a local supervisory authority for violation of conditions of post-prison supervision may be detained in a local correctional facility pending a hearing concerning the alleged violation and ultimate disposition by the local supervisory authority.

      (3) Persons retaken and returned to this state from outside the state under this section are liable for the costs and expenses of retaking and returning the person upon:

      (a) A finding by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision of present or future ability to pay; and

      (b) Order of the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision. [Amended by 1969 c.597 §116; 1973 c.836 §297; 1987 c.320 §62; 1989 c.790 §42; 1991 c.228 §1; 1995 c.423 §19; 1999 c.120 §1]

 

      144.341 Procedure upon arrest of violator. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, when the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision or the Department of Corrections orders the arrest and detention of an offender under ORS 144.331 or 144.350, the offender arrested shall be held in a county jail for no more than 15 days.

      (2) An offender may be held longer than 15 days:

      (a) If the offender is being held for a combination of probation and parole violation;

      (b) If the offender is being held pending prosecution on new criminal charges; or

      (c) Pursuant to an agreement with a local jail authority. [1993 c.680 §32]

 

      Note: 144.341 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 144 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      144.343 Hearing required on revocation; procedure. (1) When the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision or its designated representative has been informed and has reasonable grounds to believe that a person under its jurisdiction has violated a condition of parole and that revocation of parole may be warranted, the board or its designated representative shall conduct a hearing as promptly as convenient to determine whether there is probable cause to believe a violation of one or more of the conditions of parole has occurred and also conduct a parole violation hearing if necessary. Evidence received and the order of the court at a preliminary hearing under ORS 135.070 to 135.225 may be used by the board to determine the existence of probable cause. A waiver by the defendant of any preliminary hearing shall also constitute a waiver of probable cause hearing by the board. The location of the hearing shall be reasonably near the place of the alleged violation or the place of confinement.

      (2) The board may:

      (a) Reinstate or continue the alleged violator on parole subject to the same or modified conditions of parole;

      (b) Revoke parole and require that the parole violator serve the remaining balance of the sentence as provided by law;

      (c) Impose sanctions as provided in ORS 144.106; or

      (d) Delegate the authority, in whole or in part, granted by this subsection to its designated representative as provided by rule.

      (3) Within a reasonable time prior to the hearing, the board or its designated representative shall provide the parolee with written notice which shall contain the following information:

      (a) A concise written statement of the suspected violations and the evidence which forms the basis of the alleged violations.

      (b) The parolee’s right to a hearing and the time, place and purpose of the hearing.

      (c) The names of persons who have given adverse information upon which the alleged violations are based and the right of the parolee to have such persons present at the hearing for the purposes of confrontation and cross-examination unless it has been determined that there is good cause for not allowing confrontation.

      (B) Even if the violation is a matter of public record or is uncontested, there are substantial reasons which justify or mitigate the violation and make revocation inappropriate and that the reasons are complex or otherwise difficult to develop or present; or

      (C) The parolee, in doubtful cases, appears to be incapable of speaking effectively on the parolee’s own behalf.

      (g) That the hearing is being held to determine:

      (b) To confront witnesses against the parolee unless it has been determined that there is good cause not to allow confrontation;

      (d) To be represented by counsel and, if indigent, to have counsel provided at board expense if the request and determination provided in subsection (3)(f) of this section have been made.

      (6)(a) The parolee may admit or deny the violation without being physically present at the hearing if the parolee appears before the board or its designee by means of simultaneous television transmission allowing the board to observe and communicate with the parolee and the parolee to observe and communicate with the board or by telephonic communication allowing the board to communicate with the parolee and the parolee to communicate with the board.

SEIZURE OF PROPERTY BY PAROLE AND PROBATION OFFICERS

 

      144.404 Department of Corrections authority to receive, hold and dispose of property. The Department of Corrections is authorized to receive, hold and dispose of contraband, things otherwise criminally possessed or possessed in violation of parole or post-prison supervision conditions, or unclaimed goods seized by a parole and probation officer during the arrest of a suspected parole or post-prison supervision violator or during the search of the suspected violator or of the premises, vehicle or other property of the suspected violator. [1991 c.286 §1]

 

      Note: 144.404 to 144.409 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 144 by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      144.405 Duty of officer upon seizure; disposition of property if no claim to rightful possession is established. (1) Upon seizing property in execution of duty, a parole and probation officer shall, as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, make a written list of the things seized and furnish a copy to the suspected parole or post-prison supervision violator. The list shall contain a notice informing the person of the right to contest the seizure by filing a petition and shall contain such other information as the Department of Corrections, by rule, may require.

      (2) If no claim of rightful possession has been established under ORS 144.405 to 144.409, the Department of Corrections may order the sale, destruction or other disposition of the things seized. The department may enter into agreements with other state and local officials responsible under applicable laws for selling, destroying or otherwise disposing of contraband or unclaimed goods in official custody for ultimate disposition of the things seized. The clear proceeds, if any, generated by the disposition of things seized shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the General Fund.

      (3) If things seized by a parole and probation officer in execution of duty are not needed for evidentiary purposes, and if a person having a rightful claim establishes identity and right to possession to the satisfaction of the Department of Corrections, the department may summarily return the things seized to their rightful possessor.

      (4) If the things seized are contraband, the fruits of crime or things otherwise criminally possessed, the Department of Corrections may:

      (a) Relinquish custody of the things seized to appropriate law enforcement officials for disposition; or

      (b) Hold and safeguard the things seized until directed by appropriate law enforcement officials that the things in question are no longer needed for purposes of criminal prosecution. [1991 c.286 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 144.404.

 

      144.406 Petition for return of things seized. (1) Within 30 days after actual notice of any seizure, or at such later date as the Department of Corrections in its discretion may allow:

      (a) An individual from whose person, property or premises things have been seized may petition the department to return the things seized to the person or premises from which they were seized.

      (b) Any other person asserting a claim to rightful possession of the things seized may petition the department to restore the things seized to the person.

      (2) Petitions for return or restoration of things seized shall be served on the manager of the local field services office having supervision over the suspected parole or post-prison supervision violator.

      (3) Service of a petition for the return or restoration of things seized shall be made by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. [1991 c.286 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 144.404.

 

      144.407 Grounds for valid claim to rightful possession. A petition for the return or restoration of things seized shall be based on the ground that the petitioner has a valid claim to rightful possession because:

      (1) The things had been stolen or otherwise converted and the petitioner is the owner or rightful possessor;

      (2) The things seized were not, in fact, subject to seizure in connection with the suspected parole or post-prison supervision violation;

      (3) Although the things seized were subject to seizure in connection with a suspected parole or post-prison supervision violation, the petitioner is or will be entitled to their return or restoration upon a determination by the Department of Corrections or the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision that they are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes, do not constitute a parole or post-prison supervision violation or may be lawfully possessed by the petitioner; or

      (4) The suspected parole or post-prison supervision violator and the department have stipulated that the things seized may be returned to the petitioner. [1991 c.286 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 144.404.

 

      144.408 Hearing on petition. (1) If, upon consideration of a petition for return or restoration of things seized, it appears to the Department of Corrections that the things should be returned or restored, but there is substantial question whether they should be returned to the person from whose possession they were seized or to some other person, or a substantial question among several claimants to rightful possession, the department may set a further hearing, assuring that all persons with a possible possessory interest in the things in question receive due notice and an opportunity to be heard. Upon completion of the hearing, the department shall enter an order for the return or restoration of the things seized.

      (2) Instead of conducting the hearing provided for in subsection (1) of this section and returning or restoring the property, the department in its discretion, may leave the several claimants to appropriate civil process for the determination of the claims. [1991 c.286 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 144.404.

 

      144.409 Granting petition for return of things seized; judicial review. (1) In granting a petition for return or restoration of things seized, the Department of Corrections shall postpone execution of the order until such time as the things in question are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes in establishing either a criminal or parole or post-prison supervision violation.

      (2) Judicial review of a department order for return or restoration of things seized shall be available as for review of orders in other than contested cases as provided in ORS chapter 183. [1991 c.286 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 144.404.

INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR ADULT OFFENDER SUPERVISION

 

      144.600 Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision. The Legislative Assembly hereby approves and the Governor is authorized to enter into a compact on behalf of this state with any other state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

 

ARTICLE I

PURPOSE

 

      (a) The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner and, when necessary, return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that the United States Congress, by enacting 4 U.S.C. 112, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.

      (b) It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created under this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.

      (c) In addition, this compact is intended to: Create an Interstate Commission that will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of offenders placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities or corrections or other criminal justice agencies that will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to the heads of State Councils, the state executive, judicial and legislative branches and the criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education on the regulation of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.

      (d) The compacting states recognize that there is no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision, subject to the provisions of this compact and the bylaws and rules promulgated under this compact. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission are intended to formulate public policy and are therefore public business.

      (a)(1) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state, provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.

      (2) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal of the statute that enacted the compact into law.

      (3) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.

      (4) The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.

      (5) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.

      (b)(1) If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the bylaws or rules of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:

      (i) Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;

      (ii) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;

      (iii) Suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer of the defaulting state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council.

      (2) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact or the Interstate Commission bylaws or rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer of the defaulting state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature and the State Council of such termination.

      (3) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of termination.

      (4) The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.

      (c) The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district court where the Interstate Commission has its principal office to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its rules or bylaws against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

      (d)(1) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state that reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.

      (2) Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

 

ARTICLE XIII

SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION

 

      (a) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.

      (b) The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.

 

ARTICLE XIV

BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT

      (a)(1) Nothing in this compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.

      (2) The laws of the State of Oregon, other than the Oregon Constitution, that conflict with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

      (b)(1) All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the State of Oregon unless contrary to the Oregon Constitution.

      (2) All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.

      (3) Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.

      (4) In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

      (c) The State of Oregon is bound by the bylaws and rules promulgated under this compact only to the extent that the operation of the bylaws and rules does not impose an obligation exceeding any limitation on state power or authority contained in the Oregon Constitution as interpreted by the state courts of Oregon.

UNIFORM ACT FOR

OUT-OF-STATE SUPERVISION

 

      144.610 Out-of-state supervision of parolees; contract with other states. The Governor of this state may execute a compact on behalf of the State of Oregon with any of the United States joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

      A compact entered into by and among the contracting states signatory hereto with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America granted by an Act entitled, “An Act Granting the Consent of Congress to any Two or More States to Enter into Agreements or Compacts for Cooperative Effort and Mutual Assistance in the Prevention of Crime and for Other Purposes.”

      The contracting states agree:

      (1) That the judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called “sending state”) may permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called “receiving state”) while on a probation or parole, if:

      (a) Such person is in fact a resident of, or has the family of the person residing within, the receiving state and can obtain employment there;

      (b) Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having the family of the person residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.

      Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.

      A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which the person has been convicted.

      (2) That each receiving state shall assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.

      (3) That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon, and not reviewable within, the receiving state; provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there is pending against the probationer or parolee within the receiving state any criminal charge or if the probationer or parolee is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the probationer or parolee shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.

      (4) That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states party to this compact without interference.

      (5) That the Governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.

      (6) That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.

      (7) That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it by sending six months’ notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.

______________________________________________________________________________

 

      144.613 Notice when parole or probation violated; hearing; report to sending state; taking person into custody. (1) Where supervision of a parolee or probationer is being administered pursuant to the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Supervision, the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities in this state shall notify the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Supervision administrator of the sending state, as defined in ORS 144.610, whenever, in their view, consideration should be given to retaking or reincarceration for a parole or probation violation.

      (2) Prior to the giving of any such notification, a hearing shall be held in accordance with ORS 144.613 to 144.617 within a reasonable time, unless such hearing is waived by the parolee or probationer. The appropriate officer or officers of this state shall, as soon as practicable following termination of any such hearing, report to the sending state, furnish a copy of the hearing record and make recommendations regarding the disposition to be made of the parolee or probationer by the sending state.

      (3) Pending any proceeding pursuant to this section, the appropriate officers of this state may take custody of and detain the parolee or probationer involved for a period not to exceed 15 days prior to the hearing and, if it appears to the hearing officer or officers that retaking or reincarceration is likely to follow, for such reasonable period after the hearing or waiver as may be necessary to arrange for the retaking or reincarceration. [1973 c.489 §1]

 

      144.615 Hearing procedure. (1) Any hearing pursuant to ORS 144.613 to 144.617 may be before the administrator of the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Supervision, a deputy of the Director of the Department of Corrections or any other person authorized pursuant to the laws of this state to hear cases of alleged parole or probation violation, except that no hearing officer shall be the person making the allegation of violation.

      (2) With respect to any hearing pursuant to ORS 144.613 to 144.617, the parolee or probationer:

      (a) Shall have reasonable notice in writing of the nature and content of the allegations to be made, including notice that its purpose is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the parolee or probationer has committed a violation that may lead to a revocation of parole or probation.

      (b) Shall be permitted to confer with any person whose assistance the parolee or probationer reasonably desires, prior to the hearing.

      (c) Shall have the right to confront and examine any persons who have made allegations against the parolee or probationer, unless the hearing officer determines that such confrontation would present a substantial present or subsequent danger of harm to such person or persons.

      (d) May admit, deny or explain the violation alleged and may present proof, including affidavits and other evidence, in support of the contentions of the parolee or probationer. A record of the proceedings shall be made and preserved. [1973 c.489 §§2,3; 1987 c.320 §78]

 

      144.617 Hearing on violation in another state; effect of record in such hearing. In any case of alleged parole or probation violation by a person being supervised in another state pursuant to the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Supervision any appropriate judicial or administrative officer or agency in another state is authorized to hold a hearing on the alleged violation. Upon receipt of the record of a parole or probation violation hearing held in another state pursuant to a statute substantially similar to ORS 144.613 to 144.617, such record shall have the same standing and effect as though the proceeding of which it is a record was had before the appropriate officer or officers in this state, and any recommendations contained in or accompanying the record shall be fully considered by the appropriate officer or officers of this state in making disposition of the matter. [1973 c.489 §4]

 

      144.620 Short title. ORS 144.610 may be cited as the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Supervision.

 

      144.622 “Parole” and “parolee” defined for Uniform Act for Out-of-State Supervision. For purposes of ORS 144.610 and 144.613 to 144.617, “parole” includes but is not limited to post-prison supervision, and “parolee” includes but is not limited to persons on post-prison supervision under rules adopted by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. [1989 c.790 §37]

ADVISORY COMMISSION ON PRISON TERMS AND PAROLE STANDARDS

 

      144.775 Commission members; terms; compensation; rules on duration of prison terms. (1) There is hereby established an Advisory Commission on Prison Terms and Parole Standards. The commission shall consist of equal numbers of State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision members and circuit court judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The legal counsel to the Governor shall serve as an ex officio member of the commission and shall not vote unless necessary to break a voting deadlock. The Director of the Department of Corrections shall act as an advisor to the commission.

      (2) The term of office of each of the members appointed by the Chief Justice is four years. Before the expiration of the term of any of those members, the Chief Justice shall appoint a successor whose term begins on July 1 next following. A member is eligible for reappointment. If there is a vacancy for any cause, the Chief Justice shall make an appointment to become immediately effective for the unexpired term.

      (3) A member of the commission shall receive no compensation for services as a member. However, all members may receive actual and necessary travel and other expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties under ORS 292.495.

      (4) The chairperson of the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision and a judge elected by the judicial members shall serve in alternate years as chairperson of the commission. The chairperson and a vice chairperson shall be elected prior to July 1 of each year to serve for the year following. The commission shall adopt its own bylaws and rules of procedure. A majority of the commission members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members shall be required to make proposals to the board under ORS 144.775 to 144.791.

      (5) The commission shall meet at least annually at a place and time determined by the chairperson and at such other times and places as may be specified by the chairperson or five members of the commission.

      (6) The State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision shall provide the commission with the necessary clerical and secretarial staff support and shall keep the members of the commission fully informed of the experience of the board in applying the standards derived from those proposed by the commission.

      (7) The commission shall propose to the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision and the board shall adopt rules establishing ranges of duration of imprisonment and variations from the ranges. In establishing the ranges and variations, factors provided in ORS 144.780 and 144.785 shall be considered. [1977 c.372 §1; 1983 c.740 §20; 1987 c.320 §81; 1991 c.126 §7]

 

      144.780 Rules on duration of imprisonment; objectives; considerations in prescribing rules. (1) The commission shall propose to the board and the board shall adopt rules establishing ranges of duration of imprisonment to be served for felony offenses prior to release on parole. The range for any offense shall be within the maximum sentence provided for that offense.

      (2) The ranges shall be designed to achieve the following objectives:

      (a) Punishment which is commensurate with the seriousness of the prisoner’s criminal conduct; and

      (b) To the extent not inconsistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection:

      (A) The deterrence of criminal conduct; and

      (B) The protection of the public from further crimes by the defendant.

      (3) The ranges, in achieving the purposes set forth in subsection (2) of this section, shall give primary weight to the seriousness of the prisoner’s present offense and criminal history. Existing correctional resources shall be considered in establishing the ranges. [1977 c.372 §2; 1985 c.163 §1]

 

      144.783 Duration of term of imprisonment when prisoner is sentenced to consecutive terms. (1) When a prisoner is sentenced to two or more consecutive terms of imprisonment, the duration of the term of imprisonment shall be the sum of the terms set by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision pursuant to the ranges established for the offenses, subject to ORS 144.079, and subject to the variations established pursuant to ORS 144.785 (1).

      (2) The duration of imprisonment pursuant to consecutive sentences may be less than the sum of the terms under subsection (1) of this section if the board finds, by affirmative vote of a majority of three board members or, if the chairperson requires all voting members to participate, a majority of all voting members, that consecutive sentences are not appropriate penalties for the criminal offenses involved and that the combined terms of imprisonment are not necessary to protect community security. [1987 c.634 §2; 1991 c.126 §9; 2015 c.820 §44]

 

      144.785 Rules on duration of prison terms when aggravating or mitigating circumstances exist; limitation on terms; dangerous offenders. (1) The commission shall propose to the board and the board shall adopt rules regulating variations from the ranges, to be applied when aggravating or mitigating circumstances exist. The rules shall define types of circumstances as aggravating or mitigating and shall set the maximum variation permitted.

      (2) In no event shall the duration of the actual imprisonment under the ranges or variations from the ranges exceed the maximum term of imprisonment fixed for an offense, except in the case of a prisoner who has been sentenced under ORS 161.725 as a dangerous offender, in which case the maximum term shall not exceed 30 years. [1977 c.372 §3; 1981 c.547 §1; 1987 c.634 §3]

 

      144.787 Rules on age or physical disability of victim constituting aggravating circumstance. The Advisory Commission on Prison Terms and Parole Standards and the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision shall provide, in rules adopted under ORS 144.785, that, in the case of a crime involving a physical or sexual assault, a victim’s particular vulnerability to injury in such case due to the victim’s youth, advanced age or physical disability, shall constitute an aggravating circumstance justifying a variation from the range of duration of imprisonment otherwise applicable in the case. [1985 c.767 §3]

 

      144.790 [1977 c.372 §10; 1979 c.648 §1; 1981 c.426 §4; 1983 c.723 §2; 1983 c.740 §21; 1985 c.503 §1; 1987 c.320 §82; 1989 c.790 §8a; 1991 c.270 §1; 1993 c.294 §6; 1993 c.692 §8; repealed by 1995 c.520 §3 (144.791 enacted in lieu of 144.790)]

 

PRESENTENCE REPORTS

 

      144.791 Presentence report in felony conviction cases; when required. (1) When a person is convicted of a felony, including a felony sexual offense, the sentencing court may order a presentence report upon its own motion or upon the request of the district attorney or the defendant.

      (2) The sentencing court shall order a presentence report if the defendant is convicted of a felony sexual offense unless:

      (a) The defendant, as part of the same prosecution, is convicted of aggravated murder;

      (b) The felony sexual offense requires the imposition of a mandatory minimum prison sentence and no departure is sought by the court, district attorney or defendant; or

      (c) The felony sexual offense requires imposition of a presumptive prison sentence and no departure is sought by the court, district attorney or defendant.

      (3) The Department of Corrections shall:

      (a) Require that a presentence report provide an analysis of what disposition is most likely to reduce the offender’s criminal conduct, explain why that disposition would have that effect and provide an assessment of the availability to the offender of any relevant programs or treatment in or out of custody, whether provided by the department or another entity;

      (b) Determine what additional information must be included in the presentence report; and

      (c) Establish a uniform presentence report form. [1995 c.520 §4 (enacted in lieu of 144.790); 2005 c.473 §1]

 

      144.795 [1981 c.136 §2; repealed by 1985 c.503 §4]

 

      144.800 [1985 c.503 §2; 1987 c.320 §83; 1989 c.790 §8b; repealed by 1995 c.520 §7]
