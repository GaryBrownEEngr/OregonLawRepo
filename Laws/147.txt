      147.105 Application for compensation; contents; additional information or materials; amended applications; effect of criminal conviction of applicant. (1) An applicant for compensation under ORS 147.005 to 147.367 must file an application under oath on a form furnished by the Department of Justice. The application shall include:

      (a) The name and address of the victim;

      (b) If the victim is deceased, the name and address of the applicant and relationship to the victim, the names and addresses of the victim’s dependents and the extent to which each is so dependent;

      (c) The date and nature of the crime or attempted crime on which the application for compensation is based;

      (d) The date and place where, and the law enforcement officials to whom, notification of the crime was given;

      (e) The nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the victim, the names and addresses of those giving medical and hospital treatment to the victim and whether death resulted;

      (f) The loss to the applicant and to such other persons as are specified under paragraph (b) of this subsection, resulting from the injury or death;

      (g) The amount of benefits, payments or awards, if any, payable from any source, which the applicant or other person, listed under paragraph (b) of this subsection, has received or for which the applicant or other person is eligible as a result of the injury or death;

      (h) Releases authorizing the surrender to the department of reports, documents and other information relating to the matters specified under this subsection; and

      (i) Such other information as the department determines is necessary.

      (2) The department may require that the applicants submit with the application materials substantiating the facts stated in the application.

      (3) If the department finds that an application does not contain the required information or that the facts stated therein have not been substantiated, it shall notify the applicant in writing of the specific additional items of information or materials required and that the applicant has 30 days from the date of mailing in which to furnish those items to the department. Unless an applicant requests and is granted an extension of time by the department, the department shall reject with prejudice the claim of the applicant for failure to file the additional information or materials within the specified time.

      (4) An applicant may file an amended application or additional substantiating materials to correct inadvertent errors or omissions at any time before the department has completed its consideration of the original application.

      (5) The filing of additional information or the amendment of the application pursuant to subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be considered for the purposes of ORS 147.005 to 147.367 to have been filed at the same time as the original application.

      (6) Unless the department finds good cause exists for the applicant’s failure to satisfy a financial obligation or unless the interest of justice requires otherwise, the department shall not process an application filed by or on behalf of a victim who owes a financial obligation ordered or imposed as a result of a previous criminal conviction until the department receives information or materials establishing to the satisfaction of the department that the financial obligation has been satisfied. If the department does not receive the information or materials within one year after the department notifies the applicant of the need to fulfill this requirement, the application is void.

      (7)(a) If at the time of application, the applicant is incarcerated as a result of a conviction of a crime, the application shall be refused and returned to the applicant. The applicant is eligible to refile the application within six months after the applicant is released from incarceration.

      (b) The offense allegedly perpetrated against the victim is rape, sodomy or sexual abuse and the interests of the victim or of the victim’s dependents require that the information be kept confidential or that the public be excluded from the hearing;

      (c) The victim or alleged assailant is a minor; or

      (d) The interests of justice would be frustrated rather than furthered, if the information were disclosed or if the hearing were open to the public.

      (c) Where the interests of justice require, the board may refuse to disclose to the public the names of victims or other material in the record by which the identity of the victim could be discovered.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)(b) and (c) of this section, the record of the proceedings held before the board is a public record.

      (b) Shall determine the amount of the loss to the applicant and, in the case of a deceased victim, of the victim’s survivors or dependents as determined under ORS 147.035;

      (c) Shall determine the degree or extent to which the victim’s acts or conduct contributed to the injuries or death of the victim, and may reduce or deny the award of compensation accordingly. However, the department may disregard for this purpose the responsibility of the victim for the injury of the victim where the record shows that such responsibility was attributable to efforts by the victim to prevent a crime or an attempted crime from occurring in the presence of the victim or to apprehend a person who had committed a crime in the presence of the victim;

      (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this subsection, shall deduct the amount of benefits, payments or awards that are payable under the Workers’ Compensation Law, from local governmental, state or federal funds or from any source, and that the victim or survivors or dependents of the victim have received or to which the victim or survivors or dependents of the victim are entitled as a result of the death or injury of the victim;

      (g) Shall award the resultant amount to the applicant as provided in ORS 147.165.

      (2) In determining the amount of an award to be made to an applicant, the department may consider the number and type of claims filed and anticipated to be filed with the department during the current biennial budget period. If the department determines that insufficient funds will be available during the current biennial budget period to pay all filed and anticipated awards, it may prioritize claims or prorate awards based upon the anticipated available funds. The department’s decision to prioritize or prorate claims or awards is not subject to administrative or judicial review, including review under ORS 147.155.

      (b) When any person or other legal entity contracts to pay the proceeds of the compensable crime to any individual charged with or convicted of committing such a crime in this state or found guilty except for insanity with regard to such a crime, or whenever any person or other legal entity contracts with a representative or assignee of that individual to pay the proceeds of the compensable crime committed by that individual, the person or legal entity shall promptly submit a copy of the contract to the Department of Justice and pay to the department any proceeds which otherwise, under the terms of the contract, would be paid to the accused or convicted individual, the person found guilty except for insanity or the representative or assignee of the individual.

      (2) The department shall deposit proceeds received under this section in an escrow account established for the benefit of the victims or dependents of the victims of the crime for which the individual whose proceeds are placed in the escrow account is convicted or found guilty except for insanity. Proceeds in the escrow account shall be paid to satisfy judgments as provided in subsection (3) of this section or restitution orders under ORS 137.103 to 137.109.

      (3) A person is entitled to payment of proceeds from the escrow account established under this section if:

      (a) The person is the victim or a dependent of a deceased victim of a compensable crime for which the individual whose proceeds are placed in the escrow account is convicted or found guilty except for insanity; and

      (b) Within five years after the establishment of the escrow account, the person commences a civil action against such individual in a court of competent jurisdiction and receives a money judgment for damages suffered as a result of the crime.

      (4) The department, at least once every year for five years from the date it establishes the escrow account, shall cause to have published a legal notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the crime was committed and in the counties adjoining such county advising victims that the escrow proceeds are available to satisfy judgments pursuant to this section.

There shall be no payment from the escrow account to a victim or a victim’s representative until either the amounts of all unsatisfied judgments are determined, or it is determined that the payment for an unsatisfied judgment will not diminish the escrow account so that other potential victim claims could not be satisfied.

      (9)(a) The Department of Justice may notify any person whom the department believes to be in possession of the proceeds of a compensable crime, or to have contracted to pay the proceeds of a compensable crime as described in subsection (1) of this section, of the requirements of this section.

      (10) Notwithstanding subsection (9) of this section, the Department of Justice may seek provisional remedies, including garnishment or injunctive relief, to prevent the payment of money or property which the department asserts to be the proceeds of a compensable crime to an individual charged with or convicted of committing such a crime in this state or found guilty except for insanity with regard to such a crime, or to the representative or assignee of that individual, until the character of the property or money is determined.

      (11) The Department of Justice may adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section.

CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS

 

      147.405 Short title. Chapter 2, Oregon Laws 1987, shall be known as the “CRIME VICTIMS’ BILL OF RIGHTS.” [1987 c.2 §1]

 

      Note: Legislative Counsel has substituted “chapter 2, Oregon Laws 1987,” for the words “this Act” in sections 1, 2 and 18, chapter 2, Oregon Laws 1987, compiled as 147.405, 147.410 and 147.415. Specific ORS references have not been substituted, pursuant to 173.160. These sections may be determined by referring to the 1987 Comparative Section Table located in Volume 22 of ORS.

 

      147.410 Purpose. We, the people of the State of Oregon, declare that victims of crime are entitled to fair and impartial treatment in our criminal justice system. The purpose of chapter 2, Oregon Laws 1987, is to declare to our legislature and our courts that victims’ rights shall be protected at each stage of the criminal justice system. We reject the notion that a criminal defendant’s rights must be superior to all others. By chapter 2, Oregon Laws 1987, we seek to secure balanced justice by eliminating unbalanced rules. [1987 c.2 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 147.405.

 

      147.415 Severability. If any section, portion, clause or phrase of chapter 2, Oregon Laws 1987, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining sections, portions, clauses and phrases shall not be affected but shall remain in full force in effect. [1987 c.2 §18]

The notice may be oral or written and written notice may be provided electronically. If exercise of any of the rights depends upon the victim making a request, the law enforcement agency shall include in the notice the time period in which the victim is required to make the request. A law enforcement agency satisfies the requirements of this section if the law enforcement agency:

      (a) Provides notice to the victim named in the accusatory instrument, the victim’s guardian or, in a homicide case, the victim’s next of kin; and

      (b) Presents, if written notice is given, the notice directly to the victim, sends the notice to the last address given to the law enforcement agency by the victim or sends the notice electronically to the cellular phone number or electronic mail address given to the law enforcement agency by the victim.

      (2) Failure by a law enforcement agency to properly notify the victim as required by this section:

      (a) Is not grounds for setting aside a conviction.

      (b) Does not affect the validity of a plea, except as provided by section 42 or 43, Article I of the Oregon Constitution.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (2) of this section justifies a failure to properly notify the victim.

      (4)(a) As used in this section, “law enforcement agency” means the police agency that initially responds in the case, the police agency that investigates the case or the district attorney who prosecutes the case.

      (b) The district attorney shall determine if the notice required by this section has been given and, if not, shall provide the notice. [1997 c.313 §5; 2009 c.178 §25; 2017 c.171 §2]

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Supreme Court may dismiss the appeal as to any respondent if the appellant, after receipt of a notice of noncompliance, does not promptly cure a deficiency in the materials or if the failure to timely serve a true and complete copy of the accompanying materials substantially prejudices the respondent’s ability to respond to the appeal.

      (12) A respondent may file a response, which must be filed within seven days after the date the notice of interlocutory appeal is filed with the Supreme Court.

      (13)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the appellant may not file a reply.

      (b) If the Supreme Court determines that the case is unusually complex, due to the number of persons involved or the existence of novel questions of law, and the court would benefit from additional briefing, the court may extend the briefing schedule described in this section and allow the appellant to file a reply.

      (14) The appellant or respondent may request oral argument. The Supreme Court may grant or deny a request for oral argument or order oral argument on its own motion.

      (15) At any time after submission of the appellant’s memorandum of law, the Supreme Court, on its own motion or on the motion of the respondent, may summarily affirm the trial court’s order, with or without the submission of a response or oral argument, if the Supreme Court determines that the appeal does not present a substantial question of law. A motion for summary affirmance has no effect on the timelines described in this section.

      (c) In making the determination under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Supreme Court shall consider:

      (A) Whether the case is unusually complex, due to the number of persons involved or the existence of novel questions of law, and whether 21 days is an unreasonable amount of time for the court to issue a decision; and

      (B) Whether the failure to extend the 21-day period would be likely to result in a miscarriage of justice.

      (17) Appellate review under this section is confined to the record. The Supreme Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court as to any issue of fact and shall review challenges to a factual finding for evidence in the record to support the finding. The Supreme Court shall review for errors of law and, when the law delegates discretion to the trial court, determine whether the trial court’s exercise of discretion was outside the range of discretion delegated to the trial court.

      (18) The Supreme Court may affirm, modify, reverse or remand the trial court’s order. The court may reverse or remand the order only if it finds that the order is unlawful in substance or procedure and that the substantial rights of the appellant were prejudiced as a result.

      (19) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a notice of interlocutory appeal and the response described in subsection (12) of this section are filed under this section when those documents are physically received by the Supreme Court or, if the documents are filed electronically, as provided by rule of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

      (20) In addition to any other method authorized by law, service under this section may be accomplished by electronic mail or facsimile transmission, in a manner consistent with any applicable rules of appellate procedure. [2009 c.178 §14; 2011 c.659 §4; 2013 c.224 §4]

      (3) In making the determination described in subsection (2) of this section, in addition to other factors the Supreme Court considers important, the court shall consider:

      (a) The likelihood that the appellant will prevail on appeal in light of the support in fact and law for the appeal;

      (b) Whether the appeal is taken in good faith and not for the purpose of delay;

      (c) The nature of the harm to the victim, the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, any person against whom relief was ordered and the public that will likely result from the grant or denial of a stay;

      (d) The rights guaranteed to the victim, the prosecuting attorney, the defendant and any person against whom relief was ordered under the Oregon Constitution or the United States Constitution and under Oregon statutory and decisional law; and

      (e) Whether the defendant is in custody and, if so, whether the defendant has expressly consented to a continuance of the trial under ORS 136.290. [2009 c.178 §16]
