DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY

 

      151.485 Financial eligibility; determination; financial statement; termination of appointed counsel. (1) For purposes of determining the financial eligibility for appointed counsel of persons with a constitutional or statutory right to counsel in matters before the state courts and whose counsel is authorized to be paid by the public defense services executive director under ORS 151.219, a person is financially eligible for appointed counsel if the person is determined to be financially unable to retain adequate counsel without substantial hardship in providing basic economic necessities to the person or the person’s dependent family under standards established by the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.216.

      (2) A determination of financial eligibility shall be made upon the basis of information contained in a detailed financial statement submitted by the person for whom counsel is requested or appointed or, in an appropriate case, by the person’s parent, guardian or custodian. The financial statement shall be in the form prescribed by the Public Defense Services Commission. The form shall contain a full disclosure of all assets, liabilities, current income, dependents and other information required by ORS 135.050 (4) and, in addition, any information required by the commission and state courts as necessary to determine eligibility. The commission shall adopt uniform statewide guidelines and procedures that prescribe how to use the form and determine financial eligibility for appointed counsel.

      (3) If at any time after the appointment of counsel the court having jurisdiction of the case finds that the defendant is financially able to obtain counsel, the court may terminate the appointment of counsel. If at any time during criminal proceedings the court having jurisdiction of the case finds that the defendant is financially unable to pay counsel whom the defendant has retained, the court may appoint counsel as provided in this section.

      (4) In addition to any criminal prosecution, a civil proceeding may be initiated by any public body that has expended moneys for the defendant’s legal assistance within two years of judgment if the defendant was not qualified for legal assistance in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) of this section. As used in this subsection, “legal assistance” includes legal counsel, transcripts, witness fees and expenses and any other goods or services required by law to be provided to a financially eligible person at state expense under ORS 151.216 and 151.219.

      (5) The civil proceeding shall be subject to the exemptions from execution as provided for by law. [1989 c.1053 §13; 1991 c.825 §6; 2001 c.962 §33]

 

      151.487 Ability to pay; effect. (1) If in determining that a person is financially eligible for appointed counsel under ORS 151.485, the court finds that the person has financial resources that enable the person to pay in full or in part the administrative costs of determining the eligibility of the person and the costs of the legal and other services to be provided at state expense that are related to the provision of appointed counsel, the court shall enter a limited judgment requiring that the person pay to the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, through the clerk of the court, the amount that it finds the person is able to pay without creating substantial hardship in providing basic economic necessities to the person or the person’s dependent family. The amount that a court may require the person to pay is subject to the guidelines and procedures issued by the Public Defense Services Commission as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

      (2) Failure to comply with the requirements of a limited judgment entered under this section is not grounds for contempt or grounds for withdrawal by the appointed attorney.

      (3) Except as authorized in this section, a person, organization or governmental agency may not request or accept a payment or promise of payment for assisting in the representation of a person by appointment.

      (4) The commission shall promulgate and issue guidelines and procedures:

      (a) For the determination of persons provided with appointed counsel who have some financial resources to pay in full or in part the administrative, legal and other costs under subsection (1) of this section; and

      (b) Regarding the amounts persons may be required to pay by a court under subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) The determination that a person is able to pay or partially able to pay, or that a person no longer has the ability to pay the amount ordered in subsection (1) of this section, is subject to review at any time by the court. [1989 c.1053 §14; 1993 c.33 §305; 1997 c.761 §3; 2001 c.962 §34; 2011 c.597 §42; 2012 c.107 §43]

 

      151.489 Personnel to verify financial eligibility. For the purpose of aiding courts in making determinations of financial eligibility for appointed counsel at state expense under ORS 151.485 and 151.487, the State Court Administrator may locate eligibility verification and screening personnel or otherwise arrange for such services in the state trial and appellate courts or other locations and shall prescribe the policies and procedures for their use. [1989 c.1053 §15; 2001 c.962 §35]

 

      151.491 Authority of person verifying financial eligibility. (1) State courts or authorized designees who conduct the verification of the financial statement submitted by a person seeking or having appointed counsel payable at state expense under ORS 151.216 and 151.219 may require the person to execute and deliver any written requests or authorizations as may be necessary under applicable law to provide the state court or authorized designee with access to records of public or private source, otherwise confidential, as may be needed to evaluate eligibility.

      (2) In performing the verification duties under subsection (1) of this section, the state courts are authorized to obtain information from any public record office of the state or of any subdivision or agency of the state upon request and without payment of any fees ordinarily required by law. [1989 c.1053 §16; 2001 c.962 §36]

 

      151.493 Release of information by state agency to State Court Administrator. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any state agency as defined in ORS 192.311 that receives a request for release of information from the state courts for the purpose of verifying the financial eligibility of a person under ORS 151.485 to 151.497 shall release all requested information to the state court. The court shall forward to the state agency a certification signed by the person about whom the requested information is sought that authorizes the release of the information.

      (2) Upon its own motion or motion of the public defense services executive director, a court that has appointed counsel for a person by reason of financial eligibility may order the release of any information relating to the person’s financial situation held by any other person. [1991 c.825 §4; 2001 c.962 §37]

 

      151.495 Confidentiality of information obtained by state courts; exceptions. (1) All information supplied by a person seeking appointed counsel and all information collected by the state courts for purposes of determining financial eligibility for appointed counsel under ORS 151.485 to 151.497 is confidential and shall not be used for any purpose other than determining financial eligibility.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, information supplied by a person seeking appointed counsel and information collected by the state courts for purposes of determining financial eligibility may be:

      (a) Introduced in a proceeding, criminal or civil, arising out of a determination that a person is not financially eligible for appointed counsel;

      (b) Introduced in a proceeding, criminal or civil, arising as a result of an allegation that a person has supplied false information in seeking appointed counsel;

      (c) Used by the court in a sentencing proceeding resulting from the defendant’s conviction on the matter for which the information was provided or collected; and

      (d) Used by the court, the Department of Revenue, or the assignees of the court or the Department of Revenue, for the purpose of collecting delinquent amounts owed to this state by the person. [1991 c.825 §5; 1997 c.761 §4; 2001 c.962 §38]

MISCELLANEOUS

 

      151.505 Authority of court to order repayment of costs related to provision of appointed counsel. (1) At the conclusion of a case or matter in which the first accusatory instrument or petition in the trial court was filed after January 1, 1998, and in which the court appointed counsel to represent a person, a trial, appellate or post-conviction court may include in its judgment a money award requiring that the person repay in full or in part the administrative costs of determining the eligibility of the person for appointed counsel, and the costs of the legal and other services that are related to the provision of appointed counsel, that have not previously been required to be paid under a limited judgment entered under ORS 151.487. An award under this section is a monetary obligation payable to the state.

      (2) Costs that may be included in a money award under this section include a reasonable attorney fee for counsel appointed to represent the person and a reasonable amount for expenses authorized under ORS 135.055. A reasonable attorney fee is presumed to be a reasonable number of hours at the hourly rate authorized by the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.216. For purposes of this subsection, compensation of counsel is determined by reference to a schedule of compensation established by the commission.

      (3) The court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs. In determining the amount and method of payment of costs, the court shall take account of the financial resources of the person and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose.

      (4)(a) A person who has been required to pay costs under this section and who is not in contumacious default in the payment of the costs may at any time petition the court for remission of the payment of costs or any unpaid portion of the costs. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the person ordered to repay or on the immediate family of the person, or will interfere with the ability of the person to complete an alcohol or drug treatment program, the court may enter a supplemental judgment that remits all or part of the amount due or modifies the method of payment.

      (b) In accordance with ORS 144.089, a person may enter into a written agreement to participate in a community service exchange program as an alternative to paying costs imposed under this section.

      (5) All moneys collected or paid under a money award made pursuant to this section shall be paid into the Criminal Fine Account. If the money award is part of a criminal judgment of conviction, the award is a Type 2, Level II obligation for the purpose of ORS 137.145 to 137.159. [1997 c.761 §2; 2001 c.962 §39; 2003 c.334 §§1,2; 2003 c.449 §§18,19; 2011 c.597 §43; 2015 c.186 §2; 2017 c.522 §2]
