      (a) The district attorney or city attorney has brought a proceeding against the defendant named in the complaint or intends to bring a proceeding against the defendant named in the complaint; and

      (b) The proceeding is brought by the district attorney or city attorney by reason of the same conduct alleged in the complaint.

      (7) Any political subdivision of this state may require by ordinance that violation proceedings for the purpose of enforcing the charter or ordinances of the political subdivision may not be commenced in the manner provided by this section and that those proceedings may be commenced only by enforcement officers.

      (8) A person other than an enforcement officer may commence a violation proceeding under this section only for:

      (a) Boating violations under ORS chapter 830, or any violation of rules adopted pursuant to ORS chapter 830 if the violation constitutes an offense;

      (b) Traffic violations under ORS chapters 801 to 826, or any violation of rules adopted pursuant to those chapters if the violation constitutes an offense;

      (c) Violations under the wildlife laws, as described in ORS 496.002, or any violation of rules adopted pursuant to those laws if the violation constitutes an offense;

      (d) Violations under the commercial fishing laws, as described in ORS 506.001, or any violation of rules adopted pursuant to those laws if the violation constitutes an offense; or

      (e) Violations of ORS 618.121 to 618.161, and violation of rules adopted pursuant to those laws if the violation constitutes an offense. [1999 c.1051 §11]

 

      153.061 Appearance by defendant. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a defendant who has been issued a violation citation must either:

      (a) Make a first appearance by personally appearing in court at the time indicated in the summons; or

      (b) Make a first appearance in the manner provided in subsection (3) of this section before the time indicated in the summons.

      (2) If a defendant is issued a violation citation for careless driving under ORS 811.135 on which a police officer noted that the offense contributed to an accident and that the cited offense appears to have contributed to the serious physical injury or death of a vulnerable user of a public way, the officer may not enter the amount of the presumptive fine on the summons and the defendant must make a first appearance by personally appearing in court at the time indicated in the summons.

      (3) Except as provided in this section, a defendant who has been issued a violation citation may make a first appearance in the matter before the time indicated in the summons by one of the following means:

      (a) The defendant may submit to the court a written or oral request for a trial.

      (b) The defendant may enter a plea of no contest by delivering to the court the summons and a check or money order in the amount of the presumptive fine set forth in the summons. The entry of a plea under the provisions of this paragraph constitutes a waiver of trial and consent to the entry of a judgment forfeiting the presumptive fine. A no contest plea under this section is not subject to the requirements of ORS chapter 135 relating to the entry of pleas and, upon receipt of the plea, the court may enter judgment against the defendant without taking further evidence.

      (4) The court may require that a defendant requesting a trial under subsection (3) of this section deposit an amount equal to the presumptive fine established under ORS 153.019 and 153.020 or such other amount as the court determines appropriate if the defendant has failed to appear in any court on one or more other charges in the past. If the defendant does not deposit the amount specified by the court, the defendant must personally appear in court at the time indicated in the summons. The amount deposited by the defendant may be applied against any fine imposed by the court, and any amount not so applied shall be refunded to the defendant at the conclusion of the proceedings.

      (5) The court may require a defendant to appear personally in any case, or may require that all defendants appear in specified categories of cases.

      (6) If a defendant has entered a no contest plea in the manner provided in subsection (3) of this section, and the court determines that the presumptive fine is not adequate by reason of previous convictions of the defendant, the nature of the offense charged or other circumstances, the court may require that a trial be held unless an additional fine amount is paid by the defendant before a specified date. Notice of an additional fine amount under this subsection may be given to the defendant by mail. In no event may the court require a total fine amount in excess of the maximum fine established for the violation by statute.

      (7) If a defendant fails to make a first appearance on a citation for a traffic violation, as defined by ORS 801.557, fails to make a first appearance on a citation for a violation of ORS 471.430, or fails to appear at any other subsequent time set for trial or other appearance, the driving privileges of the defendant are subject to suspension under ORS 809.220. [1999 c.1051 §17; 2001 c.817 §2; 2007 c.784 §5; 2011 c.597 §§25,313; 2012 c.89 §4]

 

      153.064 Warrant for arrest upon failure to appear. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a warrant for arrest may be issued against a person who fails to make a first appearance on a citation for a violation, or fails to appear at any other subsequent time set for trial or other appearance, only if the person is charged with failure to appear in a violation proceeding under ORS 153.992.

      (2) If a person fails to make a first appearance on a citation for a violation, or fails to appear at any other subsequent time set for trial or other appearance, the court may issue an order that requires the defendant to appear and show cause why the defendant should not be held in contempt. The show cause order may be mailed to the defendant by certified mail, return receipt requested. If service cannot be accomplished by mail, the defendant must be personally served. If the defendant is served and fails to appear at the time specified in the show cause order, the court may issue an arrest warrant for the defendant for the purpose of bringing the defendant before the court. [1999 c.1051 §18]

 

(Trial)

 

      153.070 When trial required. The court may require that a trial be held in any violation proceeding. If the defendant requests a trial under ORS 153.061, or a trial is required by the court or by law, the court shall set a date, time and place for the trial. [1999 c.1051 §19; 2001 c.19 §2; 2003 c.518 §1]

 

      153.073 Time and place. Unless notice is waived by the defendant, the court shall mail or otherwise provide to the defendant notice of the date, time and place at least five days before the date set for trial under ORS 153.070. If the citation is for a traffic violation, or is for a violation of ORS 471.430, the notice must contain a warning to the defendant that if the defendant fails to appear at the trial, the driving privileges of the defendant are subject to suspension under ORS 809.220. [1999 c.1051 §20; 2001 c.817 §3; 2003 c.518 §1a]

 

      153.076 Conduct of trial. (1) Violation proceedings shall be tried to the court sitting without jury. The trial in a violation proceeding may not be scheduled fewer than seven days after the date that the citation is issued unless the defendant waives the seven-day period.

      (2) The state, municipality or political subdivision shall have the burden of proving the charged violation by a preponderance of the evidence.

      (3) The pretrial discovery rules in ORS 135.805 to 135.873 apply in violation proceedings.

      (4) The defendant may not be required to be a witness in the trial of any violation.

      (5) Defense counsel shall not be provided at public expense in any proceeding in which only violations are charged.

      (6) A district attorney or city attorney may aid in preparing evidence and obtaining witnesses but, except upon good cause shown to the court, shall not appear in violation proceedings unless counsel for the defendant appears. The court shall ensure that the district attorney or city attorney is given timely notice if defense counsel is to appear at trial. [1999 c.1051 §21]

 

      153.080 Testimony by affidavit or declaration. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may admit as evidence in any trial in a violation proceeding the affidavit or declaration of a witness in lieu of taking the testimony of the witness orally and in court. The authority granted under this section is subject to all of the following:

      (a) Testimony may not be presented by affidavit or declaration under the provisions of this section unless the court has adopted rules providing procedures for the introduction and use of testimony by affidavit or declaration.

      (b) The court shall allow testimony by affidavit or declaration under this section only upon receiving a signed statement from the defendant waiving the right to have the testimony presented orally in court.

      (c) Testimony by affidavit or declaration under this section is not subject to objection as hearsay.

      (d) A statement signed by the defendant under paragraph (b) of this subsection does not constitute a waiver of trial unless the affidavit or declaration specifically so provides.

      (e) Nothing in this section requires that the defendant or any other witness waive the right to appear if other testimony is introduced by affidavit or declaration as provided in this section.

      (2) As used in this section, “declaration” means a declaration under penalty of perjury in the form required by ORCP 1 E. [1999 c.1051 §22; 2015 c.121 §2]

 

      153.083 Role of peace officer. Notwithstanding ORS 9.160 and 9.320, in any trial of a violation, whether created by ordinance or statute, in which a city attorney or district attorney does not appear, the peace officer who issued the citation for the offense may present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses and make arguments relating to:

      (1) The application of statutes and rules to the facts in the case;

      (2) The literal meaning of the statutes or rules at issue in the case;

      (3) The admissibility of evidence; and

      (4) Proper procedures to be used in the trial. [1999 c.805 §1; 1999 c.805 §2; 2003 c.305 §1]

 

      Note: 153.083 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 153 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

(Judgment)

 

      153.090 Provisions of judgment. (1) Judgments entered under this chapter may include:

      (a) Imposition of a sentence to pay a fine;

      (b) Costs and restitution authorized by law;

      (c) A requirement that the fine, costs and restitution, if any, be paid out of the presumptive fine;

      (d) Remission of any balance of a presumptive fine to the defendant; and

      (e) Any other provision authorized by law.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 137.106, if the court orders restitution in a default judgment entered under ORS 153.102, a defendant may allege an inability to pay the full amount of monetary sanctions imposed, including restitution, and request a hearing to determine whether the defendant is unable to pay or to establish a payment schedule by filing a written request with the court within one year after the entry of the judgment. The court shall set a hearing on the issue of the defendant’s ability to pay upon receipt of the request and shall give notice to the district attorney. The district attorney shall give notice to the victim of the date, time and place of the hearing. The court may determine a payment schedule for monetary sanctions imposed, including restitution ordered under this subsection, if the defendant establishes at the hearing that the defendant is unable to pay the ordered restitution in full.

      (3) If a trial is held in a violation proceeding, or a default judgment is entered against the defendant under ORS 153.102, the court may impose any fine within the statutory limits for the violation. If a defendant pleads no contest under ORS 153.061 (3) and the court accepts the plea and enters judgment against the defendant, the amount of the fine imposed against the defendant by the court may not exceed the presumptive fine established for the violation under ORS 153.019 and 153.020.

      (4) A judge may suspend operation of any part of a judgment entered under this chapter upon condition that the defendant pay the nonsuspended portion of a fine within a specified period of time. If the defendant fails to pay the nonsuspended portion of the fine within the specified period of time, the suspended portion of the judgment becomes operative without further proceedings by the court and the suspended portion of the fine becomes immediately due and payable.

      (5) The court may not issue notice to the Department of Transportation to suspend the defendant’s driving privileges unless a trial has been required. The failure of the defendant to appear at the trial does not prevent the court from issuing notice to the department to suspend the defendant’s driving privileges.

      (6) Entry of a default judgment under ORS 153.102 does not preclude the arrest and prosecution of the defendant for the crime of failure to appear in a violation proceeding under ORS 153.992.

      (7) If a person held commercial driving privileges as described in ORS 807.018 at the time the offense was committed, a court may not defer entry of a judgment or allow an individual to enter into a diversion program that would prevent a conviction for a traffic offense from appearing on the driving record of the holder. This subsection applies to all traffic offenses, whether committed while driving a motor vehicle or a commercial motor vehicle, but does not apply to parking violations. [1999 c.1051 §25; 2003 c.670 §3; 2005 c.649 §30; 2007 c.122 §12; 2007 c.784 §7; 2009 c.395 §4; 2011 c.355 §18; 2011 c.597 §27; 2012 c.89 §5; 2013 c.237 §30]

 

      153.093 [1999 c.1095 §3; 1999 c.1095 §5; 2003 c.14 §61; 2003 c.737 §104; repealed by 2011 c.597 §5]

 

      153.096 Suspension of fine in certain cases. (1) In any proceeding for a violation under ORS 830.990 or 830.997, the court may conditionally suspend all or part of any fine or penalty to be imposed on the defendant if the defendant appears personally and agrees to complete at the defendant’s own expense a Safe Boating Education Course approved by the State Marine Board under ORS 830.110 (18), within time limits imposed by the court.

      (2) In any proceeding for a violation under ORS 830.990 or 830.997, the court shall notify the State Marine Board if the defendant fails to appear at any time as required by law or the court, or fails to comply with any order of the court. [1999 c.1051 §96b]

 

      153.099 Entry; nondefault cases. (1) If a trial is held in a violation proceeding, the court shall enter a judgment based on the evidence presented at the trial.

      (2) If the defendant appears and enters a plea of no contest in the manner described in ORS 153.061 (3) and a trial is not otherwise required by the court or by law, the court shall make a decision based on the citation. The court may consider any statement of explanation submitted with the plea. [1999 c.1051 §23; 2007 c.784 §8; 2011 c.597 §25a; 2012 c.89 §6]

 

      153.102 Entry; default cases. (1) If the defendant in a violation proceeding does not make a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 within the time allowed, and a trial is not otherwise required by the court or by law, the court may enter a default judgment based on the complaint and any other evidence the judge determines appropriate.

      (2) If the defendant makes a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 within the time allowed and requests a trial, and the defendant subsequently fails to appear at the date, time and place set for any trial or other appearance in the matter, and if a trial is not otherwise required by the court or by law, the court shall enter a judgment based on the complaint and any other evidence the judge determines appropriate. [1999 c.1051 §24]

 

      153.105 Relief from default judgment. If a default judgment is entered against a defendant under ORS 153.102, the court may relieve a defendant from the judgment upon a showing that the failure of the defendant to appear was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. A motion for relief under this section must be made by the defendant within a reasonable time, and in no event may a motion under this section be made more than one year after entry of judgment. [1999 c.1051 §26]

 

      153.108 Effect of judgment. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 131.505 to 131.535, if a person commits both a crime and a violation as part of the same criminal episode, the prosecution for one offense shall not bar the subsequent prosecution for the other. However, evidence of the first conviction shall not be admissible in any subsequent prosecution for the other offense.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 43.130 and 43.160, a plea, finding or judgment in a violation proceeding, or the fact that a violation proceeding has been brought against a defendant, may not be used for the purpose of res judicata or collateral estoppel, or be admitted as evidence in any civil proceeding. [1999 c.1051 §27; 2011 c.597 §29]

 

      153.110 [1981 c.692 §11; repealed by 1999 c.1051 §32]

 

      153.111 Distribution of abstracts of convictions. (1) Upon entry of a conviction for a traffic offense, the court shall forward to the Department of Transportation an abstract of conviction in the manner required by ORS 810.375, and a copy of the judgment, if required, under the provisions of ORS 810.375.

      (2) Upon entry of a conviction for violation of any provision of the wildlife laws or commercial fishing laws, or any rule promulgated pursuant to those laws, the court that enters the judgment of conviction shall forward to the Department of State Police an abstract of conviction.

      (3) Upon entry of a conviction for a compulsory school attendance violation under ORS 339.095, the court shall forward to the Department of Education an abstract of conviction.

      (4) Upon entry of a conviction for violation of a weights and measures law subject to penalty under ORS 618.991, the court shall forward to the State Department of Agriculture an abstract of conviction.

      (5) Upon entry of a conviction of a boating offense, as defined in ORS 830.005, the court shall forward to the State Marine Board an abstract of conviction.

      (6) A court may destroy any abstract not required to be forwarded to an agency under the provisions of this section. [1999 c.1051 §51]

 

      153.120 [1981 c.692 §12; repealed by 1999 c.1051 §32]

 

(Appeal)

 

      153.121 Appeal. An appeal from a judgment in a violation proceeding may be taken by either party as follows:

      (1) From a proceeding in justice court or municipal court, as provided in ORS 138.057 for appeals of violations.

      (2) From a proceeding in circuit court, as provided in ORS chapter 19, except that the standard of review is the same as for an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding involving a misdemeanor or felony. [1999 c.1051 §28; 2005 c.266 §1]

      (a) The information electronically filed includes all information required on a uniform citation adopted by the Supreme Court under ORS 1.525, or as required under ORS 221.333 and 810.425 for parking ordinance violations. However, an electronically filed citation containing all required information, but of a different size or format than a uniform citation adopted by the Supreme Court under ORS 1.525, shall not be prohibited by or found in violation of a rule established under this subsection.

      (b) The citation filed electronically is verifiable as being filed by a specific law enforcement officer or, for parking ordinance violations, by a person authorized to enforce parking ordinance violations.

      (c) Members of the public can obtain copies of and review citations that are electronically filed and maintained under this section in the same manner as for citations filed on paper. [1995 c.781 §53; 1999 c.1051 §129; 2001 c.911 §2; 2015 c.13 §2]

 

      153.772 Suspension of driving privileges for failure to appear; limitation on district attorney’s authority. When the court issues a notice under ORS 809.220 to suspend the driving privileges of a person for failure to appear on a citation for a violation of ORS 471.430, the district attorney may not file an accusatory instrument charging the person with violating ORS 153.992. [2001 c.817 §9]

 

      Note: 153.772 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 153 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

VIOLATIONS BUREAU

 

      153.800 Violations Bureau; uniform fine schedule. (1) Any court of this state may establish a Violations Bureau and designate the clerk or deputy clerk of the court or any other appropriate person to act as a violations clerk for the Violations Bureau. The violations clerk shall serve under the direction and control of the court appointing the clerk.

      (2) A violations clerk may exercise authority over any violation. A justice or municipal court establishing a Violations Bureau shall by order specify the violations that are subject to the authority of the violations clerk.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the violations clerk shall accept:

      (a) Written appearance, waiver of trial, plea of no contest and payment of fine, costs and assessments for violations that are subject to the authority of the violations clerk; or

      (b) Payment of presumptive fine amounts for violations that are subject to the authority of the violations clerk.

      (4)(a) Courts other than circuit courts shall establish schedules, within the limits prescribed by law, of the amounts of penalties to be imposed for first, second and subsequent violations, designating each violation specifically or by class. The order of the court establishing the schedules shall be prominently posted in the place where penalties established under the schedule are paid.

      (b) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall establish a uniform fine schedule for violations prosecuted in circuit courts. The schedule must specify the violations that are subject to the authority of the violations clerk.

      (c) All amounts must be paid to, receipted by and accounted for by the violations clerk in the same manner as other payments on money judgments are received by the court.

      (5) Any person charged with a violation within the authority of the violations clerk may:

      (a) Upon signing an appearance, plea of no contest and waiver of trial, pay the clerk the penalty established for the violation charged, including any costs and assessments authorized by law.

      (b) Pay the clerk the presumptive fine amount established for the violation. Payment of the presumptive fine amount under this paragraph constitutes consent to forfeiture of the presumptive fine amount and disposition of the violation by the clerk as provided by the rules of the court. Payment of the presumptive fine amount under this paragraph is not consent to forfeiture of the presumptive fine amount if the payment is accompanied by a plea of not guilty or a request for hearing.

      (6) A person who has been found guilty of, or who has signed a plea of no contest to, one or more previous offenses in the preceding 12 months within the jurisdiction of the court may not appear before the violations clerk unless the court, by general order applying to certain specified offenses, permits such appearance. [1995 c.292 §1; 1997 c.801 §149; 1999 c.59 §30; 1999 c.1051 §130; 2011 c.597 §149; 2012 c.89 §8]

      (3) The court may proceed to make a determination without a hearing on a citation for a parking violation if at least one of the registered owners of the vehicle appears within the time allowed at the court specified in the citation and requests a hearing, but thereafter fails to appear at the time, date and court set for any subsequent hearing in the matter. If a determination is made under the provisions of this subsection, the court shall mail notice of any sentence and judgment to the registered owner or owners of the vehicle at the address or addresses reflected in the records of the Department of Transportation.

      (4) A determination under this section shall be on the citation and on any evidence that the court may, in its discretion, determine to be appropriate.

      (5) Upon making a determination under this section, the court may enter judgment and, if the determination is one of conviction, may impose a sentence of a fine within the limits established for the parking violation along with a money award for costs, assessments and other amounts authorized by law.

      (6) A sentence to pay a fine under this section does not prevent:

      (a) Taking any other action against the person as permitted by law for the person’s failure to comply, including, but not limited to, sentencing the person further as permitted by law after the person is brought to hearing.

      (b) Following any procedures established by law when the person fails to appear.

      (7) On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a person from a judgment entered under this section upon a showing that the failure of the person to appear was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. The motion must be made within a reasonable time, and in no event more than one year after entry of judgment in the matter.

      (8) A judgment may be entered under this section only if the citation issued to the person contains a statement notifying the person that a judgment may be entered against the person up to the maximum amount of fines, assessments and other costs allowed by law for the parking violation if the person fails to appear at the time, date and court specified in the citation or fails to appear at subsequently scheduled hearings in the matter.

      (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a judgment entered under this section does not create a judgment lien and cannot become a judgment lien by any means. [1997 c.801 §98; 2003 c.576 §172]
