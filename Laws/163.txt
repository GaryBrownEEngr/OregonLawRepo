      (c) For the purpose of establishing the prior conviction solely as an element of the crime under ORS 163.107 (1)(c), neither the court nor the state shall reveal to the jury the previous conviction, but the previous conviction is established in the record by the defendant’s stipulation; and

      (d) The court shall not submit the accusatory instrument or evidence of the previous conviction to the jury.

      (2) In a proceeding under ORS 163.107 (1)(c), the state may offer, and the court may receive and submit to the jury, evidence of the previous conviction for impeachment of the defendant or another purpose, other than establishing the conviction as an element of the offense, when the evidence of the previous conviction is otherwise admissible for that purpose. When evidence of the previous conviction has been admitted by the court, the state may comment upon, and the court may give instructions about, the evidence of the previous conviction only to the extent that the comments or instructions relate to the purpose for which the evidence was admitted.

      (3) When the defendant stipulates to the prior conviction required as an element of murder in the first degree under ORS 163.107 (1)(c), if the jury finds the defendant guilty upon instruction regarding the balance of the elements of the crime, the court shall enter a judgment of guilty of murder in the first degree. [Formerly 163.103]

Otherwise, the board shall deny the relief sought in the petition.

      (e) If the board denies the relief sought in the petition, the board shall determine the date of the subsequent hearing, and the prisoner may petition for an interim hearing, in accordance with ORS 144.285.

      (f) The board’s final order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings of fact shall consist of a concise statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings as to each contested issue of fact and as to each ultimate fact required to support the board’s order.

      (6) As used in this section:

      (b) Subsection (1)(d)(B) of this section that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicants at the time of the conduct that resulted in the previous conviction. [1975 c.577 §2; 1981 c.873 §6; 1997 c.850 §3; 2007 c.867 §2; 2011 c.291 §2]

(1) It is an affirmative defense to murder in the second degree for purposes of ORS 163.115 (1)(a) that the homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance if the disturbance is not the result of the person’s own intentional, knowing, reckless or criminally negligent act and if there is a reasonable explanation for the disturbance. The reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance must be determined from the standpoint of an ordinary person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances that the actor reasonably believed them to be. Extreme emotional disturbance does not constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.

      (2) The defendant may not introduce in the defendant’s case in chief expert testimony regarding extreme emotional disturbance under this section unless the defendant gives notice of the defendant’s intent to do so.

      (3) The notice required must be in writing and must be filed at the time the defendant pleads not guilty. The defendant may file the notice at any time after the defendant pleads but before trial if the court determines that there was just cause for failure to file the notice at the time of the defendant’s plea.

      (4) If the defendant fails to file notice, the defendant may not introduce evidence for the purpose of proving extreme emotional disturbance under ORS 163.115 unless the court, in its discretion, determines that there was just cause for failure to file notice.

      (5) After the defendant files notice as provided in this section, the state may have at least one psychiatrist or licensed psychologist of its selection examine the defendant in the same manner and subject to the same provisions as provided in ORS 161.315. [1971 c.743 §90; 1977 c.235 §1; 1981 c.873 §7; 2003 c.127 §1; 2019 c.635 §19]

The Oregon Criminal Justice Commission shall classify manslaughter in the second degree as described in ORS 163.125 and criminally negligent homicide as described in ORS 163.145 as crime category 9 of the sentencing guidelines grid of the commission if:

      (b) The victim’s death in the previous conviction was caused by the person driving a motor vehicle.

      (2) The previous convictions to which subsection (1) of this section applies are:

      (a) Manslaughter in the first degree under ORS 163.118;

      (b) Manslaughter in the second degree under ORS 163.125; or

      (c) Criminally negligent homicide under ORS 163.145.

      (3) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicants at the time of the conduct that resulted in the previous conviction.

      163.150 Sentencing for aggravated murder; proceedings; issues for jury. (1)(a) Upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of aggravated murder, the court, except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment, as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(c), life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole, as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(b), or death. The proceeding shall be conducted in the trial court before the trial jury as soon as practicable. If a juror for any reason is unable to perform the function of a juror, the juror shall be dismissed from the sentencing proceeding. The court shall cause to be drawn the name of one of the alternate jurors, who shall then become a member of the jury for the sentencing proceeding notwithstanding the fact that the alternate juror did not deliberate on the issue of guilt. If the defendant has pleaded guilty, the sentencing proceeding shall be conducted before a jury impaneled for that purpose. In the proceeding, evidence may be presented as to any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence including, but not limited to, victim impact evidence relating to the personal characteristics of the victim or the impact of the crime on the victim’s family and any aggravating or mitigating evidence relevant to the issue in paragraph (b)(C) of this subsection; however, neither the state nor the defendant shall be allowed to introduce repetitive evidence that has previously been offered and received during the trial on the issue of guilt. The court shall instruct the jury that all evidence previously offered and received may be considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing. This paragraph shall not be construed to authorize the introduction of any evidence secured in violation of the Constitution of the United States or of the State of Oregon. The state and the defendant or the counsel of the defendant shall be permitted to present arguments for or against a sentence of death and for or against a sentence of life imprisonment with or without the possibility of release or parole.

      (b) Upon the conclusion of the presentation of the evidence, the court shall submit the following issues to the jury:

      (A) Whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death of the deceased or another would result;

      (B) If raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased; and

      (C) Whether the defendant should receive a death sentence.

      (c)(A) The court shall instruct the jury to consider, in determining the issues in paragraph (b) of this subsection, any mitigating circumstances offered in evidence, including but not limited to the defendant’s age, the extent and severity of the defendant’s prior criminal conduct and the extent of the mental and emotional pressure under which the defendant was acting at the time the offense was committed.

      (B) The court shall instruct the jury to answer the question in paragraph (b)(C) of this subsection “no” if, after considering any aggravating evidence and any mitigating evidence concerning any aspect of the defendant’s character or background, or any circumstances of the offense and any victim impact evidence as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, one or more of the jurors believe that the defendant should not receive a death sentence.

      (d) The state must prove each issue submitted under paragraph (b) of this subsection beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury shall return a special verdict of “yes” or “no” on each issue considered.

      (e) The court shall charge the jury that it may not answer any issue “yes,” under paragraph (b) of this subsection unless it agrees unanimously.

      (f) If the jury returns an affirmative finding on each issue considered under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to death.

      (2)(a) Upon the conclusion of the presentation of the evidence, the court shall also instruct the jury that if it reaches a negative finding on any issue under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole, as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(b), unless 10 or more members of the jury further find that there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment, in which case the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(c).

      (b) If the jury returns a negative finding on any issue under subsection (1)(b) of this section and further finds that there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment, the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections as provided in ORS 163.105 (1)(c).

      (3)(a) When the defendant is found guilty of aggravated murder, and ORS 137.707 (2) applies or the state advises the court on the record that the state declines to present evidence for purposes of sentencing the defendant to death, the court:

      (A) Shall not conduct a sentencing proceeding as described in subsection (1) of this section, and a sentence of death shall not be ordered.

      (B) Shall conduct a sentencing proceeding to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(b) or life imprisonment as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(c). If the defendant waives all rights to a jury sentencing proceeding, the court shall conduct the sentencing proceeding as the trier of fact. The procedure for the sentencing proceeding, whether before a court or a jury, shall follow the procedure of subsection (1)(a) of this section, as modified by this subsection. In the proceeding, evidence may be presented as to any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence, including, but not limited to, victim impact evidence relating to the personal characteristics of the victim or the impact of the crime on the victim’s family.

      (b) Following the presentation of evidence and argument under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court shall instruct the jury that the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(b), unless after considering all of the evidence submitted, 10 or more members of the jury find there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment with the possibility of parole as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(c). If 10 or more members of the jury find there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(c).

      (c) Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the court from sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment, as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(c), or life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole, as described in ORS 163.105 (1)(b), pursuant to a stipulation of sentence or stipulation of sentencing facts agreed to and offered by both parties if the defendant waives all rights to a jury sentencing proceeding.

      (4) If any part of subsection (2) of this section is held invalid and as a result thereof a defendant who has been sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of release or parole will instead be sentenced to life imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections as provided in ORS 163.105 (2), the defendant shall be confined for a minimum of 30 years without possibility of parole, release on work release or any form of temporary leave or employment at a forest or work camp. Subsection (2) of this section shall apply only to trials commencing on or after July 19, 1989.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(a) of this section, if the trial court grants a mistrial during the sentencing proceeding, the trial court, at the election of the state, shall either:

      (a) Sentence the defendant to imprisonment for life in the custody of the Department of Corrections as provided in ORS 163.105 (1)(c); or

      (b) Impanel a new sentencing jury for the purpose of conducting a new sentencing proceeding to determine if the defendant should be sentenced to:

      (A) Death;

      (B) Imprisonment for life without the possibility of release or parole as provided in ORS 163.105 (1)(b); or

      (C) Imprisonment for life in the custody of the Department of Corrections as provided in ORS 163.105 (1)(c). [1985 c.3 §3; 1987 c.320 §86; 1987 c.557 §1; 1989 c.720 §2; 1989 c.790 §135b; 1991 c.725 §2; 1991 c.885 §2; 1995 c.531 §2; 1995 c.657 §23; 1997 c.784 §1; 1999 c.1055 §1; 2001 c.306 §1; 2005 c.480 §1; 2017 c.359 §4; 2019 c.635 §5]

 

      163.155 Sentencing for murder of pregnant victim; proceeding; issues for jury. (1) When a defendant, who was at least 15 years of age at the time of committing the murder, is convicted of murdering a pregnant victim under ORS 163.115 (1)(a) and the defendant knew that the victim was pregnant, the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole if the person was at least 18 years of age at the time of committing the offense or to life imprisonment. The court shall conduct a sentencing proceeding to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole as described in subsection (4) of this section or to life imprisonment as described in subsection (5) of this section. If the defendant waives all rights to a jury sentencing proceeding, the court shall conduct the sentencing proceeding as the trier of fact. The procedure for the sentencing proceeding, whether before a court or a jury, shall follow the procedure of ORS 163.150 (1)(a), as modified by this section.

      (2) Following the presentation of evidence and argument under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall instruct the jury that the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole as described in subsection (4) of this section, unless after considering all of the evidence submitted, 10 or more members of the jury find there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment with the possibility of release or parole as described in subsection (5) of this section. If 10 or more members of the jury do not find there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment with the possibility of release or parole, the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole as described in subsection (4) of this section. If 10 or more members of the jury find there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment with the possibility of release or parole, the trial court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as described in subsection (5) of this section.

      (3) Nothing in this section precludes the court from sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment, as described in subsection (5) of this section, or life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole, as described in subsection (4) of this section, pursuant to a stipulation of sentence or stipulation of sentencing facts agreed to and offered by both parties if the defendant waives all rights to a jury sentencing proceeding.

      (4) A sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release or parole under this section may not be suspended, deferred or commuted by any judicial officer, and the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision may neither parole the prisoner nor reduce the period of confinement in any manner whatsoever. The Department of Corrections or any executive official may not permit the prisoner to participate in any sort of release or furlough program.

      (5) If the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment, the court shall order that the defendant be confined for a minimum of 30 years without possibility of parole or release to post-prison supervision except as provided in ORS 144.397, and without the possibility of release on work release or any form of temporary leave or employment at a forest or work camp.

(1) When a petition is filed in accordance with ORS 163.763, the circuit court shall hold an ex parte hearing in person or by telephone on the day the petition is filed or on the following judicial day. Upon a finding that it is objectively reasonable for a person in the petitioner’s situation to fear for the person’s physical safety if an order granting relief under ORS 163.760 to 163.777 is not entered and that the respondent has subjected the petitioner to sexual abuse, the circuit court:

      (2) If the respondent is restrained from entering or attempting to enter an area surrounding the petitioner’s residence or any other premises, the restraining order must specifically describe the area or premises.

      (3) When the circuit court enters a restraining order under this section, the court shall set a security amount for the violation of the order.

      (4) If the circuit court enters a restraining order under subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) The clerk of the court shall provide, without charge, the number of certified true copies of the petition and the restraining order necessary to provide the petitioner with one copy and to effect service and shall have a true copy of the petition and the restraining order delivered to the county sheriff for service upon the respondent, unless the circuit court finds that further service is unnecessary because the respondent appeared in person before the court. In addition and upon request by the petitioner, the clerk of the court shall provide the petitioner, without charge, two exemplified copies of the petition and the restraining order.

      (b) The county sheriff shall serve the respondent personally unless the petitioner elects to have the respondent served personally by another party. Proof of service shall be made in accordance with ORS 163.773. When the restraining order does not contain the respondent’s date of birth and service is effected by the sheriff, the sheriff shall verify the respondent’s date of birth with the respondent and shall record that date on the restraining order or proof of service entered into the Law Enforcement Data System under ORS 163.773.

      (5)(a) If the county sheriff:

      (A) Determines that the restraining order and petition are incomplete, the sheriff shall return the restraining order and petition to the clerk of the court. The clerk of the court shall notify the petitioner, at the address provided by the petitioner, of the error or omission.

      (B) Cannot complete service within 10 days after accepting the restraining order and petition, the sheriff shall notify the petitioner, at the address provided by the petitioner, that the documents have not been served. If the petitioner does not respond within 10 days, the sheriff shall hold the restraining order and petition for future service and file a return to the clerk of the court showing that service was not completed.

      (b) If a petitioner receives notice of incomplete service under paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection and cannot effect service on the respondent within 30 days after the granting or renewal of the restraining order, the circuit court may order service by an alternative method in accordance with ORCP 7 D(6) on proof of the petitioner’s due diligence in attempting to effect service.

      (6)(a) Within 30 days after a restraining order is served under this section, the respondent may request a circuit court hearing upon any relief granted.

      (b) If the respondent requests a hearing under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the clerk of the court shall notify the petitioner of the date and time of the hearing and shall supply the petitioner with a copy of the respondent’s request for a hearing. The petitioner shall give the clerk of the court information sufficient to allow such notification.

      (7) If the respondent fails to request a hearing within 30 days after a restraining order is served, the restraining order is confirmed by operation of law.

      (8)(a) A restraining order entered under this section is effective for a period of five years or, if the petitioner is under 18 years of age at the time of entry, until the person attains 19 years of age, whichever occurs later, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection or unless the restraining order is renewed, modified or terminated in accordance with ORS 163.760 to 163.777.

      (c) The circuit court may enter a permanent restraining order if the court finds that it is objectively reasonable for a person in the petitioner’s situation to fear for the person’s physical safety and that the passage of time or a change in circumstances would not dissipate that fear. In making the finding, the court shall consider any information offered by the petitioner to support the request for a permanent restraining order, including but not limited to:

      (A) Information that the respondent has a history of engaging in sexual abuse or domestic violence as defined in ORS 135.230;

      (B) If the petitioner is a minor, the fact that the respondent is related to the petitioner by blood or marriage; or

      (C) Any vulnerability of the petitioner that is not likely to change over time. [2013 c.687 §3; 2019 c.353 §2]

      163.767 Hearing; order; certificate of compliance; consent agreement. (1) If the respondent requests a hearing under ORS 163.765 (6), the circuit court shall hold the hearing within 21 days after the request. At the hearing, the circuit court may terminate or modify the restraining order issued under ORS 163.765.

      (2)(a) If service of a notice of hearing is inadequate to provide a party with sufficient notice of the hearing, the circuit court may extend the date of the hearing for up to five days so that the party may seek representation.

      (b) If one party is represented by an attorney at the hearing, the circuit court may extend the date of the hearing for up to five days at the other party’s request so that the other party may seek representation.

      (3) If the circuit court continues the restraining order issued under ORS 163.765, with or without modification, at a hearing about which the respondent received actual notice and the opportunity to be heard, the court shall include in the restraining order a certificate in substantially the following form in a separate section immediately above the signature of the judge:

______________________________________________________________________________

CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE VIOLENCE

AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 1994

 

This protective order meets all full faith and credit requirements of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C. 2265. This court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. The respondent was afforded notice and timely opportunity to be heard as provided by the law of this jurisdiction. This protective order is valid and entitled to enforcement in this and all other jurisdictions.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (4) The circuit court may approve a consent agreement if the court determines that the agreement provides sufficient protections to the petitioner. The circuit court may not approve a term in a consent agreement that provides for restraint of a party to the agreement unless the other party petitioned for and was granted a restraining order issued under ORS 163.765.

      (5) A restraining order entered under this section, or a consent agreement entered into under this section, shall continue for a period of five years from the date of the restraining order issued under ORS 163.765 or, if the petitioner is under 18 years of age at the time of issuance, until the petitioner attains 19 years of age, whichever occurs later, unless the court enters a permanent order under ORS 163.765 (8) or the restraining order is renewed, modified or terminated in accordance with ORS 163.775. [2013 c.687 §4; 2019 c.353 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 163.760.

      (2) In determining whether to allow written notice less than 30 days before the proceeding under ORS 45.400 (2), the circuit court shall consider the expedited nature of a proceeding under ORS 163.760 to 163.777.

      (3) In addition to the factors listed in ORS 45.400 (3)(b) that would support a finding of good cause, the circuit court shall consider whether the safety or welfare of the party or witness would be threatened if testimony were required to be provided in person at a proceeding under ORS 163.760 to 163.777.

      (4) A motion or good cause determination is not required for ex parte hearings held by telephone under ORS 163.765. [2013 c.687 §5; 2017 c.240 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 163.760.

 

      163.773 Enforcement of restraining order; service by sheriff; termination order; contempt proceeding. (1)(a) When a restraining order is issued in accordance with ORS 163.760 to 163.777 and the person to be restrained has actual notice of the restraining order, the clerk of the court or any other person serving the petition and the restraining order shall immediately deliver to a county sheriff copies of the petition and the restraining order and a true copy of proof of service on which it is stated that the petition and the restraining order were served personally on the respondent. Proof of service may be made by affidavit or by declaration under penalty of perjury. If a restraining order entered by the circuit court recites that the respondent appeared in person before the court, the necessity for service of the restraining order and proof of service is waived.

      (b) Upon receipt of a copy of the restraining order and notice of completion of any required service by a member of a law enforcement agency, the county sheriff shall immediately enter the restraining order into the Law Enforcement Data System maintained by the Department of State Police and the databases of the National Crime Information Center of the United States Department of Justice. If the petition and the restraining order were served on the respondent by a person other than a member of a law enforcement agency, the county sheriff shall enter the restraining order into the Law Enforcement Data System and the databases of the National Crime Information Center upon receipt of a true copy of proof of service. The sheriff shall provide the petitioner with a true copy of any required proof of service.

      (c) Entry into the Law Enforcement Data System constitutes notice to all law enforcement agencies of the existence of the restraining order. Law enforcement agencies shall establish procedures adequate to ensure that an officer at the scene of an alleged violation of the restraining order may be informed of the existence and terms of the restraining order. The restraining order is fully enforceable in any county or tribal land in this state.

      (d) When a restraining order has been entered into the Law Enforcement Data System and the databases of the National Crime Information Center of the United States Department of Justice under this subsection, a county sheriff shall cooperate with a request from a law enforcement agency from any other jurisdiction to verify the existence of the restraining order or to transmit a copy of the restraining order to the requesting jurisdiction.

      (2) A sheriff may serve a restraining order issued under ORS 163.760 to 163.777 in the county in which the sheriff was elected and in any county that is adjacent to the county in which the sheriff was elected.

      (3)(a) A sheriff may serve and enter into the Law Enforcement Data System a copy of a restraining order issued under ORS 163.760 to 163.777 that was transmitted to the sheriff by a circuit court or law enforcement agency through an electronic communication device. Before transmitting a copy of a restraining order to a sheriff under this subsection through an electronic communication device, the person transmitting the copy must receive confirmation from the sheriff’s office that an electronic communication device is available and operating.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, “electronic communication device” means a device by which any kind of electronic communication can be made, including but not limited to communication by telephonic facsimile and electronic mail.

      (4) When a circuit court enters an order terminating a restraining order issued under ORS 163.760 to 163.777 before the expiration date, the clerk of the court shall immediately deliver a copy of the termination order to the county sheriff with whom the original restraining order was filed. Upon receipt of the termination order, the county sheriff shall promptly remove the original restraining order from the Law Enforcement Data System and the databases of the National Crime Information Center of the United States Department of Justice.

      (5)(a) A contempt proceeding for an alleged violation of a restraining order issued under ORS 163.760 to 163.777 must be conducted by the circuit court that issued the restraining order or by the circuit court for the county in which the alleged violation of the restraining order occurs. If contempt proceedings are initiated in the circuit court for the county in which the alleged violation of the restraining order occurs, the person initiating the contempt proceedings shall file with the court a copy of the restraining order that is certified by the clerk of the court that originally issued the restraining order. Upon filing of the certified copy of the restraining order, the circuit court shall enforce the restraining order as though that court had originally issued the restraining order.

      (b) Pending a contempt hearing for an alleged violation of a restraining order issued under ORS 163.760 to 163.777, a person arrested and taken into custody pursuant to ORS 133.310 may be released as provided in ORS 135.230 to 135.290.

      (c) Service of process or other legal documents upon the petitioner is not a violation of a restraining order entered under ORS 163.760 to 163.777 if the petitioner is served as provided in ORCP 7 or 9. [2013 c.687 §6; 2015 c.121 §23]

 

      Note: See note under 163.760.

 

      163.775 Renewal and modification of restraining order. (1)(a) A circuit court may renew a restraining order entered under ORS 163.760 to 163.777 upon a finding that it is objectively reasonable for a person in the petitioner’s situation to fear for the person’s physical safety if the restraining order is not renewed. A finding that the respondent has subjected the petitioner to additional sexual abuse is not required.

      (b) A circuit court may renew a restraining order on the basis of an ex parte petition alleging facts supporting the required finding. The petition must include allegations made under oath or affirmation or a declaration under penalty of perjury. If the renewal order is granted, the provisions of ORS 163.765 (4) to (8) and 163.767 (3) apply, except that the court may hear no issue other than the basis for renewal, unless requested in the hearing request form and thereafter agreed to by the petitioner. The circuit court shall hold a hearing required under this paragraph within 21 days after the respondent’s request.

      (2) At any time after the time period set forth in ORS 163.765 (6):

      (a) A party may request that the circuit court modify terms in the restraining order for good cause shown.

      (b) A petitioner may request that the circuit court remove terms in the restraining order or make terms in the order less restrictive. Application to the circuit court under this paragraph may be by ex parte motion.

      (3) The clerk of the court shall provide without charge the number of certified true copies of the request for modification of the restraining order and notice of hearing necessary to effect service and, at the election of the party requesting the modification, shall have a true copy of the request and notice delivered to the county sheriff for service upon the other party.

      (4) The county sheriff shall serve the other party with a request for modification of a restraining order under subsection (2)(a) of this section by personal service, unless the party requesting the modification elects to have the other party personally served by a private party or unless otherwise ordered by the circuit court.

      (5) The provisions of ORS 163.767 (3) apply to a modification of a restraining order under this section.

      (A) Entered under subsection (2)(a) of this section by personal service on the nonrequesting party.

      (B) Entered under subsection (2)(b) of this section by mailing a copy of the order of modification to the respondent by first class mail.

      (b) If the order of modification recites that the respondent appeared in person before the circuit court, the necessity for service of the order and proof of service is waived.
