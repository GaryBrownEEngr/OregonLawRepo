      (1) “Appropriate property of another to oneself or a third person” or “appropriate” means to:

      (a) Exercise control over property of another, or to aid a third person to exercise control over property of another, permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances as to acquire the major portion of the economic value or benefit of such property; or

      (2) “Deprive another of property” or “deprive” means to:

      (a) Withhold property of another or cause property of another to be withheld from that person permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances that the major portion of its economic value or benefit is lost to that person; or

      (b) Dispose of the property in such manner or under such circumstances as to render it unlikely that an owner will recover such property.

      (3) “Obtain” includes, but is not limited to, the bringing about of a transfer or purported transfer of property or of a legal interest therein, whether to the obtainer or another.

      (4) “Owner of property taken, obtained or withheld” or “owner” means any person who has a right to possession thereof superior to that of the taker, obtainer or withholder.

THEFT AND RELATED OFFENSES

 

      164.015 “Theft” described. A person commits theft when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate property to the person or to a third person, the person:

      (1) Takes, appropriates, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof;

      (2) Commits theft of property lost, mislaid or delivered by mistake as provided in ORS 164.065;

      (3) Commits extortion as provided in ORS 164.075 by compelling or inducing another person to deliver property;

      (4) Commits theft by deception as provided in ORS 164.085; or

      (5) Commits theft by receiving as provided in ORS 164.095. [1971 c.743 §123; 2007 c.71 §47; 2016 c.47 §7]

      (2) If it is an element of the crime charged that property was taken by extortion, an accusation of theft must so specify. In all other cases an accusation of theft is sufficient if it alleges that the defendant committed theft of property of the nature or value required for the commission of the crime charged without designating the particular way or manner in which the theft was committed.

      (3) Proof that the defendant engaged in conduct constituting theft as defined in ORS 164.015 is sufficient to support any indictment, information or complaint for theft other than one charging extortion.

      164.030 [Amended by 1955 c.37 §1; 1959 c.236 §3; repealed by 1971 c.743 §432]

      (b) The defendant reasonably believed that the defendant was entitled to the property involved or had a right to acquire or dispose of it as the defendant did.

      (2) In a prosecution for extortion committed by instilling in the victim a fear that the victim or another person would be charged with a crime, it is a defense that the defendant reasonably believed the threatened charge to be true and that the sole purpose of the defendant was to compel or induce the victim to take reasonable action to make good the wrong which was the subject of the threatened charge.

      (3) In a prosecution for theft by receiving, it is a defense that the defendant received, retained, concealed or disposed of the property with the intent of restoring it to the owner.

      (4) It is a defense that the property involved was that of the defendant’s spouse, unless the parties were not living together as spouses in a marriage and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft. [1971 c.743 §132; 2001 c.104 §53; 2015 c.629 §31; 2016 c.47 §9]

      (2) The Oregon Criminal Justice Commission shall adopt rules that establish disproportionate impact as an aggravating factor that a court may consider as a substantial and compelling reason to impose an upward departure from a presumptive sentence under the rules of the commission. [2009 c.811 §7]

 

      Note: 164.063 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 164 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (e) Promises performance that the person does not intend to perform or knows will not be performed.

      (2) “Deception” does not include falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or representations unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed. For purposes of this subsection, the theft of a companion animal, as defined in ORS 164.055, or a captive wild animal is a matter having pecuniary significance.

      (3) In a prosecution for theft by deception, the defendant’s intention or belief that a promise would not be performed may not be established by or inferred from the fact alone that such promise was not performed.

      (4) In a prosecution for theft by deception committed by means of a bad check, it is prima facie evidence of knowledge that the check or order would not be honored if:

      (a) The drawer has no account with the drawee at the time the check or order is drawn or uttered; or

      (b) Payment is refused by the drawee for lack of funds, upon presentation within 30 days after the date of utterance, and the drawer fails to make good within 10 days after receiving notice of refusal. [1971 c.743 §128; 1991 c.837 §10; 2007 c.71 §49]

      (2) It is a defense to a charge of violating subsection (1) of this section if:

      (a) The person is a scrap metal business as defined in ORS 165.116 or an agent or employee of a scrap metal business;

      (b) The person receives or retains metal property as defined in ORS 165.116; and

      164.098 Organized retail theft. (1) A person commits the crime of organized retail theft if, acting in concert with another person:

      (a) The person violates ORS 164.015 or aids or abets the other person to violate ORS 164.015;

      (b) The subject of the theft is merchandise and the merchandise is taken from a mercantile establishment; and

      164.105 Right of possession. Right of possession of property is as follows:

      (1) A person who has obtained possession of property by theft or other illegal means shall be deemed to have a right of possession superior to that of another person who takes, obtains or withholds the property from that person by means of theft.

      (2) A joint or common owner of property shall not be deemed to have a right of possession of the property superior to that of any other joint or common owner of the property.

      (3) In the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, a person in lawful possession of property shall be deemed to have a right of possession superior to that of a person having only a security interest in the property, even if legal title to the property lies with the holder of the security interest pursuant to a conditional sale contract or other security agreement. [1971 c.743 §130; 1987 c.158 §28]

 

      164.110 [Repealed by 1971 c.743 §432]

      (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, value means the market value of the property at the time and place of the crime, or if such cannot reasonably be ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property within a reasonable time after the crime.

      (2) Whether or not they have been issued or delivered, certain written instruments, not including those having a readily ascertainable market value, shall be evaluated as follows:

      (a) The value of an instrument constituting an evidence of debt, including, but not limited to, a check, draft or promissory note, shall be considered the amount due or collectible thereon or thereby.

      (b) The value of any other instrument which creates, releases, discharges or otherwise affects any valuable legal right, privilege or obligation shall be considered the greatest amount of economic loss which the owner might reasonably suffer because of the loss of the instrument.

      (3) The value of a gambling chip, token, imitation currency or similar device is its face value.
