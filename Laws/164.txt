      (2) “Deprive another of property” or “deprive” means to:

      (a) Withhold property of another or cause property of another to be withheld from that person permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances that the major portion of its economic value or benefit is lost to that person; or

      (b) Dispose of the property in such manner or under such circumstances as to render it unlikely that an owner will recover such property.

      (3) “Obtain” includes, but is not limited to, the bringing about of a transfer or purported transfer of property or of a legal interest therein, whether to the obtainer or another.

      (4) “Owner of property taken, obtained or withheld” or “owner” means any person who has a right to possession thereof superior to that of the taker, obtainer or withholder.

THEFT AND RELATED OFFENSES

 

      164.015 “Theft” described. A person commits theft when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate property to the person or to a third person, the person:

      (1) Takes, appropriates, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof;

      (2) Commits theft of property lost, mislaid or delivered by mistake as provided in ORS 164.065;

      (3) Commits extortion as provided in ORS 164.075 by compelling or inducing another person to deliver property;

      (4) Commits theft by deception as provided in ORS 164.085; or

      (5) Commits theft by receiving as provided in ORS 164.095. [1971 c.743 §123; 2007 c.71 §47; 2016 c.47 §7]

      164.025 Consolidation of theft offenses; pleading and proof. (1) Except for the crime of extortion, conduct denominated theft under ORS 164.015 constitutes a single offense.

      (2) If it is an element of the crime charged that property was taken by extortion, an accusation of theft must so specify. In all other cases an accusation of theft is sufficient if it alleges that the defendant committed theft of property of the nature or value required for the commission of the crime charged without designating the particular way or manner in which the theft was committed.

      (3) Proof that the defendant engaged in conduct constituting theft as defined in ORS 164.015 is sufficient to support any indictment, information or complaint for theft other than one charging extortion. An accusation of extortion must be supported by proof establishing extortion. [1971 c.743 §122; 2016 c.47 §8]

 

      164.030 [Amended by 1955 c.37 §1; 1959 c.236 §3; repealed by 1971 c.743 §432]

 

      164.035 Defenses. (1) In a prosecution for theft it is a defense that the defendant acted under an honest claim of right, in that:

      (a) The defendant was unaware that the property was that of another; or

      (b) The defendant reasonably believed that the defendant was entitled to the property involved or had a right to acquire or dispose of it as the defendant did.

      (2) In a prosecution for extortion committed by instilling in the victim a fear that the victim or another person would be charged with a crime, it is a defense that the defendant reasonably believed the threatened charge to be true and that the sole purpose of the defendant was to compel or induce the victim to take reasonable action to make good the wrong which was the subject of the threatened charge.

      (3) In a prosecution for theft by receiving, it is a defense that the defendant received, retained, concealed or disposed of the property with the intent of restoring it to the owner.

      (4) It is a defense that the property involved was that of the defendant’s spouse, unless the parties were not living together as spouses in a marriage and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft. [1971 c.743 §132; 2001 c.104 §53; 2015 c.629 §31; 2016 c.47 §9]

      (2) Theft in the second degree is a Class A misdemeanor. [1971 c.743 §124; 1987 c.907 §3; 1993 c.680 §19; 2009 c.11 §12; 2009 c.16 §2]

      (2) The Oregon Criminal Justice Commission shall adopt rules that establish disproportionate impact as an aggravating factor that a court may consider as a substantial and compelling reason to impose an upward departure from a presumptive sentence under the rules of the commission. [2009 c.811 §7]

 

      Note: 164.063 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 164 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

A person who comes into control of property of another that the person knows or has good reason to know to have been lost, mislaid or delivered under a mistake as to the nature or amount of the property or the identity of the recipient, commits theft if, with intent to deprive the owner thereof, the person fails to take reasonable measures to restore the property to the owner. [1971 c.743 §126]

 

      164.070 [Amended by 1965 c.253 §131; repealed by 1971 c.743 §432]

      (a) Creates or confirms another’s false impression of law, value, intention or other state of mind that the actor does not believe to be true;

      (b) Fails to correct a false impression that the person previously created or confirmed;

      (c) Prevents another from acquiring information pertinent to the disposition of the property involved;

      (e) Promises performance that the person does not intend to perform or knows will not be performed.

      (2) “Deception” does not include falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or representations unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed. For purposes of this subsection, the theft of a companion animal, as defined in ORS 164.055, or a captive wild animal is a matter having pecuniary significance.

      (3) In a prosecution for theft by deception, the defendant’s intention or belief that a promise would not be performed may not be established by or inferred from the fact alone that such promise was not performed.

      (4) In a prosecution for theft by deception committed by means of a bad check, it is prima facie evidence of knowledge that the check or order would not be honored if:

      (a) The drawer has no account with the drawee at the time the check or order is drawn or uttered; or

      (b) Payment is refused by the drawee for lack of funds, upon presentation within 30 days after the date of utterance, and the drawer fails to make good within 10 days after receiving notice of refusal. [1971 c.743 §128; 1991 c.837 §10; 2007 c.71 §49]

      (2) It is a defense to a charge of violating subsection (1) of this section if:

      (a) The person is a scrap metal business as defined in ORS 165.116 or an agent or employee of a scrap metal business;

      (b) The person receives or retains metal property as defined in ORS 165.116; and

      164.105 Right of possession. Right of possession of property is as follows:

      (1) A person who has obtained possession of property by theft or other illegal means shall be deemed to have a right of possession superior to that of another person who takes, obtains or withholds the property from that person by means of theft.

      (2) A joint or common owner of property shall not be deemed to have a right of possession of the property superior to that of any other joint or common owner of the property.

      (3) In the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, a person in lawful possession of property shall be deemed to have a right of possession superior to that of a person having only a security interest in the property, even if legal title to the property lies with the holder of the security interest pursuant to a conditional sale contract or other security agreement. [1971 c.743 §130; 1987 c.158 §28]

 

      164.110 [Repealed by 1971 c.743 §432]
