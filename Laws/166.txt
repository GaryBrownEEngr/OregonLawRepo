      166.432 Definitions for ORS 166.412 and 166.433 to 166.441.

      166.433 Findings regarding transfers of firearms. The people of this state find that:

      (a) Ordering a divestiture by the defendant of any interest in any enterprise, including real property.

      (b) Imposing reasonable restrictions upon the future activities or investments of any defendant, including, but not limited to, prohibiting any defendant from engaging in the same type of endeavor as the enterprise in which the defendant was engaged in violation of the provisions of ORS 166.720 (1) to (4).

      (2) All property, real or personal, including money, used in the course of, derived from or realized through conduct in violation of a provision of ORS 166.715 to 166.735 is subject to civil forfeiture to the state. The state shall dispose of all forfeited property as soon as commercially feasible. If property is not exercisable or transferable for value by the state, it shall expire. All forfeitures or dispositions under this section shall be made with due provision for the rights of innocent persons. Forfeited property shall be distributed as follows:

      (a)(A) All moneys and the clear proceeds of all other property forfeited shall be deposited with the State Treasurer to the credit of the Common School Fund.

      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, “clear proceeds” means proceeds of forfeited property less costs of maintaining and preserving property pending its sale or other disposition, less costs of sale or disposition and, if the Department of Justice has not otherwise recovered its costs and expenses of the investigation and prosecution leading to the forfeiture, less 30 percent of the remaining proceeds of the property which is awarded to the department as reasonable reimbursement for costs of such investigation and prosecution.

      (b) Any amounts awarded to the Department of Justice pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be deposited in the Criminal Justice Revolving Account in the State Treasury.

      (a) Place the property under seal;

      (b) Remove the property to a place designated by the court; or

      (c) Require another agency authorized by law to take custody of the property and remove it to an appropriate location.

      (5) The Attorney General, any district attorney or any state agency having jurisdiction over conduct in violation of a provision of ORS 166.715 to 166.735 may institute civil proceedings under this section. In any action brought under this section, the circuit court shall give priority to the hearing and determination. Pending final determination, the circuit court may at any time enter such injunctions, prohibitions or restraining orders, or take such actions, including the acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, as the court may deem proper. The Attorney General, district attorney or state agency bringing an action under this section may be awarded, upon entry of a judgment in favor of the state, costs of investigation and litigation, reasonably incurred. Amounts recovered may include costs and expenses of state and local governmental departments and agencies incurred in connection with the investigation or litigation.

      (6)(a) Any aggrieved person may institute a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section:

      (A) If the proceeding is based upon racketeering activity for which a criminal conviction has been obtained, any rights of appeal have expired and the action is against the individual convicted of the racketeering activity; or

      (B) If the person is entitled to pursue a cause of action under subsection (7)(a)(B) of this section.

      (b) In such proceeding, relief shall be granted in conformity with the principles that govern the granting of injunctive relief from threatened loss or damage in other civil cases, except that no showing of special or irreparable damage to the person shall have to be made. Upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing of immediate danger of significant loss or damage, a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction may be issued in any such action before a final determination on the merits.

      (7)(a) Any person who is injured by reason of any violation of the provisions of ORS 166.720 (1) to (4) shall have a cause of action for three-fold the actual damages sustained and, when appropriate, punitive damages:

      (b) The defendant or any injured person may demand a trial by jury in any civil action brought pursuant to this subsection.

      (c) Any injured person shall have a right or claim to forfeited property or to the proceeds derived therefrom superior to any right or claim the state has in the same property or proceeds.

      (8) An investigative agency may bring an action for civil penalties for any violation of ORS 166.720 (1) to (4). Upon proof of any such violation, the court shall impose a civil penalty of not more than $250,000.

      (9) A judgment rendered in favor of the state in any criminal proceeding under ORS 166.715 to 166.735 shall estop the defendant in any subsequent civil action or proceeding brought by the state or any other person as to all matters as to which such judgment would be an estoppel as between the state and the defendant.

      (10) The Attorney General may, upon timely application, intervene in any civil action or proceeding brought under subsection (6) or (7) of this section if the Attorney General certifies that, in the opinion of the Attorney General, the action or proceeding is of general public importance. In such action or proceeding, the state shall be entitled to the same relief as if the Attorney General instituted the action or proceeding.

      (11)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a criminal or civil action or proceeding under ORS 166.715 to 166.735 may be commenced at any time within five years after the conduct in violation of a provision of ORS 166.715 to 166.735 terminates or the cause of action accrues. If a criminal prosecution or civil action or other proceeding is brought, or intervened in, to punish, prevent or restrain any violation of the provisions of ORS 166.715 to 166.735, the running of the period of limitations prescribed by this section with respect to any cause of action arising under subsection (6) or (7) of this section which is based in whole or in part upon any matter complained of in any such prosecution, action or proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency of such prosecution, action or proceeding and for two years following its termination.

      (b) A cause of action arising under subsection (6)(a)(A) or (7)(a)(A) of this section accrues when the criminal conviction for the underlying activity is obtained. In addition to any suspension of the running of the period of limitations provided for in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the period of limitations prescribed by paragraph (a) of this subsection is suspended during any appeal from the criminal conviction for the underlying activity.

      (12) The application of one civil remedy under any provision of ORS 166.715 to 166.735 shall not preclude the application of any other remedy, civil or criminal, under ORS 166.715 to 166.735 or any other provision of law. Civil remedies under ORS 166.715 to 166.735 are supplemental and not mutually exclusive.

      (13) Notwithstanding subsection (6) or (7) of this section, a person may not institute a proceeding under subsection (6) of this section and does not have a cause of action under subsection (7) of this section if the conduct that is the basis of the proceeding or action could also be the basis of a claim of discrimination because of sex that constitutes sexual harassment.

      (14) In an action brought under the provisions of this section by a person other than the Attorney General, a district attorney or a state agency, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. In a civil action brought under the provisions of this section by the Attorney General, a district attorney or a state agency:

      (a) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the Attorney General, district attorney or state agency if the Attorney General, district attorney or state agency prevails in the action; and

      (b) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the Attorney General, district attorney or state agency had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court. [1981 c.769 §5; 1983 c.715 §2; 1995 c.79 §54; 1995 c.618 §58a; 1995 c.619 §1; 1995 c.696 §17; 1997 c.249 §51; 1997 c.789 §3; 2003 c.576 §390; 2007 c.869 §8; 2017 c.21 §101]

      (2) If matter that the investigative agency seeks to obtain by the subpoena is located outside the state, the person or enterprise subpoenaed may make such matter available to the investigative agency or its representative for examination at the place where such matter is located. The investigative agency may designate representatives, including officials of the jurisdiction in which the matter is located, to inspect the matter on its behalf and may respond to similar requests from officials of other jurisdictions.

      (3) Upon failure of a person or enterprise, without lawful excuse, to obey a subpoena, and after reasonable notice to such person or enterprise, the investigative agency may apply to the circuit court for the judicial district in which such person or enterprise resides, is found or transacts business for an order compelling compliance. [1981 c.769 §6; 1983 c.715 §3]

 

      166.735 Short title; construction. (1) ORS 166.715 to 166.735 may be cited as the Oregon Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 166.715 to 166.735 shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes. [1981 c.769 §§1,7; 1983 c.715 §4]
