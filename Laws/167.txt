A person who engages in bookmaking is not a player.

A device so constructed or readily adaptable or convertible to such use is no less a slot machine because it is not in working order or because some mechanical act of manipulation or repair is required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability. Nor is it any less a slot machine because apart from its use or adaptability as such it may also sell or deliver something of value on the basis other than chance.

      (b) “Slot machine” does not include any device authorized by the Oregon State Lottery Commission for:

      (A) Display and demonstration purposes only at trade shows; or

OFFENSES AGAINST ANIMALS

 

      167.305 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Animals are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, stress and fear;

      (2) Animals should be cared for in ways that minimize pain, stress, fear and suffering;

      (3) The suffering of animals can be mitigated by expediting the disposition of abused animals that would otherwise languish in cages while their defendant owners await trial;

      (4) The suffering of animals at the hands of unlicensed animal rescue organizations that are unable to provide sufficient food and care for the animals can be reduced by requiring such organizations to comply with regulations;

      (5) The State of Oregon has an interest in facilitating the mitigation of costs of care incurred by a government agency, a humane investigation agency or its agent or a person that provides treatment for impounded animals;

      (6) A government agency, a humane investigation agency or its agent or a person that provides care and treatment for impounded or seized animals:

      (a) Has an interest in mitigating the costs of the care and treatment in order to ensure the swift and thorough rehabilitation of the animals; and

      (b) May mitigate the costs of the care and treatment through funding that is separate from, and in addition to, any recovery of reasonable costs that a court orders a defendant to pay while a forfeiture proceeding is pending or subsequent to a conviction;

      (7) Use of preconviction civil remedies is not an affront to the presumption of innocence; and

      (8) Amendments to current law are needed to ensure that interested parties are afforded adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard and thus cannot unduly delay or impede animal lien foreclosure and preconviction forfeiture processes through unfounded due process claims. [2013 c.719 §1; 2017 c.677 §1]

The sentencing court shall further order that for five years the person must consent to reasonable inspections by law enforcement and the United States Department of Agriculture to ensure the welfare of the livestock under the person’s custody or control. A refusal to consent to a reasonable inspection described in this paragraph is contempt of court and, if the person is found in contempt, shall result in the sentencing court revoking the waiver of the possession prohibition.

The agency may not, however, place the animal with family members or friends of the former owner who aided or abetted the criminal conduct underlying the forfeiture or had knowledge of the criminal conduct and failed to intervene. As a condition of placement, the agency shall require the new owner to execute an agreement to provide minimum care to the animal. The agreement must indicate that allowing the former owner to possess the animal constitutes a crime.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the agency may not place the animal with any person who resides with the former owner. [1995 c.369 §3; 2009 c.273 §1; 2013 c.719 §8]

      (b) If a government agency or a humane investigation agency or its agent provides care and treatment for impounded or seized animals, a court that orders a defendant to repay reasonable costs of care under paragraph (a) of this subsection may not reduce the incurred cost amount based on the agency having received donations or other funding for the care.

      (2)(a) When the court orders the defendant’s rights in the animal to be forfeited, the court may further order that those rights be given over to an appropriate person or agency demonstrating a willingness to accept and care for the animal or to the county or an appropriate animal care agency for further disposition in accordance with accepted practices for humane treatment of animals. The court may not transfer the defendant’s rights in the animal to any person who resides with the defendant.

      (b) This subsection does not limit the right of the person or agency to whom rights are granted to resell or otherwise make disposition of the animal. A transfer of rights under this subsection constitutes a transfer of ownership. The court shall require a person to whom rights are granted to execute an agreement to provide minimum care to the animal. The agreement must indicate that allowing the defendant to possess the animal constitutes a crime.

      (3) In addition to and not in lieu of any other sentence it may impose, a court may order the owner or person having custody of an animal to repay any reasonable costs incurred by a government agency, a humane investigation agency or its agent or a person in providing minimum care to the animal that are not included in a repayment order under subsection (1) of this section.
