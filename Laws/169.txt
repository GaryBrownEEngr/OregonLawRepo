LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES

 

      169.030 Construction, maintenance and use of local correctional facilities by county and city; renting suitable structure; provision of facilities by another county or city. (1) Every county and city in this state shall provide, keep and maintain within or without the county or city, as the case may be, a local correctional facility for the reception and confinement of prisoners committed thereto. The local correctional facility shall be constructed of fireproof materials and should have fire exits in sufficient number and suitably located for the removal of prisoners.

      (2) Any county, or incorporated city may rent or lease any structure answering the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, either in connection with or separately from any other county or city building.

      (3) Any county and any incorporated city may, by agreement, provide, maintain, and use for their separate requirements, such a local correctional facility as is required by this section.

      (4) Any county or incorporated city may, by agreement with any other county or incorporated city, provide for one such county or city to furnish local correctional facility accommodations for the imprisonment of prisoners of the other such county or city. Pursuant to such agreement, an Oregon county or city may secure the use of jail accommodations outside the state, but only in a county that adjoins the Oregon county or the county in which the Oregon city is located.

      (5) The jail accommodations provided by or furnished to a county under this section shall be considered to be jail accommodations of the county for purposes of ORS 135.215, 137.167 and 137.330. [Amended by 1963 c.236 §2; 1973 c.740 §10; 1987 c.550 §1]

 

      169.040 Inspection of local correctional facilities. (1) The county court or board of county commissioners of each county is the inspector of the local correctional facilities in the county. The court or board shall visit local correctional facilities operated by the county at least once in each regular term and may visit local correctional facilities within the county that are not operated by the county. When the court or board visits a local correctional facility, it shall examine fully into the local correctional facility, including, but not limited to, the cleanliness of the facility and the health and discipline of the persons confined. If it appears to the court or board that any provisions of law have been violated or neglected, it shall immediately give notice of the violation or neglect to the district attorney of the district.

      (2) The local health officer or the representative of the local health officer may conduct health and sanitation inspections of local correctional facilities on a semiannual basis. If the local health officer determines that the facility is in an insanitary condition or unfit for habitation for health reasons, the officer may notify the appropriate local governmental agency in writing of the required health and sanitation conditions or practices necessary to ensure the health and sanitation of the facility. If the local governmental agency does not comply with the required health and sanitation conditions or practices within an appropriate length of time, the local health officer may recommend the suspension of the operation of the local correctional facility to the local public health authority, as defined in ORS 431.003. If after a hearing the local public health authority finds that the local correctional facility is in an insanitary or unhealthful condition, it may suspend the operation of the facility until such time as the local correctional facility complies with the recommended health and sanitation conditions and practices. [Amended by 1973 c.740 §11; 2005 c.286 §1; 2015 c.736 §52]

 

      169.042 Maximum facility population; recommendation. The county court or board of commissioners of a county may institute an examination of the county’s local correctional facility for the purpose of obtaining a recommendation regarding the maximum number of inmates that should be held in the facility. This recommendation shall be based on consideration of the following:

      (1) The advice of the district attorney, county counsel and sheriff concerning prevailing constitutional standards relating to conditions of incarceration;

      (2) The design capacity of the local correctional facility;

      (3) The physical condition of the local correctional facility; and

      (4) The programs provided for inmates of the local correctional facility. [1989 c.884 §2]

 

      169.044 Action on recommendation. When the county court or board has received a recommendation pursuant to ORS 169.042, it shall either:

      (1) Reject the recommendation and decline to adopt a limit on the number of inmates that may be held in the local correctional facility; or

      (2) Adopt the recommendation and, after consultation with the officials listed in ORS 169.046 (1), issue an order establishing the maximum allowable number of inmates that may be held in the local correctional facility. This shall include specific standards for determining a county jail population emergency and a specific plan for resolving the emergency. [1989 c.884 §3]

 

      169.046 Notice of county jail population emergency; action to be taken; notification if release of inmates likely; forced release. (1) If a county court or board adopts a jail capacity limit under ORS 169.044 and the number of inmates in its local correctional facility exceeds that capacity limit so that a county jail population emergency exists, the sheriff shall notify the presiding circuit judge, each municipal court judge and justice of the peace in the county, the district attorney for the county, the county counsel, the chief law enforcement officer for each city located in the county and the county court or board of commissioners that the number of inmates in the local correctional facility has exceeded capacity and that a county jail population emergency exists.

      (2) If the county court or board has adopted a jail capacity limit and action plan under ORS 169.044 and if a county jail population emergency occurs under the terms of the plan, the county court or board and the county sheriff may carry out the steps of the plan. This includes any authorization, under the plan, for the sheriff to order inmates released in order to reduce the jail population. A sheriff shall be immune from criminal or civil liability for any good faith release of inmates under ORS 169.042 to 169.046.

      (3) If it becomes necessary to order inmates released under ORS 169.042 to 169.046, or if it appears to the sheriff that release of inmates is likely to become necessary in the near future, the sheriff shall immediately notify all police agencies in the county to make maximum use of citations in lieu of custody pursuant to ORS 133.055 to 133.076 until further notice.

      (4) If it becomes necessary to order the release of inmates under ORS 169.042 to 169.046, the sheriff may place inmates on forced release subject to a forced release agreement. A forced release agreement must be in writing and be signed by the sheriff and the inmate and must include:

      (a) The date of the next court appearance of the inmate;

      (b) A statement that the inmate is required to appear at the next court appearance; and

      (c) A statement that failure of the inmate to appear at the next court appearance is subject to prosecution under ORS 162.195 or 162.205. [1989 c.884 §§4,5,6; 1999 c.1051 §71; 2001 c.517 §2]

 

      169.050 Contracts for boarding of prisoners. The county court or board of county commissioners of each county in this state, not having more than 300,000 inhabitants, shall advertise for bids for boarding of prisoners confined in the county local correctional facilities of the county, and may award the contract for boarding them to the lowest responsible bidder. If any responsible bidder, other than the sheriff, receives the contract from the county for the boarding of prisoners, such bidder shall receive compensation for boarding such prisoners rather than the sheriff, and the sheriff shall afford to such bidder all facilities for carrying out the county’s contract for boarding prisoners. [Amended by 1973 c.740 §12]

 

      169.053 Agreements with other counties or Department of Corrections for confinement and detention of offenders.

      (B) Sanctioned, on or after January 1, 1997, by a court or the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision to 12 months or less incarceration for a violation of a condition of parole, probation or post-prison supervision.

      (3) An agreement entered into under ORS 190.110 and subsection (2) of this section shall include a provision that the county reimburse the Department of Corrections for its costs incurred in confining the county inmate. Reimbursement shall be made on a per diem basis at a rate determined by the department to be its average daily incarceration cost per inmate. In lieu of reimbursement, the department and county may enter into an agreement providing for the comparable exchange of inmates as determined by the department. [1996 c.4 §1]

      (2) Nothing in this section requires the Department of Corrections to incarcerate a county prisoner in a Department of Corrections facility.

      (3) A county prisoner poses an unusual security risk under this section if the prisoner poses a level of risk of violence or escape that exceeds the security level of the county facility. The risk of violence or escape may result from or be manifested by:

REGIONAL FACILITIES

 

      169.610 Policy. It is the policy of the Legislative Assembly to encourage better rehabilitative care to misdemeanants by encouraging the establishment of regional correctional facilities that can effectively provide a program that not only includes better custodial facilities than can be provided by cities or counties individually, but also that can provide work release, educational and other types of leave, and parole supervision by the Department of Corrections. [1971 c.636 §1; 1987 c.320 §99]

 

      169.620 “Regional correctional facility” defined. As used in ORS 169.610 to 169.677, “regional correctional facility” means a correctional facility operated pursuant to agreement as described in ORS 169.630 and used to house prisoners of the parties to the agreement, such prisoners having either pretrial or post-trial status. [1971 c.636 §2; 1985 c.708 §2]

 

      169.630 Joint establishment or operation of facilities; agreement. (1) Two or more counties, two or more cities, any combination of them, or the State of Oregon in combination with one or more cities or counties or both, may by agreement entered into pursuant to ORS 190.003 to 190.620, construct, acquire or equip, or may by such agreement operate, a regional correctional facility.

      (2) An agreement pursuant to this section shall set forth at least:

      (a) The party or combination of parties to the agreement that shall be responsible for the operation and administration of the facility;

      (b) The amount of funding to be contributed by each party toward the construction or acquisition and equipping of the facility, or toward the operation of the facility, or toward both, as the case may be; and

      (c) The number of beds to be reserved to the use of each party to the agreement. [1971 c.636 §3; 1985 c.708 §3]

 

      169.640 Status of facility for custody of misdemeanants and violators. (1) For purposes of sentencing and custody of a misdemeanant, a regional correctional facility shall be considered a county local correctional facility.

      (2) For purposes of sentencing or custody of a person for violating a city ordinance, the regional correctional facility shall be considered a city local correctional facility. [1971 c.636 §4; 1973 c.740 §27]

 

      169.650 Status of facility operated by Department of Corrections. A regional correctional facility operated under agreement by the Department of Corrections is not a state institution but it may be located in the same buildings as are used for a facility authorized by ORS 421.805. [1971 c.636 §7; 1987 c.320 §100]

 

      169.660 Status of persons confined in facility operated by Department of Corrections; assignment to regional facility. (1) Persons confined in a regional correctional facility operated by the Department of Corrections shall be considered to be in the custody of the department and shall be subject to such rules as the department may prescribe.

      (2) Persons committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections may be assigned to Department of Corrections bedspace at a regional correctional facility when the department is a party to the operation of the facility. Prisoners so assigned are subject to such rules as the department may prescribe and shall be considered to remain in the custody of the department regardless of whether, pursuant to agreement, the regional correctional facility is or is not under the actual administration of the department. [1971 c.636 §5; 1985 c.708 §4; 1987 c.320 §101]

 

      169.670 Transfer of persons to facility operated by Department of Corrections; costs; return; exception. Whenever the governing body of a county or city transfers a misdemeanant or violator or a person with pretrial or post-trial status to a regional correctional facility operated by the Department of Corrections, the county or city shall pay the cost of transportation to and from the facility and other expenses incidental thereto, including the expenses of law enforcement officers accompanying the misdemeanant, violator or person with pretrial or post-trial status. The Department of Corrections shall cause at the expense of the county or city, each misdemeanant, violator or person with pretrial or post-trial status transferred to its custody under ORS 169.660 to be returned upon request of the governing body of the county or city. However, such return is not required when the release is pursuant to work release or parole where other arrangements have been made for the placement of the misdemeanant, violator or person with pretrial or post-trial status. [1971 c.636 §6; 1987 c.320 §102]

 

      169.673 Conversion of state correctional institutions into regional correctional facilities. (1) The Department of Corrections shall negotiate with Marion County and Umatilla County, respectively, the conversion of Oregon State Correctional Institution and Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution into regional correctional facilities to house both state and county prisoners. The department shall include in the negotiations any other nearby counties desiring to participate in the operation of the regional correctional facility.

      (2) If agreement is reached with Marion County, in the case of the Oregon State Correctional Institution, and with Umatilla County, in the case of Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution, the department shall proceed to operate those institutions, or either of them as to which agreement is negotiated, as regional correctional facilities according to the terms of the agreement. [1985 c.708 §6; 1987 c.320 §103]

 

      169.677 Converted facilities to house felony or misdemeanant prisoners. If a Department of Corrections institution is made to operate as a regional correctional facility pursuant to agreement under ORS 169.673, the purposes of the institution shall include the imprisonment of either felony or misdemeanant prisoners, or both, of the parties to the agreement under which the facility is operated. [1985 c.708 §7; 1987 c.320 §104]

 

      169.680 [1971 c.636 §8; repealed by 1985 c.708 §9]
