      (2) The person appointed under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall be a citizen qualified to hold the office, an elector of the affected legislative district and a member of the same political party for at least 180 days before the date on which the vacancy occurred. The political affiliation of a person appointed under subsection (1) of this section shall be determined under ORS 236.100. The appointment shall be made by the county courts or boards of county commissioners of the affected counties pursuant to ORS 171.060 to 171.064. When the provisions of ORS 171.060 (1) are applicable, the appointment shall be made from a list of not fewer than three nor more than five nominees who have signed written statements indicating that they are willing to serve furnished by the Secretary of State. If fewer than three names of nominees are furnished, a list shall not be considered to have been submitted and the county courts or boards of county commissioners shall fill the vacancy. The vacancy must be filled by appointment within 30 days after its occurrence or not later than the time set for the convening of the special session described in subsection (1)(e) of this section when that is the basis for filling the vacancy.

      (3) If the appointing authority required by this section to fill the vacancy does not do so within the time allowed, the Governor shall fill the vacancy by appointment within 10 days.

      (4) Notwithstanding any appointment under the provisions of subsection (1)(c) of this section, when a vacancy occurs in the office of a state Senator before the 61st day before the first general election to be held during that term of office, the remaining two years of the term of office shall be filled by the electors of the affected legislative district at the first general election.

      (5) Candidates for the remaining two years of the term of office of a state Senator under subsection (4) of this section shall be nominated as provided in ORS chapter 249, with major political parties following the procedure set forth in ORS 249.200, except as follows:

[1981 c.517 §3 (enacted in lieu of 171.050); 1985 c.771 §1; 1987 c.380 §1; 1989 c.207 §1; 1995 c.607 §59; 2018 c.86 §1]

 

      171.060 Procedure for filling vacancy by appointment. (1) When any vacancy as is mentioned in ORS 171.051 exists in the office of Senator or Representative affiliated with a major political party and that vacancy is to be filled by an appointing authority as provided in ORS 171.051, the Secretary of State forthwith shall notify the person designated by the party to receive such notice. The party shall pursuant to party rule nominate not fewer than three nor more than five qualified persons to fill the vacancy. The nominating procedure shall reflect the principle of one-person, one-vote to accord voting weight in proportion to the number of party members represented. At the request of a party making a nomination, the county clerks of each county constituting the district in which the vacancy exists shall assist the party in determining the number of electors registered as members of the party in the district. A person shall not be nominated to fill the vacancy unless the person signs a written statement indicating that the person is willing to serve in the office of Senator or Representative. As soon as the nominees have been appointed, but no later than 20 days after the vacancy occurs, the party shall notify the Secretary of State of the persons nominated. The notification shall be accompanied by the signed written statement of each nominee indicating that the nominee is willing to serve in the office of Senator or Representative. The Secretary of State shall notify the county courts or boards of county commissioners of the counties constituting the district in which the vacancy exists of the nominees and of the number of votes apportioned to each member of the county courts or boards of county commissioners under ORS 171.062 and 171.064. The Secretary of State shall set a time for the meeting of the county courts or boards of county commissioners in order to fill the vacancy and by rule shall establish procedures for the conduct of the meeting. If the district is composed of more than one county, the Secretary of State shall name a temporary chairperson and designate a meeting place within the district where the county courts or boards of county commissioners shall convene for the purpose of filling the vacancy, pursuant to ORS 171.051 (2).

      (2) When any vacancy as is mentioned in ORS 171.051 exists in the office of Senator or Representative not affiliated with a major political party and that vacancy is to be filled by an appointing authority as provided in ORS 171.051, the Secretary of State forthwith shall notify the county courts or boards of county commissioners of the counties constituting the district in which the vacancy occurs of the vacancy and of the number of votes apportioned to each member of the county courts or boards of county commissioners under ORS 171.062 and 171.064. The Secretary of State shall set a time for a meeting of the county courts or boards of county commissioners and by rule shall establish procedures for the conduct of the meeting. If the district is composed of more than one county, the Secretary of State shall name a temporary chairperson and designate a meeting place within the district where the county courts or boards of county commissioners shall convene for the purpose of appointing a person to fill the vacancy.

      (3) A written statement signed by a majority of those qualified to vote upon the filling of any vacancy naming the person selected to fill the vacancy and directed to the Secretary of State is conclusive evidence of the filling of the vacancy by the appointing authority named therein. [Amended by 1955 c.211 §6; 1973 c.773 §2; 1975 c.779 §2; 1977 c.302 §1; 1985 c.771 §2; 1987 c.380 §2; 1989 c.207 §2; 1993 c.797 §17]

 

      171.062 Filling vacancies in multicounty legislative districts. (1) When a legislative district in which a vacancy occurs encompasses two or more counties, each county shall be entitled to one vote for each 1,000 of its electors or major fraction thereof residing within the legislative district at the time when either the office becomes vacant, or a resignation becomes binding under ORS 236.325, whichever occurs first. However, any county having electors in the district shall be entitled to at least one vote.

      (2) A major fraction of electors shall be a number greater than 500 but less than 1,000. [Formerly 248.175; 2019 c.675 §9]

 

      171.064 Apportioning votes for filling vacancies in multicounty legislative districts. The number of votes apportioned to each county commissioner in filling a legislative vacancy shall be equal to the total number allotted to the respective county of the county commissioner in the manner set forth in ORS 171.062 divided by the total number of county commissioners of the respective county. [Formerly 248.180]

 

      171.068 Procedure when vacancy filled after reapportionment. (1) For purposes of ORS 171.060, 171.062 and 171.064, the county court or the board of county commissioners which shall fill the vacancy in the Legislative Assembly in a district created by reapportionment shall be the county court or board of county commissioners of each county any part of which is in the district that is created by the reapportionment and includes the residence from which the former Senator or Representative was elected.

      (2) Each person nominated by a major political party to fill a vacancy in the Legislative Assembly occurring as described by ORS 171.051 in a district created by reapportionment must be registered to vote in the district from which the former Senator or Representative was elected and must have been a member of the same major political party at least 180 days before the date the vacancy to be filled occurred.

      (3) This section shall apply only to a vacancy in the Legislative Assembly occurring after the primary election next following reapportionment and before a person has been elected and qualified to fill the vacancy. [1983 c.25 §1; 1985 c.771 §3; 1987 c.267 §62; 1987 c.380 §3; 1993 c.797 §18; 1995 c.712 §81]

      (5) In addition to the mileage and per diem expense payments provided by this section, a member of the Legislative Assembly may receive reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses, subject to approval by the President of the Senate or Speaker of the House of Representatives, for legislative business outside of the state.

      (6) The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives may delegate to the chairpersons of interim and statutory committees and task forces the approval authority granted to the President and the Speaker by subsection (4) of this section, with respect to expenses incurred in attending any meeting of a particular committee or task force.

      (7) Amounts received under subsections (3) to (5) of this section are excluded from gross income and expenditures of the amounts are excluded in computing deductions for purposes of ORS chapter 316.

Expenses of members of the Legislative Assembly who are reimbursed by the state for actual expenses for meals and lodging associated with state travel for the same period during which a legislator receives per diem are subject to state income tax.

      (8) For periods when the Legislative Assembly is not in session, a member of the Legislative Assembly shall receive an expense allowance that is in addition to the amount allowed under subsection (4) of this section.

      (3) The regular employment position of a member or prospective member on leave of absence under this section shall only be deemed vacant for the period of such leave of absence, and the member or prospective member shall not be subject to removal or discharge from such position as a consequence of such leave of absence.

      (4) Upon the termination of the leave of absence of the member or prospective member under this section, a member or prospective member shall be restored to the regular employment position the member or prospective member held immediately prior to the first day of the leave of absence if such position still exists, or, if such position does not still exist, to as similar a position as possible, without loss of seniority, the right to participate in insurance or any other employment benefits, other than wages for services not rendered during the leave of absence, as a consequence of the leave of absence of the member or prospective member. Such seniority, right to participate in insurance or other employment benefits shall continue to accumulate during the leave of absence as though the member or prospective member had continued in employment continuously in the regular employment position the member or prospective member held immediately prior to the first day of the leave of absence of the member or prospective member.

      (A) Fifteen days after adjournment sine die of the Legislative Assembly following a regular session; or

      (B) If the leave was for a lesser period for another legislative assignment, five days after the assignment is completed.

      (d) The regular employment position of the member or prospective member immediately prior to the first day of the leave of absence or the character, terms, conditions or activities of such position are incompatible under the Constitution and laws of this state with the office of member of the Legislative Assembly.

      (e) Employment is on a temporary basis.

      (f) The employer employs fewer than 10 persons immediately prior to the first day of the leave of absence.

      (6) As used in this section, “prospective member” means a person who is certified or appointed to serve in the Legislative Assembly but who has not taken the oath of office. [1957 c.549 §2; 1989 c.1066 §1; 1991 c.454 §2]

STATE BUDGET POLICY

 

      171.557 State budget policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that there is a need for a comprehensive, specific budget format available to all members of the Legislative Assembly so that:

      (a) Effective policy decisions can be made;

      (b) Line items in agency budgets can be identified by program function;

      (c) Decisions to increase or decrease agency budgets can be made with knowledge as to policy and programmatic impact; and

      (d) A more objective comparison can be made to the Governor’s budget.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly also finds that the goal of the legislative budgeting process is to afford members a thorough understanding of:

      (a) The policies of state government regarding the definition and delivery of state services;

      (b) What program functions are necessary to state operations and the cost of these functions; and

      (c) The means whereby these policies and programs are administered.

      (3) The goal of the Legislative Assembly is to decide, as a body, which policies and programs are necessary to discharge its public responsibilities. Consequently, the Legislative Assembly finds that there is a need to examine the legislative budgeting process so that:

      (a) Policy decisions are made by the Legislative Assembly as a whole;

      (b) Program functions are more closely identified with line items in agency budgets;

      (c) Funding options and priorities are defined in terms of policies; and

      (d) Legislative budgeting identifies programs which are necessary in terms of policies and state responsibilities, as opposed to the need to maintain existing program activities. [1989 c.652 §1; 2016 c.117 §37; subsection (4) renumbered 171.558 in 2019]

 

      171.558 Furnishing budget information to Oregon Department of Administrative Services; confidentiality; exception.

STUDIES OF MANDATED HEALTH COVERAGE

 

      171.870 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly takes notice of the increasing number of legislative proposals for mandating certain health coverages, whether such proposals mandate payments for certain providers of health care or mandate the offering of health coverages by insurance carriers and health care service contractors as a component of individual or group policies. Improved access to these health care services to segments of the population who desire them may provide social and health consequences that are beneficial and in the public interest.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly also takes notice of the fact that the cost ramifications of expanding health coverages is resulting in a growing public concern. The way that the coverages are structured and the steps taken to create incentives to provide cost-effective services or to take advantage of features of services that offset costs can significantly affect the cost of mandating particular coverages.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly hereby finds and declares the following:

      (a) The merits of a particular coverage mandate must be balanced against a variety of consequences that may go far beyond the immediate effect upon the cost of insurance coverage.

      (b) A systematic review of legislation proposing mandated or mandatorily offered health coverage that explores all ramifications of the proposed legislation will assist the Legislative Assembly determining whether mandating a particular coverage or offering is in the public interest. [1985 c.747 §55]

 

      171.875 Report required to accompany measures proposing mandated coverage. Every proposed legislative measure that mandates a health insurance coverage, whether by requiring payment for certain providers or by requiring an offering of a health insurance coverage by an insurer or health care service contractor as a component of individual or group health insurance policies, shall be accompanied by a report that assesses both the social and financial effects of the coverage in the manner provided in ORS 171.880, including the efficacy of the treatment or service proposed. The report may be prepared either by the chief sponsor or by any other proponent of the proposed measure. The report shall be submitted with the proposed measure when the proposed measure is submitted for filing, and shall be in writing and be a public record. [1985 c.747 §56]

 

      171.880 Content of report. The report required under ORS 171.875, to the extent that information is available, shall include but need not be limited to the following:

      (1) Answers to the following questions concerning the social effect of the proposed measure:

      (a) To what extent is the treatment or service used by the general population of Oregon?

      (b) To what extent is the insurance coverage already generally available in Oregon?

      (c) What proportion of the population of Oregon already has such coverage?

      (d) To what extent does the lack of coverage result in financial hardship in Oregon?

      (e) What evidence exists to document the medical need in Oregon for the proposed treatment or services?
