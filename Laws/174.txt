CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTES

 

      174.010 General rule for construction of statutes. In the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted; and where there are several provisions or particulars such construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.

 

      174.020 Legislative intent; general and particular provisions; consideration of legislative history. (1)(a) In the construction of a statute, a court shall pursue the intention of the legislature if possible.

      (b) To assist a court in its construction of a statute, a party may offer the legislative history of the statute.

      (2) When a general provision and a particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former so that a particular intent controls a general intent that is inconsistent with the particular intent.

      (3) A court may limit its consideration of legislative history to the information that the parties provide to the court. A court shall give the weight to the legislative history that the court considers to be appropriate. [Amended by 2001 c.438 §1; 2017 c.17 §16]

 

      174.030 Construction favoring natural right to prevail. Where a statute is equally susceptible of two interpretations, one in favor of natural right and the other against it, the former is to prevail.

 

      174.040 Severability. It shall be considered that it is the legislative intent, in the enactment of any statute, that if any part of the statute is held unconstitutional, the remaining parts shall remain in force unless:

      (1) The statute provides otherwise;

      (2) The remaining parts are so essentially and inseparably connected with and dependent upon the unconstitutional part that it is apparent that the remaining parts would not have been enacted without the unconstitutional part; or

      (3) The remaining parts, standing alone, are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.

 

      174.050 [Repealed by 1983 c.740 §41]

 

      174.060 Effect of amendment of statute adopted by reference. When one statute refers to another, either by general or by specific reference or designation, the reference shall extend to and include, in addition to the statute to which reference was made, amendments thereto and statutes enacted expressly in lieu thereof unless a contrary intent is expressed specifically or unless the amendment to, or statute enacted in lieu of, the statute referred to is substantially different in the nature of its essential provisions from what the statute to which reference was made was when the statute making the reference was enacted.

 

      174.070 Effect of repeal of validating or curative Act. The repeal of a validating or curative Act shall not affect any validation or cure theretofore accomplished.

 

      174.080 Effect of repeal of repealing Act. Whenever a statute which repealed a former statute, either expressly or by implication, is repealed, the former statute shall not thereby be revived unless it is expressly so provided.

 

      174.090 Effect of repeal of repealing constitutional provision. Whenever a constitutional provision which repeals or suspends in whole or in part a former constitutional provision, either expressly or by implication, is repealed, the former constitutional provision so repealed or suspended thereby shall not be revived unless it expressly is so provided.

COMPUTATION OF TIME

 

      174.120 Computation of time; leap year. (1) The time within which an act is to be done, as provided in the civil and criminal procedure statutes, is computed by excluding the first day and including the last day, unless the last day falls upon any legal holiday or on Saturday, in which case the last day is also excluded.

      (2) For the purposes of determining whether a person has complied with a statutory time limitation governing an act to be performed in a circuit court, the Oregon Tax Court, the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, the time prescribed by law for the performance of the act does not include the day on which the specified period begins to run. The designated period does include the last day unless the last day is:

      (a) A legal holiday or Saturday;

      (b) A day on which the court is closed for the purpose of filing pleadings and other documents;

      (c) A day on which the court is closed by order of the Chief Justice, to the extent provided by the order; or

      (d) A day on which the court is closed before the end of the normal hours during which pleadings and other documents may be filed.

      (3) If the last day of a designated period is excluded under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, the act must be performed on the next day that the court is open for the purpose of filing pleadings and other documents.

      (4) The provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section apply to time limitations established by statutes of limitation and other procedural statutes governing civil and criminal proceedings.

      (5) If a statute of limitation or other procedural statute governing civil or criminal proceedings provides that an act be done within one or more years, the time for performing the act is computed in calendar years. If the specified period begins to run on a date other than February 29, the act must be done on or before the same date in the calendar year in which the specified period ends as the date in the calendar year in which the specified period began to run. If the specified period of time begins to run on February 29, the act must be done on or before February 28 of the calendar year in which the specified period ends.

      174.530 Construction of statutes enacted as part of 1953 revision. The statute laws described in ORS 174.510 (1) are intended to speak for themselves. All sections of the statute laws so described are considered to speak as of the same date, except that in cases of conflict between two or more sections or of an ambiguity in a section, reference may be had to the Acts from which the sections are derived, for the purpose of applying the rules of construction relating to repeal or amendment by implication or for the purpose of resolving the ambiguity. [1953 c.3 §3; 1961 c.90 §4]

 

      174.535 Construction of reviser’s bills. It is the policy of the Legislative Assembly to revise sections from Oregon Revised Statutes and Oregon law periodically in order to maintain accuracy.

[Derived from 1983 c.740 §1; 1985 c.565 §1; 1987 c.158 §1; 1989 c.171 §1; 1991 c.67 §1; 1991 c.927 §1; 1993 c.18 §1; 1993 c.469 §1; 1995 c.79 §1; 1997 c.249 §1; 1999 c.59 §1; 2001 c.104 §1; 2003 c.14 §1; 2005 c.22 §1; 2007 c.71 §1; 2009 c.11 §1; 2011 c.9 §1; 2013 c.1 §1; 2015 c.27 §1; 2017 c.17 §1; 2019 c.13 §1]

 

      174.540 Parts of printed statute editions not part of the law. Title heads, chapter heads, division heads, section and subsection heads or titles and explanatory notes, in the statute laws described in ORS 174.510 (1) and in parts of Oregon Revised Statutes, do not constitute any part of the law. [1953 c.3 §4; 1961 c.90 §5; 2013 c.1 §15]

 

      174.550 Statute revision of 1953 substituted for statutes repealed by ORS 174.520.

[1953 c.3 §5; 1961 c.90 §6]

 

      174.560 [1953 c.3 §8; repealed by 1961 c.90 §7]

 

      174.580 Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure; citation form. (1) As used in the statute laws of this state, including provisions of law deemed to be rules of court as provided in ORS 1.745, “Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure” means the rules adopted, amended or supplemented as provided in ORS 1.735.

      (2) In citing a specific rule of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure, the designation “ORCP (number of rule)” may be used. For example, Rule 7, section D, subsection (3), paragraph (a), subparagraph (iv), part (A), may be cited as ORCP 7 D(3)(a)(iv)(A). [1979 c.284 §4; 1993 c.18 §30; 2011 c.9 §9]

 

      174.590 Statutory terminology not intended to preserve procedural distinctions between actions and suits.
