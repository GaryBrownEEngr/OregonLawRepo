      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares it the policy of Oregon to assist the President of the United States in effective management and control of such factors and situations as contribute to an emergency affecting or likely to affect Oregon; to cooperate with other states in matters related to an emergency affecting or likely to affect Oregon; to meet extraordinary conditions in Oregon arising out of the crisis, by taking such steps as are necessary and appropriate; and generally to protect the peace, health, safety and welfare of the people of Oregon. [1974 c.5 §1]

No subpoena or judicial order may be issued compelling the Governor or any other person to divulge or make known such confidential information, except when relevant to a prosecution for violation of subsection (5) of this section.

      (2) Nothing in this section prohibits use of confidential information to prepare statistics or other general data for publication, so presented as to prevent identification of particular persons.

      (3) Any person who is served with a subpoena to give testimony orally or in writing or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements or other documents or records as provided in ORS 176.750 to 176.815 may apply to any circuit court in Oregon for protection against abuse or hardship in the manner provided in ORCP 36 C.

      176.785 Proclamation of state of emergency. Whenever the Governor determines that an existing or imminent severe disruption in the supply of one or more energy resources, in Oregon or elsewhere, threatens the availability of essential services, transportation or the operation of the economy, jeopardizing the peace, health, safety and welfare of the people of Oregon, after consultation with the President and majority and minority leaders of the Senate and the Speaker and majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives, the Governor may by proclamation declare that a state of emergency exists with regard to such resources. In the proclamation, the Governor shall recite with specificity the nature of the severe disruption in the supply of one or more energy resources. [1974 c.5 §8]

However, the Governor may not order such curtailments, adjustments or allocations which discriminate within any class of consumers. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that any such curtailments, adjustments and allocations be ordered and continue only so long as demonstrably necessary for the maintenance of essential services or transportation, or the continued operation of the economy; and that all such curtailments, adjustments and allocations be applied as uniformly as practicable within each class of suppliers and consumers.

      (2) Any involuntary curtailments of electrical or natural gas load, pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, shall be made by executive order to the Public Utility Commission of Oregon requiring the commission to implement plans for curtailment adopted pursuant to ORS 757.710 to 757.730.

      (b) Specify the times and manner in which energy resources are supplied or consumed, consistent with the restrictions imposed by subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) Any restrictions or involuntary curtailments, adjustments or allocations ordered, except those ordered under ORS 176.775 and 176.780, shall give due consideration to the needs of commercial, retail, professional and service establishments whose normal function is to supply goods or services or both of an essential nature including but not limited to food, lodging, fuel, medical care facilities, during times of the day other than conventional daytime working hours.

      176.800 Construction of ORS 176.750 to 176.815. (1) Nothing in ORS 176.750 to 176.815 is intended as a delegation of legislative responsibility for the appropriation or authorization of expenditure of public funds, as provided in the Constitution and laws of this state.

      (2) The powers vested in the Governor under ORS 176.750 to 176.815 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, emergency powers vested in the Governor under ORS chapter 401 or any other law of Oregon.

      (2) Any such proceeding in the Court of Appeals shall be given precedence on the docket over all other cases, except prior cases arising under ORS 176.750 to 176.815 and 176.990.

(1) The Governor, in consultation with the State Department of Energy and the Oregon Business Development Department, shall compile existing data and prepare an extensive statewide contingency plan to maintain emergency services, continue productivity and reduce hardship during an energy emergency.

      (2) As used in this section, “energy emergency” means a severe fuel oil shortage caused by international market conditions or hostilities, or any other emergency threatening the availability of any energy resource necessary to maintain essential services and transportation, the shortage of which jeopardizes the health, safety and welfare of the people of the State of Oregon. [1981 c.597 §2]

[Formerly 176.810; 2003 c.186 §9]

Specific ORS references have not been substituted, pursuant to 173.160. These sections may be determined by referring to the 1975 Comparative Section Table located in Volume 22 of ORS.
