      176.750 “Energy resources” defined. As used in ORS 176.750 to 176.815, unless the context requires otherwise, “energy resources” includes electricity, natural gas, petroleum, coal, wood fuels, geothermal sources, radioactive materials and any other resource yielding energy. [1974 c.5 §2]

 

      176.755 Policy.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds it necessary to provide an orderly procedure for anticipating and responding to energy resource shortages and to grant, under conditions prescribed in ORS 176.750 to 176.815, emergency powers to order involuntary curtailments in the use of energy resources to the Governor and other state and local officers.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares it the policy of Oregon to assist the President of the United States in effective management and control of such factors and situations as contribute to an emergency affecting or likely to affect Oregon; to cooperate with other states in matters related to an emergency affecting or likely to affect Oregon; to meet extraordinary conditions in Oregon arising out of the crisis, by taking such steps as are necessary and appropriate; and generally to protect the peace, health, safety and welfare of the people of Oregon. [1974 c.5 §1]

 

      176.760 Information to be available to Governor. (1) On a continuing basis the Governor may obtain all necessary information from energy resource producers, suppliers and consumers, doing business within Oregon, and from political subdivisions in this state, as necessary for the Governor to determine whether shortages or an emergency will require energy resource conservation measures.

      (3) In obtaining information under this section the Governor:

      (a) Shall seek to avoid eliciting information already furnished by a person or political subdivision in this state to a federal, state or local regulatory authority that is available for the study of the Governor; and

      176.765 Confidentiality of information; use; liability.

The Governor shall not make known in any manner any particulars of such information to persons other than those specified in subsection (4) of this section. No subpoena or judicial order may be issued compelling the Governor or any other person to divulge or make known such confidential information, except when relevant to a prosecution for violation of subsection (5) of this section.

      (2) Nothing in this section prohibits use of confidential information to prepare statistics or other general data for publication, so presented as to prevent identification of particular persons.

      (3) Any person who is served with a subpoena to give testimony orally or in writing or to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements or other documents or records as provided in ORS 176.750 to 176.815 may apply to any circuit court in Oregon for protection against abuse or hardship in the manner provided in ORCP 36 C.

      (4) References to the Governor in this section include only individuals designated for this purpose in writing by the Governor.

      (5) In addition to any penalties under ORS 176.990, a person who discloses confidential information in violation of this section willfully or with criminal negligence, as defined by ORS 161.085, may be subject, notwithstanding any other law, to removal from office or immediate dismissal from public employment.

[1974 c.5 §6]

 

      176.780 Action authorized by proclamation under ORS 176.775. Whenever the Governor has issued a proclamation under ORS 176.775, the Governor may by executive order direct actions:

      (2) Any such proceeding in the Court of Appeals shall be given precedence on the docket over all other cases, except prior cases arising under ORS 176.750 to 176.815 and 176.990.
