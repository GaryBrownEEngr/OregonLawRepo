If the secretary finds that waste, inefficiency or abuse has occurred, the investigation and any determinations made are confidential until the investigation described in subsection (3) of this section is complete. A determination by the secretary not to investigate following an initial investigation constitutes completion of the investigation.

The written determination may include other information about the nature of the investigation or the secretary’s determination.

      (b) If the secretary finds that waste, inefficiency or abuse has occurred, upon request of the person who made the report under ORS 177.170, the secretary shall provide the person with a copy of the determination and any other information included by the secretary.

      (c) If the secretary determines that officers or employees of another state agency or public body, or persons under contract with a state agency or public body, are involved in activities that constitute waste, inefficiency or abuse, the secretary shall notify the state agency or public body of the determination and deliver a copy of the secretary’s findings to the agency or body.

      (7) A written determination prepared by the secretary under this section is a public record. Following the completion of an investigation, or a determination not to investigate beyond an initial investigation, all documents, information or other records relating to the investigation are disclosable public records under ORS 192.311 to 192.478 unless an exemption from disclosure set forth in a provision of law other than this section applies to the records, except that the identity of the person making the report under ORS 177.170 shall remain confidential.

      (8) The secretary shall prepare an annual report and submit it to each regular session of the Legislative Assembly. The report shall describe the number, nature and resolution of reports made under ORS 177.170 and shall identify savings resulting from improved efficiencies or the elimination of waste or abuse resulting from reports received and investigations conducted under this section and ORS 177.170. The report shall also list the number and nature of any positive reports received relating to state agencies, state employees or persons under contract with state agencies.
