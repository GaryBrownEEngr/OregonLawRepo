      (12) Information obtained in the course of diagnosis, evaluation or treatment of an individual that, in the professional judgment of the health care services provider, indicates a clear and immediate danger to others or to society may be reported to the appropriate authority.

      (b) Any real or personal property that the person or an authorized representative of the person can demonstrate was purchased solely with assets referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection or partially with such assets, to the extent such assets were used in the purchase.

      (3) A person and the authorized representative of the person, if any, shall provide all financial information requested by the agency that is necessary to determine the person’s ability to pay. To determine ability to pay, the agency may use any information available to the agency, including information provided by the Department of Revenue from personal income tax returns pursuant to ORS 314.840. Upon request, the Department of Revenue shall release copies of tax returns to the agency. When the person or the person’s authorized representative fails to provide evidence to demonstrate an inability to pay full cost of care, the agency may determine the person has the ability to pay the full cost of care.

      (4) The agency shall provide actual notice to the person and any authorized representative, if known to the agency, of its determination by issuing an ability-to-pay order. The order shall state the person’s full liability and the person’s determined ability to pay. Actual notice means receipt by the person and the authorized representative of notice. The notice shall include a copy of the ability-to-pay order, a description of the person’s appeal rights and the date upon which appeal rights terminate and state the address where a request for hearing may be mailed or delivered. At any time, the agency may reissue an ability-to-pay order to notify an authorized representative as provided by ORS 179.653 (4).

      (5) At any time during the person’s stay at the state institution or within 36 months from the date the person is released, if the agency receives new financial information that shows a change in the person’s financial circumstances, the agency shall consider the changed circumstances and issue a new ability-to-pay order.

      (6) Orders issued after the person is released may not require the person to make payments toward the cost of care for more than 36 consecutive months following release. However, the agency may collect beyond the 36-month period any payments that became due but were not paid within the 36 months following release. Any remaining balance of full cost of care shall be collected as provided in ORS 179.740.

      (7) Notwithstanding ORS 183.315 (5), if a person or authorized representative disagrees with any ability-to-pay order issued pursuant to this section, the person or authorized representative may request a contested case hearing. To the extent practical, the hearing will be held at a location convenient to the person or the authorized representative. The request must be postmarked within 60 days from the date of the mailing of the ability-to-pay order. If the person or the authorized representative makes a timely request for a contested case hearing, the hearing and any appeal of the final hearing order shall be governed by ORS 183.413 to 183.497. If the person or the authorized representative fails to make a timely request for a contested case hearing, the ability-to-pay order shall be final and not subject to judicial review, except as subsequently modified by the agency as provided in subsection (5) of this section.

      (8) On appeal, regardless of other information presented, payment of the full cost of care may be ordered if the person or the authorized representative refuses to produce financial information that the Hearings Officer or administrative law judge determines is relevant and must be produced. [1959 c.652 §4; 1961 c.501 §2; 1967 c.549 §4; 1973 c.806 §3a; 1973 c.823 §§123,159; 1989 c.348 §3; 1997 c.170 §15; 1999 c.159 §2; 2001 c.487 §3; 2003 c.75 §86; 2009 c.595 §149; 2013 c.36 §59; 2015 c.348 §26]

 

      179.643 [1969 c.257 §8; 1973 c.546 §4; repealed by 1989 c.348 §16]

 

      179.645 [1967 c.534 §32; repealed by 1973 c.806 §14]

 

      179.650 [1959 c.652 §5; 1967 c.549 §5; 1969 c.591 §295; 1973 c.546 §5; 1973 c.806 §5a; repealed by 1989 c.348 §16]

 

      179.653 Unpaid costs as lien on property; order; when appealable. (1) If any person or authorized representative refuses to pay for the cost of care as ordered by the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Health Authority under ORS 179.640, the amount unpaid plus interest shall be a lien in favor of the State of Oregon. The lien shall arise as each payment is due under the order and shall continue until the liability with interest is satisfied. The lien shall be upon the title to and interest in the real and personal property of the personal estate.

      (2) Prior to the filing of a distraint warrant as provided in ORS 179.655 (2), the lien shall only be valid against:

      (a) Property of the person;

      (b) Assets held by any authorized representative bound by the ability-to-pay order; and

      (c) Assets subject to lien held by any person or entity having actual knowledge of the ability-to-pay order or the lien.

      (3) Regardless of any other provision of law or statute that provides a procedure for establishing obligations, including the claim and payment provisions of ORS chapter 125, an authorized representative who has received notice and had an opportunity to request a contested case hearing shall comply with an ability-to-pay order upon demand by the agency. The agency may issue the demand any time after the order becomes final.

      (4) An authorized representative who has not had an opportunity to request a contested case hearing, either because the authorized representative was not appointed at the time the ability-to-pay order became final, or was not given notice of the ability-to-pay order as required by ORS 179.640 (4), shall not be bound by the order of the agency. To bind the authorized representative, the ability-to-pay order must be reissued and notice provided to the authorized representative pursuant to ORS 179.640 (4). The authorized representative shall have the same appeal rights as if the order had originally been issued to the authorized representative. After the order becomes final, the authorized representative shall be bound as provided in subsection (3) of this section. The agency may not issue an execution of a lien or foreclose against property held by or in the control of the authorized representative until the authorized representative is bound by the order of the agency.

      (5) An authorized representative who is a trustee shall only be bound to the extent that the final order specifically finds that the trust assets of a trust fund are subject to claim by the agency.

      (6) If the authorized representative does not comply with the demand, the agency may file with the probate court a motion to require the authorized representative to comply. If the authorized representative is a conservator or guardian appointed under ORS chapter 125, the motion shall be filed in that proceeding. The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating that the order is final, that demand has been made on the authorized representative and that the order has not been complied with.

      (7) The authorized representative may object to the motion only on grounds that the order is not final, that the order is not binding on the authorized representative as provided in this section or that all required payments have been made. The objection must be by affidavit.

      (8) If the authorized representative objects by affidavit, the court shall hear the motion. If the court determines that the ability-to-pay order is final and binding on the authorized representative and that all required payments have not been made, the court shall order the authorized representative to comply with the ability-to-pay order.

      (9) If the authorized representative fails to object by affidavit within 15 days of the filing of the motion, the court shall order the authorized representative to comply with the order. An authorized representative who willfully fails or refuses to comply may be found in contempt of court and may be held personally responsible.

      (10) Nothing in this section shall affect the requirement that the agency issue a new order in accordance with ORS 179.640 (5) if financial circumstances have changed. [1973 c.806 §9a; 1989 c.348 §4; 1995 c.664 §90; 1999 c.159 §3; 2001 c.487 §4; 2009 c.595 §150; 2013 c.36 §60]

 

      179.655 Enforcement of lien; distraint warrant. (1) If any amount due the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Health Authority for the cost of care of a person is not paid within 30 days after it becomes due, and no provision is made to secure the payment by bond, deposit or otherwise, pursuant to rules adopted by the appropriate agency, the agency may issue a distraint warrant directed to any county of the state.

      (2) After the receipt of the distraint warrant, the clerk of the county shall enter in the County Clerk Lien Record the name of the person, the amount for which the distraint warrant is issued and the date the distraint warrant is recorded. The amount of the distraint warrant shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in any property owned or later acquired by the debtor against whom it is issued, and it may be enforced by the agency in the same manner as a judgment of the circuit court.

      (3) In the event that an ability-to-pay order issued under ORS 179.640 (4) or (5) becomes final, and supersedes a previous final ability-to-pay order on which a distraint warrant had been issued, the agency shall issue a new distraint warrant superseding the previous distraint warrant, and the lien shall conform to the new order.

      (4) The agency may direct a copy of the distraint warrant to the sheriff of any county of the state commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within that county, for the payment of the amount due, with interest, collection charge and the sheriff’s fee. The sheriff shall return the distraint warrant to the agency and pay to it the money collected not less than 60 days from the date the copy of the distraint warrant was directed to the sheriff.

      (5) The agency may issue the directive provided in subsection (4) of this section to any agent of the agency. In executing the distraint warrant, the agent shall have the same powers conferred by law upon sheriffs. However, the agent is not entitled to any fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses incurred in the performance of this duty. [1973 c.806 §§10,11,12; 1983 c.696 §8; 1989 c.348 §5; 1999 c.159 §4; 2001 c.487 §5; 2009 c.595 §151; 2013 c.36 §61]

 

      179.660 Guardian or conservator for estate of person in institution. If the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Health Authority believes a person at one of its state institutions needs a guardian or conservator, or both, and one has not been appointed, the agency may request that the district attorney institute proper proceedings for this appointment in the court having probate jurisdiction. The county of which the person is a resident, or was a resident at the time of admittance, shall be the basis for determining the appropriate district attorney to be contacted. [1959 c.652 §6; 1973 c.823 §124; 1989 c.348 §6; 2001 c.487 §6; 2009 c.595 §152; 2013 c.36 §62]

 

      179.670 [1959 c.652 §7; 1969 c.591 §296; 1973 c.546 §6; repealed by 1973 c.806 §14]

 

      179.680 [1959 c.652 §8; 1967 c.549 §6; 1973 c.546 §7; repealed by 1973 c.806 §14]

 

      179.690 [1959 c.652 §9; repealed by 1973 c.546 §13]

 

      179.700 [1959 c.652 §10; 1961 c.639 §1; 1965 c.182 §1; repealed by 1967 c.549 §1 (179.701 enacted in lieu of 179.700)]

 

      179.701 Determination of cost-of-care rates. (1) The cost-of-care rates for a person who is or was in a state institution described in ORS 179.321 shall be determined by the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Health Authority, as appropriate. The rates established shall be reasonably related to current costs of the institutions as described in ORS 179.321. Current costs shall exclude costs of outpatient services as defined in ORS 430.010 and any other costs not directly related to the care for a person at a state institution.

      (2) The cost-of-care rates for a person who was a resident of the Eastern Oregon Training Center shall be determined by the Department of Human Services. The rates established shall be reasonably related to the costs to operate, control, manage and supervise the state training center at the time of the person’s residency. The department must exclude costs of outpatient services as defined in ORS 430.010 and any other costs not directly related to the care of the person at the state training center. [1967 c.549 §2 (enacted in lieu of 179.700); 1973 c.806 §6; 1989 c.348 §7; 2001 c.487 §7; 2009 c.595 §153; 2011 c.658 §35; 2013 c.36 §63]

 

      179.710 [1955 c.5 §1; renumbered 179.510]

 

      179.711 Remittance of amounts due; refunds. (1) Remittance of amounts due for care of persons at state institutions as provided in ORS 179.610 to 179.770 shall be made to the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Health Authority, as appropriate.

      (2) The agency shall refund any unearned payment for the care of a person at a state institution where payment has been made in advance and the person dies or is discharged before the end of the period for which payment was made. Any refund shall be paid to the person, to the authorized representative of the person or to the decedent’s estate if the person has died. All claims for refunds approved by the agency shall be paid as provided in ORS 293.295 to 293.462. Any amounts necessary for payment of refunds are appropriated from the money collected by that agency under the provisions of ORS 179.610 to 179.770. [1959 c.652 §11; 1963 c.193 §1; 1973 c.546 §8; 1983 c.740 §44; 1989 c.348 §8; 2001 c.487 §8; 2009 c.595 §154; 2013 c.36 §64]

      179.730 [1955 c.5 §3; renumbered 179.530]

 

      179.731 Waiver of collection of amount payable. If the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Health Authority determines that collection of the amount payable under ORS 179.610 to 179.770 for the cost of care of a person would be detrimental to the best interests of the person or the agency, the agency may waive the collection of part or all of the amount otherwise payable. [1959 c.652 §§16,17,18; 1961 c.501 §3; 1973 c.546 §10; 1973 c.806 §7a; 1989 c.348 §9; 2001 c.487 §9; 2009 c.595 §155; 2013 c.36 §65]

 

      179.740 Collection from estates; settlement. (1) The Department of Corrections, the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, as appropriate, may file a claim against the decedent’s estate for any unpaid charges under ORS 179.620 (3). This shall be done in the same manner as claims of creditors and with the priorities provided in ORS 115.125.

      (2) If, within 90 days following the person’s death, the person’s estate is not otherwise being probated, the agency may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the issuance of letters of administration or testamentary. This action would be for the purpose of collecting the full amount of unpaid cost of care as determined by ORS 179.701 and limited by ORS 179.620 (3). However, the agency may not file a petition under this subsection until at least 90 days after the death of the person who was at the state institution and then only in the event that the person’s estate is not otherwise being probated.

      (3) The agency may settle any claim against the decedent’s estate during the pendency of the probate proceeding by accepting other security or in any other equitable manner. The agency may waive all or part of the claim if it finds collection of this amount due to be inequitable.

      (4) The agency may not recover amounts that exceed the total cost of care of the deceased person as computed under ORS 179.701 and limited by ORS 179.620 (3). [1959 c.652 §§16,17,18; 1961 c.501 §4; 1969 c.591 §297; 1973 c.546 §11; 1979 c.684 §4; 1989 c.348 §10; 2001 c.487 §10; 2009 c.595 §156]

 

      179.745 Title to and transfer of property. The State of Oregon, by and through the Department of Corrections, the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, may take title to real and personal property to carry out the provisions of ORS 179.620, 179.653, 179.655 and 179.740. With the written consent of the owner of real property or an authorized representative of the owner, the agency may transfer real property under the provisions of ORS 270.100 to 270.190. The agency may transfer personal property under rules adopted by the agency. The proceeds, less costs, of any real or personal property transferred by the agency under this section shall be credited to and deposited in the Department of Corrections Account, the Department of Human Services Account or the Oregon Health Authority Fund, as appropriate. [1999 c.616 §2; 2001 c.487 §11; 2009 c.595 §157]

 

DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED

 

      179.750 Equal care and services for persons in state institutions. (1) Discrimination may not be made in the admission, accommodation, care, education or treatment of any person in a state institution because the person does or does not contribute to the cost of the care.

      (2) Discrimination may not be made in the provision of or access to educational facilities and services and recreational facilities and services to any person in the state institutions enumerated in ORS 420.005 or Department of Corrections institutions as defined in ORS 421.005 on the basis of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin or marital status of the person. This subsection does not require combined domiciliary facilities at the state institutions to which it applies. [1959 c.652 §19; 1973 c.546 §12; 1977 c.363 §1; 1979 c.141 §1; 1989 c.348 §11; 1995 c.422 §134; 2003 c.14 §78; 2007 c.100 §20]

      179.770 Rules; employees. (1) In accordance with any applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority may adopt any rules necessary to carry out ORS 179.610 to 179.770.

      (2) Subject to any applicable provision of the State Personnel Relations Law, the agency may employ employees necessary to carry out ORS 179.610 to 179.770. [Subsections (1) and (2) enacted as 1959 c.652 §20; subsection (3) as 1959 c.652 §12; 1989 c.348 §12; 2001 c.487 §12; 2009 c.595 §158]
