The Attorney General shall adopt rules defining the criteria by which the Attorney General will exercise the discretion granted by this subsection.

      (3) The Attorney General may not include or retain in the directory a nonparticipating manufacturer or a brand family if the Attorney General concludes that:

      (a) Any escrow payment required from the nonparticipating manufacturer pursuant to ORS 323.806 for any period for any brand family, whether listed or not listed by the nonparticipating manufacturer, has not been fully paid into a qualified escrow fund governed by a qualified escrow agreement that has been approved by the Attorney General; or

Service on the agent constitutes legal and valid service of process on the nonparticipating manufacturer.

      (b) The nonparticipating manufacturer shall provide the name, address, telephone number and proof of the appointment and availability of the agent to the Attorney General.

      (2) The nonparticipating manufacturer shall provide notice to the Attorney General at least 30 calendar days prior to termination of the authority of an agent and shall provide proof to the satisfaction of the Attorney General of the appointment of a new agent at least five calendar days prior to the termination of an existing agent appointment.

      (7) The Attorney General shall, upon request of a nonparticipating manufacturer whose compliance with escrow requirements is at issue, provide the manufacturer with copies of all documents upon which any proposed addition to the escrow is based. Documents required to be provided under this subsection include, but are not necessarily limited to, reports under this section from distributors. The information provided to the manufacturer under this subsection may not include information about brand families or products of any tobacco product manufacturer other than the one to whom the information is provided. The information may be used only for the purpose of determining the appropriate amount of escrow deposits.

      (8) The Attorney General may require a distributor or a tobacco product manufacturer to submit any additional information, including, but not limited to, samples of the packaging and labeling of each brand family, to enable the Attorney General to determine whether a tobacco product manufacturer is in compliance with this section and ORS 180.410, 180.415, 180.420, 180.430 and 180.440 and with rules adopted under ORS 180.445 and 180.450.

      (2) Repayment of or intent to repay any amounts obtained by a person as a result of a violation of ORS 180.755 is not a defense in an action under this section.

      (3) The fact that a public agency has not paid any amounts to a person as a result of a violation of ORS 180.755 or has not suffered any injury by reason of a violation of ORS 180.755, is not a defense in an action under this section.

      (4) A court shall award to the state all damages arising from a violation of ORS 180.755. In addition, the court shall award to the state a penalty equal to the greater of $10,000 for each violation or an amount equal to twice the amount of damages incurred for each violation. The court may mitigate an award of a penalty under this subsection based on any fine or penalty assessed against the defendant for substantially the same acts or omissions in a judgment under the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729, et seq., as in effect on January 1, 2010, or under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a, as in effect on January 1, 2010, that is no longer subject to appeal.

      (5) If a court finds that an act or omission of an individual on behalf of a corporation or other legal entity constitutes a violation of ORS 180.755, the court may find that both the individual and the legal entity violated ORS 180.755, and impose a separate penalty under subsection (4) of this section against both the individual and the legal entity.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsections (4) and (5) of this section, if the state prevails in an action under this section, the court may not award a penalty under subsection (4) of this section if:

      (a) The defendant provided the Attorney General with all information known to the defendant about the violation within 30 days after the defendant first acquired the information;

      (b) The defendant fully cooperated with the Attorney General in the investigation of the violation; and

      (c) At the time the defendant provided the Attorney General with information about the violation, an investigation, court proceeding or administrative action related to the violation had not been commenced.

      (7) For the purpose of determining the amount of damages under this section:

      (a) The value of property, services or benefits obtained by a person who makes a claim may be established based on the market value of property, services or benefits at the time and place of receipt or delivery of the property, services or benefits.

      (b) If the market value of property, services or benefits at the time and place of receipt or delivery of the property, services or benefits cannot be reasonably ascertained, the value of the property, services or benefits may be established based on the replacement cost of the property, services or benefits.

      (c) If a written instrument has no readily ascertainable market value, the value of the instrument may be established based on the value determined as provided in ORS 164.115 (2).

      (d) The Attorney General may establish damages using statistical or sampling methodology, or any other system that reasonably estimates damages incurred, without separately proving the damages incurred from each violation of ORS 180.755.

      (8) The court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs of investigation, preparation and litigation to the state if the state prevails in an action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs of investigation, preparation and litigation to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the Attorney General had no objectively reasonable basis for bringing the action or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

In no event may an action under ORS 180.760 be brought more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed. [2009 c.292 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 180.750.

 

      180.770 Estoppel. (1) Any judgment that is no longer subject to appeal and that was rendered in favor of the state or of the United States in a criminal proceeding based on conduct that gives rise to an action under ORS 180.760, whether based on a verdict after trial or upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, estops a defendant in an action under ORS 180.760 from denying the elements of the offense for which the defendant was convicted.

      (2) A criminal or administrative action need not be brought against a person as a condition to bringing an action against the person under ORS 180.760. [2009 c.292 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 180.750.

      180.780 Distribution of recovered amounts. (1) If a judgment is entered in favor of the state under ORS 180.760, the Attorney General shall first apply amounts collected under the judgment to reimburse the state for the costs, attorney fees and expenses, including investigative costs, incurred as a result of the violation of ORS 180.755.

      (2) After reimbursement under subsection (1) of this section, amounts collected under the judgment must be paid to any public agency or fund that suffered a loss by reason of the violation of ORS 180.755.

      (3) Any amount remaining after distribution as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section must be deposited in the Department of Justice Protection and Education Revolving Account. [2009 c.292 §7; 2009 c.820 §1b]

 

      Note: See note under 180.750.

 

      180.785 Remedy not exclusive. The remedies provided under ORS 180.760 are in addition to any other remedy, civil or criminal, that may be available under any other provision of law.
