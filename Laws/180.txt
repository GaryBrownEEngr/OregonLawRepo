      (2) The certification required by subsection (1) of this section shall be on a form prescribed by the Attorney General and shall be submitted no later than April 30 each year. The form shall permit the tobacco product manufacturer to indicate the electronic mail address to which the Attorney General may send notice of changes in the directory developed under ORS 180.425 if the tobacco product manufacturer elects to receive electronic mail notice.

      180.416 Nonparticipating manufacturer bond; rules. (1) A nonparticipating manufacturer shall post a bond for the benefit of the state, in accordance with this section, which is conditioned on the nonparticipating manufacturer fully complying with the escrow obligations of ORS 323.806.

      (2) The bond must be posted at least 10 days in advance of each calendar quarter as a condition to the nonparticipating manufacturer and its brand families being included in the state directory for that quarter. The amount of the bond must be the greater of:

      (a) The greatest required escrow amount due from the nonparticipating manufacturer or its predecessor for any of the 12 preceding calendar quarters; or

      (3) If a nonparticipating manufacturer that posted a bond has failed to make or have made on its behalf deposits equal to the full amount owed for a quarter within 15 days following the due date for the quarter, the Attorney General may execute upon the bond in the amount equal to any remaining amount of the escrow due, including any applicable penalties or other charges allowable by law. Amounts the Attorney General collects on a bond shall be deposited into the General Fund for the benefit of the state and shall reduce the amount of escrow due from the nonparticipating manufacturer in the dollar amount collected.

The Attorney General shall adopt rules defining the criteria by which the Attorney General will exercise the discretion granted by this subsection.

      (3) The Attorney General may not include or retain in the directory a nonparticipating manufacturer or a brand family if the Attorney General concludes that:

      (a) Any escrow payment required from the nonparticipating manufacturer pursuant to ORS 323.806 for any period for any brand family, whether listed or not listed by the nonparticipating manufacturer, has not been fully paid into a qualified escrow fund governed by a qualified escrow agreement that has been approved by the Attorney General; or

      (c) Immediately upon making any change in the directory developed under this section, send electronic mail notices of the change to all persons on the list created under this subsection. [2003 c.801 §6; 2009 c.227 §2]

      180.430 Nonresident nonparticipating manufacturer service agent. (1)(a) Any nonresident or foreign nonparticipating manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the State of Oregon as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition precedent to having its brand families listed or retained in the directory developed under ORS 180.425, appoint and continuously engage the services of a resident agent in this state.

Service on the agent constitutes legal and valid service of process on the nonparticipating manufacturer.

      (b) The nonparticipating manufacturer shall provide the name, address, telephone number and proof of the appointment and availability of the agent to the Attorney General.

      (2) The nonparticipating manufacturer shall provide notice to the Attorney General at least 30 calendar days prior to termination of the authority of an agent and shall provide proof to the satisfaction of the Attorney General of the appointment of a new agent at least five calendar days prior to the termination of an existing agent appointment. If an agent terminates an agency appointment, the nonparticipating manufacturer shall notify the Attorney General of the termination within five calendar days and shall include proof to the Attorney General of the appointment of a new agent.

      (3) A nonparticipating manufacturer whose cigarettes are sold in this state who has not appointed or designated an agent as required by this section shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as the agent and may be proceeded against in courts of this state by service of process upon the Secretary of State. However, the appointment of the Secretary of State as the agent does not satisfy the condition precedent to having brand families of the nonparticipating manufacturer listed or retained in the directory.

      (b) If a person fails to produce any books, papers, records or other information required to be produced, fails to appear or testify about a matter for which testimony may be compelled or otherwise fails to comply with a subpoena issued under this subsection, the Attorney General may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the person to whom the subpoena was issued resides or may be found. The application shall be for an order requiring the person to comply with the demand or request of the Attorney General. The application shall be made by ex parte motion. The order of the court shall require the person against whom the order is directed to comply with the request or demand of the Attorney General within 10 days after the service of the order, or such further time as the court may grant, or to justify the failure to comply with the order within that time.

      (c) Failure to comply with an order under this subsection shall constitute contempt of court. The remedy provided under this paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedy provided by law.

      (7) The Attorney General shall, upon request of a nonparticipating manufacturer whose compliance with escrow requirements is at issue, provide the manufacturer with copies of all documents upon which any proposed addition to the escrow is based. Documents required to be provided under this subsection include, but are not necessarily limited to, reports under this section from distributors. The information provided to the manufacturer under this subsection may not include information about brand families or products of any tobacco product manufacturer other than the one to whom the information is provided. The information may be used only for the purpose of determining the appropriate amount of escrow deposits.

      (8) The Attorney General may require a distributor or a tobacco product manufacturer to submit any additional information, including, but not limited to, samples of the packaging and labeling of each brand family, to enable the Attorney General to determine whether a tobacco product manufacturer is in compliance with this section and ORS 180.410, 180.415, 180.420, 180.430 and 180.440 and with rules adopted under ORS 180.445 and 180.450.

      (4) A court shall award to the state all damages arising from a violation of ORS 180.755. In addition, the court shall award to the state a penalty equal to the greater of $10,000 for each violation or an amount equal to twice the amount of damages incurred for each violation. The court may mitigate an award of a penalty under this subsection based on any fine or penalty assessed against the defendant for substantially the same acts or omissions in a judgment under the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729, et seq., as in effect on January 1, 2010, or under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a, as in effect on January 1, 2010, that is no longer subject to appeal.

      (7) For the purpose of determining the amount of damages under this section:

      (a) The value of property, services or benefits obtained by a person who makes a claim may be established based on the market value of property, services or benefits at the time and place of receipt or delivery of the property, services or benefits.

      (b) If the market value of property, services or benefits at the time and place of receipt or delivery of the property, services or benefits cannot be reasonably ascertained, the value of the property, services or benefits may be established based on the replacement cost of the property, services or benefits.

      (c) If a written instrument has no readily ascertainable market value, the value of the instrument may be established based on the value determined as provided in ORS 164.115 (2).

      (d) The Attorney General may establish damages using statistical or sampling methodology, or any other system that reasonably estimates damages incurred, without separately proving the damages incurred from each violation of ORS 180.755.
