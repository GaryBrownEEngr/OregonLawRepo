      181A.245 Procedure when information requested by other than criminal justice agency. (1) When a person or agency, other than a criminal justice agency or a law enforcement agency, pursuant to ORS 181A.230 (2), requests from the Department of State Police criminal offender information regarding an individual, if the department’s compiled criminal offender information on the individual contains records of any conviction, or of any arrest less than one year old on which there has been no acquittal or dismissal, the department shall respond to the request as follows:

      (a) The department shall send prompt written notice of the request to the individual about whom the request has been made. The department shall address the notice to the individual’s last address known to the department and to the individual’s address, if any, supplied by the person making the request. However, the department has no obligation to insure that the addresses are current. The notice shall state that the department has received a request for information concerning the individual and shall identify the person or agency making the request. Notice to the individual about whom the request is made shall include:

      (A) A copy of all information to be supplied to the person or agency making the request;

      (B) Notice to the individual of the manner in which the individual may become informed of the procedures adopted under ORS 181A.230 (3) for challenging inaccurate criminal offender information; and

      (2) If the department holds no criminal offender information on an individual, or the department’s compiled criminal offender information on the individual consists only of nonconviction data, the department shall respond to a request under this section that the individual has no criminal record and shall release no further information.

      (3) The department shall keep a record of all persons and agencies making inquiries under ORS 181A.230 (2) and shall keep a record of the names of the individuals about whom such persons or agencies are inquiring, regardless of whether the department has compiled any criminal offender information on the individuals. These records shall be public records and shall be available for inspection under ORS 192.311 to 192.478.

      (4) Nothing in ORS 181A.140, 181A.220 or 181A.230 or this section is intended to prevent the department from charging a reasonable fee, pursuant to ORS 192.324, for responding to a criminal offender information inquiry or for making information available under ORS 181A.230 or this section. [Formerly 181.560]

 

      181A.250 Specific information not to be collected or maintained. No law enforcement agency, as defined in ORS 181A.010, may collect or maintain information about the political, religious or social views, associations or activities of any individual, group, association, organization, corporation, business or partnership unless such information directly relates to an investigation of criminal activities, and there are reasonable grounds to suspect the subject of the information is or may be involved in criminal conduct. [Formerly 181.575]

The criminal justice agency shall submit the information on a form which shall be developed and provided by the Department of State Police. The form shall contain only information necessary to aid law enforcement personnel in comparing homicides and suspected homicides and discovering those exhibiting similar characteristics. The Department of State Police shall enter information submitted by an investigating agency into a file controlled by the Department of State Police and shall compare such information to information on other homicides or suspected homicides, for the purpose of discovering similarities in criminal methods and suspect descriptions. The Department of State Police shall advise the concerned investigating agencies if the Department of State Police finds homicides exhibiting similar criminal methods or suspect descriptions.

      (3) When an investigating criminal justice agency terminates active investigation of a suspected criminal homicide due to an arrest having been made in the case, death of the primary suspect, or whatever other reason, the investigating agency shall so notify the Department of State Police within 30 days following such termination. Notification shall include the reason for terminating active investigation. [Formerly 181.580]

 

      Note: 181A.255 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 181A or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      Sec. 1. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The number of people in Oregon with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia is growing. Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, even the ability to carry out the simplest tasks of daily living.

      (4) Many police departments and sheriff’s offices are well trained to respond to reports of missing vulnerable adults. This legislation provides for all law enforcement in Oregon to be fully prepared to assist in protecting the safety of some of our most vulnerable citizens, while providing each police department or sheriff’s office with the flexibility to determine what works best in the local jurisdiction.
