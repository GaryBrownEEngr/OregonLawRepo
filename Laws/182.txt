Any member of a state board or commission appointed by the Governor who fails to attend two consecutive meetings of the board or commission, whether regular, adjourned or special, shall forfeit office unless the member is prevented from attending by the serious illness of a member or the family of the member or for any other cause that in the judgment of the Governor constitutes a valid reason for failing to attend. The Governor shall immediately appoint a successor.

 

      182.020 Notice of meetings of boards and commissions; reporting of absences. The secretary or clerk of every state board and commission shall:

      182.080 Effect of repeal or amendment of statute authorizing state agency to collect, receive and expend moneys. (1) The repeal of a statute or the deletion by amendment of a part thereof that granted or conferred power to any state officer, board, commission, corporation, institution, department, agency or other state organization to collect, receive and expend moneys for or on behalf of the state or for any purpose authorized by law does not affect or impair any act done, or right accruing, accrued or acquired, or liability, or obligation to pay the state a license or other fee, or payment exacted or required by law to be made or authorized by the repealed or amended statute and the rules, regulations and orders, if any, promulgated thereunder and in effect at the time of the repeal or amendment, unless otherwise specifically provided by law. In the event of such repeal or amendment of a statute, the Secretary of State may determine, collect and disburse any moneys due the state, or payable by or through the state, representing such license or other fee, or payment exacted or required by law in accordance with the provisions of such repealed or amended statute and such rules, regulations and orders promulgated thereunder, and as otherwise provided by law, in order to secure the full force, effect and operation of such statute up to the time of its repeal or amendment, but not thereafter.

      (2) Upon repeal or amendment of a statute as described in subsection (1) of this section, so much as may be necessary, and no more, of the balance in the General Fund appropriated for the use, operation and function of the state officer, board, commission, corporation, institution, department, agency or other state organization is transferred to the Secretary of State for the payment of all expenses incurred by the Secretary of State in winding up and concluding administration of the repealed or amended statute, as authorized in subsection (1) of this section. If the balance of the unexpended appropriation is insufficient to cover the costs and expenses of the Secretary of State in administering and concluding the operation of the repealed or amended statute, the secretary may request transfer or appropriation of any funds, accounts and receipts belonging to the state in the custody or control of such state officer, board, commission, corporation, institution, department, agency or other state organization, to cover in full the costs of winding up and concluding the administration of the statute.

(1) In any civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, as defined in ORS 291.002, and a petitioner, the court shall award the petitioner reasonable attorney fees and reasonable expenses if the court finds in favor of the petitioner and also finds that the state agency acted without a reasonable basis in fact or in law.

      (2) Amounts allowed under this section for reasonable attorney fees and expenses shall be paid from funds available to the state agency. The court may withhold all or part of the attorney fees from any award to a petitioner if the court finds that the state agency has proved that its action was substantially justified or that special circumstances exist which make the award of all or a portion of the attorney fees unjust.

      (3) As used in this section, “civil judicial proceeding” means any proceeding, other than a criminal proceeding as defined in ORS 131.005 (7), conducted before a court of this state. [1981 c.871 §2; 1983 c.763 §61]

      (2) Encourage and promote education of state employees, state officials and the public in general about the worth and capacity of persons with disabilities.

      (3) In all state correspondence and publications, avoid the use of stereotypes and negative labels such as “victim,” “afflicted,” “crippled” and “handicapped” except as such terms are required by statute or federal law and regulation.

      (4) Use the preferred and more positive term “person with a disability” instead of “disabled person,” “handicapped” or other negative words except as such terms are required by statute or federal law and regulation.

      (5) In implementing subsections (1) to (4) of this section, develop and seek input regarding terminology and portrayal of persons with disabilities from persons who have disabilities and their advocates.

      (6) Foster corrective measures and avoid stereotypes and negative labeling in texts used by schools, newspapers, magazines, radio and television by encouraging review and analysis of these media by publishers, company owners or appropriate agencies.

IMPACT OF STATE AGENCY ACTION ON FAMILIES

 

      182.151 Assessment of impact of state agency action on families. In formulating and implementing policies and rules that may have significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being, all state agencies in Oregon shall, to the extent permitted by law, assess such measures in light of the following considerations:

      (1) If the action by the government strengthens or erodes the stability of the family and, particularly, the marital commitment;

      (2) If the action strengthens or erodes the authority and rights of the parents in the education, nurture and supervision of their children;

      (3) If the action helps the family perform its functions, or if the action substitutes governmental activity for the function;

      (4) If the action by the government increases or decreases family earnings and if the proposed benefits of the action justify the impact on the family budget;

      (5) If the activity can be carried out by a lower level of government or by the family itself;

      (6) The message, intended or otherwise, the program sends to the public concerning the status of the family; and

      (7) The message the action sends to young people concerning the relationship between their behavior, their personal responsibility and the norms of our society. [1999 c.523 §1]

      (2) As used in ORS 182.365 to 182.400:

      (a) “Agency or unit” means any department, division, agency or section or unit of any department, division or agency or unit, that has an identifiable budget which may be separated from other budgets and for which credit can be given.

      (b) “Department” means the Oregon Department of Administrative Services.

Expenditures from the fund are not subject to allotment or other budgetary procedures.

      (4) None of the expenditures in a biennium by the agency or unit under this section shall be considered to be within any appropriation or expenditure limitation in the agency’s base budget for the biennium.

The plan must be approved by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. Loans, grants or matching funds authorized under ORS 182.375 shall not require any increased funding or increases in an expenditure limitation and shall not require legislative review.

      (2) The plan required in subsection (1) of this section shall include long-range objectives of each program, indicating in each case where the agency or unit shall increase efficiency and cost savings without a reduction in public services. The plan shall include reasons for leaving current positions vacant, actual reductions in services and supplies, travel and capital outlay and shall include a system to evaluate the resulting accomplishments of each agency or unit.
