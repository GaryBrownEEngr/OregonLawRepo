(Adoption of Rules)

 

      183.325 Delegation of rulemaking authority to named officer or employee. Unless otherwise provided by law, an agency may delegate its rulemaking authority to an officer or employee within the agency. A delegation of authority under this section must be made in writing and filed with the Secretary of State before the filing of any rule adopted pursuant to the delegation. A delegation under this section may be made only to one or more named individuals. The delegation of authority shall reflect the name of the authorized individual or individuals, and be signed in acknowledgment by the named individuals. Any officer or employee to whom rulemaking authority is delegated under this section is an “agency” for the purposes of the rulemaking requirements of this chapter. [1979 c.593 §10; 1993 c.729 §1]

 

      183.330 Description of organization; service of order; rules coordinator; order not final until put in writing. (1) In addition to other rulemaking requirements imposed by law, each agency shall publish a description of its organization and the methods whereby the public may obtain information or make submissions or requests.

      (2) Each state agency that adopts rules shall appoint a rules coordinator and file a copy of that appointment with the Secretary of State. The rules coordinator shall:

      (a) Maintain copies of all rules adopted by the agency;

      (b) Provide to the public, upon request, information pertaining to:

      (A) All rulemaking proceedings of the agency;

      (B) The status of the agency’s rules; and

      (C) All certificates and rules filed by the agency with the Secretary of State; and

      (c) Keep and make available the mailing list required by ORS 183.335 (8).

      (3) An order shall not be effective as to any person or party unless it is served upon the person or party either personally or by mail. This subsection is not applicable in favor of any person or party who has actual knowledge of the order.

      (4) An order is not final until it is reduced to writing. [1957 c.717 §2; 1971 c.734 §4; 1975 c.759 §3; 1979 c.593 §8; 1993 c.729 §2; 2001 c.220 §3; 2017 c.518 §1]

 

      183.332 Policy statement; conformity of state rules with equivalent federal laws and rules. It is the policy of this state that agencies shall seek to retain and promote the unique identity of Oregon by considering local conditions when an agency adopts policies and rules. However, since there are many federal laws and regulations that apply to activities that are also regulated by the state, it is also the policy of this state that agencies attempt to adopt rules that correspond with equivalent federal laws and rules unless:

      (1) There is specific statutory direction to the agency that authorizes the adoption of the rule;

      (2) A federal waiver has been granted that authorizes the adoption of the rule;

      (3) Local or special conditions exist in this state that warrant a different rule;

      (4) The state rule has the effect of clarifying the federal rules, standards, procedures or requirements;

      (5) The state rule achieves the goals of the federal and state law with the least impact on public and private resources; or

      (6) There is no corresponding federal regulation. [1997 c.602 §2]

 

      183.333 Policy statement; public involvement in development of policy and drafting of rules; advisory committees. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that it is the policy of this state that whenever possible the public be involved in the development of public policy by agencies and in the drafting of rules. The Legislative Assembly encourages agencies to seek public input to the maximum extent possible before giving notice of intent to adopt a rule. The agency may appoint an advisory committee that will represent the interests of persons likely to be affected by the rule, or use any other means of obtaining public views that will assist the agency in drafting the rule.

      (2) Any agency in its discretion may develop a list of interested parties and inform those parties of any issue that may be the subject of rulemaking and invite the parties to make comments on the issue.

      (3) If an agency appoints an advisory committee for consideration of a rule under subsection (1) of this section, the agency shall seek the committee’s recommendations on whether the rule will have a fiscal impact, what the extent of that impact will be and whether the rule will have a significant adverse impact on small businesses. If the committee indicates that the rule will have a significant adverse impact on small businesses, the agency shall seek the committee’s recommendations on compliance with ORS 183.540.

      (4) An agency shall consider an advisory committee’s recommendations provided under subsection (3) of this section in preparing the statement of fiscal impact required by ORS 183.335 (2)(b)(E).

      (5) If an agency does not appoint an advisory committee for consideration of a permanent rule under subsection (1) of this section and 10 or more persons likely to be affected by the rule object to the agency’s statement of fiscal impact as required by ORS 183.335 (2)(b)(E) or an association with at least 10 members likely to be affected by the rule objects to the statement, the agency shall appoint a fiscal impact advisory committee to provide recommendations on whether the rule will have a fiscal impact and what the extent of that impact will be. An objection under this subsection must be made not later than 14 days after the notice required by ORS 183.335 (1) is given.

      183.390 Petitions requesting adoption of rules. (1) An interested person may petition an agency requesting the promulgation, amendment or repeal of a rule. The Attorney General shall prescribe by rule the form for such petitions and the procedure for their submission, consideration and disposition. Not later than 90 days after the date of submission of a petition, the agency either shall deny the petition in writing or shall initiate rulemaking proceedings in accordance with ORS 183.335.

      (2) If a petition requesting the amendment or repeal of a rule is submitted to an agency under this section, the agency shall invite public comment upon the rule, and shall specifically request public comment on whether options exist for achieving the rule’s substantive goals in a way that reduces the negative economic impact on businesses.

      (3) In reviewing a petition subject to subsection (2) of this section, the agency shall consider:

      (a) The continued need for the rule;

      (b) The nature of complaints or comments received concerning the rule from the public;

      (f) The statutory citation or legal basis for the rule. [1957 c.717 §5; 1971 c.734 §8; 2003 c.749 §6]

 

      183.400 Judicial determination of validity of rule. (1) The validity of any rule may be determined upon a petition by any person to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided for review of orders in contested cases. The court shall have jurisdiction to review the validity of the rule whether or not the petitioner has first requested the agency to pass upon the validity of the rule in question, but not when the petitioner is a party to an order or a contested case in which the validity of the rule may be determined by a court.

      (2) The validity of any applicable rule may also be determined by a court, upon review of an order in any manner provided by law or pursuant to ORS 183.480 or upon enforcement of such rule or order in the manner provided by law.

      (3) Judicial review of a rule shall be limited to an examination of:

      (a) The rule under review;

      (4) The court shall declare the rule invalid only if it finds that the rule:

      (a) Violates constitutional provisions;

      (b) Exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; or

      (c) Was adopted without compliance with applicable rulemaking procedures.

      (5) In the case of disputed allegations of irregularities in procedure which, if proved, would warrant reversal or remand, the Court of Appeals may refer the allegations to a master appointed by the court to take evidence and make findings of fact. The court’s review of the master’s findings of fact shall be de novo on the evidence.

      (6) The court shall not declare a rule invalid solely because it was adopted without compliance with applicable rulemaking procedures after a period of two years after the date the rule was filed in the office of the Secretary of State, if the agency attempted to comply with those procedures and its failure to do so did not substantially prejudice the interests of the parties. [1957 c.717 §6; 1971 c.734 §9; 1975 c.759 §9; 1979 c.593 §17; 1987 c.861 §3]

      (C) A statement of need for each rule and all of the agency’s findings that a failure to act promptly would result in serious prejudice to the public interest or the interest of parties concerned; and

      (D) For each rule, an explanation of why proceeding under ORS 183.335 (5) was the most appropriate method for adopting, amending or suspending the rule and why it was not appropriate to proceed in accordance with ORS 183.335 (2) and (3). [2016 c.44 §1]

 

      Note: 183.403 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 183 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      183.405 Agency review of rules. (1) Not later than five years after adopting a rule, an agency shall review the rule for the purpose of determining:

On petition of any interested person, any agency may in its discretion issue a declaratory ruling with respect to the applicability to any person, property, or state of facts of any rule or statute enforceable by it. A declaratory ruling is binding between the agency and the petitioner on the state of facts alleged, unless it is altered or set aside by a court. However, the agency may, where the ruling is adverse to the petitioner, review the ruling and alter it if requested by the petitioner. Binding rulings provided by this section are subject to review in the Court of Appeals in the manner provided in ORS 183.480 for the review of orders in contested cases. The Attorney General shall prescribe by rule the form for such petitions and the procedure for their submission, consideration and disposition. The petitioner shall have the right to submit briefs and present oral argument at any declaratory ruling proceeding held pursuant to this section. [1957 c.717 §7; 1971 c.734 §10; 1973 c.612 §5]

 

(Contested Cases)

 

      183.411 Delegation of final order authority. Unless otherwise provided by law, an agency may delegate authority to enter a final order in a proceeding or class of proceedings to an officer or employee of the agency, or to a class of officers or employees of the agency. A delegation of authority under this section must be made in writing before the issuance of any order pursuant to the delegation and must be retained in the agency’s records. [2007 c.116 §2]

 

      Note: 183.411 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 183 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      183.413 Notice to parties before hearing of rights and procedure; failure to provide notice. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that parties to a contested case hearing have a right to be informed as to the procedures by which contested cases are heard by state agencies, their rights in hearings before state agencies, the import and effect of hearings before state agencies and their rights and remedies with respect to actions taken by state agencies. Accordingly, it is the purpose of subsections (2) and (3) of this section to set forth certain requirements of state agencies so that parties to contested case hearings shall be fully informed as to these matters when exercising their rights before state agencies.

      (2) Prior to the commencement of a contested case hearing before any agency including those agencies identified in ORS 183.315, the agency shall serve personally or by mail a written notice to each party to the hearing that includes the following:

      (h) Whether a record will be made of the proceedings and the manner of making the record and its availability to the parties.

      (i) The function of the record-making with respect to the perpetuation of the testimony and evidence and with respect to any appeal from the determination or order of the agency.

      (j) Whether an attorney will represent the agency in the matters to be heard and whether the parties ordinarily and customarily are represented by an attorney.

      (3) The failure of an agency to give notice of any item specified in subsection (2) of this section does not invalidate any determination or order of the agency unless upon an appeal from or review of the determination or order a court finds that the failure affects the substantial rights of the complaining party. In the event of such a finding, the court shall remand the matter to the agency for a reopening of the hearing and shall direct the agency as to what steps it shall take to remedy the prejudice to the rights of the complaining party. [1979 c.593 §§37,38,39; 1995 c.79 §63; 2007 c.288 §1; 2013 c.295 §1]

      183.417 Procedure in contested case hearing. (1) In a contested case proceeding, the parties may elect to be represented by counsel and to respond and present evidence and argument on all issues properly before the presiding officer in the proceeding.

      (2) Agencies may adopt rules of procedure governing participation in contested case proceedings by persons appearing as limited parties.

      (3)(a) Unless prohibited by law, informal disposition may be made of any contested case by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default. Informal settlement may be made in license revocation proceedings by written agreement of the parties and the agency consenting to a suspension, fine or other form of intermediate sanction.

      (b) Any informal disposition of a contested case, other than an informal disposition by default, must be in writing and signed by the party or parties to the contested case. The agency shall incorporate that disposition into a final order. An order under this paragraph is not subject to ORS 183.470. The agency shall deliver or mail a copy of the order to each party and to the attorney of record if the party is represented. An order that incorporates the informal disposition is a final order in a contested case, but is not subject to judicial review. A party may petition the agency to set aside a final order that incorporates the informal disposition on the ground that the informal disposition was obtained by fraud or duress.

      (4) An order adverse to a party may be issued upon default only if a prima facie case is made on the record. The record on a default order includes all materials submitted by the party. The record on a default order may be made at the time of issuance of the order. If the record on the default order consists solely of an application and other materials submitted by the party, the agency shall so note in the order.

      (5) At the commencement of a contested case hearing, the officer presiding at the hearing shall explain the issues involved in the hearing and the matters that the parties must either prove or disprove.

      (6) Testimony at a contested case hearing shall be taken upon oath or affirmation of the witness. The officer presiding at the hearing shall administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses.

      (7) The officer presiding at the hearing shall place on the record a statement of the substance of any written or oral ex parte communication on a fact in issue made to the officer during the pendency of the proceeding and notify the parties of the communication and of their right to rebut the communication. If an ex parte communication is made to an administrative law judge assigned from the Office of Administrative Hearings established under ORS 183.605, the administrative law judge must comply with ORS 183.685.

      (8) The officer presiding at the hearing shall ensure that the record developed at the hearing shows a full and fair inquiry into the facts necessary for consideration of all issues properly before the presiding officer in the case and the correct application of the law to those facts.

      (9) The record in a contested case shall include:

      (a) All pleadings, motions and intermediate rulings.

      (b) Evidence received or considered.

      (c) Stipulations.

      (d) A statement of matters officially noticed.

      (e) Questions and offers of proof, objections and rulings thereon.

      (f) A statement of any ex parte communication that must be disclosed under subsection (7) of this section and that was made to the officer presiding at the hearing.

      (g) Proposed findings and exceptions.

      (h) Any proposed, intermediate or final order prepared by the agency or an administrative law judge.

      (10) A verbatim oral, written or mechanical record shall be made of all motions, rulings and testimony in a contested case proceeding. The record need not be transcribed unless requested for purposes of rehearing or court review. The agency may charge the party requesting transcription the cost of a copy of transcription, unless the party files an appropriate affidavit of indigency. Upon petition, a court having jurisdiction to review under ORS 183.480 may reduce or eliminate the charge upon finding that it is equitable to do so, or that matters of general interest would be determined by review of the order of the agency. [2007 c.288 §4]

      183.425 Depositions or subpoena of material witness; discovery. (1) On petition of any party to a contested case, or upon the agency’s own motion, the agency may order that the testimony of any material witness may be taken by deposition in the manner prescribed by law for depositions in civil actions. Depositions may also be taken by the use of audio or audio-visual recordings. The petition shall set forth the name and address of the witness whose testimony is desired, a showing of the materiality of the testimony of the witness, and a request for an order that the testimony of such witness be taken before an officer named in the petition for that purpose. If the witness resides in this state and is unwilling to appear, the agency may issue a subpoena as provided in ORS 183.440, requiring the appearance of the witness before such officer.

      (2) An agency may, by rule, prescribe other methods of discovery which may be used in proceedings before the agency. [1971 c.734 §14; 1975 c.759 §11; 1979 c.593 §19; 1997 c.837 §6]

 

      183.430 Hearing on refusal to renew license; exceptions. (1) In the case of any license which must be periodically renewed, where the licensee has made timely application for renewal in accordance with the rules of the agency, such license shall not be deemed to expire, despite any stated expiration date thereon, until the agency concerned has issued a formal order of grant or denial of such renewal. In case an agency proposes to refuse to renew such license, upon demand of the licensee, the agency must grant hearing as provided by this chapter before issuance of order of refusal to renew. This subsection does not apply to any emergency or temporary permit or license.

      (2) In any case where the agency finds a serious danger to the public health or safety and sets forth specific reasons for such findings, the agency may suspend or refuse to renew a license without hearing, but if the licensee demands a hearing within 90 days after the date of notice to the licensee of such suspension or refusal to renew, then a hearing must be granted to the licensee as soon as practicable after such demand, and the agency shall issue an order pursuant to such hearing as required by this chapter confirming, altering or revoking its earlier order. Such a hearing need not be held where the order of suspension or refusal to renew is accompanied by or is pursuant to, a citation for violation which is subject to judicial determination in any court of this state, and the order by its terms will terminate in case of final judgment in favor of the licensee. [1957 c.717 §8 (3), (4); 1965 c.212 §1; 1971 c.734 §11]

 

      183.435 Period allowed to request hearing for license refusal on grounds other than test or inspection results. When an agency refuses to issue a license required to pursue any commercial activity, trade, occupation or profession if the refusal is based on grounds other than the results of a test or inspection that agency shall grant the person requesting the license 60 days from notification of the refusal to request a hearing. [Formerly 670.285]

 

      183.440 Subpoenas in contested cases. (1) An agency may issue subpoenas on its own motion in a contested case. In addition, an agency or hearing officer in a contested case may issue subpoenas upon the request of a party to a contested case upon a showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. A party entitled to have witnesses on behalf of the party may have subpoenas issued by an attorney of record of the party, subscribed by the signature of the attorney. Witnesses appearing pursuant to subpoena, other than the parties or officers or employees of the agency, shall receive fees and mileage as prescribed by law for witnesses in ORS 44.415 (2).

      (2) If any person fails to comply with any subpoena so issued or any party or witness refuses to testify on any matters on which the party or witness may be lawfully interrogated, the judge of the circuit court of any county, on the application of the hearing officer, the agency or the party requesting the issuance of or issuing the subpoena, shall compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from such court or a refusal to testify therein. [1957 c.717 §8 (2); 1971 c.734 §12; 1979 c.593 §20; 1981 c.174 §4; 1989 c.980 §10a; 1997 c.837 §3; 1999 c.849 §30]

 

      183.445 Subpoena by agency or attorney of record of party when agency not subject to ORS 183.440. (1) In any proceeding before an agency not subject to ORS 183.440 in which a party is entitled to have subpoenas issued for the appearance of witnesses on behalf of the party, a subpoena may be issued by an attorney of record of the party, subscribed by the signature of the attorney. A subpoena issued by an attorney of record may be enforced in the same manner as a subpoena issued by the agency.

      (2) In any proceeding before an agency not subject to ORS 183.440 in which a party is entitled to have subpoenas issued by the agency to compel the appearance of witnesses on behalf of the party, the agency may issue subpoenas on its own motion. [1981 c.174 §6; 1997 c.837 §4; 1999 c.849 §32]

 

      183.450 Evidence in contested cases. In contested cases:

      (1) Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded but erroneous rulings on evidence shall not preclude agency action on the record unless shown to have substantially prejudiced the rights of a party. All other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in conduct of their serious affairs shall be admissible. Agencies and hearing officers shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form.

      (2) All evidence shall be offered and made a part of the record in the case, and except for matters stipulated to and except as provided in subsection (4) of this section no other factual information or evidence shall be considered in the determination of the case. Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts, or by incorporation by reference. The burden of presenting evidence to support a fact or position in a contested case rests on the proponent of the fact or position.

      (3) Every party shall have the right of cross-examination of witnesses who testify and shall have the right to submit rebuttal evidence. Persons appearing in a limited party status shall participate in the manner and to the extent prescribed by rule of the agency.

      (4) The hearing officer and agency may take notice of judicially cognizable facts, and may take official notice of general, technical or scientific facts within the specialized knowledge of the hearing officer or agency. Parties shall be notified at any time during the proceeding but in any event prior to the final decision of material officially noticed and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the facts so noticed. The hearing officer and agency may utilize the hearing officer’s or agency’s experience, technical competence and specialized knowledge in the evaluation of the evidence presented.

      (5) No sanction shall be imposed or order be issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party, and as supported by, and in accordance with, reliable, probative and substantial evidence. [1957 c.717 §9; 1971 c.734 §15; 1975 c.759 §12; 1977 c.798 §3; 1979 c.593 §21; 1987 c.833 §1; 1995 c.272 §5; 1997 c.391 §1; 1997 c.801 §76; 1999 c.448 §5; 1999 c.849 §34]

 

      183.452 Representation of agencies at contested case hearings. (1) Agencies may, at their discretion, be represented at contested case hearings by the Attorney General.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 9.160, 9.320 and ORS chapter 180, and unless otherwise authorized by another law, an agency may be represented at contested case hearings by an officer or employee of the agency if:

      (a) The Attorney General has consented to the representation of the agency by an agency representative in the particular hearing or in the class of hearings that includes the particular hearing; and

      (b) The agency, by rule, has authorized an agency representative to appear on its behalf in the particular type of hearing being conducted.

      (3) An agency representative acting under the provisions of this section may not give legal advice to an agency, and may not present legal argument in contested case hearings, except to the extent authorized by subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) The officer presiding at a contested case hearing in which an agency representative appears under the provisions of this section may allow the agency representative to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and make arguments relating to the:

      (b) Actions taken by the agency in the past in similar situations;

      (c) Literal meaning of the statutes or rules at issue in the contested case;

      (d) Admissibility of evidence; and

      (4) For purposes of this section, a final order entered in a contested case by an administrative law judge under ORS 183.625 (3) is a final order issued by the agency that authorized the administrative law judge to conduct the hearing.

(Judicial Review)

 

      183.480 Judicial review of agency orders. (1) Except as provided in ORS 183.417 (3)(b), any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order or any party to an agency proceeding is entitled to judicial review of a final order, whether such order is affirmative or negative in form. A petition for rehearing or reconsideration need not be filed as a condition of judicial review unless specifically otherwise provided by statute or agency rule.

      (2) Judicial review of final orders of agencies shall be solely as provided by ORS 183.482, 183.484, 183.490 and 183.500.

      (3) No action or suit shall be maintained as to the validity of any agency order except a final order as provided in this section and ORS 183.482, 183.484, 183.490 and 183.500 or except upon showing that the agency is proceeding without probable cause, or that the party will suffer substantial and irreparable harm if interlocutory relief is not granted.

      (4) Judicial review of orders issued pursuant to ORS 813.410 shall be as provided by ORS 813.410. [1957 c.717 §12; 1963 c.449 §1; 1971 c.734 §18; 1975 c.759 §14; 1979 c.593 §23; 1983 c.338 §901; 1985 c.757 §4; 1997 c.837 §5; 2007 c.288 §11]

 

      183.482 Jurisdiction for review of contested cases; procedure; scope of court authority. (1) Jurisdiction for judicial review of contested cases is conferred upon the Court of Appeals. Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition in the Court of Appeals. The petition shall be filed within 60 days only following the date the order upon which the petition is based is served unless otherwise provided by statute. If a petition for rehearing has been filed, then the petition for review shall be filed within 60 days only following the date the order denying the petition for rehearing is served. If the agency does not otherwise act, a petition for rehearing or reconsideration shall be deemed denied the 60th day following the date the petition was filed, and in such cases, petition for judicial review shall be filed within 60 days only following such date. Date of service shall be the date on which the agency delivered or mailed its order in accordance with ORS 183.470.

      (2) The petition shall state the nature of the order the petitioner desires reviewed, and shall state whether the petitioner was a party to the administrative proceeding, was denied status as a party or is seeking judicial review as a person adversely affected or aggrieved by the agency order. In the latter case, the petitioner shall, by supporting affidavit, state the facts showing how the petitioner is adversely affected or aggrieved by the agency order. Before deciding the issues raised by the petition for review, the Court of Appeals shall decide, from facts set forth in the affidavit, whether or not the petitioner is entitled to petition as an adversely affected or an aggrieved person. Copies of the petition shall be served by registered or certified mail upon the agency, and all other parties of record in the agency proceeding.

      (3)(a) The filing of the petition shall not stay enforcement of the agency order, but the agency may do so upon a showing of:

      (A) Irreparable injury to the petitioner; and

      (B) A colorable claim of error in the order.

      (b) When a petitioner makes the showing required by paragraph (a) of this subsection, the agency shall grant the stay unless the agency determines that substantial public harm will result if the order is stayed. If the agency denies the stay, the denial shall be in writing and shall specifically state the substantial public harm that would result from the granting of the stay.

      (c) When the agency grants a stay, the agency may impose such reasonable conditions as the giving of a bond, irrevocable letter of credit or other undertaking and that the petitioner file all documents necessary to bring the matter to issue before the Court of Appeals within specified reasonable periods of time.

      (d) Agency denial of a motion for stay is subject to review by the Court of Appeals under such rules as the court may establish.

      (4) Within 30 days after service of the petition, or within such further time as the court may allow, the agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review, but, by stipulation of all parties to the review proceeding, the record may be shortened. Any party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when deemed desirable. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, the cost of the record shall not be taxed to the petitioner or any intervening party. However, the court may tax such costs and the cost of agency transcription of record to a party filing a frivolous petition for review.

      (5) If, on review of a contested case, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good and substantial reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon such conditions as the court deems proper. The agency may modify its findings and order by reason of the additional evidence and shall, within a time to be fixed by the court, file with the reviewing court, to become a part of the record, the additional evidence, together with any modifications or new findings or orders, or its certificate that the agency elects to stand on its original findings and order, as the case may be.

      (6) At any time subsequent to the filing of the petition for review and prior to the date set for hearing the agency may withdraw its order for purposes of reconsideration. If an agency withdraws an order for purposes of reconsideration, the agency shall, within such time as the court may allow, affirm, modify or reverse its order. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the agency action after withdrawal for purposes of reconsideration, the petitioner may refile the petition for review and the review shall proceed upon the revised order. An amended petition for review shall not be required if the agency, on reconsideration, affirms the order or modifies the order with only minor changes. If an agency withdraws an order for purposes of reconsideration and modifies or reverses the order in favor of the petitioner, the court shall allow the petitioner costs, but not attorney fees, to be paid from funds available to the agency.

      (7) Review of a contested case shall be confined to the record, and the court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to any issue of fact or agency discretion. In the case of disputed allegations of irregularities in procedure before the agency not shown in the record which, if proved, would warrant reversal or remand, the Court of Appeals may refer the allegations to a master appointed by the court to take evidence and make findings of fact upon them. The court shall remand the order for further agency action if the court finds that either the fairness of the proceedings or the correctness of the action may have been impaired by a material error in procedure or a failure to follow prescribed procedure, including a failure by the presiding officer to comply with the requirements of ORS 183.417 (8).

      (8)(a) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order. If the court finds that the agency has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action, the court shall:

      (A) Set aside or modify the order; or

      (B) Remand the case to the agency for further action under a correct interpretation of the provision of law.

      (b) The court shall remand the order to the agency if the court finds the agency’s exercise of discretion to be:

      (A) Outside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law;

      (B) Inconsistent with an agency rule, an officially stated agency position, or a prior agency practice, if the inconsistency is not explained by the agency; or

      (C) Otherwise in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision.

      (c) The court shall set aside or remand the order if the court finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding. [1975 c.759 §15; 1977 c.798 §4; 1979 c.593 §24; 1985 c.757 §2; 1989 c.453 §1; 1991 c.331 §44; 2007 c.659 §§2,5]

 

      183.484 Jurisdiction for review of orders other than contested cases; procedure; scope of court authority. (1) Jurisdiction for judicial review of orders other than contested cases is conferred upon the Circuit Court for Marion County and upon the circuit court for the county in which the petitioner resides or has a principal business office. Proceedings for review under this section shall be instituted by filing a petition in the Circuit Court for Marion County or the circuit court for the county in which the petitioner resides or has a principal business office.

      (2) Petitions for review shall be filed within 60 days only following the date the order is served, or if a petition for reconsideration or rehearing has been filed, then within 60 days only following the date the order denying such petition is served. If the agency does not otherwise act, a petition for rehearing or reconsideration shall be deemed denied the 60th day following the date the petition was filed, and in such case petition for judicial review shall be filed within 60 days only following such date. Date of service shall be the date on which the agency delivered or mailed its order in accordance with ORS 183.470.

      (3) The petition shall state the nature of the petitioner’s interest, the facts showing how the petitioner is adversely affected or aggrieved by the agency order and the ground or grounds upon which the petitioner contends the order should be reversed or remanded. The review shall proceed and be conducted by the court without a jury.

      (4) At any time subsequent to the filing of the petition for review and prior to the date set for hearing, the agency may withdraw its order for purposes of reconsideration. If an agency withdraws an order for purposes of reconsideration, it shall, within such time as the court may allow, affirm, modify or reverse its order. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the agency action after withdrawal for purposes of reconsideration, the petitioner may refile the petition for review and the review shall proceed upon the revised order. An amended petition for review shall not be required if the agency, on reconsideration, affirms the order or modifies the order with only minor changes. If an agency withdraws an order for purposes of reconsideration and modifies or reverses the order in favor of the petitioner, the court shall allow the petitioner costs, but not attorney fees, to be paid from funds available to the agency.

      (5)(a) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order. If the court finds that the agency has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action, it shall:

      (A) Set aside or modify the order; or

      (B) Remand the case to the agency for further action under a correct interpretation of the provision of law.

      (b) The court shall remand the order to the agency if it finds the agency’s exercise of discretion to be:

      (A) Outside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law;

      (B) Inconsistent with an agency rule, an officially stated agency position, or a prior agency practice, if the inconsistency is not explained by the agency; or

      (C) Otherwise in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision.

      (c) The court shall set aside or remand the order if it finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.

      (6) In the case of reversal the court shall make special findings of fact based upon the evidence in the record and conclusions of law indicating clearly all aspects in which the agency’s order is erroneous. [1975 c.759 §16; 1979 c.284 §121; 1979 c.593 §25a; 1985 c.757 §3; 1999 c.113 §1]

 

      183.485 Decision of court on review of contested case. (1) The court having jurisdiction for judicial review of contested cases shall direct its decision, including its judgment, to the agency issuing the order being reviewed and may direct that its judgment be delivered to the circuit court for any county designated by the prevailing party for entry in the circuit court’s register.

      (2) Upon receipt of the court’s decision, including the judgment, the clerk of the circuit court shall enter a judgment in the register of the court pursuant to the direction of the court to which the appeal is made. [1973 c.612 §7; 1981 c.178 §11; 1985 c.540 §39; 2003 c.576 §193]

 

      183.486 Form and scope of decision of reviewing court. (1) The reviewing court’s decision under ORS 183.482 or 183.484 may be mandatory, prohibitory, or declaratory in form, and it shall provide whatever relief is appropriate irrespective of the original form of the petition. The court may:

      (a) Order agency action required by law, order agency exercise of discretion when required by law, set aside agency action, remand the case for further agency proceedings or decide the rights, privileges, obligations, requirements or procedures at issue between the parties; and

      (b) Order such ancillary relief as the court finds necessary to redress the effects of official action wrongfully taken or withheld.

      (2) If the court sets aside agency action or remands the case to the agency for further proceedings, it may make such interlocutory order as the court finds necessary to preserve the interests of any party and the public pending further proceedings or agency action.

      (3) Unless the court finds a ground for setting aside, modifying, remanding, or ordering agency action or ancillary relief under a specified provision of this section, it shall affirm the agency action. [1979 c.593 §27]

 

      183.490 Agency may be compelled to act. The court may, upon petition as described in ORS 183.484, compel an agency to act where it has unlawfully refused to act or make a decision or unreasonably delayed taking action or making a decision. [1957 c.717 §13; 1979 c.593 §28]

 

      183.495 [1975 c.759 §16a; repealed by 1985 c.757 §7]

 

      183.497 Awarding costs and attorney fees when finding for petitioner. (1) In a judicial proceeding designated under subsection (2) of this section the court:

      (a) May, in its discretion, allow a petitioner reasonable attorney fees and costs if the court finds in favor of the petitioner.

      (5) The Department of Justice, the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and the Governor shall collaborate to increase the use of alternative dispute resolution to resolve disputes involving the State of Oregon by:

Hatfield School of Government, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Justice shall enter into an interagency agreement that includes, but is not limited to, provisions on appropriate roles, reporting requirements and coordination of services provided to state agencies by the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government pursuant to ORS 36.179.

      (c) Before providing dispute resolution services in a specific matter to a state agency under ORS 36.179, the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government shall notify the Department of Justice of any proposal to provide such services.

      (7) Agencies with alternative dispute resolution programs shall seek to identify cases appropriate for mediation and other means of alternative dispute resolution and to design systems and procedures to resolve those cases.

      (8) The purpose of the agency alternative dispute resolution programs is to:

      (a) Increase agency efficiency;

      (b) Increase public and agency satisfaction with the process and results of dispute resolution; and

      (c) Decrease the cost of resolving disputes.

      (9) An agency may use the services of an employee of another agency or of the federal government to serve as a mediator or facilitator, and may provide the services of an agency employee to another agency or to the federal government to serve as a mediator or facilitator. An agency may enter into an agreement with another agency or with the federal government to determine reimbursement for services of an employee acting as a mediator or facilitator under the provisions of this subsection. This subsection does not apply to mediation under ORS 243.650 to 243.782.
