STATE BOUNDARY COMPACT

 

      186.510 Oregon-Washington Columbia River Boundary Compact adopted. The Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon hereby ratifies the Oregon-Washington Columbia River Boundary Compact set forth in ORS 186.520, and the provisions of such compact hereby are declared to be the law of this state upon such compact becoming operative as provided in Article III of the compact. [1957 c.94 §1]

 

      186.520 Compact provisions. The provisions of the Oregon-Washington Columbia River Boundary Compact are as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE I.

PURPOSE

      The boundary between the States of Oregon and Washington along the course of the Columbia River has not been easy to ascertain because of changes in the main channel of the river with a result that a state of confusion and dispute exists and the enforcement and administration of the laws of the two states has been rendered difficult.

      The purpose of this compact is to fix with precision by reference to stations of longitude and latitude the boundary between the States of Oregon and Washington from one marine league due west of the mouth of the Columbia River to the most easterly point at which the 46th parallel of north latitude crosses said river, at which point the river ceases to form the boundary between the two states.

ARTICLE II.

DESCRIPTION

      The boundary between the States of Oregon and Washington from one marine league due west of the mouth of the Columbia River to the point at which the last described point number of the boundary as herein determined meets the 46th parallel of north latitude at 118º59’10”.12 of the west longitude shall be as follows:

      Beginning one marine league at sea off the mouth of the Columbia River at north latitude 46º15’00”.00; running thence due east to point number 1 of this description, which point is at north latitude 46º15’00”.00, west longitude 124º05’00”.00; thence from point number 1 continuing upstream in the channel of the Columbia River by a series of straight lines connecting the following numbered and described points in consecutive order.
