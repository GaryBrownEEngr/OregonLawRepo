      (c) Utilize existing geographic or political boundaries;

      (d) Not divide communities of common interest; and

      (e) Be connected by transportation links.

      (2) No district shall be drawn for the purpose of favoring any political party, incumbent legislator or other person.

      (a) To the extent practicable, hold five public hearings after a reapportionment plan is proposed, but before the plan is adopted. The adoption of a reapportionment plan may not be delayed by the impracticability of holding one or more of the hearings required under this subsection.

      (b) Conduct the hearings required under this subsection either in five different congressional districts of this state or with the use of videoconferencing technologies that permit active citizen participation throughout the state.

      (3) In holding the hearings required under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the Legislative Assembly or the Secretary of State, whichever is applicable, must:

      (c) Hold at least one hearing required under subsection (1) of this section and one hearing required under subsection (2) of this section in areas that have experienced the largest shifts in population since the previous reapportionment, and prioritize holding additional public hearings in these areas; and

      (d) Permit and make provision for individuals at remote sites throughout the state to provide public testimony at the hearings through the use of video equipment. [2015 c.257 §2]

 

      188.025 Secretary of State rules. The Secretary of State shall adopt rules the secretary considers necessary in carrying out the secretary’s reapportionment duties under ORS 188.010 to 188.295 and section 6, Article IV of the Oregon Constitution. [Formerly 188.015]

      (8) The special judicial panel shall employ the following standards in deciding upon a reapportionment plan:

If the panel finds that the legislatively adopted reapportionment plan does not comply with applicable statutes or the United States or Oregon Constitution, the panel may create its own reapportionment plan. A reapportionment plan adopted by the panel under this paragraph must comply with all applicable statutes and the United States and Oregon Constitutions.

      (b) If no legislatively adopted reapportionment plan was passed, the panel must consider all plans submitted by petitioners and intervenors, but may create its own reapportionment plan. A reapportionment plan adopted by the panel under this paragraph must comply with all applicable statutes and the United States and Oregon Constitutions.

      (11) The Supreme Court shall:

      (a) Hear any appeal brought under subsection (9) or (10) of this section; and

      (b) Employ the following standards in deciding upon a reapportionment plan affirmed or adopted by the special judicial panel:

      (A) For a legislatively adopted reapportionment plan, the Supreme Court must affirm the plan if the plan complies with all applicable statutes and the United States and Oregon Constitutions. If the court finds that the legislatively adopted reapportionment plan does not comply with applicable statutes or the United States or Oregon Constitution, the court may create its own reapportionment plan. A reapportionment plan adopted by the Supreme Court under this subparagraph must comply with all applicable statutes and the United States and Oregon Constitutions.

      (B) For a reapportionment plan that was adopted unanimously by the special judicial panel, the Supreme Court must affirm the plan if the plan complies with all applicable statutes and the United States and Oregon Constitutions. If the court finds that the unanimously adopted reapportionment plan does not comply with applicable statutes or the United States or Oregon Constitution, the court may create its own reapportionment plan. A reapportionment plan adopted by the Supreme Court under this subparagraph must comply with all applicable statutes and the United States and Oregon Constitutions.

      (C) For a reapportionment plan that was created or adopted by the special judicial panel by a less than unanimous decision, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, try the cause anew upon the record. This review must be based on the record created by the special judicial panel, but the Supreme Court may make its own determinations of law or underlying findings of fact. After conducting its review, the Supreme Court may affirm the panel’s reapportionment plan, amend the panel’s reapportionment plan or adopt a new reapportionment plan. A reapportionment plan decided upon by the Supreme Court under this subparagraph must comply with all applicable statutes and the United States and Oregon Constitutions.

      (12) If a party to an action files a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court under subsection (9) of this section:

      (a) The Supreme Court shall decide whether to approve the legislatively adopted reapportionment plan without any changes by October 1.

      (b) If the Supreme Court determines that the legislatively adopted reapportionment plan must be amended or substituted, by November 1 the court shall direct the special judicial panel to make such changes.

      (c) The special judicial panel shall make any required changes and submit a revised reapportionment plan to the Supreme Court by December 1.

      (d) The Supreme Court shall review the reapportionment plan revised by the special judicial panel and approve a final reapportionment plan by December 15.

      (13) If a party to an action files a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court under subsection (10) of this section:

      (a) The Supreme Court shall decide whether to approve a legislatively adopted reapportionment plan or a reapportionment plan that was unanimously adopted by the special judicial panel without any changes by November 1.

      (b) The Supreme Court shall decide whether to approve a less than unanimous decision of the special judicial panel without any changes by November 15.

      (c) If the Supreme Court determines that changes are required for a reapportionment plan approved by the special judicial panel, by November 15 the Supreme Court shall direct the panel to make such changes.

      (d) The special judicial panel shall make any required changes and submit a revised reapportionment plan to the Supreme Court by December 1.

      (e) The Supreme Court shall review the reapportionment plan revised by the special judicial panel and approve a final reapportionment plan by December 15.

      188.135 [See note following]

Note: After adjournment of the 2001 regular session of the Legislative Assembly, the Multnomah County Circuit Court ordered adoption of congressional district boundaries. The court’s order arose out of Perrin v. Kitzhaber, No. 0107-07021, which held the congressional district boundaries described in 188.135 unconstitutional. The court’s opinion was dated October 19, 2001. The court’s judgment was dated October 30, 2001. The ordered congressional district boundaries were set forth in 188.140 and the text of 188.135 was deleted.

      In 2011, the Legislative Assembly amended 188.140 to delete the boundaries ordered by the court in 2001 and adopt new congressional district boundaries.

LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS

 

      188.210 [Formerly 171.025; see note following]

 

      Note: Chapter 482, Oregon Laws 1961, including the apportionments under 182.210 and 188.220, was held unconstitutional in In Re Legislative Apportionment, 228 Or. 562, 364 P.2d 1004 (1961). A reapportionment drafted by the Secretary of State was approved by the Supreme Court in In Re Legislative Apportionment, 228 Or. 575, 365 P.2d 1042 (1961), and became law upon filing with the Governor on October 27, 1961. Pertinent portions of the reapportionment were printed in the 1961 through 1969 Replacement Parts of ORS chapter 171, but thereafter have been omitted.

      After adjournment of the 1971 Regular Session of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, the Secretary of State, pursuant to section 6 (3), Article IV, Oregon Constitution, made a reapportionment, which became law upon filing with the Governor on July 30, 1971. The Supreme Court reviewed that reapportionment in Hovet v. Myers, 260 Or. 152, 489 P.2d 684 (1971), and returned it to the Secretary of State with instructions to correct it in certain particulars and file the corrected reapportionment with the Governor. The corrected reapportionment became law upon filing with the Governor on October 14, 1971. It is set forth as chapter 1, Oregon Laws 1971 Special Session.
