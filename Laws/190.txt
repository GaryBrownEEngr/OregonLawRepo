(Generally)

 

      190.003 Definition for ORS 190.003 to 190.130. As used in ORS 190.003 to 190.130, “unit of local government” includes a county, city, district or other public corporation, commission, authority or entity organized and existing under statute or city or county charter. [1967 c.550 §2]

 

      190.007 Policy; construction. In the interest of furthering economy and efficiency in local government, intergovernmental cooperation is declared a matter of statewide concern. The provisions of ORS 190.003 to 190.130 shall be liberally construed. [1967 c.550 §3]

 

      190.010 Authority of local governments to make intergovernmental agreement. A unit of local government may enter into a written agreement with any other unit or units of local government for the performance of any or all functions and activities that a party to the agreement, its officers or agencies, have authority to perform. The agreement may provide for the performance of a function or activity:

      (1) By a consolidated department;

      (2) By jointly providing for administrative officers;

      (3) By means of facilities or equipment jointly constructed, owned, leased or operated;

      (4) By one of the parties for any other party;

      (5) By an intergovernmental entity created by the agreement and governed by a board or commission appointed by, responsible to and acting on behalf of the units of local government that are parties to the agreement; or

      (6) By a combination of the methods described in this section. [Amended by 1953 c.161 §2; 1963 c.189 §1; 1967 c.550 §4; 1991 c.583 §1]

 

      190.020 Contents of agreement. (1) An agreement under ORS 190.010 shall specify the functions or activities to be performed and by what means they shall be performed. Where applicable, the agreement shall provide for:

      (a) The apportionment among the parties to the agreement of the responsibility for providing funds to pay for expenses incurred in the performance of the functions or activities.

      (b) The apportionment of fees or other revenue derived from the functions or activities and the manner in which such revenue shall be accounted for.

      (c) The transfer of personnel and the preservation of their employment benefits.

      (d) The transfer of possession of or title to real or personal property.

      (e) The term or duration of the agreement, which may be perpetual.

      (f) The rights of the parties to terminate the agreement.

      (2) When the parties to an agreement are unable, upon termination of the agreement, to agree on the transfer of personnel or the division of assets and liabilities between the parties, the circuit court has jurisdiction to determine that transfer or division. [Amended by 1967 c.550 §5]

 

      190.030 Effect of agreement. (1) When an agreement under ORS 190.010 has been entered into, the unit of local government, consolidated department, intergovernmental entity or administrative officer designated therein to perform specified functions or activities is vested with all powers, rights and duties relating to those functions and activities that are vested by law in each separate party to the agreement, its officers and agencies.

      (2) An officer designated in an agreement to perform specified duties, functions or activities of two or more public officers shall be considered to be holding only one office.

      (3) An elective office may not be terminated by an agreement under ORS 190.010. [Amended by 1967 c.550 §6; 1991 c.583 §2]

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, intergovernmental group software product programming source codes, object codes and geographic databases or systems are confidential and exempt from public disclosure under ORS 192.355. Nothing in this section authorizes an intergovernmental group to restrict access to public records through inclusion of such records in a geographic database or system.

      190.070 Agreement changing service responsibilities requires changes in tax coordination resulting from change. (1) If any agreement entered into under ORS 190.010 to 190.030 or 190.110 between or among units of local government includes changes in service responsibility, that agreement shall set forth any changes in tax coordination resulting from the change in service responsibility.

      (E) Any other information otherwise required by law or that the board determines to include in the preliminary resolution.

      (c) The governing body of each city and county wholly or partially within the proposed zone must, within one year, approve or reject the preliminary resolution by order or resolution of the city or county governing body.

      (d) If the governing body of every city and county required to consider the question under paragraph (c) of this subsection approves the preliminary resolution, the board of directors of the intergovernmental entity, within 120 days of the last required governing body approval under paragraph (c) of this subsection, shall consider a final resolution that refers to voters in the proposed zone one or more ballot measures that reflect the contents of the resolutions approved under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection.

      (e) Each ballot measure referred to voters as described in paragraph (d) of this subsection must be approved by voters in the same manner provided by law for approval of general obligation bonds, a permanent rate limit for operating taxes, or local option taxes, except that if the final resolution includes dividing the territory of the entity into zones and does not establish a permanent rate limit for operating taxes:

      (A) The election must be held in May or November; and

      (B) The ballot measure must be approved by a majority of voters voting in the election in each zone in which taxes are to be imposed.

      (8) A ballot measure that proposes measures described in subsections (5)(d) and (7)(e) of this section shall be combined in a proposed zone.

      (b) In the case of a measure establishing tax zones within the territory of the intergovernmental entity, the tax revenues collected from each zone must be expended within the geographic area of the respective zone.

Any boundary change shall comply with the procedures set forth in ORS 308.225.

      (11) If the territory of an intergovernmental entity is divided into zones under this section, the board of directors shall determine, make and declare the ad valorem property tax levy for each zone when the board adopts its budget for any fiscal year. If the board modifies the ad valorem property tax levy or boundaries of a zone, the board must first obtain the approval of each affected city’s governing body or, in the case of a zone that includes unincorporated territory, each affected county’s governing body. The determination of the amount of ad valorem property taxes to be levied in each zone shall be in accordance with the proposal approved by the voters under this section and shall be entered in the proper records of the intergovernmental entity.
