PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY

 

      192.001 Policy concerning public records. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The records of the state and its political subdivisions are so interrelated and interdependent that the decision as to what records are retained or destroyed is a matter of statewide public policy.

      (b) The interest and concern of citizens in public records recognizes no jurisdictional boundaries and extends to such records wherever they may be found in Oregon.

      (c) As local programs become increasingly intergovernmental, the state and its political subdivisions have a responsibility to ensure orderly retention and destruction of all public records, whether current or noncurrent, and to ensure the preservation of public records of value for administrative, legal and research purposes.

      (2) The purpose of ORS 192.005 to 192.170 and 357.805 to 357.895 is to provide direction for the retention or destruction of public records in Oregon in order to ensure the retention of records essential to meet the needs of the Legislative Assembly, the state, its political subdivisions and its citizens, insofar as the records affect the administration of government, legal rights and responsibilities, and the accumulation of information of value for research purposes of all kinds, and in order to ensure the prompt destruction of records without continuing value. All records not included in types described in this subsection shall be destroyed in accordance with rules adopted by the Secretary of State. [1973 c.439 §1; 1991 c.671 §3; 2015 c.27 §18]

      (2)(a) The State Archivist shall provide instructions and forms for obtaining authorization. Upon receipt of an authorization or upon the effective date of the applicable rule, a state official who has public records in custody shall destroy or otherwise dispose of those records that are older than the specified period of retention established by the authorization or rule.

      (3) Authorizations granted prior to January 1, 1978, by any state agency, the State Archivist, or any board of county commissioners, to state agencies, schools, school districts, soil and water conservation districts, or county officials and offices shall remain in effect until they are adopted or amended by the State Archivist.

      (a) Many state agency reports are published for reasons that are historical and no longer based on the public’s need to be informed.

      (b) The format of many state agency reports is not economical or well suited to providing needed information in easily understandable form.

      (2) It is the policy of the Legislative Assembly to encourage state agencies to inform the public, the Legislative Assembly and the Governor of matters of public interest and concern. It is further the policy of this state to guarantee to its citizens the right to know about the activities of their government, to benefit from the information developed by state agencies at public expense and to enjoy equal access to the information services of state agencies. It is further state policy to encourage agencies to consider whether needed information is most effectively and economically presented by means of printed reports. [1991 c.842 §2]

The requirements of this subsection are not met if the executive summary is distributed to members of the Legislative Assembly in paper format.

      (2) The executive summary described in subsection (1) of this section shall include an explanation of how a member of the Legislative Assembly may obtain a copy of the report. If the report is also available on the Internet, the executive summary shall include the online location of the report.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if a member of the Legislative Assembly requests a paper copy of a report or executive summary, the agency or other entity responsible for submitting the report or executive summary to the Legislative Assembly shall supply a paper copy of the report or executive summary to the member.

(1) The custodian of any public records, including public records maintained in machine readable or electronic form, unless otherwise expressly provided by statute, shall furnish proper and reasonable opportunities for inspection and examination of the records in the office of the custodian and reasonable facilities for making memoranda or abstracts therefrom, during the usual business hours, to all persons having occasion to make examination of them. If the public record is maintained in machine readable or electronic form, the custodian shall furnish proper and reasonable opportunity to assure access.

      (2) The custodian of the records may adopt reasonable rules necessary for the protection of the records and to prevent interference with the regular discharge of duties of the custodian. [Formerly 192.430]

 

      192.324 Copies or inspection of public records; public body response; fees; procedure for records requests. (1) A public body that is the custodian of any public record that a person has a right to inspect shall give the person, upon receipt of a written request:

      (a) A copy of the public record if the public record is of a nature permitting copying; or

      (b) A reasonable opportunity to inspect or copy the public record.

      (2) If an individual who is identified in a public body’s procedure described in subsection (7)(a) of this section receives a written request to inspect or receive a copy of a public record, the public body shall within five business days after receiving the request acknowledge receipt of the request or complete the public body’s response to the request. An acknowledgment under this subsection must:

      (a) Confirm that the public body is the custodian of the requested record;

      (b) Inform the requester that the public body is not the custodian of the requested record; or

      (c) Notify the requester that the public body is uncertain whether the public body is the custodian of the requested record.

      (3) If the public record is maintained in a machine readable or electronic form, the public body shall provide a copy of the public record in the form requested, if available.

      (4)(a) The public body may establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse the public body for the public body’s actual cost of making public records available, including costs for summarizing, compiling or tailoring the public records, either in organization or media, to meet the request.

      (b) The public body may include in a fee established under paragraph (a) of this subsection the cost of time spent by an attorney for the public body in reviewing the public records, redacting material from the public records or segregating the public records into exempt and nonexempt records.

      (5) The custodian of a public record may furnish copies without charge or at a substantially reduced fee if the custodian determines that the waiver or reduction of fees is in the public interest because making the record available primarily benefits the general public.

      (6) A requester who believes that there has been an unreasonable denial of a fee waiver or fee reduction may petition the Attorney General or the district attorney in the same manner as a requester who petitions when inspection of a public record is denied under ORS 192.311 to 192.478. The Attorney General, the district attorney and the court have the same authority in instances when a fee waiver or reduction is denied as when inspection of a public record is denied.

      (a) Provides access to or copies of all requested records within the possession or custody of the public body that the public body does not assert are exempt from public disclosure, or explains where the records are already publicly available;

      (b) Asserts any exemptions from disclosure that the public body believes apply to any requested records and, if the public body cites ORS 192.355 (8) or (9), identifies the state or federal law that the public body relied on in asserting the exemptions;

      (c) Complies with ORS 192.338;

      (d) To the extent that the public body is not the custodian of records that have been requested, provides a written statement to that effect;

      (e) To the extent that state or federal law prohibits the public body from acknowledging whether any requested record exists or that acknowledging whether a requested record exists would result in the loss of federal benefits or imposition of another sanction, provides a written statement to that effect, citing the state or federal law that the public body relies on, unless the written statement itself would violate state or federal law; and

      (f) If the public body asserts that one or more requested records are exempt from public disclosure, includes a statement that the requester may seek review of the public body’s determination pursuant to ORS 192.401, 192.411, 192.415, 192.418, 192.422, 192.427 and 192.431.

      (3)(a) If a public body has informed a requester of a fee permitted under ORS 192.324 (4), the obligation of the public body to complete its response to the request is suspended until the requester has paid the fee, the fee has been waived by the public body pursuant to ORS 192.324 (5) or the fee otherwise has been ordered waived.

      (b) If the requester fails to pay the fee within 60 days of the date on which the public body informed the requester of the fee, or fails to pay the fee within 60 days of the date on which the public body informed the requester of the denial of the fee waiver, the public body shall close the request.

      (4)(a) A public body may request additional information or clarification from a requester of public records for the purpose of expediting the public body’s response to the request. If the public body has requested additional information or clarification in good faith, the public body’s obligation to further complete its response to the request is suspended until the requester provides the requested information or clarification or affirmatively declines to provide that information or clarification.

      (b) If the requester fails to respond within 60 days to a good faith request from the public body for information or clarification, the public body shall close the request.

      (5) As soon as reasonably possible but not later than 10 business days after the date by which a public body is required to acknowledge receipt of the request under ORS 192.324, a public body shall:

      (a) Complete its response to the public records request; or

      (b) Provide a written statement that the public body is still processing the request and a reasonable estimated date by which the public body expects to complete its response based on the information currently available.

      (6) The time periods established by ORS 192.324 and subsection (5) of this section do not apply to a public body if compliance would be impracticable because:

      (a) The staff or volunteers necessary to complete a response to the public records request are unavailable;

      (b) Compliance would demonstrably impede the public body’s ability to perform other necessary services; or

      (c) Of the volume of public records requests being simultaneously processed by the public body.

      (7) For purposes of this section, staff members or volunteers who are on leave or are not scheduled to work are considered to be unavailable.

      (8) A public body that cannot comply with the time periods established by ORS 192.324 and subsection (5) of this section for a reason listed in subsection (6) of this section shall, as soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay, acknowledge a public records request and complete the response to the request.

      192.335 Immunity from liability for disclosure of public record; effect of disclosure on privilege. (1) A public body that, acting in good faith, discloses a public record in response to a request for public records is not liable for any loss or damages based on the disclosure unless the disclosure is affirmatively prohibited by state or federal law or by a court order applicable to the public body. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to create liability on the part of a public body, or create a cause of action against a public body, based on the disclosure of a public record.

      (2) A public body that discloses any information or record in response to a written request for public records under ORS 192.311 to 192.478 that is privileged under ORS 40.225 to 40.295 does not waive its right to assert the applicable privilege to prevent the introduction of the information or record as evidence pursuant to ORS 40.225 to 40.295.

[Formerly 192.505]

      (b) If the Attorney General grants or denies the petition for a public record of the Health Licensing Office that contains information concerning a holder of an authorization to practice a profession or an applicant, the office, a person denied the right to inspect or receive a copy of the public record or the holder of the authorization or the applicant who is the subject of the public record may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court for the county where the public record is held.

(Appeals)

 

      192.407 When petition for review of public records request allowed; order granting petition; penalty. (1) A person who has submitted a written public records request in compliance with a public body’s policy may seek review of the following, in the same manner as a person petitions when inspection of a public record is denied under ORS 192.311 to 192.478:

      (a) The failure of a public body to provide the response required by ORS 192.329 within the prescribed period. A failure of the public body to timely respond shall be treated as a denial of the request unless the public body demonstrates that compliance was not required under ORS 192.329.

      (b) An estimate of time provided by a public body pursuant to ORS 192.329, if the person believes that the estimated time frame for the response is unreasonably long and will result in undue delay of disclosure.

      (c) Any other instance in which the person believes that the public body has failed to comply with ORS 192.329.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the Attorney General, the district attorney and the court have the same authority with respect to petitions under this section as when inspection of a public record is denied.

      (3) If the Attorney General, the district attorney or a court grants a petition filed under this section, the order granting the petition:

      (a) May require disclosure of nonexempt material responsive to the request within seven days, or within any other period that the Attorney General, district attorney or court concludes is appropriate to comply with ORS 192.329;

      (b) May require the public body to pay a penalty of $200 to the requester if the Attorney General, district attorney or court determines that the public body responded to the request with undue delay or failed to respond to the request; and

      (c) May order a fee waiver or a fee reduction if a public body has responded to the request with undue delay or has failed to respond to the request in the time and manner prescribed in ORS 192.329. Nothing in this subsection prohibits a reviewing body from finding an unreasonable denial of a fee waiver or a fee reduction on other grounds.

      (4) Nothing in this section limits the authority of a court to act under ORS 192.431. [2017 c.456 §5; 2019 c.205 §1]

 

      Note: 192.407 was added to and made a part of 192.311 to 192.478 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      192.411 Petition to review denial of right to inspect state public record; appeal from decision of Attorney General denying inspection. (1) Subject to ORS 192.401 (1) and 192.427, any person denied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record of a state agency may petition the Attorney General to review the public record to determine if it may be withheld from public inspection. Except as provided in ORS 192.401 (2), the burden is on the agency to sustain its action. Except as provided in ORS 192.401 (2), the Attorney General shall issue an order denying or granting the petition, or denying it in part and granting it in part, within seven days from the day the Attorney General receives the petition.

      (2) If the Attorney General grants the petition and orders the state agency to disclose the public record, or if the Attorney General grants the petition in part and orders the state agency to disclose a portion of the public record, the state agency shall comply with the order in full within seven days after issuance of the order, unless within the seven-day period it issues a notice of its intention to institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Marion County or, as provided in ORS 192.401 (3), in the circuit court of the county where the public record is held. Copies of the notice shall be sent to the Attorney General and by certified mail to the petitioner at the address shown on the petition. The state agency shall institute the proceedings within seven days after it issues its notice of intention to do so. If the Attorney General denies the petition in whole or in part, or if the state agency continues to withhold the public record or a part of it notwithstanding an order to disclose by the Attorney General, the person seeking disclosure may institute such proceedings.

      (3) The Attorney General shall serve as counsel for the state agency in a suit filed under subsection (2) of this section if the suit arises out of a determination by the Attorney General that the public record should not be disclosed, or that a part of the public record should not be disclosed if the state agency has fully complied with the order of the Attorney General requiring disclosure of another part or parts of the public record, and in no other case. In any case in which the Attorney General is prohibited from serving as counsel for the state agency, the agency may retain special counsel. [Formerly subsections (1) to (3) of 192.450]

 

      192.415 Procedure to review denial of right to inspect other public records; effect of disclosure. (1) ORS 192.401 and 192.411 apply to the case of a person denied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record of a public body other than a state agency, except that:

      (a) The district attorney of the county in which the public body is located, or if it is located in more than one county the district attorney of the county in which the administrative offices of the public body are located, shall carry out the functions of the Attorney General;

      (b) Any suit filed must be filed in the circuit court for the county described in paragraph (a) of this subsection; and

      (c) The district attorney may not serve as counsel for the public body, in the cases permitted under ORS 192.411 (3), unless the district attorney ordinarily serves as counsel for the public body.

      (2) Disclosure of a record to the district attorney in compliance with subsection (1) of this section does not waive any privilege or claim of privilege regarding the record or its contents.

      (3) Disclosure of a record or part of a record as ordered by the district attorney is a compelled disclosure for purposes of ORS 40.285. [Formerly 192.460]

 

      192.418 Effect of failure of Attorney General, district attorney or elected official to take timely action on inspection petition. (1) The failure of the Attorney General or district attorney to issue an order under ORS 192.401, 192.411 or 192.415 denying, granting, or denying in part and granting in part a petition to require disclosure within seven days from the day of receipt of the petition shall be treated as an order denying the petition for the purpose of determining whether a person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief under ORS 192.401, 192.411 or 192.415.

      (2) The failure of an elected official to deny, grant, or deny in part and grant in part a request to inspect or receive a copy of a public record within seven days from the day of receipt of the request shall be treated as a denial of the request for the purpose of determining whether a person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief under ORS 192.401, 192.411 or 192.415. [Formerly 192.465]

      192.422 Petition form; procedure when petition received. (1) A petition to the Attorney General or district attorney requesting the Attorney General or district attorney to order a public record to be made available for inspection or to be produced shall be in substantially the following form, or in a form containing the same information:

______________________________________________________________________________

______

      I (we), ____________ (name(s)), the undersigned, request the Attorney General (or District Attorney of ______ County) to order ______ (name of governmental body) and its employees to (make available for inspection) (produce a copy or copies of) the following records:

 

      1. ____________________

(Name or description of record)

 

      2. ____________________

(Name or description of record)

 

      I (we) asked to inspect and/or copy these records on ______ (date) at ______ (address). The request was denied by the following person(s):

 

      1. ____________________

(Name of public officer or employee;

      2. ____________________

______________________________________________________________________________

 

This form should be delivered or mailed to the Attorney General’s office in Salem, or the district attorney’s office in the county courthouse.

      (2) Promptly upon receipt of such a petition, the Attorney General or district attorney shall notify the public body involved. The public body shall thereupon transmit the public record disclosure of which is sought, or a copy, to the Attorney General, together with a statement of its reasons for believing that the public record should not be disclosed. In an appropriate case, with the consent of the Attorney General, the public body may instead disclose the nature or substance of the public record to the Attorney General. [Formerly 192.470]

 

      192.423 [2007 c.513 §2; renumbered 192.360 in 2017]

 

      192.427 Procedure to review denial by elected official of right to inspect public records. In any case in which a person is denied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of a public record in the custody of an elected official, or in the custody of any other person but as to which an elected official claims the right to withhold disclosure, no petition to require disclosure may be filed with the Attorney General or district attorney, or if a petition is filed it shall not be considered by the Attorney General or district attorney after a claim of right to withhold disclosure by an elected official. In such case a person denied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of a public record may institute proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief in the appropriate circuit court, as specified in ORS 192.401, 192.411 or 192.415, and the Attorney General or district attorney may upon request serve or decline to serve, in the discretion of the Attorney General or district attorney, as counsel in such suit for an elected official for which the Attorney General or district attorney ordinarily serves as counsel. Nothing in this section shall preclude an elected official from requesting advice from the Attorney General or a district attorney as to whether a public record should be disclosed. [Formerly 192.480]

      192.431 Court authority in reviewing action denying right to inspect public records; docketing; costs and attorney fees. (1) In any suit filed under ORS 192.401, 192.411, 192.415, 192.422 or 192.427, the court has jurisdiction to enjoin the public body from withholding records and to order the production of any records improperly withheld from the person seeking disclosure. The court shall determine the matter de novo and the burden is on the public body to sustain its action. The court, on its own motion, may view the documents in controversy in camera before reaching a decision. Any noncompliance with the order of the court may be punished as contempt of court.

      (2) Except as to causes the court considers of greater importance, proceedings arising under ORS 192.401, 192.411, 192.415, 192.422 or 192.427 take precedence on the docket over all other causes and shall be assigned for hearing and trial at the earliest practicable date and expedited in every way.

      (3) If a person seeking the right to inspect or to receive a copy of a public record prevails in the suit, the person shall be awarded costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal. If the person prevails in part, the court may in its discretion award the person costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal, or an appropriate portion thereof. If the state agency failed to comply with the Attorney General’s order in full and did not issue a notice of intention to institute proceedings pursuant to ORS 192.411 (2) within seven days after issuance of the order, or did not institute the proceedings within seven days after issuance of the notice, the petitioner shall be awarded costs of suit at the trial level and reasonable attorney fees regardless of which party instituted the suit and regardless of which party prevailed therein.

      Note: 192.531 to 192.549 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 192 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      192.533 Legislative findings; purposes. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The DNA molecule contains information about the probable medical future of an individual and the individual’s blood relatives. This information is written in a code that is rapidly being broken.

      (b) Genetic information is uniquely private and personal information that generally should not be collected, retained or disclosed without the individual’s authorization.

      (c) The improper collection, retention or disclosure of genetic information can lead to significant harm to an individual and the individual’s blood relatives, including stigmatization and discrimination in areas such as employment, education, health care and insurance.

      (d) An analysis of an individual’s DNA provides information not only about the individual, but also about blood relatives of the individual, with the potential for impacting family privacy, including reproductive decisions.

      (e) Current legal protections for medical information, tissue samples and DNA samples are inadequate to protect genetic privacy.

      (f) Laws for the collection, storage and use of identifiable DNA samples and private genetic information obtained from those samples are needed both to protect individual and family privacy and to permit and encourage legitimate scientific and medical research.

      (2) The purposes of the genetic privacy statutes are as follows:

      (a) To define the rights of individuals whose genetic information is collected, retained or disclosed and the rights of the individuals’ blood relatives.

      (b) To define the circumstances under which an individual may be subjected to genetic testing.

      (c) To define the circumstances under which an individual’s genetic information may be collected, retained or disclosed.

      (d) To protect against discrimination by an insurer or employer based upon an individual’s genetic characteristics.

      (e) To define the circumstances under which a DNA sample or genetic information may be used for research. [Formerly 659.705; 2003 c.333 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 192.531.

 

      192.535 Informed consent for obtaining genetic information. (1) A person may not obtain genetic information from an individual, or from an individual’s DNA sample, without first obtaining informed consent of the individual or the individual’s representative, except:

      (2) A financial institution which in good faith reliance refuses to disclose financial records of a customer upon the prohibitions of ORS 192.583 to 192.607, shall not be liable to its customer, to a state or local agency, or to any person for any loss or damage caused in whole or in part by such refusal.

      (3) Financial institutions shall not be required to notify their customers concerning the receipt by them of requests from state or local agencies for disclosures of financial records of such customers. However, except as otherwise provided in ORS 192.583 to 192.607, nothing in ORS 192.583 to 192.607 shall preclude financial institutions from giving such notice to customers. A court may order a financial institution to withhold notification to a customer of the receipt of a summons, subpoena or search warrant when the court finds that notice to the customer would impede the investigation being conducted by the state or local agency.

      (4) Financial institutions that participate in a trust account overdraft notification program established under ORS 9.685 are not liable to a lawyer or law firm on the attorney trust account, to a beneficiary of the trust account or to the Oregon State Bar for loss or damage caused in whole or in part by that participation or arising in any way out of that participation.

      (5) A financial institution shall not be liable to any person for any loss, damage or injury arising out of or in any way pertaining to the release of information pursuant to ORS 192.586 (2)(a). [Formerly 192.575; 2012 c.70 §§10b,27; 2013 c.352 §3]

 

      192.602 Time for compliance; reimbursement; exceptions. (1)(a) A financial institution shall have a reasonable period of time in which to comply with any proper customer authorization, summons, subpoena or search warrant permitting or seeking disclosure of financial records. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, a “reasonable period of time” shall in no case be less than 10 days from the date upon which the financial institution receives or is served with a customer authorization, summons, subpoena or search warrant.

      (b) When disclosure is sought under ORS 192.596, the reasonable period of time shall be not less than 20 days.

      (c) When disclosure is sought under ORS 192.597, the reasonable period of time shall be that period of time required by the circumstances but in no case more than 10 days from the date upon which the financial institution receives or is served with a subpoena under ORS 192.597.

      (2) Before making disclosures, a financial institution may require that the requesting state or local agency reimburse the financial institution for the reasonable costs incurred by the financial institution in the course of compliance. These costs include, but are not limited to, personnel costs, reproduction costs and travel expenses. The following charges shall be considered reasonable costs:

      (a) Personnel costs, $30 per hour per person, computed on the basis of $7.50 per quarter hour or fraction thereof, for time expended by personnel of the financial institution in searching, locating, retrieving, copying and transporting or conveying the requested material to the place of examination.

      (b) Reproduction costs, $1 per page, including copies produced by reader and printer reproduction processes. Photographs, films and other materials shall be reimbursed at actual costs.

      (c) Travel expenses, 50 cents per mile, plus other actual costs, necessary to transport personnel to locate and retrieve the information required or requested and to convey the required or requested material to the place of examination.

      (3) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section do not apply in the case of records subpoenaed by a prosecuting attorney as evidence of the crimes of negotiating a bad check under ORS 165.065, forgery under ORS 165.007 and 165.013, theft by deception by means of a bad check under ORS 164.085, fraudulent use of a credit card under ORS 165.055, identity theft under ORS 165.800 or racketeering activity under ORS 166.720 or of an offense listed in ORS 137.700. [Formerly 192.580; 2012 c.70 §§10c,28; 2013 c.352 §4]

 

      192.603 Procedure for disclosure to law enforcement agency. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Account information” means, whether or not the financial institution has an account under a particular customer’s name, the number of customer account items dishonored or that created overdrafts, dollar volume of dishonored items and items that when paid created overdrafts, a statement explaining any credit arrangement between the financial institution and the customer to pay overdrafts, dates and amounts of deposits and debits to a customer’s account, copies of deposit slips and deposited items, the account balance on such dates, a copy of the customer’s signature card and the dates the account opened or closed.

      (b) “Secure electronic message” means an electronic message that is encrypted or otherwise transmitted in a manner that is reasonably calculated to prevent accidental, unlawful or unauthorized disclosure or access to parties not authorized to receive or access the electronic message.

      (2) When a police or sheriff’s department or district attorney’s office in this state requests account information from a financial institution to assist in a criminal investigation, the financial institution shall supply a statement setting forth the requested account information with respect to a customer or a customer account specified by the police or sheriff’s department or district attorney’s office, for a period of up to three months prior to and three months following the date of occurrence of the account transaction giving rise to the criminal investigation. The disclosure statement required under this subsection may include only account information as defined in subsection (1) of this section. If the police or sheriff’s department or district attorney’s office makes the request by sending a secure electronic message to the financial institution, the financial institution shall respond to the request in a secure electronic message. The police or sheriff’s department or district attorney’s office requesting the information shall, within 24 hours of making the request, confirm the request in a written or secure electronic message delivered or mailed to the financial institution, setting forth the nature of the account information sought, the time period for which account information is sought, and that the information has been requested pursuant to a criminal investigation. [Formerly 192.585; 2019 c.399 §6]

 

      192.605 Charges for participation in attorney trust account overdraft notification program. Financial institutions that participate in an attorney trust account overdraft notification program established under ORS 9.685 may charge attorneys or law firms who have trust accounts with the financial institution for the reasonable costs incurred by the financial institution by reason of that participation. [Formerly 192.587]

 

      192.606 Civil liability for violation of ORS 192.583 to 192.607; attorney fees; status of evidence obtained in violation. (1) Any customer who suffers any ascertainable loss as a result of a willful violation of ORS 192.583 to 192.607 by any person, may bring an individual action in an appropriate court to recover actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater.

      (2) Any customer who suffers any ascertainable loss as a result of a negligent violation of ORS 192.583 to 192.607 by any person, may bring an individual action in an appropriate court to recover actual damages.

      192.607 Severability. If any provision of ORS 192.583 to 192.607 or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid for any reason, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision or application of ORS 192.583 to 192.607 which can remain in effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of ORS 192.583 to 192.607 are severable. [Formerly 192.595]

 

PUBLIC MEETINGS

 

      192.610 Definitions for ORS 192.610 to 192.690. As used in ORS 192.610 to 192.690:

      (1) “Decision” means any determination, action, vote or final disposition upon a motion, proposal, resolution, order, ordinance or measure on which a vote of a governing body is required, at any meeting at which a quorum is present.

      (2) “Executive session” means any meeting or part of a meeting of a governing body which is closed to certain persons for deliberation on certain matters.

      (3) “Governing body” means the members of any public body which consists of two or more members, with the authority to make decisions for or recommendations to a public body on policy or administration.

      (4) “Public body” means the state, any regional council, county, city or district, or any municipal or public corporation, or any board, department, commission, council, bureau, committee or subcommittee or advisory group or any other agency thereof.

      (5) “Meeting” means the convening of a governing body of a public body for which a quorum is required in order to make a decision or to deliberate toward a decision on any matter. “Meeting” does not include any on-site inspection of any project or program. “Meeting” also does not include the attendance of members of a governing body at any national, regional or state association to which the public body or the members belong. [1973 c.172 §2; 1979 c.644 §1]

 

      192.620 Policy. The Oregon form of government requires an informed public aware of the deliberations and decisions of governing bodies and the information upon which such decisions were made. It is the intent of ORS 192.610 to 192.690 that decisions of governing bodies be arrived at openly. [1973 c.172 §1]

 

      192.630 Meetings of governing body to be open to public; location of meetings; accommodation for person with disability; interpreters. (1) All meetings of the governing body of a public body shall be open to the public and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting except as otherwise provided by ORS 192.610 to 192.690.

      (2) A quorum of a governing body may not meet in private for the purpose of deciding on or deliberating toward a decision on any matter except as otherwise provided by ORS 192.610 to 192.690.

      (3) A governing body may not hold a meeting at any place where discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age or disability is practiced. However, the fact that organizations with restricted membership hold meetings at the place does not restrict its use by a public body if use of the place by a restricted membership organization is not the primary purpose of the place or its predominant use.

      (4)(a) Meetings of the governing body of a public body shall be held:

      (A) Within the geographic boundaries over which the public body has jurisdiction;

      (B) At the administrative headquarters of the public body;

      (C) At the nearest practical location; or

      (D) If the public body is a state, county, city or special district entity, within Indian country of a federally recognized Oregon Indian tribe that is within the geographic boundaries of this state. For purposes of this subparagraph, “Indian country” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. 1151.

      (b) Training sessions may be held outside the jurisdiction as long as no deliberations toward a decision are involved.

      (c) A joint meeting of two or more governing bodies or of one or more governing bodies and the elected officials of one or more federally recognized Oregon Indian tribes shall be held within the geographic boundaries over which one of the participating public bodies or one of the Oregon Indian tribes has jurisdiction or at the nearest practical location.

      (d) Meetings may be held in locations other than those described in this subsection in the event of an actual emergency necessitating immediate action.

      (5)(a) It is discrimination on the basis of disability for a governing body of a public body to meet in a place inaccessible to persons with disabilities, or, upon request of a person who is deaf or hard of hearing, to fail to make a good faith effort to have an interpreter for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing provided at a regularly scheduled meeting. The sole remedy for discrimination on the basis of disability shall be as provided in ORS 192.680.

      (b) The person requesting the interpreter shall give the governing body at least 48 hours’ notice of the request for an interpreter, shall provide the name of the requester, sign language preference and any other relevant information the governing body may request.

      (c) If a meeting is held upon less than 48 hours’ notice, reasonable effort shall be made to have an interpreter present, but the requirement for an interpreter does not apply to emergency meetings.

      (d) If certification of interpreters occurs under state or federal law, the Oregon Health Authority or other state or local agency shall try to refer only certified interpreters to governing bodies for purposes of this subsection.

      (e) As used in this subsection, “good faith effort” includes, but is not limited to, contacting the department or other state or local agency that maintains a list of qualified interpreters and arranging for the referral of one or more qualified interpreters to provide interpreter services. [1973 c.172 §3; 1979 c.644 §2; 1989 c.1019 §1; 1995 c.626 §1; 2003 c.14 §95; 2005 c.663 §12; 2007 c.70 §52; 2007 c.100 §21; 2009 c.595 §173; 2017 c.482 §1; 2019 c.286 §1]

 

      192.640 Public notice required; special notice for executive sessions or special or emergency meetings. (1) The governing body of a public body shall provide for and give public notice, reasonably calculated to give actual notice to interested persons including news media which have requested notice, of the time and place for holding regular meetings. The notice shall also include a list of the principal subjects anticipated to be considered at the meeting, but this requirement shall not limit the ability of a governing body to consider additional subjects.

      (2) If an executive session only will be held, the notice shall be given to the members of the governing body, to the general public and to news media which have requested notice, stating the specific provision of law authorizing the executive session.

      (3) No special meeting shall be held without at least 24 hours’ notice to the members of the governing body, the news media which have requested notice and the general public. In case of an actual emergency, a meeting may be held upon such notice as is appropriate to the circumstances, but the minutes for such a meeting shall describe the emergency justifying less than 24 hours’ notice. [1973 c.172 §4; 1979 c.644 §3; 1981 c.182 §1]

 

      192.650 Recording or written minutes required; content; fees. (1) The governing body of a public body shall provide for the sound, video or digital recording or the taking of written minutes of all its meetings. Neither a full transcript nor a full recording of the meeting is required, except as otherwise provided by law, but the written minutes or recording must give a true reflection of the matters discussed at the meeting and the views of the participants. All minutes or recordings shall be available to the public within a reasonable time after the meeting, and shall include at least the following information:

      (a) All members of the governing body present;

      (b) All motions, proposals, resolutions, orders, ordinances and measures proposed and their disposition;

      (c) The results of all votes and, except for public bodies consisting of more than 25 members unless requested by a member of that body, the vote of each member by name;

      (d) The substance of any discussion on any matter; and

      (e) Subject to ORS 192.311 to 192.478 relating to public records, a reference to any document discussed at the meeting.

      (2) Minutes of executive sessions shall be kept in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. However, the minutes of a hearing held under ORS 332.061 shall contain only the material not excluded under ORS 332.061 (2). Instead of written minutes, a record of any executive session may be kept in the form of a sound or video tape or digital recording, which need not be transcribed unless otherwise provided by law. If the disclosure of certain material is inconsistent with the purpose for which a meeting under ORS 192.660 is authorized to be held, that material may be excluded from disclosure. However, excluded materials are authorized to be examined privately by a court in any legal action and the court shall determine their admissibility.

      (3) A reference in minutes or a recording to a document discussed at a meeting of a governing body of a public body does not affect the status of the document under ORS 192.311 to 192.478.

      (4) A public body may charge a person a fee under ORS 192.324 for the preparation of a transcript from a recording. [1973 c.172 §5; 1975 c.664 §1; 1979 c.644 §4; 1999 c.59 §44; 2003 c.803 §14]

 

      192.660 Executive sessions permitted on certain matters; procedures; news media representatives’ attendance; limits. (1) ORS 192.610 to 192.690 do not prevent the governing body of a public body from holding executive session during a regular, special or emergency meeting, after the presiding officer has identified the authorization under ORS 192.610 to 192.690 for holding the executive session.

      (a) To consider the employment of a public officer, employee, staff member or individual agent.

      (6) No executive session may be held for the purpose of taking any final action or making any final decision.

      192.680 Enforcement of ORS 192.610 to 192.690; effect of violation on validity of decision of governing body; liability of members. (1) A decision made by a governing body of a public body in violation of ORS 192.610 to 192.690 shall be voidable.

A decision that is reinstated is effective from the date of its initial adoption.

      (2) Any person affected by a decision of a governing body of a public body may commence a suit in the circuit court for the county in which the governing body ordinarily meets, for the purpose of requiring compliance with, or the prevention of violations of ORS 192.610 to 192.690, by members of the governing body, or to determine the applicability of ORS 192.610 to 192.690 to matters or decisions of the governing body.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the court finds that the public body made a decision while in violation of ORS 192.610 to 192.690, the court shall void the decision of the governing body if the court finds that the violation was the result of intentional disregard of the law or willful misconduct by a quorum of the members of the governing body, unless other equitable relief is available.

      (4) If the court makes a finding that a violation of ORS 192.610 to 192.690 has occurred under subsection (2) of this section and that the violation is the result of willful misconduct by any member or members of the governing body, that member or members shall be jointly and severally liable to the governing body or the public body of which it is a part for the amount paid by the body under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) Any suit brought under subsection (2) of this section must be commenced within 60 days following the date that the decision becomes public record.

      192.685 Additional enforcement of alleged violations of ORS 192.660.
