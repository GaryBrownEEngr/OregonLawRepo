COORDINATION AGREEMENTS

 

(Agreements Generally)

 

      195.020 Special district planning responsibilities; agreements with local governments and metropolitan service district. (1) Special districts shall exercise their planning duties, powers and responsibilities and take actions that are authorized by law with respect to programs affecting land use, including a city or special district boundary change as defined in ORS 197.175 (1), in accordance with goals approved pursuant to ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197.

      (2) A county assigned coordinative functions under ORS 195.025 (1), or the metropolitan service district, which is assigned coordinative functions for Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties by ORS 195.025 (1), shall enter into a cooperative agreement with each special district that provides an urban service within the boundaries of the county or the metropolitan district. A county or the metropolitan service district may enter into a cooperative agreement with any other special district operating within the boundaries of the county or the metropolitan district.

      (3) The appropriate city and county and, if within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district, the metropolitan service district, shall enter into a cooperative agreement with each special district that provides an urban service within an urban growth boundary. The appropriate city and county, and the metropolitan service district, may enter into a cooperative agreement with any other special district operating within an urban growth boundary.

      (4) The agreements described in subsection (2) of this section shall conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a) to (d), (f) and (g) of this subsection. The agreements described in subsection (3) of this section shall:

      (a) Describe how the city or county will involve the special district in comprehensive planning, including plan amendments, periodic review and amendments to land use regulations;

      (b) Describe the responsibilities of the special district in comprehensive planning, including plan amendments, periodic review and amendments to land use regulations regarding provision of urban services;

      (c) Establish the role and responsibilities of each party to the agreement with respect to city or county approval of new development;

      (d) Establish the role and responsibilities of the city or county with respect to district interests including, where applicable, water sources, capital facilities and real property, including rights of way and easements;

      (e) Specify the units of local government which shall be parties to an urban service agreement under ORS 195.065;

      (f) If a metropolitan service district is a party to the agreement, describe how the metropolitan service district will involve the special district in the exercise of the metropolitan service district’s regional planning responsibilities; and

      (g) Contain such other provisions as the Land Conservation and Development Commission may require by rule.

      (5) Agreements required under subsections (2) and (3) of this section are subject to review by the commission. The commission may provide by rule for periodic submission and review of cooperative agreements to insure that they are consistent with acknowledged comprehensive plans. [Formerly 197.185]

 

      195.025 Regional coordination of planning activities; alternatives. (1) In addition to the responsibilities stated in ORS 197.175, each county, through its governing body, shall be responsible for coordinating all planning activities affecting land uses within the county, including planning activities of the county, cities, special districts and state agencies, to assure an integrated comprehensive plan for the entire area of the county. In addition to being subject to the provisions of ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197 with respect to city or special district boundary changes, as defined by ORS 197.175 (1), the governing body of the metropolitan service district shall be considered the county review, advisory and coordinative body for Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington Counties for the areas within that district.

      (2) For the purposes of carrying out ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197, counties may voluntarily join together with adjacent counties as authorized in ORS 190.003 to 190.620.

      (3) Whenever counties and cities representing 51 percent of the population in their area petition the Land Conservation and Development Commission for an election in their area to form a regional planning agency to exercise the authority of the counties under subsection (1) of this section in the area, the commission shall review the petition. If it finds that the area described in the petition forms a reasonable planning unit, it shall call an election in the area on a date specified in ORS 203.085, to form a regional planning agency. The election shall be conducted in the manner provided in ORS chapter 255. The county clerk shall be considered the elections officer and the commission shall be considered the district elections authority. The agency shall be considered established if the majority of votes favor the establishment.

      (4) If a voluntary association of local governments adopts a resolution ratified by each participating county and a majority of the participating cities therein which authorizes the association to perform the review, advisory and coordination functions assigned to the counties under subsection (1) of this section, the association may perform such duties. [Formerly 197.190]

 

      195.033 Area population forecasts; rules. (1) As used in this section, “affected local government” means:

      (a) A city or county for which the Portland State University Population Research Center is preparing a population forecast;

      (b) A county that contains all or part of a city or an urban growth boundary for which the center is preparing a population forecast; and

      (c) A local service district, as defined in ORS 174.116, that includes territory within the area subject to the population forecast.

      (2) For the purpose of land use planning, the center shall issue a population forecast for:

      (a) Each county except Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington Counties;

      (b) The portions of Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington Counties that are not within Metro; and

      (c) The area within each urban growth boundary other than the urban growth boundary of Metro.

      (3) A local government with land use jurisdiction over land for which the center issues population forecasts under subsection (2) of this section shall apply the current final population forecast when changing the comprehensive plan or a land use regulation of the local government.

      (4) The center shall issue population forecasts for each area described in subsection (2) of this section not less than once every four years on a schedule established by standards adopted by Portland State University in consultation with the Department of Land Conservation and Development.

      (5) When issuing a population forecast, the center shall:

      (a) Consider and, if appropriate, incorporate available local data and information about local conditions received from representatives of local governments and members of the public;

      (b) Cause, directly or with the assistance of the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the issuance of notice to all affected local governments and to members of the public that have provided a written request for notice to the center; and

      (c) Post the methodology and supporting data used to make the population forecast on a publicly available website when the center causes notice to be issued as described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (6) A population forecast must forecast population for a 50-year period including:

      (a) Forecasts for intervals, within the 50-year period, that are established by standards adopted by Portland State University in consultation with the Department of Land Conservation and Development; and

      (b) Population cohorts as provided by standards adopted by the university in consultation with the department.

      (7) Within 45 days after the center issues a proposed population forecast under this section, a member of the public or an affected local government may file objections with the center. An objection must be supported by the inclusion of data or information that supports the objection. If the center:

      (a) Does not receive an objection within the 45-day period, the proposed population forecast becomes final.

      (b) Receives an objection within the 45-day period, the center shall review the objections filed, make changes to the proposed population forecast, if necessary in the discretion of the center, and issue a final population forecast.

      (8) Periodically, the Department of Land Conservation and Development may require the center to submit its forecasting methodology and local data collection practices for review by an advisory committee established by the department and composed of experts in the field of population forecasting, representatives of cities and counties and members of the public.

      (9) The issuance of a final population forecast under this section is:

      (a) Not a land use decision; and

      (b) A final decision not subject to further review or appeal.

      (10) The Land Conservation and Development Commission, in consultation with Portland State University, shall adopt rules to implement the population forecasting program required by this section.

      (11) Each biennium, the commission shall allocate, from the grant funding described in ORS 197.639 (5), an amount of moneys that the Land Conservation and Development Commission, in consultation with Portland State University, determines is sufficient to operate the population forecasting program required by this section.

      (f) Establish a process for review and modification of the urban service agreement.

      (2)(a) Each county shall have responsibility for convening representatives of all cities and special districts that provide or declare an interest in providing an urban service inside an urban growth boundary within the county, for the purpose of negotiating an urban service agreement. A county may establish two or more subareas inside an urban growth boundary for the purpose of such agreements. If an urban service is to be provided within the boundaries of a metropolitan service district, a county shall notify the metropolitan service district in advance of the time for cities and special districts to meet for the purpose of negotiating an urban service agreement, and the metropolitan service district shall exercise its review, advisory and coordination functions under ORS 195.025.

      (b) When negotiating for an urban service agreement, a county shall consult with recognized community planning organizations within the area affected by the urban service agreement.

      (3) Decisions on a local government structure to be used to deliver an urban service under ORS 195.070 are not land use decisions under ORS 197.015.

      (4) For purposes of ORS 195.020, 195.070, 195.075, 197.005 and this section, “urban services” means:

[1993 c.804 §3]

 

      195.070 Agreement factors. (1) The following factors shall be considered in establishing urban service agreements under ORS 195.065:

      (a) Financial, operational and managerial capacity to provide the service;

      (b) The effect on the cost of the urban service to the users of the service, the quality and quantity of the service provided and the ability of urban service users to identify and contact service providers, and to determine their accountability, with ease;

      (c) Physical factors related to the provision of the urban service;

      (d) The feasibility of creating a new entity for the provision of the urban service;

      (2) The extent of consideration of the factors set forth in subsection (1) of this section is a matter of local government and special district discretion. [1993 c.804 §4]

 

      195.075 Agreement provisions and considerations. (1) Urban service agreements entered into under ORS 195.065 shall provide for the continuation of an adequate level of urban services to the entire area that each provider serves. If an urban service agreement calls for significant reductions in the territory of a special service district, the urban service agreement shall specify how the remaining portion of the district is to receive services in an affordable manner.

      (2) Units of local government and special districts that enter into an urban service agreement shall consider the agreement’s effect on the financial integrity and operational ability of each service provider and its protection of the solvency and commitments of affected service providers. When an urban service agreement provides for the elimination, consolidation or reduction in size of a service provider, the urban service agreement shall address:

      (a) The capital debt of the provider and short- and long-term finances;

      (b) Rates;

      (c) Employee compensation, benefits and job security; and

      (d) Equality of service. [1993 c.804 §5]

 

      195.080 Application of comprehensive plans and land use regulations. Nothing in ORS 195.020, 195.060 to 195.085, 195.205 to 195.235, 197.005, 197.319, 197.320, 197.335 and 223.304 shall be construed to prevent planning for, installation of or connection to public facilities or services consistent with acknowledged comprehensive plans and land use regulations. [1993 c.804 §6]

 

      195.085 Compliance deadlines. (1) Local governments and special districts shall demonstrate compliance with ORS 195.020 and 195.065.

      (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission may adjust the deadline for compliance under this section when cities and counties that are parties to an agreement under ORS 195.020 and 195.065 are scheduled for periodic review at different times.

      (3) Local governments and special districts that are parties to an agreement in effect on November 4, 1993, which provides for the future provision of an urban service shall demonstrate compliance with ORS 195.065 no later than the date such agreement expires or the second periodic review that begins after November 4, 1993, whichever comes first.

      (4) An urban service agreement in effect on April 1, 2014, does not apply to real property described as Area 2 on Metro’s map denominated “2011 UGB Expansion Areas, Ordinance 11-1264B, Exhibit A, October, 2011.” [1993 c.804 §§7,8; 2014 c.92 §7]

 

(School Facility Planning)

 

      195.110 School facility plan for large school districts. (1) As used in this section, “large school district” means a school district that has an enrollment of over 2,500 students based on certified enrollment numbers submitted to the Department of Education during the first quarter of each new school year.

      (2) A city or county containing a large school district shall:

      (a) Include as an element of its comprehensive plan a school facility plan prepared by the district in consultation with the affected city or county.

      (b) Initiate planning activities with a school district to accomplish planning as required under ORS 195.020.

      (3) The provisions of subsection (2)(a) of this section do not apply to a city or a county that contains less than 10 percent of the total population of the large school district.

      (4) The large school district shall select a representative to meet and confer with a representative of the city or county, as described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, to accomplish the planning required by ORS 195.020 and shall notify the city or county of the selected representative. The city or county shall provide the facilities and set the time for the planning activities. The representatives shall meet at least twice each year, unless all representatives agree in writing to another schedule, and make a written summary of issues discussed and proposed actions.

      (5)(a) The school facility plan must cover a period of at least 10 years and must include, but need not be limited to, the following elements:

      (A) Population projections by school age group.

      (B) Identification by the city or county and by the large school district of desirable school sites.

      (C) Descriptions of physical improvements needed in existing schools to meet the minimum standards of the large school district.

      (D) Financial plans to meet school facility needs, including an analysis of available tools to ensure facility needs are met.

      (E) An analysis of:

      (i) The alternatives to new school construction and major renovation; and

      (ii) Measures to increase the efficient use of school sites including, but not limited to, multiple-story buildings and multipurpose use of sites.

      (F) Ten-year capital improvement plans.

      (G) Site acquisition schedules and programs.

      (b) Based on the elements described in paragraph (a) of this subsection and applicable laws and rules, the school facility plan must also include an analysis of the land required for the 10-year period covered by the plan that is suitable, as a permitted or conditional use, for school facilities inside the urban growth boundary.

      (6) If a large school district determines that there is an inadequate supply of suitable land for school facilities for the 10-year period covered by the school facility plan, the city or county, or both, and the large school district shall cooperate in identifying land for school facilities and take necessary actions, including, but not limited to, adopting appropriate zoning, aggregating existing lots or parcels in separate ownership, adding one or more sites designated for school facilities to an urban growth boundary, or petitioning a metropolitan service district to add one or more sites designated for school facilities to an urban growth boundary pursuant to applicable law.

      (7) The school facility plan shall provide for the integration of existing city or county land dedication requirements with the needs of the large school district.

      (8) The large school district shall:

      (a) Identify in the school facility plan school facility needs based on population growth projections and land use designations contained in the city or county comprehensive plan; and

      (b) Update the school facility plan during periodic review or more frequently by mutual agreement between the large school district and the affected city or county.

      (9)(a) In the school facility plan, the district school board of a large school district may adopt objective criteria to be used by an affected city or county to determine whether adequate capacity exists to accommodate projected development. Before the adoption of the criteria, the large school district shall confer with the affected cities and counties and agree, to the extent possible, on the appropriate criteria. After a large school district formally adopts criteria for the capacity of school facilities, an affected city or county shall accept those criteria as its own for purposes of evaluating applications for a comprehensive plan amendment or for a residential land use regulation amendment.

      (b) A city or county shall provide notice to an affected large school district when considering a plan or land use regulation amendment that significantly impacts school capacity. If the large school district requests, the city or county shall implement a coordinated process with the district to identify potential school sites and facilities to address the projected impacts.

      (10) A school district that is not a large school district may adopt a school facility plan as described in this section in consultation with an affected city or county.

      (11) The capacity of a school facility is not the basis for a development moratorium under ORS 197.505 to 197.540.

      (12) This section does not confer any power to a school district to declare a building moratorium.

      (13) A city or county may deny an application for residential development based on a lack of school capacity if:

      (a) The issue is raised by the school district;

      (b) The lack of school capacity is based on a school facility plan formally adopted under this section; and

      (c) The city or county has considered options to address school capacity. [1993 c.550 §2; 1995 c.508 §1; 2001 c.876 §1; 2007 c.579 §1]

 

      195.115 Reducing barriers for pedestrian and bicycle access to schools. City and county governing bodies shall work with school district personnel to identify barriers and hazards to children walking or bicycling to and from school. The cities, counties and districts may develop a plan for the funding of improvements designed to reduce the barriers and hazards identified. [2001 c.940 §1]

 

      Note: 195.115 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 195 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

URBAN AND RURAL RESERVES

 

      195.137 Definitions for ORS 195.137 to 195.145. As used in ORS 195.137 to 195.145:

      (1) “Rural reserve” means land reserved to provide long-term protection for agriculture, forestry or important natural landscape features that limit urban development or help define appropriate natural boundaries of urbanization, including plant, fish and wildlife habitat, steep slopes and floodplains.

      (2) “Urban reserve” means lands outside an urban growth boundary that will provide for:

      (a) Future expansion over a long-term period; and

      (b) The cost-effective provision of public facilities and services within the area when the lands are included within the urban growth boundary. [2007 c.723 §1]

 

      195.139 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Long-range planning for population and employment growth by local governments can offer greater certainty for:

      (a) The agricultural and forest industries, by offering long-term protection of large blocks of land with the characteristics necessary to maintain their viability; and

      (b) Commerce, other industries, other private landowners and providers of public services, by determining the more and less likely locations of future expansion of urban growth boundaries and urban development.

      (2) State planning laws must support and facilitate long-range planning to provide this greater certainty. [2007 c.723 §2]

 

      195.141 Designation of rural reserves and urban reserves pursuant to intergovernmental agreement; rules. (1) A county and a metropolitan service district established under ORS chapter 268 may enter into an intergovernmental agreement pursuant to ORS 190.003 to 190.130, 195.025 or 197.652 to 197.658 to designate rural reserves pursuant to this section and urban reserves pursuant to ORS 195.145 (1)(b).

      (2) Land designated as a rural reserve:

      (a) Must be outside an urban growth boundary.

      (b) May not be designated as an urban reserve during the urban reserve planning period described in ORS 195.145 (4).

      (c) May not be included within an urban growth boundary during the period of time described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (3) When designating a rural reserve under this section to provide long-term protection to the agricultural industry, a county and a metropolitan service district shall base the designation on consideration of factors including, but not limited to, whether land proposed for designation as a rural reserve:

      (a) Is situated in an area that is otherwise potentially subject to urbanization during the period described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, as indicated by proximity to the urban growth boundary and to properties with fair market values that significantly exceed agricultural values;

      (b) Is capable of sustaining long-term agricultural operations;

      (c) Has suitable soils and available water where needed to sustain long-term agricultural operations; and

      (d) Is suitable to sustain long-term agricultural operations, taking into account:

      (A) The existence of a large block of agricultural or other resource land with a concentration or cluster of farms;

      (B) The adjacent land use pattern, including its location in relation to adjacent nonfarm uses and the existence of buffers between agricultural operations and nonfarm uses;

      (C) The agricultural land use pattern, including parcelization, tenure and ownership patterns; and

      (D) The sufficiency of agricultural infrastructure in the area.

      (4) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall, after consultation with the State Department of Agriculture, adopt by goal or by rule a process and criteria for designating rural reserves pursuant to this section. [2007 c.723 §3]

 

      195.143 Coordinated and concurrent process for designation of rural reserves and urban reserves. (1) A county and a metropolitan service district must consider simultaneously the designation and establishment of:

      (a) Rural reserves pursuant to ORS 195.141; and

      (b) Urban reserves pursuant to ORS 195.145 (1)(b).

      (2) An agreement between a county and a metropolitan service district to establish rural reserves pursuant to ORS 195.141 and urban reserves pursuant to ORS 195.145 (1)(b) must provide for a coordinated and concurrent process for adoption by the county of comprehensive plan provisions and by the district of regional framework plan provisions to implement the agreement. A district may not designate urban reserves pursuant to ORS 195.145 (1)(b) in a county until the county and the district have entered into an agreement pursuant to ORS 195.145 (1)(b) that identifies the land to be designated by the district in the district’s regional framework plan as urban reserves. A county may not designate rural reserves pursuant to ORS 195.141 until the county and the district have entered into an agreement pursuant to ORS 195.141 that identifies the land to be designated as rural reserves by the county in the county’s comprehensive plan.

      (3) A county and a metropolitan service district may not enter into an intergovernmental agreement to designate urban reserves in the county pursuant to ORS 195.145 (1)(b) unless the county and the district also agree to designate rural reserves in the county.

      (4) Designation and protection of rural reserves pursuant to ORS 195.141 or urban reserves pursuant to ORS 195.145 (1)(b):

      (a) Is not a basis for a claim for compensation under ORS 195.305 unless the designation and protection of rural reserves or urban reserves imposes a new restriction on the use of private real property.

      (b) Does not impair the rights and immunities provided under ORS 30.930 to 30.947. [2007 c.723 §4]

      (1) “Further review area” means an area of land within which further site specific review should occur before land management or building activities begin because either the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries or the State Forestry Department determines that the area reasonably could be expected to include sites that experience rapidly moving landslides as a result of excessive rainfall.

      (2) “Landslide” means any detached mass of soil, rock or debris that is of sufficient size to cause damage and that moves down a slope or a stream channel.

      (3) “Rapidly moving landslide” means a landslide that is difficult for people to outrun or escape. [1999 c.1103 §1]

 

      Note: 195.250 to 195.260 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 195 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      195.253 Policy. The Legislative Assembly declares that it is the policy of the State of Oregon that:

      (1) Each property owner, each highway user and all federal, state and local governments share the responsibility for making sound decisions regarding activities that may affect landslide hazards and the associated risks of property damage or personal injury.

      (2) In keeping with the concept of shared responsibility where individuals are primarily responsible for making sound decisions to protect personal interests, regulation applied pursuant to ORS 195.250 to 195.260 shall be restricted to reducing the risk of serious bodily injury or death that may result from rapidly moving landslides.

      (3) In recognition of the need for consistent treatment and coordination of actions relating to rapidly moving landslides and because of the potential for serious bodily injury or death as a result of rapidly moving landslides and the effect of rapidly moving landslides on the ability of people to use their property, ORS 195.250 to 195.260 shall be regarded as the controlling policy of this state for rapidly moving landslides. [1999 c.1103 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 195.250.

 

      195.256 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Many locations in Oregon are subject to naturally occurring landslide hazards, and some human activities may accelerate the incidence or increase the adverse effects of those hazards.

      (2) Rapidly moving landslides present the greatest risk to human life, and persons living in or traveling through areas prone to rapidly moving landslides are at increased risk of serious bodily injury or death.

      (3) Although some risk from rapidly moving landslides can be mitigated through proper siting and construction techniques, sites that are vulnerable to impact from rapidly moving landslides are generally unsuitable for permanent habitation.

      (4) Activities that require sound decisions to mitigate rapidly moving landslide hazards and risks include but are not limited to:

      (a) Siting or constructing homes or other structures in areas prone to rapidly moving landslides;

      (b) Occupying existing homes or other structures in areas prone to rapidly moving landslides during periods of high risk due to heavy or extended rainfall;

      (c) Conducting land management activities that may adversely alter the susceptibility of land to rapidly moving landslides; and

      (d) Operating motor vehicles in areas known to be subject to rapidly moving landslides. [1999 c.1103 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 195.250.

 

      195.260 Duties of local governments, state agencies and landowners in landslide hazard areas. (1) In order to reduce the risk of serious bodily injury or death resulting from rapidly moving landslides, a local government:

      (a) Shall exercise all available authority to protect the public during emergencies, consistent with ORS 401.032.

      (b) May require a geotechnical report and, if a report is required, shall provide for a coordinated review of the geotechnical report by the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries or the State Forestry Department, as appropriate, before issuing a building permit for a site in a further review area.

      (c) Except those structures exempt from building codes under ORS 455.310 and 455.315, shall amend its land use regulations, or adopt new land use regulations, to regulate the siting of dwellings and other structures designed for human occupancy, including those being restored under ORS 215.130 (6), in further review areas where there is evidence of substantial risk for rapidly moving landslides. All final decisions under this paragraph and paragraph (b) of this subsection are the responsibility of the local government with jurisdiction over the site. A local government may not delegate such final decisions to any state agency.

      (d) May deny a request to issue a building permit if a geotechnical report discloses that the entire parcel is subject to a rapidly moving landslide or that the subject lot or parcel does not contain sufficient buildable area that is not subject to a rapidly moving landslide.

      (e) Shall maintain a record, available to the public, of properties for which a geotechnical report has been prepared within the jurisdiction of the local government.

      (2) A landowner allowed a building permit under subsection (1)(c) of this section shall sign a statement that shall:

      (a) Be recorded with the county clerk of the county in which the property is located, in which the landowner acknowledges that the landowner may not in the future bring any action against an adjacent landowner about the effects of rapidly moving landslides on or adjacent to the landowner’s property; and

      (b) Record in the deed records for the county where the lot or parcel is located a nonrevocable deed restriction that the landowner signs and acknowledges, that contains a legal description complying with ORS 93.600 and that prohibits any present or future owner of the property from bringing any action against an adjacent landowner about the effects of rapidly moving landslides on or adjacent to the property.

      (3) Restrictions on forest practices adopted under ORS 527.710 (10) do not apply to risk situations arising solely from the construction of a building designed for human occupancy in a further review area on or after October 23, 1999.

      (4) The following state agencies shall implement the following specific responsibilities to reduce the risk of serious bodily injury or death resulting from rapidly moving landslides:

      (a) The State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall:

      (A) Identify and map further review areas selected in cooperation with local governments and in coordination with the State Forestry Department, and provide technical assistance to local governments to facilitate the use and application of this information pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section; and

      (B) Provide public education regarding landslide hazards.

      (b) The State Forestry Department shall regulate forest operations to reduce the risk of serious bodily injury or death from rapidly moving landslides directly related to forest operations, and assist local governments in the siting review of permanent dwellings on and adjacent to forestlands in further review areas pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (c) The Land Conservation and Development Commission may take steps under its existing authority to assist local governments to appropriately apply the requirements of subsection (1)(c) of this section.

      (d) The Department of Transportation shall provide warnings to motorists during periods determined to be of highest risk of rapidly moving landslides along areas on state highways with a history of being most vulnerable to rapidly moving landslides.

      (e) The Office of Emergency Management shall coordinate state resources for rapid and effective response to landslide-related emergencies.

      (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any state or local agency adopting rules related to the risk of serious bodily injury or death from rapidly moving landslides shall do so only in conformance with the policies and provisions of ORS 195.250 to 195.260.

      (6) No state or local agency may adopt or enact any rule or ordinance for the purpose of reducing risk of serious bodily injury or death from rapidly moving landslides that limits the use of land that is in addition to land identified as a further review area by the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries or the State Forestry Department pursuant to subsection (4) of this section.

      (7) Except as provided in ORS 527.710 or in Oregon’s ocean and coastal land use planning goals, no state agency may adopt criteria regulating activities for the purpose of reducing risk of serious bodily injury or death from rapidly moving landslides on lands subject to the provisions of ORS 195.250 to 195.260 that are more restrictive than the criteria adopted by a local government pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section.

[2007 c.424 §3]

 

      195.305 Compensation for restriction of use of real property due to land use regulation. (1) If a public entity enacts one or more land use regulations that restrict the residential use of private real property or a farming or forest practice and that reduce the fair market value of the property, then the owner of the property shall be entitled to just compensation from the public entity that enacted the land use regulation or regulations as provided in ORS 195.310 to 195.314.

      (2) Just compensation under ORS 195.310 to 195.314 shall be based on the reduction in the fair market value of the property resulting from the land use regulation.

      (3) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to land use regulations that were enacted prior to the claimant’s acquisition date or to land use regulations:

      (a) That restrict or prohibit activities commonly and historically recognized as public nuisances under common law;

      (b) That restrict or prohibit activities for the protection of public health and safety;

      (c) To the extent the land use regulations are required to comply with federal law;

      (d) That restrict or prohibit the use of a property for the purpose of selling pornography or performing nude dancing;

      (e) That plan and rezone land to an industrial zoning classification for inclusion within an urban growth boundary; or

      (f) That plan and rezone land within an urban growth boundary to an industrial zoning classification.

      (4)(a) Subsection (3)(a) of this section shall be construed narrowly in favor of granting just compensation under this section. Nothing in subsection (3) of this section is intended to affect or alter rights provided by the Oregon or United States Constitution.

      (b) Subsection (3)(b) of this section does not apply to any farming or forest practice regulation that is enacted after January 1, 2007, unless the primary purpose of the regulation is the protection of human health and safety.

      (c) Subsection (3)(c) of this section does not apply to any farming or forest practice regulation that is enacted after January 1, 2007, unless the public entity enacting the regulation has no discretion under federal law to decline to enact the regulation.

      (5) A public entity may adopt or apply procedures for the processing of claims under ORS 195.310 to 195.336.

      (6) The public entity that enacted the land use regulation that gives rise to a claim under subsection (1) of this section shall provide just compensation as required under ORS 195.310 to 195.336.

      (7) A decision by a public entity that an owner qualifies for just compensation under ORS 195.305 to 195.336 and sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, sections 2 to 9 and 17, chapter 855, Oregon Laws 2009, and sections 2 to 7, chapter 8, Oregon Laws 2010, and a decision by a public entity on the nature and extent of that compensation are not land use decisions.

      (8) The remedies created by ORS 195.305 to 195.336 and sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, sections 2 to 9 and 17, chapter 855, Oregon Laws 2009, and sections 2 to 7, chapter 8, Oregon Laws 2010, are in addition to any other remedy under the Oregon or United States Constitution, and are not intended to modify or replace any constitutional remedy.

      (9) If any portion or portions of this section are declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this section shall remain in full force and effect. [Formerly 197.352; 2013 c.279 §1]

 

      195.308 Exception to requirement for compensation. Notwithstanding the requirement to pay just compensation for certain land use regulations under ORS 195.305 (1), compensation is not due for the enforcement or enactment of a land use regulation established in ORS 30.930 to 30.947, 527.310 to 527.370, 561.995, 569.360 to 569.495, 570.010 to 570.050, 570.105 to 570.190, 570.305, 570.310, 570.320 to 570.360, 570.405, 570.412, 570.420, 570.425, 570.450, 570.700 to 570.710, 570.755, 570.770, 570.775, 570.780, 570.790, 570.800, 570.995, 596.095, 596.100, 596.105, 596.393, 596.990 or 596.995 or in administrative rules or statewide plans implementing these statutes. [2007 c.490 §1; 2009 c.98 §11; 2015 c.203 §27]

 

      Note: 195.308 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 195 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      195.310 Claim for compensation; calculation of reduction in fair market value; highest and best use of restricted property; status of use authorized. (1) A person may file a claim for just compensation under ORS 195.305 and 195.310 to 195.314 after June 28, 2007, if:

      (a) The person is an owner of the property and all owners of the property have consented in writing to the filing of the claim;

      (b) The person’s desired use of the property is a residential use or a farming or forest practice;

      (c) The person’s desired use of the property is restricted by one or more land use regulations enacted after January 1, 2007; and

      (d) The enactment of one or more land use regulations after January 1, 2007, other than land use regulations described in ORS 195.305 (3), has reduced the fair market value of the property.

      (2) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the reduction in the fair market value of the property caused by the enactment of one or more land use regulations that are the basis for the claim is equal to the decrease, if any, in the fair market value of the property from the date that is one year before the enactment of the land use regulation to the date that is one year after the enactment, plus interest. If the claim is based on the enactment of more than one land use regulation enacted on different dates, the reduction in the fair market value of the property caused by each regulation shall be determined separately and the values added together to calculate the total reduction in fair market value. Interest shall be computed under this subsection using the average interest rate for a one-year United States Government Treasury Bill on December 31 of each year of the period between the date the land use regulation was enacted and the date the claim was filed, compounded annually on January 1 of each year of the period. A claimant must provide an appraisal showing the fair market value of the property one year before the enactment of the land use regulation and the fair market value of the property one year after the enactment. The actual and reasonable cost of preparing the claim, including the cost of the appraisal, not to exceed $5,000, may be added to the calculation of the reduction in fair market value under this subsection. The appraisal must:

      (a) Be prepared by a person certified under ORS chapter 674 or a person registered under ORS chapter 308;

      (b) Comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, as authorized by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989; and

      (c) Unless the claim is based on the enactment of one or more land use regulations described in ORS 195.300 (14)(e), expressly determine the highest and best use of the property at the time the land use regulation was enacted.

      (3) Unless the claim is based on the enactment of one or more land use regulations described in ORS 195.300 (14)(e), relief may not be granted under this section if the highest and best use of the property at the time the land use regulation was enacted was not the use that was restricted by the land use regulation.

      (4) For a claim based on a land use regulation described in ORS 195.300 (14)(e), the reduction in fair market value:

      (a) Is the reduction in fair market value of a lawfully established unit of land that is attributable to the land use regulation on the date the claim is filed.

However, the standards must not be applied in a manner that has the effect of prohibiting the establishment of the dwelling, lot or parcel authorized under sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, unless the standards are reasonably necessary to avoid or abate a nuisance, to protect public health or safety or to carry out federal law.

      (2) If the property described in a claim is bisected by an urban growth boundary, any new dwelling, lot or parcel established on the property pursuant to an order under section 6, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, must be located on the portion of the property outside the urban growth boundary.

      (3) Before beginning construction of any dwelling authorized under section 6 or 7, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, the owner must comply with the requirements of ORS 215.293 if the property is in an exclusive farm use zone, a forest zone or a mixed farm and forest zone.

If one of the properties is zoned for residential use, the owner may cluster some or all of the dwellings, lots or parcels that would have been located in an exclusive farm use zone, a forest zone or a mixed farm and forest zone on the property zoned for residential use.

      (6) An owner is not eligible for more than 20 home site approvals under sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, regardless of how many properties that person owns or how many claims that person has filed.

      (7) An authorization to partition or subdivide the property, or to establish dwellings on the property, granted under section 6, 7 or 9, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, runs with the property and may be either transferred with the property or encumbered by another person without affecting the authorization.

In addition:

      (a) A lot or parcel lawfully created based on an authorization under section 6, 7 or 9, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, remains a discrete lot or parcel, unless the lot or parcel lines are vacated or the lot or parcel is further divided, as provided by law; and

      (b) A dwelling or other residential use of the property based on an authorization under section 6, 7 or 9, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, is a permitted use and may be established or continued by the claimant or a subsequent owner, except that once the claimant conveys the property to a person other than the claimant’s spouse or the trustee of a revocable trust in which the claimant is the settlor, the subsequent owner must establish the dwellings or other residential use authorized under section 6, 7 or 9, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, within 10 years of the conveyance.

      (8) When relief has been claimed under sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007:

      (a) Additional relief is not due; and

      (b) An additional claim may not be filed, compensation is not due and a waiver may not be issued with regard to the property

under ORS 195.305 to 195.336 and sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, or ORS 195.305 as in effect immediately before December 6, 2007, except with respect to a land use regulation enacted after January 1, 2007.

      (9) A person that is eligible to be a holder as defined in ORS 271.715 may acquire the rights to carry out a use of land authorized under sections 5 to 11, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, from a willing seller in the manner provided by ORS 271.715 to 271.795. Metro, cities and counties may enter into cooperative agreements under ORS chapter 195 to establish a system for the purchase and sale of severable development interests as described in ORS 94.531. A system established under this subsection may provide for the transfer of severable development interests between the jurisdictions of the public entities that are parties to the agreement for the purpose of allowing development to occur in a location that is different from the location in which the development interest arises.

      (10) If a claimant is an individual, the entitlement to prosecute the claim under section 6, 7 or 9, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007, and an authorization to use the property provided by a waiver under section 6, 7 or 9, chapter 424, Oregon Laws 2007:

      (a) Is not affected by the death of the claimant if the death occurs on or after December 6, 2007; and
