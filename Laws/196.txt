COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE

 

      196.105 Definitions for ORS 196.105 to 196.125. As used in ORS 196.105 to 196.125:

      (1) “Commission” means the Columbia River Gorge Commission established under section 5 of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663.

      (2) “General management area” means the area within the scenic area that is not an urban area or special management area.

      (3) “Management plan” means the management plan for the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area adopted by the commission.

      (4) “Special management area” means any area identified as such in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act.

      (5) “Urban area” means the 13 towns or cities as identified in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act. [1987 c.856 §1; 1993 c.317 §1]

 

      196.107 Legislative findings on management plan; effect of plan on land use decisions; decertification of plan. (1) The Legislative Assembly, considering the recommendations of the Land Conservation and Development Commission, finds that the management plan adopted pursuant to the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act achieves on balance the purposes of the statewide planning goals adopted pursuant to ORS 197.230.

      (2) Land use decisions subject to review under ORS 197.835 for compliance with the goals for those portions of Multnomah, Hood River and Wasco Counties within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, except land within urban area boundaries, are exempt from the requirements of ORS 197.610 to 197.625. This exemption becomes effective in a county when that county or the Columbia River Gorge Commission adopts and implements ordinances that are approved pursuant to sections 7(b) and 8(h) to 8(k) of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663.

      (3) The Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development may petition the Land Conservation and Development Commission to decertify the management plan at any time. If the Land Conservation and Development Commission receives a petition from the director, the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall decertify the management plan within 120 days, if it determines that any part of the management plan does not achieve on balance the purposes of the statewide planning goals adopted pursuant to ORS 197.230. [1993 c.317 §3]

 

      196.109 Effect of revision of urban area boundaries within scenic area on management plan. If the urban area boundaries of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area are revised to include land that was once within the general management area or the special management area, the management plan no longer applies to that land and the applicable provisions of ORS chapters 92, 195, 197, 215 and 227 and the rules, plans and ordinances adopted thereunder apply. [1993 c.317 §4]

 

      196.110 Land use regulation in Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. (1) Notwithstanding any provision setting forth criteria or conditions for approval of a permit or requiring action by the county in ORS chapter 92, 195, 196, 197 or 215 or in a local ordinance or charter, a county may deny any permit or otherwise refuse to take any action that is inconsistent with the purposes and standards as provided in sections 3 and 6(d) of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663, or the scenic area management plan adopted pursuant to the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663. When taking action on a permit application, a county shall follow procedures consistent with the procedures set out in ORS 215.402 to 215.438 and shall comply with the time limitations set out in ORS 215.427. The authority of a county to deny a permit or otherwise take action under this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other authority for denial that may be exercised by the county pursuant to the provisions of ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197. Any action of a county taken pursuant to this subsection shall be appealed to the Columbia River Gorge Commission as provided in section 15(a)(2) of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a state agency may not take action that must be reviewed for compatibility with an acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulation in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area until the agency determines through written findings that the action is consistent with the purposes and standards as provided in sections 3 and 6(d) of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663, and the interim guidelines or the scenic area management plan.

      (3) A state agency may seek any of the administrative or judicial remedies or participate in any proceeding provided by the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663.

      (4) The provisions of ORS 197.180 do not apply to the Columbia River Gorge Commission. [1987 c.856 §2; 2003 c.181 §1]

 

      196.115 Appeal from decision of Columbia River Gorge Commission or county. (1) For purposes of judicial review, decisions of the Columbia River Gorge Commission shall be subject to review solely as provided in this section, except as otherwise provided by the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663.

      (2)(a) A final action or order by the commission in a review or appeal of any action of the commission pursuant to section 10(c) or 15(b)(4) of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, or a final action or order by the commission in a review or appeal of any action of a county pursuant to section 15(a)(2) or 15(b)(4) of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, shall be reviewed by the Court of Appeals on a petition for judicial review filed and served as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section and ORS 183.482.

      (b) On a petition for judicial review under paragraph (a) of this subsection the Court of Appeals also shall review the action of the county that is the subject of the commission’s order, if requested in the petition.

      (c) The Court of Appeals shall issue a final order on review under this subsection within the time limits provided by ORS 197.855.

      (d) In lieu of judicial review under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, a county action may be appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals under ORS 197.805 to 197.855. A notice of intent to appeal the county’s action shall be filed not later than 21 days after the commission’s order on the county action becomes final.

      (e) Notwithstanding ORS 197.835, the scope of review in an appeal pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subsection shall not include any issue relating to interpretation or implementation of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663, and any issue related to such interpretation or implementation shall be waived by the filing of an appeal under paragraph (d) of this subsection.

      (f) After county land use ordinances are approved pursuant to sections 7(b) and 8(h) to (k) of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663, the Land Use Board of Appeals shall not review land use decisions within the general management area or special management area for compliance with the statewide planning goals. The limitation of this paragraph shall not apply if the Land Conservation and Development Commission decertifies the management plan pursuant to ORS 196.107.

      (3)(a) If a petition for judicial review of a commission order is filed pursuant to subsection (2)(a) of this section, the procedures to be followed by the parties, the commission and the court, and the court’s review, shall be in accordance with ORS 183.480, 183.482 (1) to (7), 183.485, 183.486, 183.490 and 183.497, except as this section or the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663, otherwise provides.

      (b) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS 183.482:

      (A) The commission shall transmit the original record or the certified copy of the entire record within 21 days after service of a petition for judicial review is served on the commission; and

      (B) The parties shall file briefs with the court within the times allowed by rules of the court.

      (c) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order. If the court finds that the agency has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action, the court shall:

      (A) Set aside or modify the order; or

      (B) Remand the case to the agency for further action under a correct interpretation of the provision of law.

      (d) The court shall remand the order to the agency if the court finds the agency’s exercise of discretion to be:

      (A) Outside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law;

      (B) Inconsistent with an agency rule, an officially stated agency position or a prior agency practice, unless the inconsistency is explained by the agency; or

      (C) Otherwise in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision.

      (e) The court shall set aside or remand the order if the court finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record.

      (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any case where review of a county action as well as a commission order is sought pursuant to subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section, the court shall accept any findings of fact by the commission which the court finds to be supported by substantial evidence in the whole record, and such findings by the commission shall prevail over any findings by the county concerning the same or substantially the same facts.

      (4)(a) Except as otherwise provided by this section or the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663, if review of a county action is sought pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this section, the procedures to be followed by the parties, the county and the court, and the court’s review, shall be in accordance with those provisions governing review of county land use decisions by the Land Use Board of Appeals set forth in ORS 197.830 (2) to (8), (10), (15) and (16) and 197.835 (2) to (10), (12) and (13). As used in this section, “board” as used in the enumerated provisions shall mean “court” and the term “notice of intent to appeal” in ORS 197.830 (10) shall refer to the petition described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) In addition to the other requirements of service under this section, the petitioner shall serve the petition upon the persons and bodies described in ORS 197.830 (9), as a prerequisite to judicial review of the county action.

      (c) In accordance with subsection (3)(b)(B) of this section, a party to a review of both a commission order and a county action shall file only one brief with the court, which shall address both the commission order and the county action.

      (d) Review of a decision under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 shall be confined to the record. Subject to subsection (3)(f) of this section, the court shall be bound by any finding of fact of the county for which there is substantial evidence in the whole record. The court may appoint a master and follow the procedures of ORS 183.482 (7) in connection with matters that the board may take evidence for under ORS 197.835 (2).

      (5) Approval of county land use ordinances by the commission pursuant to section 7 of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, P.L. 99-663, may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals as provided in ORS 183.482.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 183.484, any proceeding filed in circuit court by or against the commission shall be filed with the circuit court for the county in which the commission has a principal business office or in which the land involved in the proceeding is located. [1987 c.856 §3; 1989 c.761 §17; 1993 c.317 §5; 1995 c.595 §16; 1999 c.621 §4]

      196.180 Compact provisions. The provisions of the Pacific Ocean Resources Compact are as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE I

 

Findings and Purpose

 

A. The parties recognize:

      (1) The States of Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington and the Province of British Columbia have a common interest in the protection of marine and coastal resources. This common interest results from:

      (a) The fluid, dynamic ocean currents and atmospheric winds that carry pollutants beyond one party’s coastal area to another.

      (b) The migratory nature of many important living marine resources that depend upon the marine habitat of various parties for different parts of their lifecycle.

      (c) The economic reliance of each party upon renewable resources of the ocean.

      (d) The use of the ocean for transport of oil and other hazardous substances between ports in the various parties and other nations.

      (e) A regional interest in providing a stable environment for those communities dependent upon ocean resources and ocean trade for a livelihood.

      (2) Some marine resource activities, such as fisheries, are currently highly managed with regard for their regional or transboundary nature through existing state programs, regional fisheries councils, interstate compacts and international treaties. Because there are existing formal mechanisms for interstate cooperation and coordination for these marine resource activities, this compact is not intended to encompass these activities or to grant to the Pacific Ocean Resources Compact authority to regulate resource allocation or management as it may pertain to the use and consumption of marine resources.

      (3) A formal interstate agreement does not exist to address and resolve issues of mutual concern or to coordinate individual programs of the parties that affect regional interests in the areas of:

      (a) Prevention of oil and hazardous substance spills;

      (b) Transportation of oil and other hazardous substances;

      (c) Oil and hazardous substance spill response planning;

      (d) Environmental monitoring and research; and

      (e) Ocean resource management.

      (4) Each party has jurisdiction over the submerged and submersible lands within its territorial sea and responsibility for management of many marine resources and ocean uses. Each party has unique natural resource, social, economic and political conditions for which local management by the individual party is the most appropriate.

      (5) Parties now do not have an effective means to address mutual concerns related to transport of oil and hazardous substances in waters within and beyond the party’s jurisdiction that may jeopardize ocean resources and uses important to one or more coastal parties.

      (6) The 1983 Presidential Proclamation of the 200-mile United States Exclusive Economic Zone has created the opportunity for all coastal states to more fully exercise and assert their responsibilities pertaining to the protection, conservation and development of ocean resources under United States jurisdiction.

      (7) Citizens of the Pacific states and the Province of British Columbia are increasingly concerned with the environmental integrity of the ocean and protection of all ocean resources.

      (8) Recent studies conducted in the wake of major accidental releases of oil or hazardous substances have concluded that the existing system of response to spills could be improved in the following ways to provide better protection of ocean resources:

      (a) Enhanced personnel training and qualifications;

      (b) Improved vessel design and integrity;

      (c) Better mechanisms for cost recovery by the states or the province;

      (d) Improved coordination in regulatory oversight;

      (e) Enhanced traffic management; and

      (f) An improved information base dealing with marine and coastal environments.

      (9) A spill or discharge of oil or hazardous substance from an ocean-going vessel has the potential of causing major regional impacts.

B. Therefore, the purposes of this compact shall be:

      (1) To assist in the promotion of interstate commerce by encouraging uniform regulation of the transportation of oil or hazardous substance within the compact zone.

      (2) To provide a legal mechanism to regulate certain ocean activities within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone.

      (3) To enhance regional coordination of issues of critical importance.

      (4) To work with federal agencies to advance the best interest of the region.

      (5) To foster regional cooperation and pooling of resources to reduce costs and increase effective use of scarce resources.

      (6) To monitor activities of concern to the parties.

      (7) To address issues of mutual concern to the Pacific states and the Province of British Columbia and enhance the parties’ influence over activities of concern that are not now addressed through existing compacts, including:

      (a) Spill prevention;

      (b) Transportation of oil and other hazardous substances;

      (c) Spill response planning;

      (d) Environmental monitoring and research; and

      (e) Ocean resource management.

      (8) To foster cooperation and coordination among the parties in order to increase the effectiveness of the individual party’s ocean laws and programs.

      (9) To provide technical assistance to parties for ocean activities covered by this compact.

      (10) To provide for formal participation by the Province of British Columbia with the compact to more fully address issues of regional concern.

      (11) To insure that the citizens of the region have opportunities to participate in discussions and deliberations of regional ocean resources issues.

      (12) To establish an innovative system under which the parties can represent their shared interests within the compact zone, including:

      (a) The maintenance and protection of common ocean resources; and

      (b) The vessel transportation of oil and other hazardous substances.

      (13) To recommend uniform safety standards for routes, crews and equipment for vessels transporting oil and hazardous substances within the compact zone and monitor the implementation of these standards and regulations by federal agencies, states or provinces and private industry.

      (14) To promote more coordinated management of ocean resources that are of mutual concern.

      (15) To provide a forum for the regional coordination of the individual parties’ plans for the management and protection of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting parties jointly or separately now have or may acquire jurisdiction.

      (f) Enter into an agreement with the United States Coast Guard under which the compact will administer compliance with the requirements for demonstrating financial responsibility under section 1016 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in an amount established by the compact. Such proof of financial responsibility, if established by the compact, shall satisfy and supersede the requirement of any individual party for demonstrating financial responsibility. However, all financial responsibility requirements established by the parties to this compact before the compact establishes an amount under this paragraph shall remain in full force and effect until the compact establishes a requirement and enters into an agreement with the United States Coast Guard under this paragraph. In establishing the amount of financial responsibility under this paragraph, the compact shall work with officials of each party to assure that such requirements are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the parties, in aggregate.

      (g) In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. §§551 to 559 and §§701-706, enforce the rules and regulations adopted by the compact to carry out the authority of the compact as set forth in this Article.

      (h) Appoint technical and advisory committees for the purpose of advising the compact on regional ocean resources issues, data needs and format and other purposes related to the compact’s activities. A technical or advisory committee appointed by the compact shall not be subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (P.L. 92-463, as amended).

      (i) Allow a variance from the provisions of this compact or rules or regulations adopted by the compact pursuant to this Article. A variance shall be based on a showing by the person or entity seeking the variance that the activity allowed under the variance will have no regional impact and that the variance is economically necessary. Under no circumstances may a variance result in the regulation of the transportation of oil or hazardous substance according to standards less stringent than standards imposed under federal law.

      (3) The compact shall adopt all regulations necessary to carry out its duties and exercise its authority under this Article. The compact shall adopt such regulations in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. §§500 to 559.

OREGON OCEAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

 

(Generally)

 

      196.405 Definitions for ORS 196.405 to 196.515. As used in ORS 196.405 to 196.515, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Council” means the council established in ORS 196.438.

      (2) “Exclusive Economic Zone” has the meaning set forth in Proc. 5030 whereby the United States proclaimed jurisdiction over the resources of the ocean within 200 miles of the coastline.

      (3) “Panel” means a project review panel established under ORS 196.453.

      (4) “Plan” means the Oregon Ocean Resources Management Plan.

      (5) “Territorial sea” means the waters and seabed extending three geographical miles seaward from the coastline in conformance with federal law.

      (6) “Territorial Sea Plan” means the plan for Oregon’s territorial sea. [1987 c.576 §6; 1991 c.501 §2; 2003 c.744 §1]

 

      196.407 Policy. It is the policy of this state to:

      (1) Work with the States of Washington and California to explore the possibility of development of communication information systems including a computerized system of coastal and marine resource information.

      (2) Work with the States of Washington and California to develop compatible programs of ocean oil spill response, damage assessment and compensation.

      (3) Cooperate and coordinate with adjacent states to develop a regional approach to obtaining fisheries information. [1989 c.895 §2; 2003 c.744 §2]

 

      196.408 Duties of state agencies. (1) State agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, coordinate development of coastal and ocean information systems with those in adjacent states.

      (2) State agencies with responsibility for oil spill and hazardous material response, damage assessment and compensation in the marine environment shall, to the maximum extent practicable, coordinate Oregon’s plans, programs, policies and techniques with those of adjacent states.

      (3) State agencies which have jurisdiction over water areas, the seabed and resources adjacent to offshore rocks and islands may coordinate with adjacent states and federal agencies to develop programs and regulations to manage uses and activities of ocean areas adjacent to coastal cliffs and offshore rocks and islands managed within the National Wildlife Refuge System.

      (4) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife may coordinate with fishery managers in adjacent states to develop a uniform fish catch and monitoring system. [1989 c.895 §3; 2003 c.744 §3]

 

      196.410 Legislative findings for offshore oil and gas leasing. The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (1) Oregon’s territorial sea encompasses all the rocks and islands of the Oregon National Wildlife Refuge, borders all beaches, headlands and rocky intertidal areas and includes areas heavily used for commercial and recreational fishing. Navigation lanes for barges and vessels pass through the area.

      (2) Oregon’s territorial sea is rich in marine life. Its renewable resources support significant portions of the coastal economy. It is a dynamic, hazardous marine environment within which oil spills cannot be contained.

      (3) Oregon’s nearshore zone is extremely high in biological productivity, reflected by the variety and value of commercial and sport ocean fisheries catch. The Oregon coast provides a significant habitat for migrating seabirds and mammals. Oregon is unwilling to risk damaging sensitive marine environments or to sacrifice environmental quality to develop offshore oil and gas resources. [1989 c.895 §4]

 

      196.415 Legislative findings for ocean resources management. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The Pacific Ocean and its many resources are of environmental, economic, aesthetic, recreational, social and historic importance to the people of this state.

      (2) Exploration, development and production of ocean resources likely to result from both federal agency programs in federal waters of the outer continental shelf and initiatives of private companies within state waters will increase the chance of conflicting demands on ocean resources for food, energy and minerals, as well as waste disposal and assimilation, and may jeopardize ocean resources and values of importance to this state.

      (3) The fluid, dynamic nature of the ocean and the migration of many of its living resources beyond state boundaries extend the ocean management interests of this state beyond the three geographic mile territorial sea currently managed by the state pursuant to the federal Submerged Lands Act.

      (4) Existing federal laws, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, the Magnuson Fisheries Management and Conservation Act of 1976, as amended, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1978, recognize the interests of coastal states in management of ocean resources in federal waters and provide for state participation in ocean resources management decisions. The Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 require that all federal coastal activities affecting natural resources, land uses and water uses in the coastal zone must be consistent with the federally approved Oregon Coastal Management Program.

      (5) The 1983 Proclamation of the 200-mile United States Exclusive Economic Zone has created an opportunity for all coastal states to more fully exercise and assert their responsibilities pertaining to the protection, conservation and development of ocean resources under United States jurisdiction.

      (6) It is important that the State of Oregon develop and maintain a program of ocean resources management to promote management of living and nonliving marine resources within state jurisdiction, to insure effective participation in federal agency planning and management of ocean resources and uses which may affect this state, and to coordinate state agency management of ocean resources with local government management of coastal shorelands and resources.

      (7) While much is known about the ocean, its composition, characteristics and resources, additional study and research is required to gain information and understanding necessary for sound ocean planning and management. [1987 c.576 §3; 1991 c.501 §3; 2003 c.744 §4]

 

      196.420 Policy. It is the policy of the State of Oregon to:

      (1) Conserve the long-term values, benefits and natural resources of the ocean both within the state and beyond by giving clear priority to the proper management and protection of renewable resources over nonrenewable resources;

      (2) Encourage ocean resources development which is environmentally sound and economically beneficial to adjacent local governments and to the state;

      (3) Assert the interests of this state as a partner with federal agencies in the sound management of the ocean resources within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone and on the continental shelf;

      (4) Encourage research, study and understanding of ocean processes, marine life and other ocean resources;

      (5) Encourage research and development of new, innovative marine technologies to study and utilize ocean resources; and

      (6) Ensure that the Ocean Policy Advisory Council will work closely with coastal local governments to incorporate in its activities coastal local government and resident concerns, coastal economic sustainability and expertise of coastal residents. [1987 c.576 §4; 1991 c.501 §4; 2003 c.744 §5]

 

      196.425 Oregon Ocean Resources Management Program. To ensure the conservation and development of ocean resources affecting Oregon consistent with the purposes of ORS 196.405 to 196.515, a program of ocean resource planning and management is established. This program shall be known as the Oregon Ocean Resources Management Program and is part of Oregon’s coastal management program. The Oregon Ocean Resources Management Program consists of:

WETLAND CONSERVATION PLANS

 

      196.668 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Wetlands provide a natural means of flood and storm damage protection through the absorption and storage of water during high runoff periods, thereby reducing flood crests and preventing loss of life and property;

      (2) Wetlands provide essential breeding, spawning, rearing, feeding, nesting and wintering habitats for a major portion of this state’s fish and wildlife;

      (3) Wetlands provide essential habitat for waterfowl using the Pacific Flyway and for the rearing of salmon and other anadromous and resident fish;

      (4) Wetlands act as accumulation areas for sediments which retain nutrients and other pollutants that may prevent entry of the pollutants into other waterways;

      (5) Wetlands provide a valuable public service of maintaining clean water by retaining nutrients, metals and toxic materials from the water to protect water quality;

      (6) Wetlands provide significant opportunities for environmental and ecological research, public recreation and education and provide scenic diversity and aesthetic value as open space and areas of visual enjoyment;

      (7) Much of this state’s original wetlands have been diked, drained, filled, dredged, ditched or otherwise altered;

      (8) There is continuing development pressure on wetlands in Oregon;

      (9) There are often conflicts between wetland protection and other resource values and uses;

      (10) Uncoordinated regulation of wetlands by local, state and federal agencies can cause confusion, frustration and unreasonable delay and uncertainty for the general public; and

      (11) Wetland management is a matter of this state’s concern since benefits and impacts related to wetland resources can be international, national, regional and statewide in scope. [1989 c.837 §2]

 

      196.670 [Formerly 541.605; renumbered 196.800 in 1989]

 

      196.672 Policy. In addition to the policy described in ORS 196.805, it is the policy of the State of Oregon to:

      (1) Promote the protection, conservation and best use of wetland resources, their functions and values through the integration and close coordination of statewide planning goals, local comprehensive plans and state and federal regulatory programs.

      (2) Use a single definition of “wetlands” for the purposes of ORS 196.800 to 196.905 and statewide planning goals and a single, uniform methodology of delineating wetland boundaries.

      (3) Develop a statewide inventory of wetlands based on uniform identification standards and criteria at a scale practicable for planning and regulatory purposes, and to make such inventory available to state agencies and local governments to facilitate better management of wetland resources and closer coordination of local, state and federal wetland programs.

      (4) Maintain a stable resource base of wetlands through the mitigation of losses of wetland resources and the adoption of the procedural mitigation standard currently used by federal agencies.

      (5) Establish the opportunity to increase wetland resources by encouraging wetland restoration and creation where appropriate.

      (6) Reduce the delays and uncertainty which can occur in the current wetland planning and regulatory framework through improved coordination of the provisions in ORS 196.800 to 196.905 with local land use planning and regulation and by providing mechanisms for expedited permit review consistent with the protection and conservation of wetland resources.

      (7) Continue to meet the requirements of federal law in the protection and management of wetland resources, while asserting the interests of this state, in concert with those of local governments in urging the federal resource and regulatory agencies to develop a uniform wetland policy and more consistent, cohesive standards to implement the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344).

      (8) Develop and provide information to the general public concerning the functions, values and distribution of wetlands of this state to raise public awareness of these resources.

      (9) Promote the protection of wetland values on private lands by developing and using public recognition programs, incentives and other nonregulatory actions.

      (10) Encourage wetlands as an interim use of mining and construction sites on lands that were not originally wetlands and are designated for other than wetland purposes in an acknowledged comprehensive plan, while insuring that interim wetland use does not limit the future use of such sites for mining and construction. [1989 c.837 §3]

 

      196.674 Statewide Wetlands Inventory; rules. (1) The Department of State Lands shall compile and maintain a comprehensive Statewide Wetlands Inventory.

      (2) In compiling the Statewide Wetlands Inventory, the department shall develop, by rule, a system for uniform wetland identification, delineation and comprehensive mapping. Initial inventories shall be based upon the National Wetlands Inventory prepared by the United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service. The Department of State Lands shall consult with the public, local governments and affected state and federal agencies concerning the accuracy of the inventory.

      (3) The Department of State Lands shall revise the inventory maps as new or more complete information becomes available.

      (4) The Department of State Lands shall provide each city and county planning office with copies of the Statewide Wetlands Inventory covering the local jurisdiction.

      (5) The Department of State Lands shall provide each state agency with a copy of the inventory upon request.

      (6) Copies of the Statewide Wetlands Inventory shall be made available to the general public, through the Department of State Lands, upon payment of a fee to offset administrative and reproduction costs.

      (7) A wetland inventory developed by another party may be utilized by the Department of State Lands if it is consistent with standards adopted pursuant to this section, after consulting with the affected local government, and is reviewed and approved by the Department of State Lands as complying with the standards adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.

      (8) Nothing in this section shall restrict the regulatory jurisdiction of the Department of State Lands under ORS 196.800 to 196.905.

      (9) In compiling and updating the Statewide Wetlands Inventory, the Department of State Lands shall identify opportunities for wetland creation, restoration and enhancement when the information is available. [1989 c.837 §6; 2003 c.253 §6]

 

      196.675 [Formerly 541.610; renumbered 196.805 in 1989]

 

      196.676 Response to notices from local governments. The Department of State Lands shall respond to the notice received from local governments pursuant to ORS 215.418 (1) and 227.350 (1) within 30 days of receipt of the notice. The response shall state whether a permit is or in the future will be required or whether a permit has been issued by the department for the activity which is subject to notice. [1989 c.837 §7]

 

      196.678 Wetland conservation plans; contents; procedure for adopting. (1) Any city or county may develop and submit to the Department of State Lands a wetland conservation plan for review pursuant to the provisions of ORS 196.678 to 196.684.

      (9) Except as provided in subsection (10) of this section, the Director of the Department of State Lands shall approve the acknowledged estuary management plan by order within 60 days of completion of the preliminary review.

      (10) A contested case hearing shall be held within 30 days of the completion of the preliminary review or receipt of a request for hearing if:

      (a) The director determines there is probable cause to believe that the estuary management plan does not meet the standards for approving wetland conservation plans or unreasonably interferes with the use of the estuary for navigation, fisheries or public recreation; or

      (b) A hearing is requested and the request:

      (A) Is made in writing within 60 days of the date of mailing of notice of completion of review;

      (B) Clearly states the reasons for requesting the hearing; and

      (C) Provides sufficient information for the director to determine that there is probable cause to believe that the estuary management plan does not meet the standards for approving wetland conservation plans or unreasonably interferes with the use of the estuary for navigation, fisheries or public recreation.

      (11) The director shall approve the acknowledged estuary management plan as a wetland conservation plan by order unless the director finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the estuary management plan does not meet the standards for approving wetland conservation plans or unreasonably interferes with the use of the estuary for navigation, fisheries or public recreation or that substantial fills proposed in an estuary management plan for nonwater dependent use are not for a public use and would not satisfy a public need that outweighs harm to navigation, fisheries or public recreation.

      (12) The director shall prepare a proposed order for review by the parties within 30 days of any contested case hearing held pursuant to subsection (10) of this section.

      (13) A final order from the director that recommends, pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, denial of an estuary management plan as a wetland conservation plan shall identify deficient elements and provisions of the acknowledged estuary management plan and what measures may be taken to correct those deficiencies.

      (14) Individual permit applications shall be required for removal or fill, or both, in areas subject to an approved estuary management plan. Individual permit applications shall be reviewed in accordance with ORS 196.815, 196.825, 196.830 and 196.835. In lieu of the substantive standards for permit issuance in ORS 196.825 (3), the department shall issue a permit if the removal or fill, or both, is determined by the director to be consistent with the estuary management plan or can be conditioned to be consistent with the plan. The department shall condition any such permit as necessary to ensure that the project:

      (a) Is designed or configured to minimize alterations to waters of this state;

      (b) Is the minimum size necessary to reasonably provide for the proposed use;

      (c) Is consistent with the resource capabilities of the area and the purposes of the management unit, unless this has been previously determined in the approved estuary management plan;

      (d) Is designed to minimize impacts from implementing the project; and

      (e) Has estuarine resource replacement measures for creation, restoration, enhancement or preservation that replaces impacted resources.

      (15) Judicial review of an order granting or denying approval of an estuary management plan as provided in this section shall be as provided in ORS 183.470.

      (16) Following approval by the director of an estuary management plan, the requirements of ORS 196.684 shall apply to the approved estuary management plan. [1989 c.837 §14; 2007 c.849 §13; 2009 c.343 §17; 2011 c.370 §5]

 

      196.687 Regulation of alteration or fill of artificially created wetlands. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 196.600 to 196.905, state or local governments shall not prohibit or restrict the alteration or fill of wetland areas up to one acre in size that have been artificially created from upland for the purpose of controlling, storing or maintaining storm water.

      (2) An area that was developed as a storm water detention or retention facility as a condition of a development approval shall not be altered or filled without acceptance by the approving authority of a plan to mitigate the loss of functional capabilities of the detention or retention facility.

      (3) Until a local government adopts an ordinance to conform its comprehensive plan and land use regulations to the provisions of this section, the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall apply directly to proposed activities in wetland areas. Any portion of a goal, rule, comprehensive plan, land use regulation or ordinance not in conformance with the provisions of this section on September 9, 1995:

      (a) Shall not be implemented or enforced; and

      (b) Has no legal effect.

      (4) The provisions of this section do not apply to land used to mitigate the loss of wetlands.

      (5) If the Department of State Lands assumes responsibility under 33 U.S.C. 1344(g) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, ORS 196.600 to 196.905 shall apply to artificially created wetlands described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. [1995 c.482 §1]

[2001 c.516 §14]

 

      196.805 Policy. (1) The protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this state are matters of the utmost public concern. Streams, lakes, bays, estuaries and other bodies of water in this state, including not only water and materials for domestic, agricultural and industrial use but also habitats and spawning areas for fish, avenues for transportation and sites for commerce and public recreation, are vital to the economy and well-being of this state and its people. Unregulated removal of material from the beds and banks of the waters of this state may create hazards to the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state. Unregulated filling in the waters of this state for any purpose, may result in interfering with or injuring public navigation, fishery and recreational uses of the waters. In order to provide for the best possible use of the water resources of this state, it is desirable to centralize authority in the Director of the Department of State Lands, and implement control of the removal of material from the beds and banks or filling of the waters of this state.

      (2) The director shall take into consideration all beneficial uses of water including streambank protection when administering fill and removal statutes.

      (3) There shall be no condemnation, inverse condemnation, other taking, or confiscating of property under ORS 196.600 to 196.905 without due process of law. [Formerly 541.610 and then 196.675; 2003 c.738 §16; 2012 c.108 §7]

 

      196.810 Permit required to remove material from bed or banks of waters; status of permit; exceptions; rules. (1)(a) Except as otherwise specifically permitted under ORS 196.600 to 196.905, a person may not remove any material from the beds or banks of any waters of this state or fill any waters of this state without a permit issued under authority of the Director of the Department of State Lands, or in a manner contrary to the conditions set out in the permit, or in a manner contrary to the conditions set out in an order approving a wetland conservation plan.

      (b) Notwithstanding the permit requirements of this section and notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 196.800 (3) and (13), if any removal or fill activity is proposed in essential indigenous anadromous salmonid habitat, except for those activities customarily associated with agriculture, a permit is required. “Essential indigenous anadromous salmonid habitat” as defined under this section shall be further defined and designated by rule by the Department of State Lands in consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and in consultation with other affected parties.

      (c) A person is not required to obtain a permit under paragraph (b) of this subsection for prospecting or other nonmotorized activities resulting in the removal from or fill of less than one cubic yard of material at any one individual site and, cumulatively, not more than five cubic yards of material within a designated essential indigenous anadromous salmonid habitat segment in a single year. Prospecting or other nonmotorized activities may be conducted only within the bed or wet perimeter of the waterway and may not occur at any site where fish eggs are present. Removal or filling activities customarily associated with mining require a permit under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (d) A permit is not required under paragraph (b) of this subsection for construction or maintenance of fish passage and fish screening structures that are constructed, operated or maintained under ORS 498.306, 498.316, 498.326 or 509.600 to 509.645.

      (e)(A) Notwithstanding the permit requirements of this section and notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 196.800 (3) and (13), if any removal or fill activity is proposed in Oregon’s territorial sea that is related to an ocean renewable energy facility as defined in ORS 274.870, a permit is required.

      (B) An application for a permit related to an ocean renewable energy facility in the territorial sea must include all of the information required by that part of the Territorial Sea Plan that addresses the development of ocean renewable energy facilities in the territorial sea.

      (C) The Department of State Lands may not issue a removal or fill permit for an ocean renewable energy facility that does not comply with the criteria described in that part of the Territorial Sea Plan that addresses the development of ocean renewable energy facilities in the territorial sea.

      (2) The Director of the Department of State Lands may issue a permit to fill Smith Lake or Bybee Lake, located in Multnomah County, if such fill is to enhance or maintain fish and wildlife habitat or support recreational use or public access at or near Smith Lake or Bybee Lake. A fill shall be considered to be for the purpose of enhancing or maintaining fish and wildlife habitat if the proposed fill is approved by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. [Formerly 541.622 and then 196.690; 2016 c.84 §9]

 

      196.825 Criteria for issuance of permit; conditions; consultation with public bodies; hearing; appeal. (1) The Director of the Department of State Lands shall issue a permit applied for under ORS 196.815 if the director determines that the project described in the application:

      (a) Is consistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this state as specified in ORS 196.600 to 196.905; and

      (b) Would not unreasonably interfere with the paramount policy of this state to preserve the use of its waters for navigation, fishing and public recreation.

      (2) If the director issues a permit applied for under ORS 196.815 to a person that proposes a removal or fill activity for construction or maintenance of a linear facility, and if that person is not a landowner or a person authorized by a landowner to conduct the proposed removal or fill activity on a property, then the person may not conduct removal or fill activity on that property until the person obtains:

      (a) The landowner’s consent;

      (b) A right, title or interest with respect to the property that is sufficient to undertake the removal or fill activity; or

      (c) A court order or judgment authorizing the use of the property.

      (3) In determining whether to issue a permit, the director shall consider all of the following:

      (a) The public need for the proposed fill or removal and the social, economic or other public benefits likely to result from the proposed fill or removal. When the applicant for a permit is a public body, the director may accept and rely upon the public body’s findings as to local public need and local public benefit.

      (b) The economic cost to the public if the proposed fill or removal is not accomplished.

      (c) The availability of alternatives to the project for which the fill or removal is proposed.

      (d) The availability of alternative sites for the proposed fill or removal.

      (e) Whether the proposed fill or removal conforms to sound policies of conservation and would not interfere with public health and safety.

      (f) Whether the proposed fill or removal is in conformance with existing public uses of the waters and with uses designated for adjacent land in an acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations.

      (g) Whether the proposed fill or removal is compatible with the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations for the area where the proposed fill or removal is to take place or can be conditioned on a future local approval to meet this criterion.

      (h) Whether the proposed fill or removal is for streambank protection.

      (i) Whether the applicant has provided all practicable mitigation to reduce the adverse effects of the proposed fill or removal in the manner set forth in ORS 196.800. In determining whether the applicant has provided all practicable mitigation, the director shall consider the findings regarding wetlands set forth in ORS 196.668 and whether the proposed mitigation advances the policy objectives for the protection of wetlands set forth in ORS 196.672.

      (4) The director may issue a permit for a project that results in a substantial fill in an estuary for a nonwater dependent use only if the project is for a public use and would satisfy a public need that outweighs harm to navigation, fishery and recreation and if the proposed fill meets all other criteria contained in ORS 196.600 to 196.905.

      (5) If the director issues a permit, the director may impose such conditions as the director considers necessary to carry out the purposes of ORS 196.805 and 196.830 and subsection (1) of this section and to provide mitigation for the reasonably expected adverse effects of project development. In formulating such conditions the director may request comment from public bodies, as defined in ORS 174.109, federal agencies and tribal governments affected by the permit. Each permit is valid only for the time specified therein. The director shall impose, as conditions to any permit, general authorization or wetland conservation plan, measures to provide mitigation for the reasonably expected adverse effects of project development.
