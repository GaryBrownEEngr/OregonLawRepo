GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      197.005 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Uncoordinated use of lands within this state threatens the orderly development, the environment of this state and the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and welfare of the people of this state.

      (2) To promote coordinated administration of land uses consistent with comprehensive plans adopted throughout the state, it is necessary to establish a process for the review of state agency, city, county and special district land conservation and development plans for compliance with goals.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, cities and counties should remain as the agencies to consider, promote and manage the local aspects of land conservation and development for the best interests of the people within their jurisdictions.

      (4) The promotion of coordinated statewide land conservation and development requires the creation of a statewide planning agency to prescribe planning goals and objectives to be applied by state agencies, cities, counties and special districts throughout the state.

      (5) City and county governments are responsible for the development of local comprehensive plans. The purpose of ORS 195.065, 195.070 and 195.075 is to enhance coordination among cities, counties and special districts to assure effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of urban services required under those local comprehensive plans. [1973 c.80 §1; 1977 c.664 §1; 1981 c.748 §21; 1993 c.804 §2a; 1999 c.348 §1]

 

      197.010 Policy. The Legislative Assembly declares that:

      (1) In order to ensure the highest possible level of livability in Oregon, it is necessary to provide for properly prepared and coordinated comprehensive plans for cities and counties, regional areas and the state as a whole. These comprehensive plans:

      (a) Must be adopted by the appropriate governing body at the local and state levels;

      (b) Are expressions of public policy in the form of policy statements, generalized maps and standards and guidelines;

      (c) Shall be the basis for more specific rules and land use regulations which implement the policies expressed through the comprehensive plans;

      (d) Shall be prepared to assure that all public actions are consistent and coordinated with the policies expressed through the comprehensive plans; and

      (e) Shall be regularly reviewed and, if necessary, amended to keep them consistent with the changing needs and desires of the public they are designed to serve.

      (2)(a) The overarching principles guiding the land use program in the State of Oregon are to:

      (A) Provide a healthy environment;

      (B) Sustain a prosperous economy;

      (C) Ensure a desirable quality of life; and

      (D) Equitably allocate the benefits and burdens of land use planning.

      (b) Additionally, the land use program should, but is not required to, help communities achieve sustainable development patterns and manage the effects of climate change.

      (c) The overarching principles in paragraph (a) of this subsection and the purposes in paragraph (b) of this subsection provide guidance to:

      (A) The Legislative Assembly when enacting a law regulating land use.

      (B) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, when the public body:

      (i) Adopts or interprets goals, comprehensive plans and land use regulations implementing the plans, or administrative rules implementing a provision of ORS chapter 195, 196, 197, 215 or 227; or

      (ii) Interprets a law governing land use.

      (d) Use of the overarching principles in paragraph (a) of this subsection and the purposes in paragraph (b) of this subsection is not a legal requirement for the Legislative Assembly or other public body and is not judicially enforceable.

      (3) The equitable balance between state and local government interests can best be achieved by resolution of conflicts using alternative dispute resolution techniques such as mediation, collaborative planning and arbitration. Such dispute resolution techniques are particularly suitable for conflicts arising over periodic review, comprehensive plan and land use regulations, amendments, enforcement issues and local interpretation of state land use policy. [1973 c.80 §2; 1981 c.748 §21a; 1993 c.792 §48; 2009 c.873 §1]

 

      197.012 Compact urban development. In areas of the state that are growing rapidly, state agencies, as defined in ORS 171.133, cities and counties should, within constraints of applicable federal law and regulations, state law and rules and local ordinances:

      (1) Consider directing major public infrastructure investments, including major transportation investments, to reinforce compact urban development; and

      (2) Consider giving priority to investments that promote infill or redevelopment of existing urban areas to encourage the density necessary to support alternative modes of transportation. [2009 c.873 §14]

 

      Note: 197.012 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 197 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      197.013 Implementation and enforcement are of statewide concern. Implementation and enforcement of acknowledged comprehensive plans and land use regulations are matters of statewide concern. [1981 c.884 §7]

A plan is “coordinated” when the needs of all levels of governments, semipublic and private agencies and the citizens of Oregon have been considered and accommodated as much as possible. “Land” includes water, both surface and subsurface, and the air.

COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES

 

      197.173 Findings regarding coordination between state agencies and local governments. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Improving coordination and consistency between the duties and actions of state agencies that affect land use and the duties and actions of local governments under comprehensive plans and land use regulations is required to ensure that the actions of state agencies complement both state and local land use planning objectives.

      (2) Improved coordination is necessary to streamline state and local permitting procedures.

      (3) The Department of Land Conservation and Development has not engaged in a formal and concerted effort to update state agency land use coordination programs since 1989, and that state agency rules, plans and programs affecting land use and local government comprehensive plans and land use regulations have changed substantially since that time.

      (4) Rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission regarding state agency land use coordination and state permit compliance and compatibility should be:

      (a) Reviewed to eliminate unclear or conflicting provisions and to ensure that local land use decisions authorizing a use generally precede state agency decisions on permits for the use or for aspects of the use; and

      (b) Updated regularly to maintain a high level of coordination between state agencies and local governments in reviewing authorizations for a use of property. [2009 c.606 §1]

The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall adopt rules clarifying how the goals apply to the incorporation of a new city. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 15, chapter 827, Oregon Laws 1983, the rules shall take effect upon adoption by the commission. The applicability of rules promulgated under this section to the incorporation of cities prior to August 9, 1983, shall be determined under the laws of this state.

      (2) Pursuant to ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197, each city and county in this state shall:

      (a) Prepare, adopt, amend and revise comprehensive plans in compliance with goals approved by the commission;

      (b) Enact land use regulations to implement their comprehensive plans;

      197.295 [1981 c.884 §4; 1983 c.795 §1; 1987 c.785 §1; 1989 c.648 §51; 1991 c.226 §16; 1991 c.612 §12; 1995 c.79 §73; 1995 c.547 §2; 2019 c.422 §29; renumbered 197.286 in 2019]

      197.296 Factors to establish sufficiency of buildable lands within urban growth boundary; analysis and determination of residential housing patterns. (1)(a) The provisions of subsections (2) to (9) of this section apply to metropolitan service district regional framework plans and local government comprehensive plans for lands within the urban growth boundary of a city that is located outside of a metropolitan service district and has a population of 25,000 or more.

      (b) The Land Conservation and Development Commission may establish a set of factors under which additional cities are subject to the provisions of this section. In establishing the set of factors required under this paragraph, the commission shall consider the size of the city, the rate of population growth of the city or the proximity of the city to another city with a population of 25,000 or more or to a metropolitan service district.

      (2)(a) A local government shall demonstrate that its comprehensive plan or regional framework plan provides sufficient buildable lands within the urban growth boundary established pursuant to statewide planning goals to accommodate estimated housing needs for 20 years:

      (A) At periodic review under ORS 197.628 to 197.651;

      (B) As scheduled by the commission:

      (i) At least once each eight years for local governments that are not within a metropolitan service district; or

      (ii) At least once each six years for a metropolitan service district; or

      (C) At any other legislative review of the comprehensive plan or regional framework plan that concerns the urban growth boundary and requires the application of a statewide planning goal relating to buildable lands for residential use.

      (b) The 20-year period shall commence on the date initially scheduled for completion of the review under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (3) In performing the duties under subsection (2) of this section, a local government shall:

      (a) Inventory the supply of buildable lands within the urban growth boundary and determine the housing capacity of the buildable lands; and

      (b) Conduct an analysis of existing and projected housing need by type and density range, in accordance with all factors under ORS 197.303 and statewide planning goals and rules relating to housing, to determine the number of units and amount of land needed for each needed housing type for the next 20 years.

      (4)(a) For the purpose of the inventory described in subsection (3)(a) of this section, “buildable lands” includes:

      (A) Vacant lands planned or zoned for residential use;

      (B) Partially vacant lands planned or zoned for residential use;

      (C) Lands that may be used for a mix of residential and employment uses under the existing planning or zoning; and

      (D) Lands that may be used for residential infill or redevelopment.

      (b) For the purpose of the inventory and determination of housing capacity described in subsection (3)(a) of this section, the local government must demonstrate consideration of:

      (A) The extent that residential development is prohibited or restricted by local regulation and ordinance, state law and rule or federal statute and regulation;

      (B) A written long term contract or easement for radio, telecommunications or electrical facilities, if the written contract or easement is provided to the local government; and

      (C) The presence of a single family dwelling or other structure on a lot or parcel.

      (c) Except for land that may be used for residential infill or redevelopment, a local government shall create a map or document that may be used to verify and identify specific lots or parcels that have been determined to be buildable lands.

      (5)(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, the determination of housing capacity pursuant to subsection (3)(a) of this section must be based on data relating to land within the urban growth boundary that has been collected since the last review under subsection (2)(a)(B) of this section. The data shall include:

      (A) The number, density and average mix of housing types of urban residential development that have actually occurred;

      (B) Trends in density and average mix of housing types of urban residential development;

      (C) Market factors that may substantially impact future urban residential development; and

      (D) The number, density and average mix of housing types that have occurred on the buildable lands described in subsection (4)(a) of this section.

      (b) A local government shall make the determination described in paragraph (a) of this subsection using a shorter time period than the time period described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the local government finds that the shorter time period will provide more accurate and reliable data related to housing capacity. The shorter time period may not be less than three years.

      (c) A local government shall use data from a wider geographic area or use a time period longer than the time period described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the analysis of a wider geographic area or the use of a longer time period will provide more accurate, complete and reliable data relating to trends affecting housing need than an analysis performed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection. The local government must clearly describe the geographic area, time frame and source of data used in a determination performed under this paragraph.

      (6) If the housing need determined pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section is greater than the housing capacity determined pursuant to subsection (3)(a) of this section, the local government shall take one or both of the following actions to accommodate the additional housing need:

      (a) Amend its urban growth boundary to include sufficient buildable lands to accommodate housing needs for the next 20 years. As part of this process, the local government shall consider the effects of measures taken pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection. The amendment shall include sufficient land reasonably necessary to accommodate the siting of new public school facilities. The need and inclusion of lands for new public school facilities shall be a coordinated process between the affected public school districts and the local government that has the authority to approve the urban growth boundary.

      (b) Amend its comprehensive plan, regional framework plan, functional plan or land use regulations to include new measures that demonstrably increase the likelihood that residential development will occur at densities sufficient to accommodate housing needs for the next 20 years without expansion of the urban growth boundary. A local government or metropolitan service district that takes this action shall adopt findings regarding the density expectations assumed to result from measures adopted under this paragraph based upon the factors listed in ORS 197.303 (2) and data in subsection (5)(a) of this section. The density expectations may not project an increase in residential capacity above achieved density by more than three percent without quantifiable validation of such departures. For a local government located outside of a metropolitan service district, a quantifiable validation must demonstrate that the assumed housing capacity has been achieved in areas that are zoned to allow no greater than the same authorized density level within the local jurisdiction or a jurisdiction in the same region. For a metropolitan service district, a quantifiable validation must demonstrate that the assumed housing capacity has been achieved in areas that are zoned to allow no greater than the same authorized density level within the metropolitan service district.

      (c) As used in this subsection, “authorized density level” has the meaning given that term in ORS 227.175.

      (7) Using the housing need analysis conducted under subsection (3)(b) of this section, the local government shall determine the overall average density and overall mix of housing types at which residential development of needed housing types must occur in order to meet housing needs over the next 20 years. If that density is greater than the actual density of development determined under subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section, or if that mix is different from the actual mix of housing types determined under subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section, the local government, as part of its periodic review, shall adopt measures that demonstrably increase the likelihood that residential development will occur at the housing types and density and at the mix of housing types required to meet housing needs over the next 20 years.

      (8)(a) A local government outside a metropolitan service district that takes any actions under subsection (6) or (7) of this section shall demonstrate that the comprehensive plan and land use regulations comply with goals and rules adopted by the commission and implement ORS 197.286 to 197.314.

      (b) A local government shall determine the density and mix of housing types anticipated as a result of actions taken under subsections (6) and (7) of this section and monitor and record the actual density and mix of housing types achieved following the adoption of these actions. The local government shall compare actual and anticipated density and mix. The local government shall submit its comparison to the commission at the next review of its urban growth boundary under subsection (2)(a) of this section.

      (9) In establishing that actions and measures adopted under subsections (6) and (7) of this section demonstrably increase the likelihood of higher density residential development, the local government shall at a minimum ensure that land zoned for needed housing is in locations appropriate for the housing types identified under subsection (3) of this section, is zoned at density ranges that are likely to be achieved by the housing market using the analysis in subsection (3) of this section and is in areas where sufficient urban services are planned to enable the higher density development to occur over the 20-year period. Actions or measures, or both, may include but are not limited to:

      (a) Increases in the permitted density on existing residential land;

      (b) Financial incentives for higher density housing;

      (c) Provisions permitting additional density beyond that generally allowed in the zoning district in exchange for amenities and features provided by the developer;

      (d) Removal or easing of approval standards or procedures;

      (e) Minimum density ranges;

      (f) Redevelopment and infill strategies;

      (g) Authorization of housing types not previously allowed by the plan or regulations;

      (h) Adoption of an average residential density standard; and

      (i) Rezoning or redesignation of nonresidential land.

      (10)(a) The provisions of this subsection apply to local government comprehensive plans for lands within the urban growth boundary of a city that is located outside of a metropolitan service district and has a population of less than 25,000.

      (b) As required under paragraph (c) of this subsection, a city shall, according to rules of the commission:

      (A) Determine the estimated housing needs within the jurisdiction for the next 20 years;

      (B) Inventory the supply of buildable lands available within the urban growth boundary to accommodate the estimated housing needs determined under this subsection; and

      (C) Adopt measures necessary to accommodate the estimated housing needs determined under this subsection.

      (c) The actions required under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be undertaken:

      (A) At periodic review pursuant to ORS 197.628 to 197.651;

      (B) On a schedule established by the commission for cities with a population greater than 10,000, not to exceed once each eight years; or

      (C) At any other legislative review of the comprehensive plan that requires the application of a statewide planning goal relating to buildable lands for residential use.

      (d) For the purpose of the inventory described in this subsection, “buildable lands” includes those lands described in subsection (4)(a) of this section. [1995 c.547 §3; 2001 c.908 §1; 2003 c.177 §1; 2015 c.27 §19; 2017 c.102 §1; 2019 c.639 §5; 2019 c.640 §8a]

[2019 c.640 §2]

 

      197.298 Priority of land to be included within urban growth boundary. (1) In addition to any requirements established by rule addressing urbanization, land may not be included within an urban growth boundary of Metro except under the following priorities:

      (a) First priority is land that is designated urban reserve land under ORS 195.145, rule or metropolitan service district action plan.

      (b) If land under paragraph (a) of this subsection is inadequate to accommodate the amount of land needed, second priority is land adjacent to an urban growth boundary that is identified in an acknowledged comprehensive plan as an exception area or nonresource land. Second priority may include resource land that is completely surrounded by exception areas unless such resource land is high-value farmland as described in ORS 215.710.

      (c) If land under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection is inadequate to accommodate the amount of land needed, third priority is land designated as marginal land pursuant to ORS 197.247 (1991 Edition).

      (d) If land under paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection is inadequate to accommodate the amount of land needed, fourth priority is land designated in an acknowledged comprehensive plan for agriculture or forestry, or both.

      (2) Higher priority shall be given to land of lower capability as measured by the capability classification system or by cubic foot site class, whichever is appropriate for the current use.

      (3) Land of lower priority under subsection (1) of this section may be included in an urban growth boundary if land of higher priority is found to be inadequate to accommodate the amount of land estimated in subsection (1) of this section for one or more of the following reasons:

      (a) Specific types of identified land needs cannot be reasonably accommodated on higher priority lands;

      (b) Future urban services could not reasonably be provided to the higher priority lands due to topographical or other physical constraints; or

      (c) Maximum efficiency of land uses within a proposed urban growth boundary requires inclusion of lower priority lands in order to include or to provide services to higher priority lands.

      (4) When a city includes land within the urban growth boundary of the city pursuant to ORS 197.286 to 197.314, the city shall prioritize lands for inclusion as provided in ORS 197A.320. [1995 c.547 §5; 1999 c.59 §56; 2013 c.575 §12]

 

      197.299 Metropolitan service district accommodation of needed housing and school lands; allocation of housing capacity to cities. (1) A metropolitan service district organized under ORS chapter 268 shall complete the inventory, determination and analysis required under ORS 197.296 (3) not later than six years after completion of the previous inventory, determination and analysis.

      (2)(a) The metropolitan service district shall take such action as necessary under ORS 197.296 (6)(a) to accommodate one-half of a 20-year buildable land supply determined under ORS 197.296 (3) within one year of completing the analysis.

      (b) The metropolitan service district shall take all final action under ORS 197.296 (6)(a) necessary to accommodate a 20-year buildable land supply determined under ORS 197.296 (3) within two years of completing the analysis.

      (c) The metropolitan service district shall take action under ORS 197.296 (6)(b), within one year after the analysis required under ORS 197.296 (3)(b) is completed, to provide sufficient buildable land within the urban growth boundary to accommodate the estimated housing needs for 20 years from the time the actions are completed.

      (d) The metropolitan service district shall consider and adopt new measures that the governing body deems appropriate under ORS 197.296 (6)(b) and shall allocate any housing capacity that is not accommodated under this section to be accommodated by the application of ORS 197.296 (6)(b) by cities within the metropolitan service district with a population greater than 10,000.

      (e) Cities to which housing capacity is allocated under paragraph (d) of this subsection shall take steps, at least once every six years as scheduled by the Land Conservation and Development Commission, to demonstrably increase the likelihood that residential development will occur at densities sufficient to accommodate housing needs for the next 20 years as required by ORS 197.296 (6)(b).

      (3) The commission may grant an extension to the time limits of subsection (2) of this section if the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development determines that the metropolitan service district has provided good cause for failing to meet the time limits.

      (4)(a) The metropolitan service district shall establish a process to expand the urban growth boundary to accommodate a need for land for a public school that cannot reasonably be accommodated within the existing urban growth boundary. The metropolitan service district shall design the process to:

      (A) Accommodate a need that must be accommodated between periodic analyses of urban growth boundary capacity required by subsection (1) of this section; and

      (B) Provide for a final decision on a proposal to expand the urban growth boundary within four months after submission of a complete application by a large school district as defined in ORS 195.110.

      (b) At the request of a large school district, the metropolitan service district shall assist the large school district to identify school sites required by the school facility planning process described in ORS 195.110. A need for a public school is a specific type of identified land need under ORS 197.298 (3).

      (5) Three years after completing its most recent demonstration of sufficient buildable lands under ORS 197.296, a metropolitan service district may, on a single occasion, revise the determination and analysis required as part of the demonstration for the purpose of considering an amendment to the metropolitan service district’s urban growth boundary, provided:

      (a) The metropolitan service district has entered into an intergovernmental agreement and has designated rural reserves and urban reserves under ORS 195.141 and 195.145 with each county located within the district;

      (b) The commission has acknowledged the rural reserve and urban reserve designations described in paragraph (a) of this subsection;

      (c) One or more cities within the metropolitan service district have proposed a development that would require expansion of the urban growth boundary;

      (d) The city or cities proposing the development have provided evidence to the metropolitan service district that the proposed development would provide additional needed housing to the needed housing included in the most recent determination and analysis;

      (e) The location chosen for the proposed development is adjacent to the city proposing the development; and

      (f) The location chosen for the proposed development is located within an area designated and acknowledged as an urban reserve.

      (6)(a) If a metropolitan service district, after revising its most recent determination and analysis pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, concludes that an expansion of its urban growth boundary is warranted, the metropolitan service district may take action to expand its urban growth boundary in one or more locations to accommodate the proposed development, provided the urban growth boundary expansion does not exceed a total of 1,000 acres.

      (b) A metropolitan service district that expands its urban growth boundary under this subsection:

      (A) Must adopt the urban growth boundary expansion not more than four years after completing its most recent demonstration of sufficient buildable lands under ORS 197.296; and

      (B) Is exempt from the boundary location requirements described in the statewide land use planning goals relating to urbanization. [1997 c.763 §2; 2001 c.908 §2; 2005 c.590 §1; 2007 c.579 §2; 2014 c.92 §5; 2017 c.199 §1; 2019 c.640 §9]

      197.301 Metropolitan service district report of performance measures. (1) A metropolitan service district organized under ORS chapter 268 shall compile and report to the Department of Land Conservation and Development on performance measures as described in this section at least once every two years. The information shall be reported in a manner prescribed by the department.

      (2) Performance measures subject to subsection (1) of this section shall be adopted by a metropolitan service district and shall include but are not limited to measures that analyze the following:

      (a) The rate of conversion of vacant land to improved land;

      (b) The density and price ranges of residential development, including both single family and multifamily residential units;

      (c) The level of job creation within individual cities and the urban areas of a county inside the metropolitan service district;

      (d) The number of residential units added to small sites assumed to be developed in the metropolitan service district’s inventory of available lands but which can be further developed, and the conversion of existing spaces into more compact units with or without the demolition of existing buildings;

      (e) The amount of environmentally sensitive land that is protected and the amount of environmentally sensitive land that is developed;

      (f) The sales price of vacant land;

      (g) Residential vacancy rates;

      (h) Public access to open spaces; and

      (i) Transportation measures including mobility, accessibility and air quality indicators. [1997 c.763 §3]

 

      197.302 Metropolitan service district determination of buildable land supply; corrective action; enforcement. (1) After gathering and compiling information on the performance measures as described in ORS 197.301 but prior to submitting the information to the Department of Land Conservation and Development, a metropolitan service district shall determine if actions taken under ORS 197.296 (6) have established the buildable land supply and housing densities necessary to accommodate estimated housing needs determined under ORS 197.296 (3). If the metropolitan service district determines that the actions undertaken will not accommodate estimated need, the district shall develop a corrective action plan, including a schedule for implementation. The district shall submit the plan to the department along with the report on performance measures required under ORS 197.301. Corrective action under this section may include amendment of the urban growth boundary, comprehensive plan, regional framework plan, functional plan or land use regulations as described in ORS 197.296.

      (2) Within two years of submitting a corrective action plan to the department, the metropolitan service district shall demonstrate by reference to the performance measures described in ORS 197.301 that implementation of the plan has resulted in the buildable land supply and housing density within the urban growth boundary necessary to accommodate the estimated housing needs for each housing type as determined under ORS 197.296 (3).

      (3) The failure of the metropolitan service district to demonstrate the buildable land supply and housing density necessary to accommodate housing needs as required under this section and ORS 197.296 may be the basis for initiation of enforcement action pursuant to ORS 197.319 to 197.335.

      197.303 “Needed housing” defined. (1) As used in ORS 197.286 to 197.314, “needed housing” means all housing on land zoned for residential use or mixed residential and commercial use that is determined to meet the need shown for housing within an urban growth boundary at price ranges and rent levels that are affordable to households within the county with a variety of incomes, including but not limited to households with low incomes, very low incomes and extremely low incomes, as those terms are defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under 42 U.S.C. 1437a. “Needed housing” includes the following housing types:

      (a) Attached and detached single-family housing and multiple family housing for both owner and renter occupancy;

      (b) Government assisted housing;

      (c) Mobile home or manufactured dwelling parks as provided in ORS 197.475 to 197.490;

      (d) Manufactured homes on individual lots planned and zoned for single-family residential use that are in addition to lots within designated manufactured dwelling subdivisions; and

      (e) Housing for farmworkers.

      (2) For the purpose of estimating housing needs, as described in ORS 197.296 (3)(b), a local government shall use the population projections prescribed by ORS 195.033 or 195.036 and shall consider and adopt findings related to changes in each of the following factors since the last review under ORS 197.296 (2)(a)(B) and the projected future changes in these factors over a 20-year planning period:

      (a) Household sizes;

      (b) Household demographics;

      (c) Household incomes;

      (d) Vacancy rates; and

      (e) Housing costs.

      (3) A local government shall make the estimate described in subsection (2) of this section using a shorter time period than since the last review under ORS 197.296 (2)(a)(B) if the local government finds that the shorter time period will provide more accurate and reliable data related to housing need. The shorter time period may not be less than three years.

      (4) A local government shall use data from a wider geographic area or use a time period longer than the time period described in subsection (2) of this section if the analysis of a wider geographic area or the use of a longer time period will provide more accurate, complete and reliable data relating to trends affecting housing need than an analysis performed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The local government must clearly describe the geographic area, time frame and source of data used in an estimate performed under this subsection.

      (5) Subsection (1)(a) and (d) of this section does not apply to:

      (a) A city with a population of less than 2,500.

      197.304 Lane County accommodation of needed housing. (1) Notwithstanding an intergovernmental agreement pursuant to ORS 190.003 to 190.130 or acknowledged comprehensive plan provisions to the contrary, a city within Lane County that has a population of 50,000 or more within its boundaries shall meet its obligation under ORS 197.286 to 197.314 separately from any other city within Lane County. The city shall, separately from any other city:

      (a) Establish an urban growth boundary, consistent with the jurisdictional area of responsibility specified in the acknowledged comprehensive plan; and

      (b) Demonstrate, as required by ORS 197.296, that its comprehensive plan provides sufficient buildable lands within an urban growth boundary established pursuant to statewide planning goals to accommodate estimated housing needs for 20 years.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, this section does not alter or affect an intergovernmental agreement pursuant to ORS 190.003 to 190.130 or acknowledged comprehensive plan provisions adopted by Lane County or local governments in Lane County. [2007 c.650 §2]

      (4) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a local government may adopt and apply only clear and objective standards, conditions and procedures regulating the development of housing, including needed housing. The standards, conditions and procedures:

      (a) May include, but are not limited to, one or more provisions regulating the density or height of a development.

      (b) May not have the effect, either in themselves or cumulatively, of discouraging needed housing through unreasonable cost or delay.

      (a) An application or permit for residential development in an area identified in a formally adopted central city plan, or a regional center as defined by Metro, in a city with a population of 500,000 or more.

      (b) An application or permit for residential development in historic areas designated for protection under a land use planning goal protecting historic areas.

      (6) In addition to an approval process for needed housing based on clear and objective standards, conditions and procedures as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a local government may adopt and apply an alternative approval process for applications and permits for residential development based on approval criteria regulating, in whole or in part, appearance or aesthetics that are not clear and objective if:

      (a) The applicant retains the option of proceeding under the approval process that meets the requirements of subsection (4) of this section;

      (c) The approval criteria for the alternative approval process authorize a density at or above the density level authorized in the zone under the approval process provided in subsection (4) of this section.

      (7) Subject to subsection (4) of this section, this section does not infringe on a local government’s prerogative to:

      (a) Set approval standards under which a particular housing type is permitted outright;

      (b) Impose special conditions upon approval of a specific development proposal; or

      (c) Establish approval procedures.

      (a) The manufactured home shall be multisectional and enclose a space of not less than 1,000 square feet.

      (b) The manufactured home shall be placed on an excavated and back-filled foundation and enclosed at the perimeter such that the manufactured home is located not more than 12 inches above grade.

      (c) The manufactured home shall have a pitched roof, except that no standard shall require a slope of greater than a nominal three feet in height for each 12 feet in width.

      (d) The manufactured home shall have exterior siding and roofing which in color, material and appearance is similar to the exterior siding and roofing material commonly used on residential dwellings within the community or which is comparable to the predominant materials used on surrounding dwellings as determined by the local permit approval authority.

      (e) The manufactured home shall be certified by the manufacturer to have an exterior thermal envelope meeting performance standards which reduce levels equivalent to the performance standards required of single-family dwellings constructed under the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code as defined in ORS 455.010.

      (f) The manufactured home shall have a garage or carport constructed of like materials. A jurisdiction may require an attached or detached garage in lieu of a carport where such is consistent with the predominant construction of immediately surrounding dwellings.

      (g) In addition to the provisions in paragraphs (a) to (f) of this subsection, a city or county may subject a manufactured home and the lot upon which it is sited to any development standard, architectural requirement and minimum size requirement to which a conventional single-family residential dwelling on the same lot would be subject. [1981 c.884 §5; 1983 c.795 §3; 1989 c.380 §2; 1989 c.964 §6; 1993 c.184 §3; 1997 c.733 §2; 1999 c.357 §1; 2001 c.613 §2; 2011 c.354 §3; 2017 c.745 §5; 2019 c.401 §7]

(Temporary provisions relating to affordable housing pilot program)

 

      Note: Sections 1 to 9, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016, provide:

      Sec. 1. Sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act are added to and made a part of ORS 197.295 to 197.314 [series became 197.286 to 197.314]. [2016 c.52 §1]

      Sec. 2. Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that a supply of land dedicated to affordable housing, planned and zoned to encourage development of affordable housing and protected for affordable housing siting over a long period, is necessary for the economic prosperity of communities in this state. [2016 c.52 §2]

      Sec. 3. Affordable housing pilot program. The Land Conservation and Development Commission, working with the Housing and Community Services Department, other state agencies and local governments, shall establish and implement an affordable housing pilot program. Notwithstanding any statewide land use planning goal provisions specifying requirements for amending urban growth boundaries, the commission shall adopt rules to implement the pilot program on or before July 1, 2017. The pilot program is intended to:

      (1) Encourage local governments to provide an adequate supply of land within urban growth boundaries that is dedicated to affordable housing;

      (2) Encourage the development of affordable housing on land dedicated to affordable housing; and

      (3) Protect land dedicated to affordable housing from conversion to other uses before or after the development of affordable housing. [2016 c.52 §3]

      Sec. 4. Establishment of site selection process. (1) Under the rules adopted under section 3, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016, the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall establish a site selection process by which the commission shall select two pilot projects, one from a city with a population of 25,000 or less and one from a city with a population greater than 25,000, from among nominations made by local governments. However, if the commission has not received any qualifying nominations from a city with a population of 25,000 or less on or before the effective date of this 2019 Act [January 1, 2020], the commission may select any two pilot projects eligible for selection on or before August 17, 2018.

      (2) A local government may nominate a pilot project that provides a site dedicated to affordable housing within the jurisdiction of the local government.

      (3) When nominating a pilot project for the site selection process, a local government shall:

      (a) Submit a concept plan for the pilot project, including any proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan and land use regulations required to implement the pilot project; and

      (b) Demonstrate that the landowner of the site has agreed to designation of the landowner’s property as a pilot project for the purposes of sections 2 to 9, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016.

      (4) The commission shall select pilot projects that are:

      (a) Reasonably likely to provide a site for affordable housing that would not otherwise be provided without the special provisions of the pilot program;

      (b) Reasonably likely to serve identified populations in the area that require affordable housing;

      (c) Adjacent to the city’s existing urban growth boundary;

      (d) Near public facilities and services, including roadways and an identified transit corridor to serve the area, or for which public facilities and services are planned and reasonably likely to be provided at a reasonable cost in the near future;

      (e) Located, planned and zoned to avoid or minimize adverse effects on natural resources and nearby farm and forest uses if the pilot project would require amending an urban growth boundary to include the pilot project site; and

      (f) Nominated by a local government that demonstrates efforts by the local government to accommodate and encourage the development of needed housing within its existing urban growth boundary.

      (5) The following local governments are not eligible for nomination or selection under the pilot program:

      (a) Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah, Polk and Washington Counties and cities within Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah, Polk and Washington Counties;

      (b) Metro and cities and counties included in the Metro urban growth boundary; and

      (c) Local governments within Jefferson County that are served by the North Unit Irrigation District. [2016 c.52 §4; 2019 c.32 §1]

      Sec. 5. Rules. (1) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall, by rule:

      (a) Define “affordable housing”;

      (b) Specify types of affordable housing allowed on pilot project sites, including sites that are used as manufactured dwelling parks;

      (c) Limit the total acreage of all lots and parcels included in each pilot project site to not greater than 50 acres; and

      (d) Specify local government efforts that serve to demonstrate that the local government is accommodating and encouraging development of needed housing within its existing urban growth boundary.

      (2) The commission shall specify by rule related requirements for affordable housing that may include a sales price or rental rate range, taking into consideration:

      (a) Housing prices within the region compared to the income of residents of that region;

      (b) The availability of government assisted housing in the region;

      (c) The need for sites to accommodate manufactured dwellings, as defined in ORS 446.003, due to the conversion of manufactured dwelling parks or mobile home parks in the region to other uses; and

      (d) Other relevant factors as identified by the commission.

      (3) The commission may adopt rules that authorize mixed income housing developments that include affordable housing on pilot project sites. [2016 c.52 §5]

      Sec. 6. Expedited process for amending urban growth boundaries to include selected site. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 197A.320 and without regard to whether an urban growth boundary already contains a 20-year supply of buildable lands, the Land Conservation and Development Commission by rule may establish an expedited process for amending urban growth boundaries to include pilot project sites selected under section 4 of this 2016 Act.

      (2) An amendment to an urban growth boundary pursuant to this section must identify the specific goal and rule requirements related to urban growth boundaries from which a local government is exempt for the purpose of implementing the pilot program.

      (3) Pilot project sites included within an urban growth boundary amended pursuant to this section must:

      (a) Be dedicated to affordable housing; and

      (b) Remain planned and zoned for affordable housing, except as otherwise provided in rules adopted pursuant to section 5 (3) of this 2016 Act. [2016 c.52 §6]

      Sec. 7. Site protection from conversion to other uses. (1) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the Land Conservation and Development Commission under section 4 of this 2016 Act shall protect the pilot project site within its urban growth boundary from conversion to other uses before, during and after the development of affordable housing at the pilot project site, except as provided otherwise in rules adopted by the commission under section 5 (3) of this 2016 Act.

      (2) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the commission shall ensure that housing developed on the site continues to be used to provide affordable housing for a period of at least 50 years after the selection of the pilot project site through:

      (a) Zoning restrictions;

      (b) Guaranteed rental rates or sales prices;

      (c) Incentives, contract commitments, density bonuses or other voluntary regulations, provisions or conditions designed to increase the supply of moderate or lower cost housing units;

      (d) Other regulations, provisions or conditions determined by the local government to be effective in maintaining the affordability of housing on land selected for a pilot project under section 4 of this 2016 Act; or

      (e) Restrictive agreements entered into with sources of affordable housing funding.

      (3) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the commission may authorize a mix of affordable housing and other housing types on the site, provided that the percentage of affordable housing units developed on the site meets or exceeds requirements specified in rules adopted by the commission pursuant to section 5 (3) of this 2016 Act. [2016 c.52 §7]

      Sec. 8. Certain local government actions prohibited. (1) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the Land Conservation and Development Commission under section 4 of this 2016 Act may not plan or zone the site to allow a use or mix of uses not authorized under sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act unless the local government withdraws the pilot project site from the urban growth boundary and rezones the site pursuant to law, statewide land use planning goals and land use regulations implementing the goals that regulate allowable uses of land outside urban growth boundaries.

      (2) A local government may not use sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act to bring high-value farmland, as determined by the commission, within its urban growth boundary.

      (3) The inclusion of pilot project sites dedicated to affordable housing within an urban growth boundary pursuant to sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act does not authorize a local government to convert buildable lands within the urban growth boundary that are planned for needed housing, as defined in ORS 197.303, to other uses.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 197.309 (2), for a pilot project site selected under section 4 of this 2016 Act, and affordable housing developed on a selected pilot project site, a local government may take any action described in ORS 197.309 that has the effect of establishing the sales price for a housing unit or residential building lot or parcel, or that requires a housing unit or residential building lot or parcel to be designated for sale to a particular class or group of purchasers.

      (5) Sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act do not constitute a statutory contract. A pilot project site selected under section 4 of this 2016 Act and affordable housing developed on a selected pilot project site remain subject to new or additional regulatory requirements authorized by law, statewide land use planning goals and land use regulations implementing the goals.

      (6) As used in this section, “lot” and “parcel” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 92.010. [2016 c.52 §8]

      Sec. 9. Reporting requirement. The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall report on the progress of the pilot program, in the manner provided in ORS 192.245, to the committees of the Legislative Assembly related to housing and human services:

      (1) At least once during each of three consecutive regular sessions of the Legislative Assembly, beginning with the 2017 regular session of the Legislative Assembly; and

      (2) At least once following adjournment sine die of the regular sessions of the Legislative Assembly described in subsection (1) of this section, but no later than the convening of the next regular session of the Legislative Assembly. [2016 c.52 §9]

      197.335 Order for compliance with goals; review of order; withholding grant funds; injunctions. (1) An order issued under ORS 197.328 and the copy of the order mailed to the local government, state agency or special district shall set forth:

      (a) The nature of the noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the contents of the comprehensive plan or land use regulation, if any, of a local government that do not comply with the goals or the contents of a plan, program or regulation affecting land use adopted by a state agency or special district that do not comply with the goals. In the case of a pattern or practice of decision-making which violates the goals, comprehensive plan or land use regulations, the order shall specify the decision-making which constitutes the pattern or practice, including specific provisions the Land Conservation and Development Commission believes are being misapplied;

      (b) The specific lands, if any, within a local government for which the existing plan or land use regulation, if any, does not comply with the goals; and

      (c) The corrective action decided upon by the commission, including the specific requirements, with which the local government, state agency or special district must comply. In the case of a pattern or practice of decision-making that violates an acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulation, the commission may require revisions to the comprehensive plan, land use regulations or local procedures which the commission believes are necessary to correct the pattern or practice. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, except as provided in subsection (3)(c) of this section, an enforcement order does not affect:

      (A) Land use applications filed with a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order unless specifically identified by the order;

      (B) Land use approvals issued by a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order; or

      (C) The time limit for exercising land use approvals issued by a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order.

      (2) Judicial review of a final order of the commission shall be governed by the provisions of ORS chapter 183 applicable to contested cases except as otherwise stated in this section. The commission’s final order shall include a clear statement of findings which set forth the basis for the order. Where a petition to review the order has been filed in the Court of Appeals, the commission shall transmit to the court the entire administrative record of the proceeding under review. Notwithstanding ORS 183.482 (3) relating to a stay of enforcement of an agency order, an appellate court, before it may stay an order of the commission, shall give due consideration to the public interest in the continued enforcement of the commission’s order and may consider testimony or affidavits thereon. Upon review, an appellate court may affirm, reverse, modify or remand the order. The court shall reverse, modify or remand the order only if it finds:

      (a) The order to be unlawful in substance or procedure, but error in procedure shall not be cause for reversal, modification or remand unless the court shall find that substantial rights of any party were prejudiced thereby;

      (b) The order to be unconstitutional;

      (c) The order is invalid because it exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; or

      (d) The order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record.

      (3)(a) If the commission finds that in the interim period during which a local government, state agency or special district would be bringing itself into compliance with the commission’s order under ORS 197.320 or subsection (2) of this section it would be contrary to the public interest in the conservation or sound development of land to allow the continuation of some or all categories of land use decisions or limited land use decisions, it shall, as part of its order, limit, prohibit or require the approval by the local government of applications for subdivisions, partitions, building permits, limited land use decisions or land use decisions until the plan, land use regulation or subsequent land use decisions and limited land use decisions are brought into compliance. The commission may issue an order that requires review of local decisions by a hearings officer or the Department of Land Conservation and Development before the local decision becomes final.

      (b) Any requirement under this subsection may be imposed only if the commission finds that the activity, if continued, aggravates the goal, comprehensive plan or land use regulation violation and that the requirement is necessary to correct the violation.

      (c) The limitations on enforcement orders under subsection (1)(c)(B) of this section shall not be interpreted to affect the commission’s authority to limit, prohibit or require application of specified criteria to subsequent land use decisions involving land use approvals issued by a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order.

      (4) As part of its order under ORS 197.320 or subsection (2) of this section, the commission may withhold grant funds from the local government to which the order is directed. As part of an order issued under this section, the commission may notify the officer responsible for disbursing state-shared revenues to withhold that portion of state-shared revenues to which the local government is entitled under ORS 221.770, 323.455, 366.762 and 366.800 and ORS chapter 471 which represents the amount of state planning grant moneys previously provided the local government by the commission. The officer responsible for disbursing state-shared revenues shall withhold state-shared revenues as outlined in this section and shall release funds to the local government or department when notified to so do by the commission or its designee. The commission may retain a portion of the withheld revenues to cover costs of providing services incurred under the order, including use of a hearings officer or staff resources to monitor land use decisions and limited land use decisions or conduct hearings. The remainder of the funds withheld under this provision shall be released to the local government upon completion of requirements of the commission order.

      (5)(a) As part of its order under this section, the commission may notify the officer responsible for disbursing funds from any grant or loan made by a state agency to withhold such funds from a special district to which the order is directed. The officer responsible for disbursing funds shall withhold funds as outlined in this section and shall release funds to the special district or department when notified to do so by the commission.

      (b) The commission may retain a portion of the funds withheld to cover costs of providing services incurred under the order, including use of a hearings officer or staff resources to monitor land use decisions and limited land use decisions or conduct hearings. The remainder of the funds withheld under this provision shall be released to the special district upon completion of the requirements of the commission order.

      (6) The commission may institute actions or proceedings for legal or equitable remedies in the Circuit Court for Marion County or in the circuit court for the county to which the commission’s order is directed or within which all or a portion of the applicable city is located to enforce compliance with the provisions of any order issued under this section or to restrain violations thereof. Such actions or proceedings may be instituted without the necessity of prior agency notice, hearing and order on an alleged violation.

EXPEDITED LAND DIVISIONS

 

      197.360 “Expedited land division” defined; applicability. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Expedited land division” means a division of land under ORS 92.010 to 92.192, 92.205 to 92.245 or 92.830 to 92.845 by a local government that:

      (A) Includes only land that is zoned for residential uses and is within an urban growth boundary.

      (B) Is solely for the purposes of residential use, including recreational or open space uses accessory to residential use.

      (C) Does not provide for dwellings or accessory buildings to be located on land that is specifically mapped and designated in the comprehensive plan and land use regulations for full or partial protection of natural features under the statewide planning goals that protect:

      (i) Open spaces, scenic and historic areas and natural resources;

      (ii) The Willamette River Greenway;

      (iii) Estuarine resources;

      (iv) Coastal shorelands; and

      (v) Beaches and dunes.

      (D) Satisfies minimum street or other right-of-way connectivity standards established by acknowledged land use regulations or, if such standards are not contained in the applicable regulations, as required by statewide planning goals or rules.

      (E) Will result in development that either:

      (i) Creates enough lots or parcels to allow building residential units at 80 percent or more of the maximum net density permitted by the zoning designation of the site; or

      (ii) Will be sold or rented to households with incomes below 120 percent of the median family income for the county in which the project is built.

      (b) “Expedited land division” includes land divisions that create three or fewer parcels under ORS 92.010 to 92.192 and meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (2) An expedited land division as described in this section is not a land use decision or a limited land use decision under ORS 197.015 or a permit under ORS 215.402 or 227.160.

      (3) The provisions of ORS 197.360 to 197.380 apply to all elements of a local government comprehensive plan and land use regulations applicable to a land division, including any planned unit development standards and any procedures designed to regulate:

      (a) The physical characteristics of permitted uses;

      (b) The dimensions of the lots or parcels to be created; or

      (c) Transportation, sewer, water, drainage and other facilities or services necessary for the proposed development, including but not limited to right-of-way standards, facility dimensions and on-site and off-site improvements.

      (4) An application for an expedited land division submitted to a local government shall describe the manner in which the proposed division complies with each of the provisions of subsection (1) of this section. [1995 c.595 §7; 2015 c.260 §1]

 

      197.365 Application for expedited land division; notice requirements; procedure. Unless the applicant requests to use the procedure set forth in a comprehensive plan and land use regulations, a local government shall use the following procedure for an expedited land division, as described in ORS 197.360:

      (1)(a) If the application for expedited land division is incomplete, the local government shall notify the applicant of exactly what information is missing within 21 days of receipt of the application and allow the applicant to submit the missing information. For purposes of computation of time under this section, the application shall be deemed complete on the date the applicant submits the requested information or refuses in writing to submit it.

      (b) If the application was complete when first submitted or the applicant submits the requested additional information within 180 days of the date the application was first submitted, approval or denial of the application shall be based upon the standards and criteria that were applicable at the time the application was first submitted.

      (2) The local government shall provide written notice of the receipt of the completed application for an expedited land division to any state agency, local government or special district responsible for providing public facilities or services to the development and to owners of property within 100 feet of the entire contiguous site for which the application is made. The notification list shall be compiled from the most recent property tax assessment roll. For purposes of appeal to the referee under ORS 197.375, this requirement shall be deemed met when the local government can provide an affidavit or other certification that such notice was given. Notice shall also be provided to any neighborhood or community planning organization recognized by the governing body and whose boundaries include the site.

      (3) The notice required under subsection (2) of this section shall:

      (a) State:

      (A) The deadline for submitting written comments;

      (B) That issues that may provide the basis for an appeal to the referee must be raised in writing prior to the expiration of the comment period; and

      (C) That issues must be raised with sufficient specificity to enable the local government to respond to the issue.

      (b) Set forth, by commonly used citation, the applicable criteria for the decision.

      (c) Set forth the street address or other easily understood geographical reference to the subject property.

      (d) State the place, date and time that comments are due.

      (e) State a time and place where copies of all evidence submitted by the applicant will be available for review.

      (f) Include the name and telephone number of a local government contact person.

      (g) Briefly summarize the local decision-making process for the expedited land division decision being made.

      (4) After notice under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the local government shall:

      (a) Provide a 14-day period for submission of written comments prior to the decision.

      (b) Make a decision to approve or deny the application within 63 days of receiving a completed application, based on whether it satisfies the substantive requirements of the local government’s land use regulations. An approval may include conditions to ensure that the application meets the applicable land use regulations. For applications subject to this section, the local government:

      (A) Shall not hold a hearing on the application; and

      (B) Shall issue a written determination of compliance or noncompliance with applicable land use regulations that includes a summary statement explaining the determination. The summary statement may be in any form reasonably intended to communicate the local government’s basis for the determination.

      (c) Provide notice of the decision to the applicant and to those who received notice under subsection (2) of this section within 63 days of the date of a completed application. The notice of decision shall include:

      (A) The summary statement described in paragraph (b)(B) of this subsection; and

      (B) An explanation of appeal rights under ORS 197.375. [1995 c.595 §8; 2015 c.260 §3]

 

      197.370 Failure of local government to approve or deny application within specified time. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, if the local government does not make a decision on an expedited land division within 63 days after the application is deemed complete, the applicant may apply in the circuit court for the county in which the application was filed for a writ of mandamus to compel the local government to issue the approval. The writ shall be issued unless the local government shows that the approval would violate a substantive provision of the applicable land use regulations or the requirements of ORS 197.360. A decision of the circuit court under this section may be appealed only to the Court of Appeals.

      (2) After seven days’ notice to the applicant, the governing body of the local government may, at a regularly scheduled public meeting, take action to extend the 63-day time period to a date certain for one or more applications for an expedited land division prior to the expiration of the 63-day period, based on a determination that an unexpected or extraordinary increase in applications makes action within 63 days impracticable. In no case shall an extension be to a date more than 120 days after the application was deemed complete. Upon approval of an extension, the provisions of ORS 197.360 to 197.380, including the mandamus remedy provided by subsection (1) of this section, shall remain applicable to the expedited land division, except that the extended period shall be substituted for the 63-day period wherever applicable.

      (3) The decision to approve or not approve an extension under subsection (2) of this section is not a land use decision or limited land use decision. [1995 c.595 §9]

 

      197.375 Appeal of decision on application for expedited land division; notice requirements; standards for review; procedure; costs. (1) An appeal of a decision made under ORS 197.360 and 197.365 shall be made as follows:

      (a) An appeal must be filed with the local government within 14 days of mailing of the notice of the decision under ORS 197.365 (4), and shall be accompanied by a $300 deposit for costs.

      (b) A decision may be appealed by:

      (A) The applicant; or

      (B) Any person or organization who files written comments in the time period established under ORS 197.365.

      (c) An appeal shall be based solely on allegations:

      (A) Of violation of the substantive provisions of the applicable land use regulations;

      (B) Of unconstitutionality of the decision;

      (C) That the application is not eligible for review under ORS 197.360 to 197.380 and should be reviewed as a land use decision or limited land use decision; or

      (D) That the parties’ substantive rights have been substantially prejudiced by an error in procedure by the local government.

      (2) The local government shall appoint a referee to decide the appeal of a decision made under ORS 197.360 and 197.365. The referee shall not be an employee or official of the local government. However, a local government that has designated a hearings officer under ORS 215.406 or 227.165 may designate the hearings officer as the referee for appeals of a decision made under ORS 197.360 and 197.365.

      (3) Within seven days of being appointed to decide the appeal, the referee shall notify the applicant, the local government, the appellant if other than the applicant, any person or organization entitled to notice under ORS 197.365 (2) that provided written comments to the local government and all providers of public facilities and services entitled to notice under ORS 197.365 (2) and advise them of the manner in which they may participate in the appeal. A person or organization that provided written comments to the local government but did not file an appeal under subsection (1) of this section may participate only with respect to the issues raised in the written comments submitted by that person or organization. The referee may use any procedure for decision-making consistent with the interests of the parties to ensure a fair opportunity to present information and argument. The referee shall provide the local government an opportunity to explain its decision, but is not limited to reviewing the local government decision and may consider information not presented to the local government.

      (4)(a) The referee shall apply the substantive requirements of the local government’s land use regulations and ORS 197.360. If the referee determines that the application does not qualify as an expedited land division as described in ORS 197.360, the referee shall remand the application for consideration as a land use decision or limited land use decision. In all other cases, the referee shall seek to identify means by which the application can satisfy the applicable requirements.

      (b) The referee may not reduce the density of the land division application. The referee shall make a written decision approving or denying the application or approving it with conditions designed to ensure that the application satisfies the land use regulations, within 42 days of the filing of an appeal. The referee may not remand the application to the local government for any reason other than as set forth in this subsection.

      (5) Unless the governing body of the local government finds exigent circumstances, a referee who fails to issue a written decision within 42 days of the filing of an appeal shall receive no compensation for service as referee in the appeal.

      (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the referee shall order the local government to refund the deposit for costs to an appellant who materially improves his or her position from the decision of the local government. The referee shall assess the cost of the appeal in excess of the deposit for costs, up to a maximum of $500, including the deposit paid under subsection (1) of this section, against an appellant who does not materially improve his or her position from the decision of the local government. The local government shall pay the portion of the costs of the appeal not assessed against the appellant. The costs of the appeal include the compensation paid the referee and costs incurred by the local government, but not the costs of other parties.

      (7) The Land Use Board of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to consider any decisions, aspects of decisions or actions made under ORS 197.360 to 197.380.

      (8) Any party to a proceeding before a referee under this section may seek judicial review of the referee’s decision in the manner provided for review of final orders of the Land Use Board of Appeals under ORS 197.850 and 197.855. The Court of Appeals shall review decisions of the referee in the same manner as provided for review of final orders of the Land Use Board of Appeals in those statutes. However, notwithstanding ORS 197.850 (9) or any other provision of law, the court shall reverse or remand the decision only if the court finds:

      (a) That the decision does not concern an expedited land division as described in ORS 197.360 and the appellant raised this issue in proceedings before the referee;

      (b) That there is a basis to vacate the decision as described in ORS 36.705 (1)(a) to (d), or a basis for modification or correction of an award as described in ORS 36.710; or

      (c) That the decision is unconstitutional. [1995 c.595 §10; 2003 c.598 §37]

 

      197.380 Application fees for expedited land division. Each city and county shall establish an application fee for an expedited land division. The fee shall be set at a level calculated to recover the estimated full cost of processing an application, including the cost of appeals to the referee under ORS 197.375, based on the estimated average cost of such applications. Within one year of establishing the fee required under this section, the city or county shall review and revise the fee, if necessary, to reflect actual experience in processing applications under ORS 197.360 to 197.380. [1995 c.595 §11; 1999 c.348 §8]

      (2) If the local government finds after review of the application that the proposed activity complies with goals and the comprehensive plans of the local government affected by the activity, it shall approve the application and issue a permit for the activity to the person or public agency applying for the permit. If the governing body does not approve or disapprove the permit within 60 days of receipt of the application, the application shall be considered approved.

      (3) The local government may prescribe and include in the permit any conditions or restrictions that it considers necessary to assure that the activity complies with the goals and the comprehensive plans of the local governments affected by the activity.

      (4) Actions pursuant to this section are subject to review under ORS 197.830 to 197.845. [1975 c.486 §3; 1977 c.664 §26; 1979 c.772 §7c; 1981 c.748 §40; 1983 c.827 §44]

      Note: Sections 6 to 8, chapter 636, Oregon Laws 2009, provide:

      Sec. 6. (1) There is established the Oregon Transfer of Development Rights Pilot Program in the Department of Land Conservation and Development. Working with the State Forestry Department, the State Department of Agriculture and local governments and with other state agencies, as appropriate, the Department of Land Conservation and Development shall implement the pilot program.

      (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall adopt rules to implement the pilot program. The commission, by rule, may:

      (a) Establish a maximum ratio of transferable development rights to severed development interests in a sending area for each pilot project. The maximum ratio:

      (A) Must be calculated to protect lands planned and zoned for forest use and to create incentives for owners of land in the sending area to participate in the pilot project;

      (B) May not exceed one transferable development right to one severed development interest if the receiving area is outside of urban growth boundaries and outside unincorporated communities;

      (C) May not exceed two transferable development rights to one severed development interest if the receiving area is in an unincorporated community; and

      (D) Must be consistent with plans for public facilities and services in the receiving area.

      (b) Require participating owners of land in a sending area to grant conservation easements pursuant to ORS 271.715 to 271.795, or otherwise obligate themselves, to ensure that additional residential development of their property does not occur.

      (3) The commission, by rule, shall establish a process for selecting pilot projects from among potential projects nominated by local governments. The process must require local governments to nominate potential projects by submitting a concept plan for each proposed pilot project, including proposed amendments, if any, to the comprehensive plan and land use regulations implementing the plan that are necessary to implement the pilot project.

      (4) When selecting a pilot project, the commission must find that the pilot project is:

      (a) Reasonably likely to provide a net benefit to the forest economy or the agricultural economy of this state;

      (b) Designed to avoid or minimize adverse effects on transportation, natural resources, public facilities and services, nearby urban areas and nearby farm and forest uses; and

      (c) Designed so that new development authorized in a receiving area does not conflict with a resource or area inventoried under a statewide land use planning goal relating to natural resources, scenic and historic areas and open spaces, or with an area identified as a Conservation Opportunity Area in the “Oregon Conservation Strategy” adopted by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission and published by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife in September of 2006.

      (5) The commission may select up to three pilot projects for the transfer of development rights under sections 6 to 8, chapter 636, Oregon Laws 2009.

      (8)(a) Except as provided otherwise in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a local government participating in a pilot project shall select a receiving area for the pilot project based on the following priorities:

      (A) First priority is lands within an urban growth boundary.

      (B) Second priority is lands that are adjacent to an urban growth boundary and that are subject to an exception from a statewide land use planning goal relating to agricultural lands or forestlands.

      (C) Third priority is lands that are:

      (i) Within an urban unincorporated community or a rural community; or

      (ii) In a resort community, or a rural service center, that contains at least 100 dwelling units at the time the pilot project is approved.

      (D) Fourth priority is exception areas approved under ORS 197.732 that are adjacent to urban unincorporated communities or rural communities, if the county agrees to bring the receiving area within the boundaries of the community and to provide the community with water and sewer service.

      (b) The commission may authorize a local government to select lower priority lands over higher priority lands for a receiving area in a pilot project only if the local government has established, to the satisfaction of the commission, that selecting higher priority lands as the receiving area is not likely to result in the severance and transfer of a significant proportion of the development interests in the sending area within five years after the receiving area is established.

      (c) The minimum residential density of development allowed in receiving areas intended for residential development is:

      (A) For second priority lands described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection, at least five dwelling units per net acre or 125 percent of the average residential density allowed within the urban growth boundary when the pilot project is approved by the commission, whichever is greater.

      (B) For third priority and fourth priority lands described in paragraph (a)(C) and (D) of this subsection, at least 125 percent of the average residential density allowed on land planned for residential use within the unincorporated community when the pilot project is approved by the commission.

      (d) For third and fourth priority lands described in paragraph (a)(C) and (D) of this subsection that are within one jurisdiction but adjacent to another jurisdiction, the written consent of the adjacent jurisdiction is required for designation of the receiving area.

      (9) The commission may establish additional requirements for receiving areas.

      (10) The commission, by rule, may provide a bonus in the form of a higher transfer ratio if a substantial portion of the new development in the receiving area of the pilot project is affordable housing within an urban growth boundary. [2009 c.636 §6; 2010 c.5 §3; 2011 c.144 §1]

      Sec. 7. (1) Notwithstanding contrary provisions of statewide land use planning goals relating to public facilities and services and urbanization, and notwithstanding ORS 215.700 to 215.780, a local government may change its comprehensive plan and land use regulations implementing the plan to allow residential development in a receiving area consistent with sections 6 to 8, chapter 636, Oregon Laws 2009, if the Land Conservation and Development Commission has approved a concept plan for the pilot project.

      (2) The local governments having land use jurisdiction over lands included in the sending area and the receiving area for the pilot project shall adopt amendments to their respective comprehensive plans and land use regulations implementing the plans that are consistent with subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) When the commission has approved a proposed concept plan, the local governments having land use jurisdiction over the affected sending area and affected receiving area shall adopt overlay zone provisions and corresponding amendments to the comprehensive plan and land use regulations implementing the plan that identify the additional development allowed through participation in the pilot project. The Department of Land Conservation and Development shall review the overlay zones and corresponding comprehensive plan amendments in the manner of periodic review under ORS 197.628 to 197.650 [series became 197.628 to 197.651].

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 197.296 and 197.298 and statewide land use planning goals relating to urbanization, a local government may amend its urban growth boundary to include adjacent lands in a receiving area, consistent with an approved concept plan, if the net residential density of development authorized in the receiving area is at least five dwelling units per net acre or 125 percent of the average residential density allowed on land planned for residential use within the urban growth boundary when the pilot project is approved by the commission, whichever is greater.

      (5) Local governments or other entities may establish a development rights bank or other system to facilitate the transfer of development rights.

      (6) A county shall review an application for a pilot project under sections 6 to 8, chapter 636, Oregon Laws 2009, as a comprehensive plan amendment. A county may apply other procedures, including master plan approval, site plan review or conditional use review as the county finds appropriate to subsequent phases of review of the pilot project.

      (7) When development rights transfers authorized by the pilot project under sections 6 to 8, chapter 636, Oregon Laws 2009, result in the transfer of development rights from the jurisdiction of one local government to another local government and cause a potential shift of ad valorem tax revenues between jurisdictions, the local governments may enter into an intergovernmental agreement under ORS 190.003 to 190.130 that provides for sharing between the local governments of the prospective ad valorem tax revenues derived from new development in the receiving area. [2009 c.636 §7; 2011 c.144 §2]

      Sec. 8. (1) The Department of Land Conservation and Development, the State Forestry Department, a local government participating in the Oregon Transfer of Development Rights Pilot Program or a third-party holder identified by the Department of Land Conservation and Development may hold, monitor or enforce a conservation easement pursuant to ORS 271.715 to 271.795 or other property interest to ensure that lands in sending areas do not retain residential development rights transferred under sections 6 to 8 of this 2009 Act.

      (2) An entity that is eligible to be a holder of a conservation easement may acquire, from a willing seller in the manner provided by ORS 271.715 to 271.795, the right to carry out a use of land authorized under rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission implementing the pilot program.

SITING OF DESTINATION RESORTS

 

      197.435 Definitions for ORS 197.435 to 197.467. As used in ORS 197.435 to 197.467:

      (1) “Developed recreational facilities” means improvements constructed for the purpose of recreation and may include but are not limited to golf courses, tennis courts, swimming pools, marinas, ski runs and bicycle paths.

      (2) “High value crop area” means an area in which there is a concentration of commercial farms capable of producing crops or products with a minimum gross value of $1,000 per acre per year. These crops and products include field crops, small fruits, berries, tree fruits, nuts or vegetables, dairying, livestock feedlots or Christmas trees as these terms are used in the 1983 County and State Agricultural Estimates prepared by the Oregon State University Extension Service. The “high value crop area” designation is used for the purpose of minimizing conflicting uses in resort siting and does not revise the requirements of an agricultural land goal or administrative rules interpreting the goal.

      (3) “Map of eligible lands” means a map of the county adopted pursuant to ORS 197.455.

      (4) “Open space” means any land that is retained in a substantially natural condition or is improved for recreational uses such as golf courses, hiking or nature trails or equestrian or bicycle paths or is specifically required to be protected by a conservation easement. Open spaces may include ponds, lands protected as important natural features, lands preserved for farm or forest use and lands used as buffers. Open space does not include residential lots or yards, streets or parking areas.

      (5) “Overnight lodgings” means:

      (a) With respect to lands not identified in paragraph (b) of this subsection, permanent, separately rentable accommodations that are not available for residential use, including hotel or motel rooms, cabins and time-share units. Individually owned units may be considered overnight lodgings if they are available for overnight rental use by the general public for at least 45 weeks per calendar year through a central reservation and check-in service. Tent sites, recreational vehicle parks, manufactured dwellings, dormitory rooms and similar accommodations do not qualify as overnight lodgings for the purpose of this definition.

      (b) With respect to lands in eastern Oregon, as defined in ORS 321.805, permanent, separately rentable accommodations that are not available for residential use, including hotel or motel rooms, cabins and time-share units. Individually owned units may be considered overnight lodgings if they are available for overnight rental use by the general public for at least 38 weeks per calendar year through a central reservation system operated by the destination resort or by a real estate property manager, as defined in ORS 696.010. Tent sites, recreational vehicle parks, manufactured dwellings, dormitory rooms and similar accommodations do not qualify as overnight lodgings for the purpose of this definition.

      (6) “Self-contained development” means a development for which community sewer and water facilities are provided on-site and are limited to meet the needs of the development or are provided by existing public sewer or water service as long as all costs related to service extension and any capacity increases are borne by the development. A “self-contained development” must have developed recreational facilities provided on-site.

      (7) “Tract” means a lot or parcel or more than one contiguous lot or parcel in a single ownership. A tract may include property that is not included in the proposed site for a destination resort if the property to be excluded is on the boundary of the tract and constitutes less than 30 percent of the total tract.

      (8) “Visitor-oriented accommodations” means overnight lodging, restaurants and meeting facilities that are designed to and provide for the needs of visitors rather than year-round residents. [1987 c.886 §3; 1989 c.648 §52; 1993 c.590 §1; 2003 c.812 §1; 2005 c.22 §140]

 

      197.440 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) It is the policy of this state to promote Oregon as a vacation destination and to encourage tourism as a valuable segment of our state’s economy;

      (2) There is a growing need to provide year-round destination resort accommodations to attract visitors and encourage them to stay longer. The establishment of destination resorts will provide jobs for Oregonians and contribute to the state’s economic development;

      (3) It is a difficult and costly process to site and establish destination resorts in rural areas of this state; and

      (4) The siting of destination resort facilities is an issue of statewide concern. [1987 c.886 §2]

 

      197.445 Destination resort criteria; phase-in requirements; annual accounting. A destination resort is a self-contained development that provides for visitor-oriented accommodations and developed recreational facilities in a setting with high natural amenities. To qualify as a destination resort under ORS 30.947, 197.435 to 197.467, 215.213, 215.283 and 215.284, a proposed development must meet the following standards:

      (1) The resort must be located on a site of 160 acres or more except within two miles of the ocean shoreline where the site shall be 40 acres or more.

      (2) At least 50 percent of the site must be dedicated to permanent open space, excluding streets and parking areas.

      (3) At least $7 million must be spent on improvements for on-site developed recreational facilities and visitor-oriented accommodations exclusive of costs for land, sewer and water facilities and roads. Not less than one-third of this amount must be spent on developed recreational facilities.

      (4) Visitor-oriented accommodations including meeting rooms, restaurants with seating for 100 persons and 150 separate rentable units for overnight lodging shall be provided. However, the rentable overnight lodging units may be phased in as follows:

      (1) The declaration of moratoria on construction and land development by cities, counties and special districts may have a negative effect not only on property owners, but also on the housing and economic development policies and goals of other local governments within the state, and therefore, is a matter of statewide concern.

      (2) Such moratoria, particularly when limited in duration and scope, and adopted pursuant to growth management systems that further the statewide planning goals and local comprehensive plans, may be both necessary and desirable.

      (3) Clear state standards should be established to ensure that:

      (a) The need for moratoria is considered and documented;

      (b) The impact on property owners, housing and economic development is minimized; and

      (c) Necessary and properly enacted moratoria are not subjected to undue litigation. [1980 c.2 §1; 1991 c.839 §2; 1995 c.463 §2]

 

      197.520 Manner of declaring moratorium. (1) No city, county or special district may adopt a moratorium on construction or land development unless it first:

      (a) Provides written notice to the Department of Land Conservation and Development at least 45 days prior to the final public hearing to be held to consider the adoption of the moratorium;

      (b) Makes written findings justifying the need for the moratorium in the manner provided for in this section; and

      (c) Holds a public hearing on the adoption of the moratorium and the findings which support the moratorium.

      (2) For urban or urbanizable land, a moratorium may be justified by demonstration of a need to prevent a shortage of public facilities which would otherwise occur during the effective period of the moratorium. Such a demonstration shall be based upon reasonably available information, and shall include, but need not be limited to, findings:

      (a) Showing the extent of need beyond the estimated capacity of existing public facilities expected to result from new land development, including identification of any public facilities currently operating beyond capacity, and the portion of such capacity already committed to development;

      (b) That the moratorium is reasonably limited to those areas of the city, county or special district where a shortage of key public facilities would otherwise occur; and

      (c) That the housing and economic development needs of the area affected have been accommodated as much as possible in any program for allocating any remaining public facility capacity.

      (3) A moratorium not based on a shortage of public facilities under subsection (2) of this section may be justified only by a demonstration of compelling need. Such a demonstration shall be based upon reasonably available information and shall include, but need not be limited to, findings:

      (a) For urban or urbanizable land:

      (A) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas;

      (B) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that a needed supply of affected housing types and the supply of commercial and industrial facilities within or in proximity to the city, county or special district are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium;

      (C) Stating the reasons alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory;

      (D) That the city, county or special district has determined that the public harm which would be caused by failure to impose a moratorium outweighs the adverse effects on other affected local governments, including shifts in demand for housing or economic development, public facilities and services and buildable lands, and the overall impact of the moratorium on population distribution; and

      (E) That the city, county or special district proposing the moratorium has determined that sufficient resources are available to complete the development of needed interim or permanent changes in plans, regulations or procedures within the period of effectiveness of the moratorium.

      (b) For rural land:

      (A) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas;

      (B) Stating the reasons alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory;

      (C) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that lots or parcels outside the affected geographical areas are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium; and

      (D) That the city, county or special district proposing the moratorium has developed a work plan and time schedule for achieving the objectives of the moratorium.

      (4) No moratorium adopted under subsection (3)(a) of this section shall be effective for a period longer than 120 days, but such a moratorium may be extended provided the city, county or special district adopting the moratorium holds a public hearing on the proposed extension and adopts written findings that:

      (a) Verify the problem giving rise to the need for a moratorium still exists;

      (b) Demonstrate that reasonable progress is being made to alleviate the problem giving rise to the moratorium; and

      (c) Set a specific duration for the renewal of the moratorium. No extension may be for a period longer than six months.

      (5) Any city, county or special district considering an extension of a moratorium shall give the department at least 14 days’ notice of the time and date of the public hearing on the extension. [1980 c.2 §3; 1991 c.839 §3; 1995 c.463 §3]

 

      197.522 Local government to approve subdivision, partition or construction; conditions. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Needed housing” has the meaning given that term in ORS 197.303.

      (b) “Partition” has the meaning given that term in ORS 92.010.

      (c) “Permit” means a permit as defined in ORS 215.402 and a permit as defined in ORS 227.160.

      (d) “Subdivision” has the meaning given that term in ORS 92.010.

      (2) A local government shall approve an application for a permit, authorization or other approval necessary for the subdivision or partitioning of, or construction on, any land for needed housing that is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land use regulations.

      (3) If an application is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land use regulations, the local government, prior to making a final decision on the application, shall allow the applicant to offer an amendment or to propose conditions of approval that would make the application consistent with the plan and applicable regulations. If an applicant seeks to amend the application or propose conditions of approval:

      (a) A county may extend the time limitation under ORS 215.427 for final action by the governing body of a county on an application for needed housing and may set forth a new time limitation for final action on the consideration of future amendments or proposals.

      (b) A city may extend the time limitation under ORS 227.178 for final action by the governing body of a city on an application for needed housing and may set forth a new time limitation for final action on the consideration of future amendments or proposals.

      (4) A local government shall deny an application that is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land use regulations and that cannot be made consistent through amendments to the application or the imposition of reasonable conditions of approval. [1999 c.838 §4; 2015 c.374 §3]

 

      Note: 197.522 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 197 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      197.524 Local government to adopt moratorium or public facilities strategy following pattern or practice of delaying or stopping issuance of permits. (1) When a local government engages in a pattern or practice of delaying or stopping the issuance of permits, authorizations or approvals necessary for the subdivision or partitioning of, or construction on, any land, including delaying or stopping issuance based on a shortage of public facilities, the local government shall:

      (a) Adopt a public facilities strategy under ORS 197.768; or

      (b) Adopt a moratorium on construction or land development under ORS 197.505 to 197.540.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to the delay or stopping of the issuance of permits, authorizations or approvals because they are inconsistent with the local government’s comprehensive plan or land use regulations. [1999 c.838 §3]

 

      197.530 Correction program; procedures. (1) A city, county or special district that adopts a moratorium on construction or land development in conformity with ORS 197.520 (1) and (2) shall within 60 days after the effective date of the moratorium adopt a program to correct the problem creating the moratorium. The program shall be presented at a public hearing. The city, county or special district shall give at least 14 days’ advance notice to the Department of Land Conservation and Development of the time and date of the public hearing.

      (2) No moratorium adopted under ORS 197.520 (2) shall be effective for a period longer than six months from the date on which the corrective program is adopted, but such a moratorium may be extended provided the city, county or special district adopting the moratorium holds a public hearing on the proposed extension and adopts written findings that:

      (a) Verify that the problem giving rise to the moratorium still exists;

      (b) Demonstrate that reasonable progress is being made to alleviate the problem giving rise to the moratorium; and

      (c) Set a specific duration for the renewal of the moratorium.

      (3) No single extension under subsection (2) of this section may be for a period longer than six months, and no moratorium shall be extended more than three times.

      (4) Any city, county or special district considering an extension of a moratorium shall give the department at least 14 days’ notice of the time and date of the public hearing on the extension. [1980 c.2 §4; 1991 c.839 §4]

 

      197.540 Review by Land Use Board of Appeals. (1) In the manner provided in ORS 197.830 to 197.845, the Land Use Board of Appeals shall review upon petition by a county, city or special district governing body or state agency or a person or group of persons whose interests are substantially affected, any moratorium on construction or land development or a corrective program alleged to have been adopted in violation of the provisions of ORS 197.505 to 197.540.

      (2) If the board determines that a moratorium or corrective program was not adopted in compliance with the provisions of ORS 197.505 to 197.540, the board shall issue an order invalidating the moratorium.

      (3) All review proceedings conducted by the Land Use Board of Appeals under subsection (1) of this section shall be based on the administrative record, if any, that is the subject of the review proceeding. The board shall not substitute its judgment for a finding solely of fact for which there is substantial evidence in the whole record.

      (4) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197 to the contrary, the sole standard of review of a moratorium on construction or land development or a corrective program is under the provisions of this section, and such a moratorium shall not be reviewed for compliance with the statewide planning goals adopted under ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197.

      (5) The review of a moratorium on construction or land development under subsection (1) of this section shall be the sole authority for review of such a moratorium, and there shall be no authority for review in the circuit courts of this state. [1980 c.2 §5; 1983 c.827 §45; 2001 c.672 §9]

The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall specify, by rule, the deadline for submitting proposed changes, but in all cases the proposed change must be submitted at least 20 days before the local government holds the first evidentiary hearing on adoption of the proposed change. The commission may not require a local government to submit the proposed change more than 35 days before the first evidentiary hearing.

      (2) If a local government determines that emergency circumstances beyond the control of the local government require expedited review, the local government shall submit the proposed changes as soon as practicable, but may submit the proposed changes after the applicable deadline.

      (3) Submission of the proposed change must include all of the following materials:

      (a) The text of the proposed change to the comprehensive plan or land use regulation implementing the plan;

      (b) If a comprehensive plan map or zoning map is created or altered by the proposed change, a copy of the map that is created or altered;

      (c) A brief narrative summary of the proposed change and any supplemental information that the local government believes may be useful to inform the director or members of the public of the effect of the proposed change;

      (d) The date set for the first evidentiary hearing;

      (e) The form of notice or a draft of the notice to be provided under ORS 197.763, if applicable; and

      (f) Any staff report on the proposed change or information describing when the staff report will be available, and how a copy of the staff report can be obtained.

      (4) The director shall cause notice of the proposed change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or the land use regulation to be provided to:

      (a) Persons that have requested notice of changes to the acknowledged comprehensive plan of the particular local government, using electronic mail, electronic bulletin board, electronic mailing list server or similar electronic method; and

      (b) Persons that are generally interested in changes to acknowledged comprehensive plans, by posting notices periodically on a public website using the Internet or a similar electronic method.

      (5) When a local government determines that the land use statutes, statewide land use planning goals and administrative rules of the commission that implement either the statutes or the goals do not apply to a proposed change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan and the land use regulations, submission of the proposed change under this section is not required.

      (6) If, after submitting the materials described in subsection (3) of this section, the proposed change is altered to such an extent that the materials submitted no longer reasonably describe the proposed change, the local government must notify the Department of Land Conservation and Development of the alterations to the proposed change and provide a summary of the alterations along with any alterations to the proposed text or map to the director at least 10 days before the final evidentiary hearing on the proposal. The director shall cause notice of the alterations to be given in the manner described in subsection (4) of this section. Circumstances requiring resubmission of a proposed change may include, but are not limited to, a change in the principal uses allowed under the proposed change or a significant change in the location at which the principal uses would be allowed, limited or prohibited.

      (7) When the director determines that a proposed change to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation may not be in compliance with land use statutes or the statewide land use planning goals, including administrative rules implementing either the statutes or the goals, the department shall notify the local government of the concerns at least 15 days before the final evidentiary hearing, unless there is only one hearing or the proposed change has been modified to the extent that resubmission is required under subsection (6) of this section.

      (8) Notwithstanding subsection (7) of this section, the department may provide advisory recommendations to the local government concerning the proposed change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulation. [1981 c.748 §4; 1983 c.827 §7; 1985 c.565 §27; 1989 c.761 §20; 1999 c.622 §1; 2011 c.280 §1]

 

      197.612 Comprehensive plan or land use regulation changes to conform plan or regulations to new requirement in statute, goal or rule. (1) Notwithstanding contrary provisions of state and local law, a local government that proposes a change to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation solely for the purpose of conforming the plan and regulations to new requirements in a land use statute, statewide land use planning goal or rule of the Land Conservation and Development Commission implementing the statutes or goals may take action to change the comprehensive plan or the land use regulation without holding a public hearing if:

      (a) The local government gives notice to the Department of Land Conservation and Development of the proposed change in the manner provided by ORS 197.610 and 197.615; and

      (b) The department confirms in writing that the only effect of the proposed change is to conform the comprehensive plan or the land use regulations to the new requirements.

      (2) Notwithstanding the requirement under ORS 197.830 (2) that a person must have appeared before the local government orally or in writing, a person that has not appeared may petition for review of the decision under subsection (1) of this section solely to determine whether the only effect of the local decision is to conform the comprehensive plan or the land use regulation to the new requirements. [2011 c.280 §6]

 

      197.615 Submission of adopted comprehensive plan or land use regulation changes to Department of Land Conservation and Development. (1) When a local government adopts a proposed change to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation, the local government shall submit the decision to the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development within 20 days after making the decision.

      (2) The submission must contain the following materials:

      (a) A copy of the signed decision, the findings and the text of the change to the comprehensive plan or land use regulation;

      (b) If a comprehensive plan map or zoning map is created or altered by the proposed change, a copy of the map that is created or altered;

      (c) A brief narrative summary of the decision, including a summary of substantive differences from the proposed change submitted under ORS 197.610 and any supplemental information that the local government believes may be useful to inform the director or members of the public of the effect of the actual change; and

      (d) A statement by the individual transmitting the submission, identifying the date of the decision and the date of the submission.

      (3) The director shall cause notice of the decision and an explanation of the requirements for appealing the land use decision under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 to be provided to:

      (a) Persons that have requested notice of changes to the acknowledged comprehensive plan of the particular local government, using electronic mail, electronic bulletin board, electronic mailing list server or similar electronic method; and

      (b) Persons that are generally interested in changes to acknowledged comprehensive plans, by posting notices periodically on a public website using the Internet or a similar electronic method.

      (4) On the same day the local government submits the decision to the director, the local government shall mail, or otherwise deliver, notice to persons that:

      (a) Participated in the local government proceedings that led to the decision to adopt the change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or the land use regulation; and

      (b) Requested in writing that the local government give notice of the change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or the land use regulation.

      197.620 Appeal of certain comprehensive plan or land use regulation decision-making. (1) A decision to not adopt a legislative amendment or a new land use regulation is not appealable unless the amendment is necessary to address the requirements of a new or amended goal, rule or statute.

      (2) Notwithstanding the requirements of ORS 197.830 (2) that a person have appeared before the local government orally or in writing to seek review of a land use decision, the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development or any other person may appeal the decision to the Land Use Board of Appeals if:

      (a) The local government failed to submit all of the materials described in ORS 197.610 (3) or, if applicable, ORS 197.610 (6), and the failure to submit the materials prejudiced substantial rights of the Department of Land Conservation and Development or the person;

      (b) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the local government submitted the materials described in ORS 197.610 (3) or, if applicable, ORS 197.610 (6), after the deadline specified in ORS 197.610 (1) or (6) or rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission, whichever is applicable; or

      (c) The decision differs from the proposed changes submitted under ORS 197.610 to such an extent that the materials submitted under ORS 197.610 do not reasonably describe the decision.

      (3) Subsection (2)(b) of this section does not authorize an appeal if the local government cures an untimely submission of materials as provided in this subsection. A local government may cure the untimely submission of materials by either:

      (a) Postponing the date for the final evidentiary hearing by the greater of 10 days or the number of days by which the submission was late; or

      (b) Holding the evidentiary record open for an additional period of time equal to 10 days or the number of days by which the submission was late, whichever is greater. Additionally, the local government shall provide notice of the postponement or record extension to the Department of Land Conservation and Development. [1981 c.748 §5a; 1983 c.827 §8; 1989 c.761 §21; 1991 c.612 §13a; 2011 c.280 §3]

 

      197.625 Acknowledgment of comprehensive plan or land use regulation changes; application prior to acknowledgment. (1) A local decision adopting a change to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation is deemed to be acknowledged when the local government has complied with the requirements of ORS 197.610 and 197.615 and either:

      (a) The 21-day appeal period set out in ORS 197.830 (9) has expired and a notice of intent to appeal has not been filed; or

      (b) If an appeal has been timely filed, the Land Use Board of Appeals affirms the local decision or, if an appeal of the decision of the board is timely filed, an appellate court affirms the decision.

      (2) If the local decision adopting a change to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation is affirmed on appeal under ORS 197.830 to 197.855, the comprehensive plan or the land use regulation, as modified, is deemed to be acknowledged upon the date the decision of the board or the decision of an appellate court becomes final.

      (3) Prior to acknowledgment of a change to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation:

      (a) The change is effective at the time specified by local government charter or ordinance; and

      (b) If the change was adopted in substantial compliance with ORS 197.610 and 197.615, the local government shall apply the change to land use decisions, expedited land divisions and limited land use decisions unless a stay is granted under ORS 197.845.

      (4) Approval of a land use decision, expedited land division or limited land use decision that is subject to an effective but unacknowledged provision of a comprehensive plan or a land use regulation must include findings of compliance with land use statutes, statewide land use planning goals and administrative rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission implementing the statutes or goals that apply to the decision and that the unacknowledged provision implements.

      (5) If an effective but unacknowledged provision of a comprehensive plan or a land use regulation fails to gain acknowledgment, a permit or zone change approved, in whole or in part, on the basis of the change does not justify retention of the improvements that were authorized by the permit or zone change.

      (6) If requested by a local government, the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development shall issue certification of the acknowledgment upon receipt of an affidavit from:

      (a) The local government, attesting that the change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or the land use regulation was accomplished in compliance with ORS 197.610 and 197.615; and

      (b) The Land Use Board of Appeals, stating either:

      (A) That no notice of appeal was filed within the 21 days allowed under ORS 197.830 (9); or

      (B) The date the decision of the board or the decision of an appellate court affirming the change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or the land use regulation became final.

      (7) The board shall issue an affidavit for the purposes of subsection (6) of this section within five days after receiving a valid request from the local government. [1981 c.748 §5b; 1983 c.827 §10; 1987 c.729 §6; 1989 c.761 §23; 1991 c.612 §14; 1993 c.792 §44; 1995 c.595 §25; 1999 c.348 §9; 1999 c.621 §5; 2003 c.793 §3; 2011 c.280 §4]

 

      197.626 Submission of land use decisions that expand urban growth boundary or designate urban or rural reserves. (1) A local government shall submit for review and the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall review the following final land use decisions in the manner provided for review of a work task under ORS 197.633 and subject to subsection (3) of this section:

      (a) An amendment of an urban growth boundary by a metropolitan service district that adds more than 100 acres to the area within its urban growth boundary;

      (b) An amendment of an urban growth boundary by a city with a population of 2,500 or more within its urban growth boundary that adds more than 50 acres to the area within the urban growth boundary;

      (c) A designation of an area as an urban reserve under ORS 195.137 to 195.145 by a metropolitan service district or by a city with a population of 2,500 or more within its urban growth boundary;

      (d) An amendment of the boundary of an urban reserve by a metropolitan service district;

      (e) An amendment of the boundary of an urban reserve to add more than 50 acres to the urban reserve by a city with a population of 2,500 or more within its urban growth boundary; and

      (f) A designation or an amendment to the designation of a rural reserve under ORS 195.137 to 195.145 by a county, in coordination with a metropolitan service district, and the amendment of the designation.

      (2) When the commission reviews a final land use decision of a metropolitan service district under subsection (1)(a), (c), (d) or (f) of this section, the commission shall issue a final order in writing within 180 days after the commission votes whether to approve the decision.

      (3) When reviewing an amendment of an urban growth boundary under subsection (1)(b) of this section and ORS 197.286 to 197.314:

      (a) At the request of and in coordination with the city, the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development shall parse work tasks in a manner that allows the Department of Land Conservation and Development to issue final orders approving or remanding sequential phases required for completion of the work tasks, including a final order approving:

      (A) An inventory of buildable lands and an opportunities analysis under a goal relating to economic activities or an inventory of buildable lands and a needs analysis under a goal relating to housing needs.

      (B) An estimation of the land need under a goal relating to economic activities.

      (C) Any response to the department regarding approval of the estimation of land need, including changes proposed to comprehensive plan designations or land use zones.

      (b)(A) The director shall take action on each sequential phase of a work task described in paragraph (a) of this subsection not later than 90 days after the local government submits the phase for review, unless the local government waives the 90-day deadline or the commission grants the director an extension.

      (B) If the director does not take action within the time period required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the sequential phase of the work task is deemed approved.

      (c) The director may approve or remand a sequential phase of a work task or refer the phase of the work task to the commission for a decision. A decision by the director to approve or remand a phase of the work task may be appealed to the commission.

      (d) The director shall provide a letter to the local government certifying the approval of each sequential phase of a work task, unless an interested party has filed a timely objection to the phase of the work task consistent with administrative rules for conducting periodic review.

      (4) A final order of the commission under this section may be appealed to the Court of Appeals in the manner described in ORS 197.650 and 197.651. [1999 c.622 §14; 2001 c.672 §10; 2003 c.793 §4; 2007 c.723 §7; 2011 c.469 §1; 2014 c.92 §6; 2017 c.521 §1]

 

      197.627 Meaning of “compliance with the goals” for certain purposes. For the purposes of acknowledgment under ORS 197.251, board review under ORS 197.805 to 197.855, review of a proposed regional problem-solving agreement under ORS 197.652 to 197.658 or periodic review under ORS 197.628 to 197.651, “compliance with the goals” means the comprehensive plan and regulations, on the whole, conform with the purposes of the goals and any failure to meet individual goal requirements is technical or minor in nature. [Formerly 197.747]

 

      Note: 197.627 was made a part of ORS chapter 197 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      197.628 Periodic review; policy; conditions that indicate need for periodic review. (1) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to require the periodic review of comprehensive plans and land use regulations in order to respond to changes in local, regional and state conditions to ensure that the plans and regulations remain in compliance with the statewide planning goals adopted pursuant to ORS 197.230, and to ensure that the plans and regulations make adequate provision for economic development, needed housing, transportation, public facilities and services and urbanization.

      (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall concentrate periodic review assistance to local governments on achieving compliance with those statewide land use planning laws and goals that address economic development, needed housing, transportation, public facilities and services and urbanization.

      (3) The following conditions indicate the need for periodic review of comprehensive plans and land use regulations:

      (a) There has been a substantial change in circumstances including but not limited to the conditions, findings or assumptions upon which the comprehensive plan or land use regulations were based, so that the comprehensive plan or land use regulations do not comply with the statewide planning goals relating to economic development, needed housing, transportation, public facilities and services and urbanization;

      (b) Decisions implementing acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations are inconsistent with the goals relating to economic development, needed housing, transportation, public facilities and services and urbanization;

      (c) There are issues of regional or statewide significance, intergovernmental coordination or state agency plans or programs affecting land use which must be addressed in order to bring comprehensive plans and land use regulations into compliance with the goals relating to economic development, needed housing, transportation, public facilities and services and urbanization; or

      (d) The local government, commission or Department of Land Conservation and Development determines that the existing comprehensive plan and land use regulations are not achieving the statewide planning goals relating to economic development, needed housing, transportation, public facilities and services and urbanization. [1991 c.612 §2; 1999 c.622 §2; 2005 c.829 §1]

 

      197.629 Schedule for periodic review; coordination. (1) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall establish and maintain a schedule for periodic review of comprehensive plans and land use regulations. Except as necessary to coordinate approved periodic review work programs and to account for special circumstances that from time to time arise, the schedule shall reflect the following timelines:

      (a) A city with a population of more than 2,500 within a metropolitan planning organization or a metropolitan service district shall conduct periodic review every seven years after completion of the previous periodic review; and

      (b) A city with a population of 10,000 or more inside its urban growth boundary that is not within a metropolitan planning organization shall conduct periodic review every 10 years after completion of the previous periodic review.

      (2) A county with a portion of its population within the urban growth boundary of a city subject to periodic review under this section shall conduct periodic review for that portion of the county according to the schedule and work program set for the city.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if the schedule set for the county is specific as to that portion of the county within the urban growth boundary of a city subject to periodic review under this section, the county shall conduct periodic review for that portion of the county according to the schedule and work program set for the county.

      (4) If the Land Conservation and Development Commission pays the costs of a local government that is not subject to subsection (1) of this section to perform new work programs and work tasks, the commission may require the local government to complete periodic review when the local government has not completed periodic review within the previous five years if:

      (a) A city has been growing faster than the annual population growth rate of the state for five consecutive years;

      (b) A major transportation project on the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program that is approved for funding by the Oregon Transportation Commission is likely to:

      (A) Have a significant impact on a city or an urban unincorporated community; or

      (B) Be significantly affected by growth and development in a city or an urban unincorporated community;

      (c) A major facility, including a prison, is sited or funded by a state agency; or

      (d) Approval by the city or county of a facility for a major employer will increase employment opportunities and significantly affect the capacity of housing and public facilities in the city or urban unincorporated community.

      (5) The Land Conservation and Development Commission may schedule periodic review for a local government earlier than provided in subsection (1) of this section if necessary to ensure that all local governments in a region whose land use decisions would significantly affect other local governments in the region are conducting periodic review concurrently, but not sooner than five years after completion of the previous periodic review.

      (6) A city or county that is not required to complete periodic review under subsection (1) of this section may request periodic review by the commission.

      (7) Upon request by a city, the Land Conservation and Development Commission may permit a city to undergo periodic review for the limited purpose of completing changes to proposed amendments to a comprehensive plan and land use regulations required on remand after review by the commission under ORS 197.626 (1)(b). If periodic review is initiated under this subsection, the city may adopt, and the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development may approve, a work program that includes only the changes required on remand.

      (8) As used in this section, “metropolitan planning organization” means an organization located wholly within the State of Oregon and designated by the Governor to coordinate transportation planning in an urbanized area of the state pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 5303(c). [1999 c.622 §10; 2001 c.527 §3; 2005 c.829 §2; 2015 c.261 §1]

 

      197.630 [1981 c.748 §5c; repealed by 1983 c.827 §59]

 

      197.631 Commission to amend regulations to facilitate periodic review. In order to use state and local periodic review resources most efficiently and effectively and to concentrate periodic review on adequate provision of economic development, needed housing, transportation, public facilities and services and urbanization, the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall adopt, amend or repeal the statewide land use planning goals, guidelines and corresponding rules as necessary to facilitate periodic review and to provide for compliance by local governments with those goals not described in ORS 197.628 (2) through the post-acknowledgment procedures of ORS 197.610 to 197.625. [1999 c.622 §11; 2005 c.829 §3; 2015 c.261 §3]

 

      197.633 Two phases of periodic review; rules; appeal of decision on work program; schedule for completion; extension of time on appeal. (1) The periodic review process is divided into two phases. Phase one is the evaluation of the existing comprehensive plan, land use regulations and citizen involvement program and, if necessary, the development of a work program to make needed changes to the comprehensive plan or land use regulations. Phase two is the completion of work tasks outlined in the work program.

      (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall adopt rules for conducting periodic review that address:

      (a) Initiating periodic review;

      (b) Citizen participation;

      (c) The participation of state agencies;

      (d) The preparation, review and approval of a work program; and

      (e) The preparation, review and approval of work tasks, including:

      (A) The amendment of an urban growth boundary.

      (B) The designation of, or withdrawal of territory from, urban reserves or rural reserves.

      (3) The rules adopted by the commission under this section may include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning standing, requirements to raise issues before local government as a precondition to commission review and other provisions concerning the scope and standard for commission review to simplify or speed the review. The commission shall confine its review of evidence to the local record. The commission’s standard of review:

      (a) For evidentiary issues, is whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the local government’s decision.

      (b) For procedural issues, is whether the local government failed to follow the procedures applicable to the matter before the local government in a manner that prejudiced the substantial rights of a party to the proceeding.

      (c) For issues concerning compliance with applicable laws, is whether the local government’s decision on the whole complies with applicable statutes, statewide land use planning goals, administrative rules, the comprehensive plan, the regional framework plan, the functional plan and land use regulations. The commission shall defer to a local government’s interpretation of the comprehensive plan or land use regulations in the manner provided in ORS 197.829. For purposes of this paragraph, “complies” has the meaning given the term “compliance” in the phrase “compliance with the goals” in ORS 197.627.

      (4) A decision by the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development to approve a work program, that no work program is necessary or that no further work is necessary is final and not subject to appeal.

      (5) The director:

      (a) Shall take action on a work task not later than 120 days after the local government submits the work task for review unless the local government waives the 120-day deadline or the commission grants the director an extension. If the director does not take action within the time period required by this subsection, the work task is deemed approved. The department shall provide a letter to the local government certifying that the work task is approved unless an interested party has filed a timely objection to the work task consistent with administrative rules for conducting periodic review.

      (b) May approve or remand a work task or refer the work task to the commission for a decision. A decision by the director to approve or remand a work task may be appealed to the commission.

      (6) Except as provided in this subsection, the commission shall take action on the appeal or referral of a work task within 90 days of the appeal or referral. Action by the commission in response to an appeal from a decision of the director or a referral is a final order subject to judicial review in the manner provided in ORS 197.650 and 197.651. The commission may extend the time for taking action on the appeal or referral if the commission finds that:

      (a) The appeal or referral is appropriate for mediation;

      (b) The appeal or referral raises new or complex issues of fact or law that make it unreasonable for the commission to give adequate consideration to the issues within the 90-day limit; or

      (c) The parties to the appeal and the commission agree to an extension, not to exceed an additional 90 days.

      (7) The commission and a local government shall attempt to complete periodic review within three years after approval of a work program. To promote the timely completion of periodic review, the commission shall establish a system of incentives to encourage local government compliance with timelines in periodic review work programs. [1991 c.612 §3; 1993 c.18 §38; 1999 c.622 §3; 2001 c.527 §1; 2005 c.829 §4; 2011 c.469 §2]

 

      197.635 [1981 c.748 §6; repealed by 1983 c.827 §59]

 

      197.636 Procedures and actions for failure to meet periodic review deadlines. (1) Upon good cause shown by a local government, the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development may allow the local government an extension of time for submitting a work program or completing a work task. A decision by the director to grant or deny an extension may be referred to the Land Conservation and Development Commission by the director. The Department of Land Conservation and Development or the commission shall not extend the deadline for submitting a work program more than once nor for more than 90 days, and shall not extend the deadline for a work task more than once nor for more than one year.

      (2) If a local government fails to submit a work program or to complete a work task by the deadline set by the director or the commission, including any extension that has been granted, the director shall schedule a hearing before the commission. The commission shall issue an order imposing one or more of the following sanctions until the work program or the work task receives final approval by the director or the commission:

      (a) Require the local government to apply those portions of the goals and rules to land use decisions as specified in the order. Sanctions may be imposed under this paragraph only when necessary to resolve a specific deficiency identified in the order.

      (b) Forfeiture of all or a portion of the grant money received to conduct the review, develop the work program or complete the work task.

      (c) Completion of the work program or work task by the department. The commission may require the local government to pay the cost for completion of work performed by the department, following the withholding process set forth in ORS 197.335 (4).

      (d) Application of such interim measures as the commission deems necessary to ensure compliance with the statewide planning goals.

      (3) If the department receives a work program or work task completed in response to a commission order issued under subsection (2) of this section, the director shall evaluate and issue a decision on the work program or work task within 90 days.

      (4) Commission action pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section is a final order subject to judicial review in the manner provided in ORS 197.650. [1991 c.612 §4; 1999 c.622 §4; 2001 c.527 §2; 2005 c.829 §5]

 

      197.637 Department of Land Conservation and Development may request review by Housing and Community Services Department of certain local housing measures. (1) Upon request of the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the Housing and Community Services Department shall review the inventory and analysis of housing, and measures taken to address the housing need, required of certain local governments under ORS 197.296. The review shall address the likely effect of measures developed by a local government under ORS 197.296 (6) or (7) on the adequacy of the supply of buildable land and opportunities to satisfy needs identified under ORS 197.296 (3).

      (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission and the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development shall consider the review and any recommendations of the Housing and Community Services Department when determining whether a local government has complied with the statewide land use planning goals and the requirements of ORS 197.296. [1999 c.622 §12; 2001 c.908 §4]

 

      197.638 Department of Land Conservation and Development may request review by Oregon Business Development Department of local inventory and analysis of industrial and commercial land. (1) Upon request of the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the Oregon Business Development Department shall review the inventory and analysis of industrial and commercial land, and measures taken to address the land needs, required of certain local governments under ORS 197.712. The review shall address the likely effect of measures developed by a local government on the adequacy of the supply of sites and opportunities to satisfy needs identified under ORS 197.712.

      (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission and the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development shall consider the review and any recommendations of the Oregon Business Development Department when determining whether a local government has complied with the statewide land use planning goals and the requirements of ORS 197.712. [1999 c.622 §13]

 

      197.639 State assistance teams; alternative coordination process; grant and technical assistance funding; priority of population forecasting program; advisory committee. (1) In addition to coordination between state agencies and local government established in certified state agency coordination programs, the Department of Land Conservation and Development may establish one or more state assistance teams made up of representatives of various agencies and local governments, utilize the Economic Revitalization Team established under ORS 284.555 or institute an alternative process for coordinating agency participation in the periodic review of comprehensive plans.

      (2) The Economic Revitalization Team may work with a city to create a voluntary comprehensive plan review that focuses on the unique vision of the city, instead of conducting a standard periodic review, if the team identifies a city that the team determines can benefit from a customized voluntary comprehensive plan review.

      (3) The department may develop model ordinance provisions to assist local governments in the periodic review plan update process and in complying with new statutory requirements or new land use planning goal or rule requirements adopted by the Land Conservation and Development Commission outside the periodic review process.

      (4) A local government may arrange with the department for the provision of periodic review planning services and those services may be paid with grant program funds allocated under subsection (5) of this section.

      (5) The commission shall establish an advisory committee composed, at a minimum, of representatives from the League of Oregon Cities, the Association of Oregon Counties, metropolitan service districts, the Special Districts Association of Oregon, land use planning public interest groups and developer interest groups. The advisory committee shall advise the commission and the department on the allocation of grants and technical assistance funding from General Fund sources and other issues assigned by the commission.

      (6) The population forecasting program operated by the Portland State University Population Research Center pursuant to ORS 195.033 is the highest priority for the allocation of grant funding under subsection (5) of this section. [1991 c.612 §5; 2003 c.793 §5; 2005 c.829 §6; 2013 c.574 §5]

 

      197.640 [1981 c.748 §9; 1983 c.827 §11; 1987 c.69 §1; 1987 c.729 §7; 1987 c.856 §8; repealed by 1991 c.612 §23]

 

      197.641 [1983 c.827 §11b; 1987 c.729 §8a; repealed by 1991 c.612 §23]

 

      197.643 [1983 c.827 §11c; 1987 c.729 §9; repealed by 1991 c.612 §23]

 

      197.644 Modification of work program; exclusive jurisdiction of Land Conservation and Development Commission. (1) The Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development may authorize or direct a local government to modify an approved work program when:

      (a) Issues of regional or statewide significance arising out of another local government’s periodic review require an enhanced level of coordination;

      (b) Issues of goal compliance are raised as a result of completion of a work task resulting in a need to undertake further review or revisions;

      (c) Issues relating to the organization of the work program, coordination with affected agencies or persons, or orderly implementation of work tasks, result in a need for further review or revision; or

      (d) Issues relating to needed housing, employment, transportation or public facilities and services were omitted from the work program but must be addressed in order to ensure compliance with the statewide planning goals.

      (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction for review of the completed work tasks as set forth in ORS 197.628 to 197.651.

      (3) Commission action pursuant to subsection (2) of this section is a final order subject to judicial review in the manner provided in ORS 197.650 and 197.651. [1991 c.612 §6; 1997 c.634 §1; 1999 c.622 §5; 2011 c.469 §3]

 

      197.645 [1983 c.827 §11d; 1987 c.729 §10; repealed by 1991 c.612 §23]

 

      197.646 Implementation of new requirement in goal, rule or statute; rules. (1) A local government shall amend its acknowledged comprehensive plan or acknowledged regional framework plan and land use regulations implementing either plan by a self-initiated post-acknowledgment process under ORS 197.610 to 197.625 to comply with a new requirement in land use statutes, statewide land use planning goals or rules implementing the statutes or the goals.

      (2)(a) The Department of Land Conservation and Development shall notify local governments when a new requirement in land use statutes, statewide land use planning goals or rules implementing the statutes or the goals requires changes to an acknowledged comprehensive plan, an acknowledged regional framework plan or land use regulations implementing either plan.

      (b) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall establish, by rule, the time period within which an acknowledged comprehensive plan, an acknowledged regional framework plan and land use regulations implementing either plan must be in compliance with:

      (A) A new requirement in a land use statute, if the legislation does not specify a time period for compliance; and

      (B) A new requirement in a land use planning goal or rule adopted by the commission.

      (3) When a local government does not adopt amendments to an acknowledged comprehensive plan, an acknowledged regional framework plan or land use regulations implementing either plan, as required by subsection (1) of this section, the new requirements apply directly to the local government’s land use decisions. The failure to adopt amendments to an acknowledged comprehensive plan, an acknowledged regional framework plan or land use regulations implementing either plan required by subsection (1) of this section is a basis for initiation of enforcement action pursuant to ORS 197.319 to 197.335. [1991 c.612 §7; 2005 c.829 §7; 2007 c.71 §67; 2011 c.469 §4]

      197.650 Appeal to Court of Appeals; standing. (1) A Land Conservation and Development Commission final order issued pursuant to ORS 197.180, 197.251, 197.626, 197.628 to 197.651, 197.652 to 197.658, 197.659, 215.780 or 215.788 to 215.794 may be appealed to the Court of Appeals by persons who participated in proceedings, if any, that led to issuance of the final order being appealed.

      (2) Jurisdiction for judicial review of a final order of the commission issued pursuant to ORS 197.180, 197.251, 197.626, 197.628 to 197.651, 197.652 to 197.658, 197.659, 215.780 or 215.788 to 215.794 is conferred upon the Court of Appeals. [1981 c.748 §10; 1983 c.827 §52; 1989 c.761 §8; 1991 c.612 §16; 1997 c.247 §1; 1999 c.622 §7; 2009 c.606 §5; 2009 c.873 §13a; 2011 c.469 §5]

Note: See note under 197.646.

 

      197.651 Appeal to Court of Appeals for judicial review of final order of Land Conservation and Development Commission. (1) Judicial review of a final order of the Land Conservation and Development Commission under ORS 197.626 concerning the designation of urban reserves under ORS 195.145 (1)(b) or rural reserves under ORS 195.141 is as provided in subsections (3) to (12) of this section.

      (2) Judicial review of any other final order of the commission under ORS 197.626 or of a final order of the commission under 197.180, 197.251, 197.628 to 197.651, 197.652 to 197.658, 197.659, 215.780 or 215.788 to 215.794 is as provided in subsections (3) to (7), (9), (10) and (12) of this section.

      (3) A proceeding for judicial review under this section may be instituted by filing a petition in the Court of Appeals. The petition must be filed within 21 days after the date the commission delivered or mailed the order upon which the petition is based.

      (4) The filing of the petition, as set forth in subsection (3) of this section, and service of a petition on the persons who submitted oral or written testimony in the proceeding before the commission are jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended.

      (5) The petition must state the nature of the order the petitioner seeks to have reviewed. Copies of the petition must be served by registered or certified mail upon the commission and the persons who submitted oral or written testimony in the proceeding before the commission.

      (6) Within 21 days after service of the petition, the commission shall transmit to the Court of Appeals the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review. However, by stipulation of the parties to the review proceeding, the record may be shortened. The Court of Appeals may tax a party that unreasonably refuses to stipulate to limit the record for the additional costs. The Court of Appeals may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, the Court of Appeals may not tax the cost of the record to the petitioner or an intervening party. However, the Court of Appeals may tax the costs to a party that files a frivolous petition for judicial review.

      (7) Petitions and briefs must be filed within time periods and in a manner established by the Court of Appeals by rule.

      (8) The Court of Appeals shall:

      (a) Hear oral argument within 49 days of the date of transmittal of the record unless the Court of Appeals determines that the ends of justice served by holding oral argument on a later day outweigh the best interests of the public and the parties. However, the Court of Appeals may not hold oral argument more than 49 days after the date of transmittal of the record because of general congestion of the court calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by a member of the court or a party.

      (b) Set forth in writing and provide to the parties a determination to hear oral argument more than 49 days from the date the record is transmitted, together with the reasons for the determination. The Court of Appeals shall schedule oral argument as soon as is practicable.

      (c) Consider, in making a determination under paragraph (b) of this subsection:

      (A) Whether the case is so unusual or complex, due to the number of parties or the existence of novel questions of law, that 49 days is an unreasonable amount of time for the parties to brief the case and for the Court of Appeals to prepare for oral argument; and

      (B) Whether the failure to hold oral argument at a later date likely would result in a miscarriage of justice.

      (9) The court:

      (a) Shall limit judicial review of an order reviewed under this section to the record.

      (b) May not substitute its judgment for that of the Land Conservation and Development Commission as to an issue of fact.

      (10) The Court of Appeals may affirm, reverse or remand an order reviewed under this section. The Court of Appeals shall reverse or remand the order only if the court finds the order is:

      (a) Unlawful in substance or procedure. However, error in procedure is not cause for reversal or remand unless the Court of Appeals determines that substantial rights of the petitioner were prejudiced.

      (b) Unconstitutional.

      (c) Not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found by the commission.

      (11) The Court of Appeals shall issue a final order on the petition for judicial review with the greatest possible expediency.

COLLABORATIVE REGIONAL PROBLEM SOLVING

 

      197.652 Regional problem-solving process. (1) At the request of a county and at least one other local government in a region, the Department of Land Conservation and Development, other state agencies, as defined in ORS 171.133, metropolitan planning organizations, special districts and advisory committees on transportation may participate with the local governments in a collaborative regional problem-solving process.

      (2) If requested to participate, the department shall assist the county with the process and encourage regional efforts to resolve land use planning problems using the authorities described in ORS 197.652 to 197.658.

      (3) The county, in cooperation with the other local governments, shall identify the land use planning problems to be addressed and the participants whose actions are necessary to resolve the land use planning problems.

      (4) The county shall submit a proposed work scope and a proposed list of participants as a proposal to the Land Conservation and Development Commission for review. The commission shall review:

      (a) The proposed work scope to determine whether it can reasonably be completed within the time allowed;

      (b) The proposed participant list to determine whether it includes, at a minimum, all local governments that will need to amend a comprehensive plan provision or a land use regulation, or adopt a new provision or regulation, in order to resolve the land use planning problems identified in the work scope; and

      (c) The proposed work scope and the proposed participant list for consistency.

      (5) A county may initiate amendments of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation under ORS 197.652 to 197.658 only if the commission approves the work scope, the list of participants and a schedule for completion of the process. The schedule for completion of the process may:

      (a) Not exceed three years except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) Be extended by the commission for up to one year for good cause shown.

      (6) The decision of a county to submit a proposal under this section, and the decision of the commission to approve a proposal, are not final actions subject to judicial review.

      (7) If the commission approves a proposal under this section, the county must periodically report on the progress in carrying out the proposal, as specified by the commission.

      (8) For purposes of ORS 197.654 and 197.656, the participants in a collaborative regional problem-solving process include all participants on the list of participants approved by the commission unless the commission subsequently approves the addition or removal of a participant. [1996 c.6 §3; 1997 c.365 §1; 2009 c.873 §8]

 

      197.654 Regional problem-solving goals, actions and agreements; implementation. (1) After the Land Conservation and Development Commission approves a proposal for regional problem-solving under ORS 197.652, the participants shall develop proposed actions to resolve the problems identified in the work scope. The participants must agree to:

      (a) Regional goals that describe how the region intends to resolve each regional problem described in the work scope;

      (b) Actions necessary to achieve the regional goals, including changes to comprehensive plans or land use regulations;

      (c) Measurable indicators of performance and a system for monitoring progress toward achievement of the regional goals;

      (d) Incentives and disincentives to encourage successful implementation of the actions to achieve the regional goals;

      (e) If the regional goals involve the management of an urban growth boundary, actions to coordinate the planning and provision of water, sewer and transportation facilities in the region; and

      (f) A process for correction of actions if monitoring indicates that the actions are not achieving the regional goals.

      (2) A decision by a participant to enter into a regional problem-solving agreement under ORS 197.652 to 197.658 is not a final land use decision. However, a regional problem-solving agreement is not final and binding until:

      (a) All local governments that are participants have adopted the provisions of the comprehensive plans or land use regulations contemplated in the agreement; and

      (b) The commission has approved the comprehensive plan provisions and land use regulations as provided under ORS 197.656.

      (3) Changes to provisions of comprehensive plans and land use regulations adopted to implement a regional problem-solving agreement take effect 60 days after the commission notifies all participants that the commission has approved all of the changes. [1996 c.6 §4; 2009 c.873 §9]

 

      197.656 Commission approval of comprehensive plans not in compliance with goals; written statement of disapproval; participation by state agencies; use of resource lands; rules. (1) After the adoption of changes to comprehensive plans and land use regulations to implement a regional problem-solving agreement under ORS 197.652 to 197.658, the local governments that are participants shall submit the changes to the Land Conservation and Development Commission for review in the manner set forth in this section.

      (2) Following the procedures set forth in this subsection, the commission may approve changes to comprehensive plans and land use regulations that do not fully comply with the statewide land use planning goals, without taking an exception under ORS 197.732, upon a determination that the changes:

      (a) Conform, on the whole, with the purposes of the goals, and any failure to meet individual goal requirements is technical or minor in nature;

      (b) Are needed to achieve the regional goals specified by the participants; and

      (c) In combination with other actions agreed upon by the participants, are reasonably likely to achieve the regional goals.

      (3) The commission:

      (a) Shall review changes to the comprehensive plans or land use regulations adopted by a local government to implement a regional problem-solving agreement under ORS 197.652 to 197.658 pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section and ORS 197.659.

      (b) Has exclusive jurisdiction for review of changes to comprehensive plans or land use regulations adopted by a local government to implement a regional problem-solving agreement under ORS 197.652 to 197.658.

      (4) A participant in the regional problem-solving process or a person who participated in the proceedings leading to the adoption of changes to the comprehensive plans or land use regulations may not raise an issue on review before the commission that was not raised in the local proceedings for adoption of the changes to the plans or regulations.

      (5) If the commission disapproves changes to the comprehensive plans or land use regulations adopted by a local government to implement a regional problem-solving agreement under ORS 197.652 to 197.658, the commission shall issue a written statement describing the reasons for the disapproval and suggesting alternative methods for accomplishing the goals on a timely basis.

      (6) If, in order to resolve regional land use problems, the participants in a collaborative regional problem-solving process decide to devote agricultural land or forestland, as defined in the statewide planning goals, to uses not authorized by those goals, the participants shall choose land that is not part of the region’s commercial agricultural or forestland base, or take an exception to those goals pursuant to ORS 197.732. To identify land that is not part of the region’s commercial agricultural or forestland base, the participants shall consider the recommendation of a committee of persons appointed by the affected county, with expertise in appropriate fields, including but not limited to farmers, ranchers, foresters and soils scientists and representatives of the State Department of Agriculture, the State Forestry Department and the Department of Land Conservation and Development.

      (7) The Governor may require all appropriate state agencies to participate in the collaborative regional problem-solving process.

      (8) The commission may adopt rules to establish additional procedural and substantive requirements for review of changes to comprehensive plans and land use regulations adopted by local governments to implement a regional problem-solving agreement under ORS 197.652 to 197.658. [1996 c.6 §5; 2001 c.672 §11; 2009 c.873 §10]

 

      197.658 Modifying local work plan. In addition to the provisions of ORS 197.644, the Land Conservation and Development Commission may modify an approved work program when a local government has agreed to participate in a collaborative regional problem-solving process pursuant to ORS 197.654 and 197.656. [1996 c.6 §6]

 

      197.659 Commission approval of certain changes in comprehensive plans or land use regulations. (1) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall grant, deny or remand approval of proposed changes to a comprehensive plan or land use regulations adopted pursuant to ORS 197.652 to 197.658 or 215.788 to 215.794 within 120 days after the date that the local government submits the proposed changes.

      (2) The Department of Land Conservation and Development shall prepare a report stating whether the proposed changes comply with applicable statutes, goals and commission rules. The department shall provide a reasonable opportunity for persons to prepare and submit written comments or objections to the report; however a person may not:

      (a) Submit written comments or objections to the report unless the person participated orally or in writing in the local government proceedings leading to the adoption of the proposed changes.

      (b) Produce new evidence.

      (3) After reviewing the proposed changes, the report and any written comments and objections to the report, the commission shall prepare a proposed final order. The commission shall afford the local government and persons who submitted written comments or objections to the report a reasonable opportunity to file written exceptions to the proposed final order. If timely exceptions are not filed, the proposed order becomes final.

      (4) The commission’s review under this section is confined to the record of proceedings before the local government, the report of the department and any comments, objections and exceptions filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section and the proposed final order of the commission, including any responses to exceptions. The commission may entertain oral argument from the department and from persons who filed exceptions, and may consider new issues raised by its review. The commission may not allow additional evidence, argument or testimony that could have been presented to the local government but was not presented.

      (5) A commission order granting, denying or remanding proposed changes must include a clear statement of findings that sets forth the basis for the approval, denial or remand, including:

      (a) Identifying the statutes, goals and rules applicable to the proposed changes; and

      (b) Supporting the determinations of compliance and noncompliance.

      (6) A commission order granting approval may be limited to an identified geographic area described in the order if:

      (a) The identified geographic area is the only area that is the subject of the proposed changes; or

      (b) Specific geographic areas do not comply with the applicable statutes, goals or rules, and the requirements are not technical or minor in nature.

      (7) The commission may issue a limited approval order if a previously issued approval order is reversed or remanded by an appellate court. The limited approval order may deny approval of that part of the comprehensive plan or land use regulations that the court found not in compliance with the applicable statutes, goals or rules and grant approval of other parts of the proposed changes.

      (8) A limited approval order is an approval for all purposes and is a final order for purposes of judicial review with respect to the approved geographic area. A limited order may be adopted in conjunction with a remand. [2009 c.873 §13]

      197.663 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) It is the policy of this state that persons with disabilities and elderly persons are entitled to live as normally as possible within communities and should not be excluded from communities because their disability or age requires them to live in groups;

      (2) There is a growing need for residential homes and residential facilities to provide quality care and protection for persons with disabilities and elderly persons and to prevent inappropriate placement of such persons in state institutions and nursing homes;

      (3) It is often difficult to site and establish residential homes and residential facilities in the communities of this state;

      (4) To meet the growing need for residential homes and residential facilities, it is the policy of this state that residential homes and residential facilities shall be considered a residential use of property for zoning purposes; and

      (5) It is the policy of this state to integrate residential facilities into the communities of this state. The objective of integration cannot be accomplished if residential facilities are concentrated in any one area. [1989 c.564 §3; 2007 c.70 §54]

 

      197.665 Locations of residential homes. (1) Residential homes shall be a permitted use in:

      (4) A city or county may require an applicant proposing to site a residential facility within its jurisdiction to supply the city or county with a copy of the entire application and supporting documentation for state licensing of the facility, except for information which is exempt from public disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478. However, cities and counties shall not require independent proof of the same conditions that have been required by the Department of Human Services under ORS 418.205 to 418.327 for licensing of a residential facility. [1989 c.564 §5; 1991 c.801 §8; 2001 c.900 §48; 2003 c.86 §15]

FARMWORKER HOUSING

 

      197.677 Policy. In that the agricultural workers in this state benefit the social and economic welfare of all of the people in Oregon by their unceasing efforts to bring a bountiful crop to market, the Legislative Assembly declares that it is the policy of this state to insure adequate agricultural labor accommodations commensurate with the housing needs of Oregon’s workers that meet decent health, safety and welfare standards. To accomplish this objective in the interest of all of the people in this state, it is necessary that:

      (1) Every state and local government agency that has powers, functions or duties with respect to housing, land use or enforcing health, safety or welfare standards, under this or any other law, shall exercise its powers, functions or duties consistently with the state policy declared by ORS 197.307, 197.312, 197.677 to 197.685, 215.213, 215.277, 215.283, 215.284 and 455.380 and in such manner as will facilitate sustained progress in attaining the objectives established;

      (2) Every state and local government agency that finds farmworker activities within the scope of its jurisdiction must make every effort to alleviate insanitary, unsafe and overcrowded accommodations;

      (3) Special efforts should be directed toward mitigating hazards to families and children; and

      (4) All accommodations must provide for the rights of free association to farmworkers in their places of accommodation. [1989 c.964 §2; 2001 c.613 §11]

 

      197.680 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) This state has a large stock of existing farmworker housing that does not meet minimum health and safety standards and is in need of rehabilitation;

      (2) It is not feasible to rehabilitate much of the existing farmworker housing stock to meet building code standards;

      (3) In order to assure that minimum standards are met in all farmworker housing in this state, certain interim measures must be taken; and

      (4) Limited rehabilitation, outside city boundaries, must be allowed to a lesser standard than that set forth in the existing building codes. [1989 c.964 §3; 2001 c.613 §12]

 

      197.685 Location of farmworker housing; approval standards. (1) The availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing opportunities for farmworkers is a matter of statewide concern.

      (2) Farmworker housing within the rural area of a county shall be permitted in a zone or zones in rural centers and areas committed to nonresource uses.

      (3) Any approval standards, special conditions and procedures for approval adopted by a local government shall be clear and objective and shall not have the effect, either in themselves or cumulatively, of discouraging needed housing through unreasonable cost or delay. [1989 c.964 §5; 2001 c.613 §4]

 

      197.705 [1973 c.482 §1; repealed by 1977 c.665 §24]

 

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

 

      197.707 Legislative intent. It was the intent of the Legislative Assembly in enacting ORS chapters 195, 196, 197, 215 and 227 not to prohibit, deter, delay or increase the cost of appropriate development, but to enhance economic development and opportunity for the benefit of all citizens. [1983 c.827 §16]

 

      197.710 [1973 c.482 §3; repealed by 1977 c.665 §24]

 

      197.712 Commission duties; comprehensive plan provisions; public facility plans; state agency coordination plans; compliance deadline; rules. (1) In addition to the findings and policies set forth in ORS 197.005, 197.010 and 215.243, the Legislative Assembly finds and declares that, in carrying out statewide comprehensive land use planning, the provision of adequate opportunities for a variety of economic activities throughout the state is vital to the health, welfare and prosperity of all the people of the state.

      (2) By the adoption of new goals or rules, or the application, interpretation or amendment of existing goals or rules, the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall implement all of the following:

      (a) Comprehensive plans shall include an analysis of the community’s economic patterns, potentialities, strengths and deficiencies as they relate to state and national trends.

      (b) Comprehensive plans shall contain policies concerning the economic development opportunities in the community.

      (c) Comprehensive plans and land use regulations shall provide for at least an adequate supply of sites of suitable sizes, types, locations and service levels for industrial and commercial uses consistent with plan policies.

      (e) A city or county shall develop and adopt a public facility plan for areas within an urban growth boundary containing a population greater than 2,500 persons. The public facility plan shall include rough cost estimates for public projects needed to provide sewer, water and transportation for the land uses contemplated in the comprehensive plan and land use regulations. Project timing and financing provisions of public facility plans shall not be considered land use decisions.

      (f) In accordance with ORS 197.180, state agencies that provide funding for transportation, water supply, sewage and solid waste facilities shall identify in their coordination programs how they will coordinate that funding with other state agencies and with the public facility plans of cities and counties. In addition, state agencies that issue permits affecting land use shall identify in their coordination programs how they will coordinate permit issuance with other state agencies and cities and counties.

      (g) Local governments shall provide:

      (A) Reasonable opportunities to satisfy local and rural needs for residential and industrial development and other economic activities on appropriate lands outside urban growth boundaries, in a manner consistent with conservation of the state’s agricultural and forest land base; and

      (B) Reasonable opportunities for urban residential, commercial and industrial needs over time through changes to urban growth boundaries.

      (3) A comprehensive plan and land use regulations shall be in compliance with this section by the first periodic review of that plan and regulations. [1983 c.827 §17; 1991 c.612 §17]

 

      197.713 Industrial development on industrial lands outside urban growth boundaries; exceptions. (1) Notwithstanding statewide land use planning goals relating to urbanization or to public facilities and services, a county or its designee may authorize:

      (a) Industrial development, including accessory uses subordinate to the industrial development, in buildings of any size and type, subject to the permit approval process described in ORS 215.402 to 215.438 and to applicable building codes, in an area planned and zoned for industrial use on January 1, 2004, subject to the territorial limits described in subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

      (b) On-site sewer facilities to serve the industrial development authorized under this section, including accessory uses subordinate to the industrial development.

      (2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, a county or its designee may consider the following land for industrial development under this section:

      (a) Land more than three miles outside the urban growth boundary of every city with a population of 20,000 individuals or more; and

      (b) Land outside the urban growth boundary of every city with a population of fewer than 20,000 individuals.

      (3) A county or its designee may not authorize industrial development under this section on land within the Willamette Valley as defined in ORS 215.010.

      (4) A county or its designee may not authorize under this section retail, commercial or residential development in the area zoned for industrial use. [2003 c.688 §1; 2005 c.666 §1]

 

      Note: 197.713 and 197.714 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 197 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      197.714 Cooperation of county and city concerning industrial development. (1) Notwithstanding the authority granted in ORS 197.713 and 197.716 to allow industrial or other employment use development, when a county or its designee considers action under ORS 197.713 or 197.716 for land within 10 miles of the urban growth boundary of a city, the county or its designee shall give notice to the city at least 21 days prior to taking action.

      (2) If the city objects to the authorization of industrial or other employment use development under ORS 197.713 or 197.716, the city and county shall negotiate to establish conditions on the industrial or other employment use designation, development or changes in the development necessary to mitigate concerns raised by the city’s objection. [2003 c.688 §2; 2019 c.170 §3]

      (2) A listed county that has adopted an economic opportunity analysis as part of its comprehensive plan may amend its comprehensive plan, land use regulations and zoning map to designate not more than 10 sites outside an urban growth boundary that cumulatively total not more than 50 acres of land if the sites were identified in any economic opportunity analysis as additional potential sites for industrial uses or other employment uses in order to allow for industrial uses and other employment uses without requiring an exception under ORS 197.732 to any statewide land use planning goals related to:

      (a) Agriculture;

      (b) Forest use; or

      (c) Urbanization.

      (3) A county may not designate a site under subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) On any lands designated as high-value farmland as defined in ORS 195.300;

      (b) Unless the county complies with ORS 197.714; and

      197.719 Industrial use of abandoned or diminished mill sites; amendment of comprehensive plans and land use regulations; sewer facilities. (1) As used in this section, “abandoned or diminished mill site” means a mill, plant or other facility engaged in the processing or manufacturing of wood products, including sawmills and facilities for the production of plywood, veneer, hardboard, panel products, pulp and paper, that:

      (a) Is located outside of urban growth boundaries;

      (b) Was closed after January 1, 1980, or has been operating at less than 25 percent of capacity since January 1, 2003; and

      (c) Contains or contained permanent buildings used in the production or manufacturing of wood products.

      (2) Notwithstanding statewide land use planning goals protecting agricultural lands or forestlands or administrative rules implementing those goals, the governing body of a county may amend the county’s comprehensive plan and land use regulations to allow an abandoned or diminished mill site to be zoned for industrial use.

      (3) Notwithstanding a statewide land use planning goal relating to urbanization or administrative rules implementing that goal, the governing body of a county may amend the county’s comprehensive plan and land use regulations to allow an abandoned or diminished mill site to be zoned for any level of industrial use.

      (4) Notwithstanding a statewide land use planning goal relating to public facilities and services or administrative rules implementing that goal, the governing body of a county or its designee may approve:

      (a) The extension of sewer facilities to lands that on June 10, 2003, are zoned for industrial use and that contain an abandoned or diminished mill site. The sewer facilities may serve only industrial uses authorized for the mill site and contiguous lands zoned for industrial use.

      (b) The extension of sewer facilities to an abandoned or diminished mill site that is rezoned for industrial use under this section only as necessary to serve industrial uses authorized for the mill site.

      (c) The establishment of on-site sewer facilities to serve an area that on June 10, 2003, is zoned for industrial use and that contains an abandoned or diminished mill site or to serve an abandoned or diminished mill site that is rezoned for industrial use under this section. The sewer facilities may serve only industrial uses authorized for the mill site and contiguous lands zoned for industrial use.

      (5)(a) A local government, as defined in ORS 174.116, may not authorize a connection to any portion of a sewer facility located between an urban growth boundary or the boundary of an unincorporated community and the boundary of the mill site or the industrial zone containing the mill site, except as provided under a statewide land use planning goal relating to public facilities and services or under ORS 197.732.

      (b) Sewer facilities approved under subsection (4) of this section shall be limited in size to meet the needs of authorized industrial uses and may not provide service to retail, commercial or residential development, except as provided under a statewide land use planning goal relating to public facilities and services or under ORS 197.732. The presence of the sewer facilities may not be used to justify an exception to statewide land use planning goals protecting agricultural lands or forestlands or relating to urbanization.

      (6)(a) The governing body of a county or its designee shall determine the boundary of an abandoned or diminished mill site. For an abandoned or diminished mill site that is rezoned for industrial use under this section, land within the boundary of the mill site may include only those areas that were improved for the processing or manufacturing of wood products.

      (b) For an abandoned or diminished mill site subject to subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section, the governing body of a city or county or its designee may approve a permit, as defined in ORS 215.402 or 227.160, only for industrial development and accessory uses subordinate to such development on the mill site. The governing body or its designee may not approve a permit for retail, commercial or residential development on the mill site.

      (7) For land that on June 10, 2003, is zoned under statewide land use planning goals protecting agricultural lands or forestlands and that is rezoned for industrial use under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the governing body of the county or its designee may not later rezone the land for retail, commercial or other nonresource use, except as provided under the statewide land use planning goals or under ORS 197.732.

      197.722 Definitions for ORS 197.722 to 197.728. As used in ORS 197.722 to 197.728:

      (1) “Industrial use” means employment activities, including, but not limited to, manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, processing, storage, logistics, warehousing, importation, distribution and transshipment and research and development, that generate income from the production, handling or distribution of goods or services, including goods or services in the traded sector, as defined in ORS 285A.010.

      (2) “Regionally significant industrial area” means an area planned and zoned for industrial use that:

      (a) Contains vacant sites, including brownfields, that are suitable for the location of new industrial uses or the expansion of existing industrial uses and that collectively can provide significant additional employment in the region;

      (b) Has site characteristics that give the area significant competitive advantages that are difficult or impossible to replicate in the region;

      (c) Has superior access to transportation and freight infrastructure, including, but not limited to, rail, port, airport, multimodal freight or transshipment facilities, and other major transportation facilities or routes; and

      (d) Is located in close proximity to major labor markets. [2011 c.564 §6]

 

      Note: 197.722 to 197.728 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 197 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      197.723 Designation of regionally significant industrial areas; rules. (1) Within three years after June 28, 2011, in cooperation with local governments and private industry, the Economic Recovery Review Council, by rule, shall designate at least five and not more than 15 regionally significant industrial areas. The council shall base the designation of regionally significant industrial areas on the criteria in the definition of “regionally significant industrial area” and the judgment of the council concerning the relative importance of the areas in terms of potential, long-term job creation.

      (2) A local government may nominate a regionally significant industrial area for designation by the council.

      (3) An area containing multiple sites certified by the Oregon Business Development Department as ready for development within six months or less is eligible for designation by the council if the area is a regionally significant industrial area.

      (4) In addition to demonstrating compliance with other provisions of law, including, but not limited to, a statewide land use planning goal concerning economic development and rules implementing the goal, the future employment potential of a regionally significant industrial area shall be protected from conflicting development in the following ways:

      (a) A local government may not adopt a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation that prevents industrial uses within the area.

      (b) A local government may not adopt a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation that allows new nonindustrial uses within the area that conflict with existing or planned industrial uses.

      (c) A local government may not decrease the land area planned or zoned for industrial uses within the regionally significant industrial area.

      (d) A local government may adopt a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation, including development standards or overlay zones, that restricts the type or extent of current or future industrial uses within the area, but only if the local government mitigates at the same time the effect of the new provision by:

      (A) Clearly maintaining or increasing the industrial employment potential of the area; and

      (B) Clearly maintaining the important site characteristics and functions that led to the designation of the site as a regionally significant industrial area.

      (5) Subsection (4) of this section does not apply to a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation that is necessary:

      (a) To protect public health or safety; or

      (b) To implement federal law.

      (6) If 50 percent of the developable land within a regionally significant industrial area has not been developed within 10 years after designation of the area, the council shall remove the designation, unless landowners representing a majority of the land within the area request that the designation be continued.

      (7) Within a regionally significant industrial area, a new industrial use or the expansion of an existing industrial use is eligible for an expedited industrial land use permit issued under ORS 197.724 if the new or expanded use does not require a change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulations.

      (8) In addition to other criteria for distribution of available funds, the Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority and the Oregon Transportation Commission may consider the designation of an area as a regionally significant industrial area in prioritizing funding for transportation and other public infrastructure.

      (9) ORS 197.722 to 197.728 do not apply to land in the Willamette River Greenway Plan boundary between river mile 1 and river mile 11. [2011 c.564 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 197.722.

 

      197.724 Review of application for land use permit within regionally significant industrial area. (1) An applicant for a new industrial use or the expansion of an existing industrial use located within a regionally significant industrial area may request that an application for a land use permit be reviewed as an application for an expedited industrial land use permit under this section if the proposed use does not require:

      (a) An exception taken under ORS 197.732 to a statewide land use planning goal;

      (b) A change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulations of the local government within whose land use jurisdiction the new or expanded industrial use would occur; or

      (c) A federal environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act.

      (2) If the applicant makes a request that complies with subsection (1) of this section, the local government shall review the applications for land use permits for the proposed industrial use by applying the standards and criteria that otherwise apply to the review and by using the procedures set forth for review of an expedited land division in ORS 197.365 and 197.370. [2011 c.564 §8]

 

      Note: See note under 197.722.

      197.726 Jurisdiction on appeal; standing. (1) The Land Use Board of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to consider decisions, aspects of decisions or actions taken under ORS 197.722 to 197.728.

      (2) An appeal of a decision on an application for an expedited industrial land use permit made under ORS 197.724 may be made in the manner set forth in ORS 197.375 for appeal of a decision on an expedited land division. Notwithstanding ORS 197.375:

      (a) The applicant and a person who filed written comments in the time period established under ORS 197.365 may file an appeal;

      (b) If an appeal is filed, the referee shall hold a hearing on the appeal; and

      (c) The referee shall issue a written decision within 56 days after the appeal was filed.

      (3) A party to a proceeding before a referee under this section may seek judicial review of the referee’s decision in the manner provided for review of final orders of the Land Use Board of Appeals under ORS 197.850 and 197.855. The Court of Appeals shall review decisions of the referee in the manner provided for review of final orders of the Land Use Board of Appeals in ORS 197.850 and 197.855. However, notwithstanding ORS 197.850 (9) or any other provision of law, the court shall reverse or remand the decision only if the court finds that:

      (a) The local government’s decision clearly does not concern an application for an expedited industrial land use permit as described in ORS 197.724 and the appellant raised this issue in proceedings before the referee;

      (b) The referee’s decision contains a clear, material error of fact based on the record, and the appellant raised the issue in proceedings before the referee;

      (c) The referee’s decision contains a clear, material error of law, giving deference to any interpretations of law by the referee, and the appellant raised the issue in proceedings before the referee; or

      (d) The decision of the local government or the referee is unconstitutional. [2011 c.564 §9]

 

      Note: See note under 197.722.

 

      197.727 Fee for review. Each city and county with land use jurisdiction within a regionally significant industrial area designated by the Economic Recovery Review Council may establish a fee for review of an application for an expedited industrial land use permit. The fee must be set at a level estimated to recover the full cost of processing an application, including the cost of appeals to a referee under ORS 197.726, based on the estimated cost of the use proposed in the application. [2011 c.564 §10]

 

      Note: See note under 197.722.

 

      197.728 Rules. The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall administer regionally significant industrial areas and may adopt rules as necessary to implement ORS 197.722 to 197.728. [2011 c.564 §11]

      197.732 Goal exceptions; criteria; rules; review. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Compatible” is not intended as an absolute term meaning no interference or adverse impacts of any type with adjacent uses.

      (b) “Exception” means a comprehensive plan provision, including an amendment to an acknowledged comprehensive plan, that:

      (A) Is applicable to specific properties or situations and does not establish a planning or zoning policy of general applicability;

      (B) Does not comply with some or all goal requirements applicable to the subject properties or situations; and

      (C) Complies with standards under subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) A local government may adopt an exception to a goal if:

      (a) The land subject to the exception is physically developed to the extent that it is no longer available for uses allowed by the applicable goal;

      (b) The land subject to the exception is irrevocably committed as described by Land Conservation and Development Commission rule to uses not allowed by the applicable goal because existing adjacent uses and other relevant factors make uses allowed by the applicable goal impracticable; or

      (c) The following standards are met:

      (A) Reasons justify why the state policy embodied in the applicable goals should not apply;

      (B) Areas that do not require a new exception cannot reasonably accommodate the use;

      (C) The long term environmental, economic, social and energy consequences resulting from the use at the proposed site with measures designed to reduce adverse impacts are not significantly more adverse than would typically result from the same proposal being located in areas requiring a goal exception other than the proposed site; and

      (D) The proposed uses are compatible with other adjacent uses or will be so rendered through measures designed to reduce adverse impacts.

      (3) The commission shall adopt rules establishing:

      (a) That an exception may be adopted to allow a use authorized by a statewide planning goal that cannot comply with the approval standards for that type of use;

      (b) Under what circumstances particular reasons may or may not be used to justify an exception under subsection (2)(c)(A) of this section; and

      (c) Which uses allowed by the applicable goal must be found impracticable under subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) A local government approving or denying a proposed exception shall set forth findings of fact and a statement of reasons that demonstrate that the standards of subsection (2) of this section have or have not been met.

      (5) Each notice of a public hearing on a proposed exception shall specifically note that a goal exception is proposed and shall summarize the issues in an understandable manner.

      (6) Upon review of a decision approving or denying an exception:

      (a) The Land Use Board of Appeals or the commission shall be bound by any finding of fact for which there is substantial evidence in the record of the local government proceedings resulting in approval or denial of the exception;

      (b) The board upon petition, or the commission, shall determine whether the local government’s findings and reasons demonstrate that the standards of subsection (2) of this section have or have not been met; and

      (c) The board or commission shall adopt a clear statement of reasons that sets forth the basis for the determination that the standards of subsection (2) of this section have or have not been met.

      (7) The commission shall by rule establish the standards required to justify an exception to the definition of “needed housing” authorized by ORS 197.303.

      (8) An exception acknowledged under ORS 197.251, 197.625 or 197.630 (1) (1981 Replacement Part) on or before August 9, 1983, continues to be valid and is not subject to this section. [1983 c.827 §19a; 1995 c.521 §3; 2005 c.67 §1; 2007 c.71 §68; 2011 c.354 §6]

 

      197.734 Exceptions to certain statewide planning goal criteria; rules. (1) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall adopt or amend rules regarding the statewide planning goal criteria described in ORS 197.732 (2)(a) and (b). The rules adopted or amended pursuant to this subsection must allow a local government to rezone land in an area physically developed or committed to residential use, as described in ORS 197.732, without requiring the local government to take a new exception to statewide planning goals related to agricultural and forest lands. The rules must allow for a rezoning that authorizes the change, continuation or expansion of an industrial use that has been in operation for the five years immediately preceding the formal land use planning action that was initiated for the change, continuation or expansion of use.

      (2) The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section must provide that:

      (a) The rezoned use will maintain the land:

      (A) As rural land as described by commission rule; and

      (B) In a manner consistent with other statewide planning goal requirements;

      (b) The rural uses, density and public facilities and services permitted by the rezoning will not commit adjacent or other nearby resource land to uses that are not permitted by statewide planning goals related to agricultural and forest lands;

      (c) The rural uses, density and public facilities and services permitted by the rezoning are compatible with the uses of adjacent and other nearby resource land uses; and

      (d) The land to be rezoned is not in an area designated as a rural or urban reserve under ORS 195.141. [2015 c.477 §1]

      (5) If a local government makes a limited land use decision which is different from the proposal described in the notice to such a degree that the notice of the proposed action did not reasonably describe the local government’s final actions, a person adversely affected by the decision may appeal the decision to the board under this section:

The brief shall be due on the same date the respondent’s brief is due and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $100.

      (9) A notice of intent to appeal a land use decision or limited land use decision shall be filed not later than 21 days after the date the decision sought to be reviewed becomes final.

Failure to include a statement identifying when, how and to whom notice was provided under ORS 197.615 does not render the notice defective. Copies of the notice of intent to appeal shall be served upon the local government, special district or state agency and the applicant of record, if any, in the local government, special district or state agency proceeding. The notice shall be served and filed in the form and manner prescribed by rule of the board and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $200 and a deposit for costs to be established by the board.

      (b) Within 10 days after service of a notice of intent to appeal, the board shall provide notice to the petitioner and the respondent of their option to enter into mediation pursuant to ORS 197.860. Any person moving to intervene shall be provided such notice within seven days after a motion to intervene is filed. The notice required by this paragraph shall be accompanied by a statement that mediation information or assistance may be obtained from the Department of Land Conservation and Development.

If a local government or state agency withdraws an order for purposes of reconsideration, it shall, within such time as the board may allow, affirm, modify or reverse its decision. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the local government or agency action after withdrawal for purposes of reconsideration, the petitioner may refile the notice of intent and the review shall proceed upon the revised order. An amended notice of intent is not required if the local government or state agency, on reconsideration, affirms the order or modifies the order with only minor changes.

      (14) The board shall issue a final order within 77 days after the date of transmittal of the record. If the order is not issued within 77 days the applicant may apply in Marion County or the circuit court of the county where the application was filed for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to issue a final order.

      (15) Upon entry of its final order, the board:

      (a) May, in its discretion, award costs to the prevailing party including the cost of preparation of the record if the prevailing party is the local government, special district or state agency whose decision is under review. The board shall apply the deposit required by subsection (9) of this section to any costs charged against the petitioner.

      (b) Shall award reasonable attorney fees and expenses to the prevailing party against any other party who the board finds presented a position or filed any motion without probable cause to believe the position or motion was well-founded in law or on factually supported information.

      (a) The number of reviews commenced, as described in subsection (1) of this section, the number of reviews commenced for which a petition is filed under subsection (2) of this section and, in relation to each of those numbers, the rate at which the reviews result in a decision of the board to uphold, reverse or remand the land use decision or limited land use decision. The board shall track and report reviews under this paragraph in categories established by the board.

[1999 c.357 §5; 2011 c.354 §7]

 

      197.832 Board Publications Account. The Board Publications Account is established in the General Fund. All moneys in the account are appropriated continuously to the Land Use Board of Appeals to be used for paying expenses incurred by the board under ORS 197.830 (17).

      (b) The local government made a land use decision or limited land use decision which is different from the proposal described in the notice to such a degree that the notice of the proposed action did not reasonably describe the local government’s final action.

      (C) Made a decision not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record;

      (D) Improperly construed the applicable law; or

      (E) Made an unconstitutional decision; or

      (b) The state agency made a decision that violated the goals.

      (10)(a) The board shall reverse a local government decision and order the local government to grant approval of an application for development denied by the local government if the board finds:

      (A) Based on the evidence in the record, that the local government decision is outside the range of discretion allowed the local government under its comprehensive plan and implementing ordinances; or

      (B) That the local government’s action was for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of ORS 215.427 or 227.178.

      (b) If the board does reverse the decision and orders the local government to grant approval of the application, the board shall award attorney fees to the applicant and against the local government.

      (11)(a) Whenever the findings, order and record are sufficient to allow review, and to the extent possible consistent with the time requirements of ORS 197.830 (14), the board shall decide all issues presented to it when reversing or remanding a land use decision described in subsections (2) to (9) of this section or limited land use decision described in ORS 197.828 and 197.195.

      (b) Whenever the findings are defective because of failure to recite adequate facts or legal conclusions or failure to adequately identify the standards or their relation to the facts, but the parties identify relevant evidence in the record which clearly supports the decision or a part of the decision, the board shall affirm the decision or the part of the decision supported by the record and remand the remainder to the local government, with direction indicating appropriate remedial action.

      (12) The board may reverse or remand a land use decision under review due to ex parte contacts or bias resulting from ex parte contacts with a member of the decision-making body, only if the member of the decision-making body did not comply with ORS 215.422 (3) or 227.180 (3), whichever is applicable.

      (13) Subsection (12) of this section does not apply to reverse or remand of a land use decision due to ex parte contact or bias resulting from ex parte contact with a hearings officer.

      (14) The board shall reverse or remand a land use decision or limited land use decision which violates a commission order issued under ORS 197.328.

      (c) Any reasonable period of delay resulting from a request for a stay under ORS 197.845.

      (d) Any reasonable period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by a member of the board on the member’s own motion or at the request of one of the parties, if the member granted the continuance on the basis of findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the parties in having a decision within 77 days.

      (2) No period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the board under subsection (1)(d) of this section shall be excludable under this section unless the board sets forth in the record, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the other parties in a decision within the 77 days. The factors the board shall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under subsection (1)(d) of this section in any case are as follows:

      (a) Whether the failure to grant a continuance in the proceeding would be likely to make a continuation of the proceeding impossible or result in a miscarriage of justice; or

      (b) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of parties or the existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate consideration of the issues within the 77-day time limit.

      (3) No continuance under subsection (1)(d) of this section shall be granted because of general congestion of the board calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by any member of the board or any party.

      (4) The board may defer all or part of its consideration of a land use decision or limited land use decision described in subsection (1)(a) of this section until the Land Conservation and Development Commission has disposed of the acknowledgment proceeding described in subsection (1)(a) of this section. If the board deferred all or part of its consideration of a decision under this subsection, the board may grant a stay of the comprehensive plan provision, land use regulation, limited land use decision or land use decision under ORS 197.845. [1983 c.827 §33; 1989 c.761 §25; 1991 c.612 §19; 1991 c.817 §27; 1995 c.595 §18; 1999 c.348 §18; 1999 c.621 §8]

 

      197.845 Stay of decision being reviewed; criteria; undertaking; conditions; limitations. (1) Upon application of the petitioner, the board may grant a stay of a land use decision or limited land use decision under review if the petitioner demonstrates:

      (a) A colorable claim of error in the land use decision or limited land use decision under review; and

      (b) That the petitioner will suffer irreparable injury if the stay is not granted.

      (2) If the board grants a stay of a quasi-judicial land use decision or limited land use decision approving a specific development of land, it shall require the petitioner requesting the stay to give an undertaking in the amount of $5,000. The undertaking shall be in addition to the filing fee and deposit for costs required under ORS 197.830 (9). The board may impose other reasonable conditions such as requiring the petitioner to file all documents necessary to bring the matter to issue within specified reasonable periods of time.

      (3) If the board affirms a quasi-judicial land use decision or limited land use decision for which a stay was granted under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the board shall award reasonable attorney fees and actual damages resulting from the stay to the person who requested the land use decision or limited land use decision from the local government, special district or state agency, against the person requesting the stay in an amount not to exceed the amount of the undertaking.

      (4) The board shall limit the effect of a stay of a legislative land use decision to the geographic area or to particular provisions of the legislative decision for which the petitioner has demonstrated a colorable claim of error and irreparable injury under subsection (1) of this section. The board may impose reasonable conditions on a stay of a legislative decision, such as the giving of a bond or other undertaking or a requirement that the petitioner file all documents necessary to bring the matter to issue within a specified reasonable time period. [1983 c.827 §34; 1989 c.761 §22; 1991 c.817 §28; 1999 c.621 §9]

 

      197.850 Judicial review of board order; procedures; scope of review; attorney fees; undertaking. (1) Any party to a proceeding before the Land Use Board of Appeals under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 may seek judicial review of a final order issued in those proceedings.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 183.480 to 183.540, judicial review of orders issued under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 is solely as provided in this section.

      (3)(a) Jurisdiction for judicial review of proceedings under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 is conferred upon the Court of Appeals. Proceedings for judicial review are instituted by filing a petition in the Court of Appeals. The petition must be filed within 21 days following the date the board delivered or mailed the order upon which the petition is based.

      (b) Filing of the petition, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, and service of a petition on all persons identified in the petition as adverse parties of record in the board proceeding is jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended.

      (4) The petition must state the nature of the order the petitioner desires reviewed. Copies of the petition must be served by first class, registered or certified mail on the board and all other parties of record in the board proceeding.

      (5) Within seven days after service of the petition, the board shall transmit to the court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review, but, by stipulation of all parties to the review proceeding, the record may be shortened. The court may tax a party that unreasonably refuses to stipulate to limit the record for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when deemed desirable. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, the court may not tax the cost of the record to the petitioner or any intervening party. However, the court may tax such costs and the cost of transcription of record to a party filing a frivolous petition for judicial review.

      (6) Petitions and briefs must be filed within time periods and in a manner established by the Court of Appeals by rule.

      (7)(a) The court shall hear oral argument within 49 days of the date of transmittal of the record.

      (b) The court may hear oral argument more than 49 days from the date of transmittal of the record provided the court determines that the ends of justice served by holding oral argument on a later day outweigh the best interests of the public and the parties. The court may not hold oral argument more than 49 days from the date of transmittal of the record because of general congestion of the court calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by any member of the court or any party.

      (c) The court shall set forth in writing a determination to hear oral argument more than 49 days from the date the record is transmitted, together with the reasons for its determination, and shall provide a copy to the parties. The court shall schedule oral argument as soon as practicable thereafter.

      (d) In making a determination under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the court shall consider:

      (A) Whether the case is so unusual or complex, due to the number of parties or the existence of novel questions of law, that 49 days is an unreasonable amount of time for the parties to brief the case and for the court to prepare for oral argument; and

      (B) Whether the failure to hold oral argument at a later date likely would result in a miscarriage of justice.

      (8) Judicial review of an order issued under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 must be confined to the record. The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the board as to any issue of fact.

      (9) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order. The court shall reverse or remand the order only if it finds:

      (a) The order to be unlawful in substance or procedure, but error in procedure is not cause for reversal or remand unless the court finds that substantial rights of the petitioner were prejudiced thereby;

      (b) The order to be unconstitutional; or

      (c) The order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found by the board under ORS 197.835 (2).

      (10) The Court of Appeals shall issue a final order on the petition for judicial review with the greatest possible expediency.

      (11) If the order of the board is remanded by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, the board shall respond to the court’s appellate judgment within 30 days.

      (12) A party must file with the board an undertaking with one or more sureties insuring that the party will pay all costs, disbursements and attorney fees awarded against the party by the Court of Appeals if:

      (a) The party appealed a decision of the board to the Court of Appeals; and

      (b) In making the decision being appealed to the Court of Appeals, the board awarded attorney fees and expenses against that party under ORS 197.830 (15)(b) or (c).

      (13) Upon entry of its final order, the court shall award attorney fees and expenses to a party who:

      (a) Prevails on a claim that an approval condition imposed by a local government on an application for a permit pursuant to ORS 215.416 or 227.175 is unconstitutional under section 18, Article I, Oregon Constitution, or the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; or

      (b) Is entitled to attorney fees under ORS 197.830 (15)(c).

      (14) The undertaking required in subsection (12) of this section must be filed with the board and served on the opposing parties within 10 days after the date the petition was filed with the Court of Appeals. [1983 c.827 §35; 1989 c.515 §1; 1989 c.761 §26; 1995 c.595 §19; 1997 c.733 §1; 1999 c.575 §1; 1999 c.621 §10; 2009 c.25 §1; 2019 c.221 §2]

 

      197.855 Deadline for final court order; exceptions. (1) The Court of Appeals shall issue a final order on a petition for review filed under ORS 197.850 within 91 days after oral argument on the petition.

      (2) The following periods of delay shall be excluded from the 91-day period within which the court must issue a final order on a petition:

      (a) Any period of delay resulting from a motion properly before the court; or

      (b) Any reasonable period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court on the court’s own motion or at the request of one of the parties, if the court granted the continuance on the basis of findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the parties in having a decision within 91 days.

      (3) No period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court under subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be excludable under this section unless the court sets forth, in the record, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the other parties in a decision within the 91 days. The factors the court shall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under subsection (2)(b) of this section in any case are as follows:

      (a) Whether the failure to grant a continuance in the proceeding would be likely to make a continuation of the proceeding impossible or result in a miscarriage of justice; or

      (b) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of parties or the existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate consideration of the issues within the 91-day time limit.

      (4) No continuance under subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be granted because of general congestion of the court calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by any member of the court or any party. [1983 c.827 §35a]

 

      197.860 Stay of proceedings to allow mediation. All parties to an appeal may at any time prior to a final decision by the Court of Appeals under ORS 197.855 stipulate that the appeal proceeding be stayed for any period of time agreeable to the parties and the board or court to allow the parties to enter mediation. Following mediation, the board or the court may, at the request of the parties, dismiss the appeal or remand the decision to the board or the local government with specific instructions for entry of a final decision on remand. If the parties fail to agree to a stipulation for remand or dismissal through mediation within the time the appeal is stayed, the appeal shall proceed with such reasonable extension of appeal deadlines as the board or Court of Appeals considers appropriate. [1989 c.761 §14]
