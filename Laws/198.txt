      (b) In addition to the permanent rate limit for operating taxes, a separate ad valorem tax for bonded indebtedness for capital construction, capital improvement or capital costs, as those terms are defined in ORS 310.140, within the proposed district and the petition is approved by the county board, as presented or as modified, the county shall hold an election on the question of incurring the bonded indebtedness when the election on the question of formation of the district is held. The question on incurring bonded indebtedness may be approved only if electors approve formation of the district, and the ballot measure must clearly state that the bonded indebtedness may be approved only if electors approve formation of the district.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section and ORS 198.815, an order of a boundary commission authorizing a county service district established to provide sewage works to also provide drainage works shall be effective upon the filing of the order with the county board. The order of the boundary commission is subject to referendum by the electors of the county service district in the manner provided for district measures under ORS 255.135 to 255.205. If the order of a boundary commission is referred to the electors, the order does not take effect until the order is approved by a majority of the votes cast on the question and the results of the election are certified. The question in the ballot title for a measure referred under this subsection shall be worded so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to a vote in favor of authorizing the county service district to provide drainage works. [1971 c.727 §26; 1983 c.83 §10; 1983 c.336 §21; 1989 c.92 §6; 1989 c.374 §1; 1997 c.541 §345; 2001 c.707 §1; 2005 c.747 §3; 2013 c.491 §6]

 

      198.813 Formation of county service district for water management services in Washington County; dissolution of existing districts. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 198.810 (3), an order of the county board that approves a petition for formation of a county service district within Washington County to provide water resource management services or ancillary activities may be referred to the electors in the proposed district. An election on the question of forming the district shall be held as provided in ORS 198.815. If an election is called, the order shall not become effective until the order is approved by a majority of the votes cast on the question and the results of the election are certified. The question in the ballot title for a measure referred under this subsection shall be worded so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to a vote in favor of authorizing the formation of a county service district to provide water resource management services and ancillary activities.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 198.705 to 198.955 or 451.620, an order of the county board that approves a petition for formation of a county service district within Washington County to provide water resource management services may also provide for the dissolution of any existing county service district that is situated within the newly established district and that provides any water resource management service that will be provided by the newly established district. Upon the effective date of the order, the existing county service district shall be dissolved and the newly established district shall succeed to all the assets and become charged with all the liabilities, obligations and functions of the former district. [1999 c.759 §3; 2005 c.747 §4]

      198.815 Election on formation; notice; ballot title when dissolution ordered; election of first board. (1) If the required number of written requests for an election are filed with the county board on or before the date of the final hearing or if the petition for formation includes a permanent rate limit for operating taxes for the proposed district, the board shall provide by order for the holding of an election to submit to the electors the question of forming the district. The board shall cause notice of the election to be published by two insertions. If requests for an election are filed by less than the required number of persons and no permanent rate limit for operating taxes is included in the petition, the county board shall dismiss the requests and enter an order creating the district.

      (2) The order calling an election shall fix the date of the election on the next available election date in ORS 255.345 for which the filing deadline can be met. However, when the proposal for formation includes a permanent rate limit for operating taxes for the proposed district, the election shall be held on the date of the next May or November election for which the filing deadline can be met. The order shall also state that at such election members of the district board will be voted for. Candidates to be voted for as members of the first board of a district shall be nominated as provided by ORS chapter 255 and the principal Act of a district.

      (3) The order calling the election shall require the county official in charge of elections to include with the ballot for the election a map or other description of the boundaries of the proposed district using streets and other generally recognized features and a statement of the permanent rate, if any, proposed for the district in the petition for formation under ORS 198.750 (1)(g). Such statement shall comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035. The map or other description and statement required by this subsection shall be supplied by the county board.

      (4)(a) When the proposal for formation includes a permanent rate limit for operating taxes for the proposed district, the ballot title shall clearly indicate that a single question is being proposed which is:

      (A) Whether the proposed district shall be formed; and

      (B) Whether the permanent rate limit specified in the ballot title shall be adopted as the maximum rate of operating taxes for that district.

      (b) The ballot title for the election shall be in compliance with ORS 250.036.

      (5) When the proposal for formation includes a permanent rate limit for the proposed district, the district shall be authorized to impose operating taxes not in excess of the permanent rate limit if the proposal is approved by a majority of the votes cast and the election is held in May or November of any year.

      (6) If a proposed county service district is subject to dissolution unless a determination of public need for continued existence is made, the ballot title shall include the fiscal year in which dissolution will occur and statement that the district will dissolve unless the board of directors determines that there is a public need for continued existence.

(1) After the election if any is held, if it is determined by the county board that the majority of the votes cast were in favor of formation of the district, the board shall enter an order establishing and forming the district. If a majority of the votes cast oppose the formation of the district, the board shall enter an order dismissing the petition. The order shall be entered within 30 days after the date of the election. The county board shall also canvass the votes for members of the district board and, if formation of the district is approved, cause the county clerk to issue certificates of election to the number of persons, equal to the number of board members named in the petition for formation, receiving the highest number of votes.

      (2) After the date of the formation order, the inhabitants of the territory within the district shall be a municipal corporation to be known by the name specified in the order, and as such shall have perpetual succession, and by such name shall exercise and carry out the corporate powers and objects conferred by the principal Act of the district.

      (3) An order creating a district, whether the district is formed with or without an election, shall state the name and purpose of the district, describe its boundaries, and declare the district formed. From the date of the formation order the district shall be considered established. [1971 c.727 §28; 1999 c.759 §4]

 

      198.825 Election of first members of board when no formation election required.

When the formation order is entered, the county board shall order an election held in the district, which election shall be held on the next practicable date under ORS 255.345.

      (2) ORS chapter 255 governs the nomination and election of the first board of a district defined under ORS 255.012 if the district has an elective board. If the district is not defined under ORS 255.012, the returns of the election shall be made to the county clerk. The clerk shall canvass the votes for members of the district board and issue certificates of election to the number of persons, equal to the number of board members named in the petition for formation, receiving the highest number of votes.

      (a) That the owners of all the land within the proposed district have joined in the petition; and

      (b) That, in accordance with the criteria prescribed by ORS 199.462, the area could be benefited by formation of the district.

      (3) If formation is approved, any election required by ORS 198.810 to 198.825 shall be dispensed with. After the hearing on the petition, if the county board approves the petition, it shall enter an order creating the district. If the district board members generally are elected, the persons nominated by the petition and accepting nomination as members of the board shall constitute the first board of the district. [1971 c.727 §30]

The fiscal year in which dissolution will occur, not later than the 10th fiscal year after the date of the order, shall be specified.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided by the principal Act, if any part of the territory subject to formation of a district under this section is within a city, the order shall be accompanied by a certified copy of a resolution of the governing body of the city approving the order.

      (4) A county board that also serves as the governing body of a county service district established to provide sewage works may initiate a proceeding to authorize that county service district to also provide drainage works by adopting an order setting forth the information specified in subsection (1) of this section. The order must be accompanied by resolutions consenting to the additional function that are adopted by the governing bodies of not less than 70 percent of the cities located within the boundaries of the county service district. [1971 c.727 §31; 1987 c.504 §7; 1987 c.510 §1; 1989 c.374 §2; 2005 c.510 §4]

Before the petition is filed with the county board, it shall be approved by indorsement thereon by the board of the affected district and by any other agency also required by the principal Act to indorse or approve the petition.

      (2) ORS 198.800 to 198.820 apply to the proceeding conducted by the county board and the rights, powers and duties of petitioners and other persons having an interest in the proceedings. However, when determining whether to approve an annexation petition filed under this section, the county board, in lieu of the criteria prescribed by ORS 198.805 (1) and 199.462, shall consider the local comprehensive plan for the area and any service agreement executed between a local government and the affected district.

      (3) In lieu of a petition, annexation may be initiated by resolution of the district board or of the county board. Proceedings may also be initiated by any other public agency if authorized by the principal Act.

(1) If the annexation petition is not signed by all the owners of all the lands in the territory proposed to be annexed or is not signed by a majority of the electors registered in the territory proposed to be annexed and by the owners of more than half of the land in the territory and an election is ordered on the proposed annexation as provided by ORS 198.815, the county board shall order an election to be held in the territory and the county board also shall order the board of the affected district to hold an election on the same day, both elections to be held for the purpose of submitting the proposed annexation to the electors. The district board shall certify the results of the election to the county board. The order of annexation shall not be entered by the county board unless a majority of the votes in the territory and a majority of the votes in the district are in favor of the annexation. If a majority of the votes cast in both elections do not favor annexation, the county board by order shall so declare.

      (2) Two or more proposals for annexation of territory may be voted upon at the same time. However, within the district each proposal shall be stated separately on the ballot and voted on separately and, in the territory proposed to be annexed, no proposal for annexing other territory shall appear on the ballot.

      (3) If the annexation petition is signed by all of the owners of all land in the territory proposed to be annexed or is signed by a majority of the electors registered in the territory proposed to be annexed and by the owners of more than half of the land in the territory, an election in the territory and district shall be dispensed with. After the hearing on the petition, if the county board approves the petition as presented or as modified or, if an election is held, if the electors approve the annexation, the county board shall enter an order describing the boundaries of the territory annexed and declaring it annexed to the district.

      (2) When the owner of a parcel of land wants to annex that land to a district, the owner may file an annexation petition with the county board. The petition shall declare that the petition is filed pursuant to this section, state the name of the affected district and all affected counties, indicate the principal Act of the affected district and be signed by the owner of the parcel of land. Before the petition is filed with the county board, the petition must be approved by indorsement thereon by the board of the affected district and by any other agency also required by the principal Act to indorse or approve the petition.

      (3) If a petition filed under this section meets the requirements of this section and is otherwise sufficient under the principal Act, the county board shall set a date for a public hearing on the petition. The hearing shall be held not sooner than 20 days nor later than 50 days after the date on which the petition is filed. Written notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the petitioner and to the board of the affected district.

      (4) At the time stated in the notice described in subsection (3) of this section, the county board shall hold a public hearing to consider the petition. When determining whether to approve the petition, the county board shall consider the local comprehensive plan for the area and any service agreement executed between a local government and the affected district.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the total unlimited taxing power of the district over the area not withdrawn from the district does not wholly satisfy the bonded or other indebtedness incurred prior to the withdrawal, the withdrawn territory shall be taxed in an amount sufficient to satisfy its proportionate share of that indebtedness. [1977 c.663 §3]

 

Note: 198.882 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 198 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

(Merger; Consolidation)

 

      198.885 Merger of districts; effect.

The districts included in the merger shall be considered annexed by and absorbed into the surviving district.

      (2) If the merger is approved, the district boards and officers of the merging districts shall turn over to the board of the surviving district all funds, property, contracts and records of the merging districts. Upon the effective date of the merger:

      (a) The surviving district shall succeed to all the property, contracts, rights and powers of the merging districts, and shall constitute and be a regularly organized district as if originally organized in the manner provided by the principal Act and ORS 198.705 to 198.955;

      (b) Uncollected taxes, assessments or charges levied by the merging districts shall become the property of the surviving district and upon collection shall be credited to the account of the surviving district; and

      (3) Districts providing potable water for domestic consumption, sanitary sewer or surface water quality and quantity purposes under separate principal Acts may merge as provided in this section. The district designated as the surviving district shall have all powers held by the other district under the principal Act of the other district.

      (4) A county service district may merge with another district providing different or similar services as provided in subsection (3) of this section. When the county service district is not the surviving district, the merging entities shall enter into an agreement concerning elected representation on the board of the surviving district. The agreement shall provide that no fewer than two members of the board of the surviving district shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners, acting as the governing body of the county service district, to serve until replaced by individuals elected to the office at the next regular district election.

      (5) Subsections (3) and (4) of this section do not apply to water authorities or sanitary authorities seeking to provide a different water-related service if the entities that seek to merge with the existing water authorities or sanitary authorities are within the urban growth boundary of a city and the city provides water supply, wastewater treatment or surface water management and treatment. When such entities are within the urban growth boundary of a city, the merging entities must:

      (a) Obtain consent for the merger from the city prior to calling an election; or

      (b) Comply with the formation process set forth in ORS 450.600. [1971 c.727 §42; 1983 c.336 §22; 1997 c.590 §1; 2011 c.9 §18]

 

      198.890 Consolidation of districts; effect.

The districts included in the consolidation shall be considered joined into a single new district.

      (2) If the consolidation is approved, the district boards and officers of the consolidating districts shall turn over to the board of the successor district all funds, property, contracts and records of the consolidating districts. Upon the effective date of the consolidation:

The agreement shall provide that no fewer than two members of the board of the successor district shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners, acting as the governing body of the county service district, to serve until replaced by individuals elected to the office at the next regular district election.

      (5) Subsections (3) and (4) of this section do not apply to water authorities or sanitary authorities seeking to provide a different water-related service if the entities that seek to consolidate with the existing water authorities or sanitary authorities are within the urban growth boundary of a city and the city provides water supply, wastewater treatment or surface water management and treatment. When such entities are within the urban growth boundary of a city, the consolidating entities must:

      (a) Obtain consent for the consolidation from the city prior to calling an election; or

The plan may provide for any distribution of indebtedness and may require that the annexing district and any territory annexed, or merging or consolidating districts and any city to be joined to the surviving or successor district, remain solely liable for all or any portion of any indebtedness outstanding at the time of the annexation, merger or consolidation.

      (2) If the merger or consolidation is approved, the district board of the successor or surviving district shall, in accordance with the plan, levy taxes and assessments for the liquidation of any prior existing indebtedness. Such a levy shall be subject to the principal Act of the consolidated or merged district. [1971 c.727 §45; 1983 c.142 §7; 2011 c.369 §4]

 

      198.902 Application of district petition requirements to cities. The procedures and requirements regarding the preparation, circulation and filing of a petition in a district under ORS 198.705 to 198.955 apply to the preparation, circulation and filing of a petition in a city, except that the duties of the secretary of the district board as described in ORS 198.765 and 198.770 shall be performed by the elections officer of the city. The governing body of a city shall perform the duties of the district board in ORS 198.705 to 198.955 in regard to a petition filed with the city. [1983 c.142 §9]

 

      198.903 Joint assembly of governing bodies of affected districts or cities; order for election; contents. (1) When the governing body of each affected district or city has received a petition under ORS 198.895 containing the required number of signatures or has adopted or approved a resolution, the governing body of the affected entity having the largest population according to the most recent federal decennial census shall call a joint assembly of the governing bodies of the affected entities. The governing body calling the joint assembly shall specify the time and place of the assembly. The secretary of the governing body shall give notice of the assembly to each member of the governing body of each affected entity. The notice shall be given by certified mail.

      (2) At the joint assembly, a majority of the members of each governing body constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

      (3) The assembly, by a majority of all members present, shall adopt an order calling an election in each affected entity. The order shall include the matters specified in ORS 198.745.

      (4) The order adopted by the assembly may include a plan for zoning or subdistricting the surviving or successor district for the purpose of nominating or electing members of its board if the principal Act for the district provides for election or representation by zone or subdistrict. The plan must describe the proposed boundaries of the zones or subdistricts. If required by the principal Act, the plan also must include a map of the proposed zone or subdistrict boundaries.

      (5) If the merger or consolidation is initiated by petition and the petition includes a debt distribution plan, the order adopted under this section shall include that plan. [1983 c.142 §10; 1983 c.350 §7b]

 

      198.905 Certification of election results. The governing body of each affected entity shall meet separately not later than the fifth day after receiving from the county clerk the abstract of the votes cast in the entity in an election on consolidation or merger. At the meeting, the governing body of the entity shall determine the result of the election and certify the result to the governing body of each of the affected entities. [1971 c.727 §46; 1983 c.142 §11]

 

      198.910 Joint meeting of governing bodies of merged or consolidated districts and cities; election of board members for surviving or successor district; terms. (1) If the proposal for merger or consolidation is approved by a majority of the votes cast in each affected entity required for approval of the proposal, the governing body of the affected entity with the largest population according to the most recent federal decennial census shall call a joint meeting of the governing bodies of the affected entities. The meeting shall be held at a time and place designated by the governing body calling the meeting, not later than 10 days after the canvass of the vote in the entity last canvassed. The secretary of the entity calling the meeting shall give notice of the time and place of the meeting to each member of the governing body of each affected entity.

      (2) At the joint meeting, a majority of the members of the governing body of each affected entity constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The members so assembled shall from among the members elect a number of persons consistent with the principal Act to serve as board members of the surviving or successor district. The board so elected shall immediately meet and organize as provided by the principal Act and shall by resolution declare the districts merged or consolidated and each affected city joined, as the case may be. From the date of adoption of the resolution the merger or consolidation is complete, and the city territory, together with any territory thereafter annexed to the city, is included in the boundaries of the surviving or successor district and shall be subject to all the liabilities of the district in the same manner and to the same extent as other territory included in the district.

      (3) Of the persons elected under subsection (2) of this section to serve as board members of the surviving or successor district, three shall serve until June 30 following the next regular district election as defined in ORS 255.005 and the remaining members shall serve until June 30 next following the second regular district election.

The terms of office of the members shall be determined by lot. [1971 c.727 §47; 1983 c.142 §12; 1989 c.503 §1; 1993 c.424 §4]

 

      198.912 Apportionment of board members for certain surviving or successor districts. Notwithstanding ORS 198.910, when, at an election on consolidation or merger, a majority of the votes cast in each affected district is in favor of merger or consolidation or when merger or consolidation of districts is approved by a final order of a local government boundary commission, if two or more of the affected districts each have 20 percent or more of the electors or owners of land within the successor or surviving district, then each such affected district shall be represented on the board elected under ORS 198.910 as follows:

      (1) By one member when the percentage of electors or owners of land in the affected district is at least 20 percent but less than 40 percent of the electors or owners of land within the successor or surviving district.

      (2) By two members when the percentage of electors or owners of land in the affected district is at least 40 percent but less than 60 percent of the electors or owners of land within the successor or surviving district.

      (3) By the number of board members remaining after apportionment of board members under subsections (1) and (2) of this section when, among all of the affected districts, the percentage of electors or owners of land in the affected district is the highest percentage of electors or owners of land within the successor or surviving district.

      198.927 Annexation of dissolved district. Upon dissolution of a district pursuant to ORS 198.920, a district that was formed under the same principal Act as the district that was dissolved may annex, pursuant to ORS 198.850 to 198.869, all or any part of the territory of the dissolved district. [2011 c.369 §2]

 

      Note: 198.927 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 198 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      198.930 Plan for dissolution and liquidation. The plan of dissolution and liquidation may include provision for transfer and conveyance of all assets of the district to any other district or, in the case of a county service district, to the county in which the district is located, which has the authority to and agrees to assume the outstanding indebtedness of the dissolving district, if any, and to continue to furnish similar services to the inhabitants of the district. [1971 c.727 §51; 1987 c.504 §8]

 

      198.935 Election on dissolution; consent of creditors; content of notice. (1) When the district to be dissolved is within the jurisdiction of a local government boundary commission, within 10 days after the district board files the plan of dissolution and liquidation required by ORS 198.925, the district board shall file the documents initiating dissolution with the boundary commission in accordance with ORS 199.476.

      (2) Within 10 days after the district board files the plan of dissolution and liquidation required by ORS 198.925, and following boundary commission approval if necessary, the district board shall call an election for the purpose of submitting to the electors of the district the question of whether the district shall be dissolved, its indebtedness liquidated and its assets disposed of in accordance with the plan proposed. The election shall be held on the next available election date in ORS 255.345 for which the filing deadline can be met. No election shall be called until the assent of all known holders of valid indebtedness against the district is obtained or provision is made in the plan for payment of the nonassenting holders. The notice of the election shall contain a brief summary of the plan of dissolution and liquidation and state that the plan of dissolution is available for examination at the office of the county clerk.

      198.940 Dissolution without election. The election required by ORS 198.935 shall be dispensed with and the county board shall declare the district dissolved and proceed in accordance with ORS 198.945, if the county board finds that dissolution is in the interest of the people of the county and:

      (1) The territory within the affected district is uninhabited;

      (2) The district has failed regularly to elect district board members in accordance with the principal Act of the district;

      (3) For a county service district, dissolution is required due to an absence of public need for continuation of the district, as provided in ORS 451.620; or

      (4) For a county service district, the district is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was formed. [1971 c.727 §53; 1987 c.504 §9; 2009 c.496 §1]

 

      198.945 Trustees for dissolved district; records to county clerk; limitation on further elections. (1) Upon canvassing the vote after the election, if it appears that a majority or more of the votes cast approve dissolution, the district board shall declare the district dissolved. The board shall thereupon constitute a board of trustees who shall pay the debts or procure releases thereof and dispose of the property of the district. If the dissolved district was located wholly within the limits of one county, the board of the dissolving district may designate the county board as the board of trustees for the purpose of winding up the affairs of the district. If a majority of the votes cast at the election is against dissolution, the district board shall declare the proposal lost and cause the result of the vote to be made a part of the records of the district. In either case, the results of the election shall be certified to the county board immediately after the canvass of the vote.

      (2) If dissolution is approved, after the affairs of the district have been fully settled, all books and records of the district shall be deposited by the board of trustees in the office of the county clerk of the county. At the same time, the board of trustees shall execute under oath, and file with the county board, a statement that the district has been dissolved and its affairs liquidated. From the date of the statement, the corporate existence of the district is terminated for all purposes.

      (3) If a majority of the votes cast are against dissolution, no further election for dissolution shall be called by the board, upon petition or upon a resolution of the board, prior to the expiration of one year from the date of the election on dissolution. [1971 c.727 §54]

 

      198.950 Power of trustees to convey assets. The board of trustees may convey to another district all assets of the dissolving district as described by ORS 198.930:

      (1) If the other district assumes all debts and obligations of the dissolving district and undertakes to continue to furnish the service provided by the dissolving district pursuant to the plan of dissolution and liquidation; and

      (2) If the consent of all the known holders of valid indebtedness against the district has been obtained, or provision has been made in the plan for payment of the nonassenting holders. [1971 c.727 §55]

 

      198.955 Disposition of assets; rules. (1) Except as provided by ORS 198.950, any surplus funds remaining to the credit of the district, after payment of the indebtedness of the district, shall be turned over to the county treasurer. If the assets of the district are insufficient to pay the indebtedness, the board of trustees shall levy taxes, within the limits of the authority of the district, for the liquidation of such indebtedness.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the property of a district is located within the corporate limits of a city, such property shall, upon dissolution of the district, vest in the city in which located and the property of the district lying outside the corporate limits of any city shall vest in the county until the formation of a city embracing such territory, at which time it shall vest in the city.

      (3) In each year that the county receives surplus funds to the credit of the district under subsection (1) of this section, any funds in the account of the district on June 30, in excess of $6,000 retained by the county for administration, shall be certified to the county assessor and shall be disposed of as provided under one of the following paragraphs, as selected by the county assessor:

      (a) Notwithstanding ORS 310.105, the funds may be offset against that portion of the levies of taxing units levied against the property values of property within the dissolved district. The method of offset shall be further defined by rule of the Department of Revenue. If the funds are offset as provided under this paragraph, the funds shall be distributed to each taxing unit in the amount of that taxing unit’s offset.

      (b) The amount may be credited to each property appearing on the tax roll for the year for which the credit applies within the dissolved district on the basis of current assessed value. If the surplus funds are distributed under this paragraph, the surplus funds shall be deposited in the unsegregated tax collections account established under ORS 311.385 and distributed in the same manner as other funds in that account. The method to be used to credit the amount of the surplus shall be further defined by rule of the Department of Revenue. [1971 c.727 §56; 1989 c.883 §1; 1991 c.459 §343]
