LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOUNDARY COMMISSIONS

 

(Temporary provisions relating to requirements for annexation of certain industrial lands)

 

      Note: Sections 3, 4 and 11, chapter 539, Oregon Laws 2005, provide:

      Sec. 3. Section 4 of this 2005 Act is added to and made a part of ORS 199.410 to 199.534. [2005 c.539 §3]

      Sec. 4. (1) A lot, parcel or tract may not be included in territory proposed to be annexed unless the owner of the lot, parcel or tract gives written consent to the annexation, if the lot, parcel or tract:

      (a) Is zoned for industrial use or designated for industrial use zoning in an acknowledged comprehensive plan;

      (b) Is land on which no electors reside, unless one or more electors living on-site are employed or engaged to provide security services for the industrial user of the land;

      (c) Has an assessed value of more than $2 million, including improvements; and

      (d) Is in unincorporated Jackson County within the urban unincorporated community of White City, west of Oregon Route 62.

      (2) After annexation of a lot, parcel or tract described in subsection (1) of this section, the development rights that apply to the lot, parcel or tract under the industrial zoning classification applicable to the lot, parcel or tract when it is annexed are retained and run with the lot, parcel or tract.

      (3) As used in this section, “urban unincorporated community” means an unincorporated community that:

      (a) Includes at least 150 permanent residential dwelling units;

      (b) Contains a mixture of land uses, including three or more public, commercial or industrial land uses;

      (c) Includes areas served by a community sewer system; and

      (d) Includes areas served by a community water system. [2005 c.539 §4; 2016 c.121 §2]

      Sec. 11. Sections 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, chapter 539, Oregon Laws 2005, are repealed June 30, 2026. [2005 c.539 §11; 2016 c.121 §6]

 

(Generally)

 

      199.410 Policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) A fragmented approach has developed to public services provided by local government. Fragmentation results in duplications in services and resistance to cooperation and is a barrier to planning implementation. Such an approach has limited the orderly development and growth of Oregon’s urban areas to the detriment of the citizens of this state.

      (b) The programs and growth of each unit of local government affect not only that particular unit but also the activities and programs of a variety of other units within each urban area.

      (c) As local programs become increasingly intergovernmental, the state has a responsibility to insure orderly determination and adjustment of local government boundaries to best meet the needs of the people.

      (d) Local comprehensive plans define local land uses but may not specify which units of local government are to provide public services when those services are required.

      (e) Urban population densities and intensive development require a broad spectrum and high level of community services and controls. When areas become urbanized and require the full range of community services, priorities are required regarding the type and levels of services that the residents need and desire. Community service priorities need to be established by weighing the total service needs against the total financial resources available for securing services. Those service priorities are required to reflect local circumstances, conditions and limited financial resources. A single governmental agency, rather than several governmental agencies is in most cases better able to assess the financial resources and therefore is the best mechanism for establishing community service priorities.

      (2) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that each boundary commission establish policies and exercise its powers under this chapter in order to create a governmental structure that promotes efficiency and economy in providing the widest range of necessary services in a manner that encourages and provides planned, well-ordered and efficient development patterns.

      (3) The purposes of ORS 199.410 to 199.534 are to:

      (a) Provide a method for guiding the creation and growth of cities and special service districts in Oregon in order to prevent illogical extensions of local government boundaries and to encourage the reorganization of overlapping governmental agencies;

      (b) Assure adequate quality and quantity of public services and the financial integrity of each unit of local government;

      (c) Provide an impartial forum for the resolution of local government jurisdictional questions;

      (d) Provide that boundary determinations are consistent with acknowledged local comprehensive plans and are, in conformance with statewide planning goals. In making boundary determinations the commission shall first consider the acknowledged comprehensive plan for consistency of its action. Only when the acknowledged local comprehensive plan provides inadequate policy direction shall the commission consider the statewide planning goals. The commission shall consider the timing, phasing and availability of services in making a boundary determination; and

      (e) Reduce the fragmented approach to service delivery by encouraging single agency service delivery over service delivery by several agencies. [1969 c.494 §1; 1981 c.265 §1; 1989 c.92 §8; 1997 c.541 §347]

      (3) To be qualified to serve as a member of a commission, a person must be a resident of the area subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. A person who is an elected or appointed officer or employee of a city, county or district may not serve as a member of a commission.

Any member of the committee may designate a representative who is an officer or employee of the member’s city, county or district to appear and act for that member at any meeting of the committee.

      (2) The advisory committee shall meet as necessary. The advisory committee shall also meet on the call of the commission.

      (3)(a) The committee may review each petition filed with the commission except a petition filed under ORS 199.495. If the committee reviews a petition, it may submit a recommendation on the petition to the boundary commission within 30 days after the petition is filed with the commission.

      199.457 Finances; tax levy by county; donations; service charges; assessments. (1) Any county located within the jurisdiction of a boundary commission may levy taxes and expend funds for the purposes of ORS 199.410 to 199.534.

      (2) A boundary commission may accept any funds, property or services, or the use of any property donated by any person, district, city or county in carrying out the purposes of ORS 199.410 to 199.534.

      (3) A boundary commission, with the approval of the advisory committee appointed under ORS 199.450, may establish and collect reasonable service charges from persons, cities, the county or counties and special districts within its jurisdiction to defray the costs of operating the commission and carrying out the purposes of ORS 199.410 to 199.534. Such charges shall include, but not be limited to, fees for filing a petition or resolution for a boundary change with the commission.

      (4) In addition to any service charges established under subsection (3) of this section, a boundary commission may determine it is necessary to charge cities and counties within its jurisdiction for services and activities carried out under ORS 199.410 to 199.534. If the commission determines that it is necessary to charge cities and counties within its jurisdiction for any fiscal year, the commission shall determine, with the approval of the advisory committee appointed under ORS 199.450, the total amount to be charged and shall assess each city and county with the portion of the total amount as the population of the portion of the city or county within the jurisdiction of the commission bears to the total population of the area within the jurisdiction of the commission. For the purposes of this subsection, the population of a county does not include the population of any city situated within the boundaries of that county.

      (5) In addition to any service charges, established under subsection (3) of this section, a boundary commission may determine it is necessary to charge districts within its jurisdiction for services and activities carried out under ORS 199.410 to 199.534. If the commission determines that it is necessary to charge districts within its jurisdiction for any fiscal year, the commission shall determine, with the approval of the advisory committee appointed under ORS 199.450, the total amount to be charged and shall assess each district with the portion of the total amount as the assessed valuation of the district within the jurisdiction of the commission bears to the total assessed valuation of all districts within the jurisdiction of the commission. However, assessments shall not be made by a boundary commission under this subsection against a highway lighting district organized under ORS chapter 372, a vector control district organized under ORS chapter 452 or a county service district organized under ORS chapter 451 for the purpose of providing street lighting works or vector control.

      (6) For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 1982, the commission shall notify each city, county or district governing body of its intent to levy an assessment under this section and the amount of the assessment for each city, county and district at least 120 days before the beginning of the fiscal year for which the assessment will be made.

      (7) The decision of the commission to assess the cities, counties and districts within its jurisdiction, and the amount of the assessment upon each, shall be binding upon those governmental bodies. Cities, counties and districts shall pay their assessment in equal quarterly payments as the commission may require except that any city or district with a total annual assessment of less than $100 shall pay the total assessment in one installment at the time specified for the second quarterly payment.

      (8) When a city or district located in a county outside the jurisdiction of a boundary commission annexes or otherwise incorporates territory located within the jurisdiction of a boundary commission, the boundary commission shall assess the city or district with the portion of the total amount determined under subsection (4) or (5) of this section as the assessed valuation of the territory of the city or district within the jurisdiction of the boundary commission bears to the total assessed valuation of the entire city or district.

(Jurisdiction; General Procedure)

 

      199.460 Jurisdiction of boundary commission over boundary changes. (1) A boundary commission has jurisdiction of a proceeding to consider a boundary change if any part of the territory included or proposed to be included within the affected city or district is within the jurisdiction of the commission.

      (2) If the territory subject to the proceeding is within the jurisdiction of two or more commissions, the highest assessed value commission shall have primary jurisdiction in the conduct of the proceeding under ORS 199.410 to 199.534, and all other commissions having jurisdiction of the territory shall cooperate in the conduct of the proceeding. On the call of the highest assessed value commission, the commissions shall meet as a joint commission to hold hearings and to adopt a final order in the proceeding. As used in this subsection, “highest assessed value commission” means the commission having jurisdiction of the greatest portion of the taxable assessed valuation of the affected territory. [1969 c.494 §10; 1971 c.462 §6; 1989 c.92 §15; 1997 c.516 §6]

 

      199.461 Study of proposed boundary change or other action; hearing; action by commission; judicial review; notice to public officials. (1) When the boundary commission receives a petition in a boundary change proceeding or an application for any proceeding allowed under ORS 199.464, it shall:

      (a) Cause a study to be made of the proposal.

      (b) Conduct one or more public hearings on the proposal.

      (2) After the study and hearings, the boundary commission may alter the boundaries set out in a petition for formation or a minor boundary change of a city or district or in a petition for consolidation of cities so as either to include or exclude territory. If the commission determines that any land has been improperly omitted from the proposal and that the owner of the land has not appeared at the hearing, in person or by a representative designated in writing, the commission shall continue the hearing on the petition and shall order notice given to the nonappearing owner requiring appearance of the owner before the commission to show cause, if any, why the land should not be included in the proposal. For minor boundary change modifications, notice to nonappearing owners may be given by personal service or by letter sent by first-class mail, at least 10 days prior to the date to which the hearing has been continued. For major boundary change modifications, notice to nonappearing owners may be given by personal service, by letter sent by first-class mail or by a legal advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the area at least 15 days prior to the date to which the hearing has been continued. The required notice may be waived by the nonappearing owner.

      (3) After the study and hearings the boundary commission may alter the application for extraterritorial sewer or water line extensions to include or exclude line and connections thereto, and may alter the application for formation of a privately owned sewer or water system or allocation of territory to a community water supply system to include or exclude territory. If the commission determines that any land has been improperly omitted from a proposal to form a private water or sewer system or allocate territory to a community water system, or that any line or connections have been improperly omitted from a proposal to extend extraterritorially a water or sewer line, and that the owner of the property to be included or to which the line is being extended has not appeared at the hearing, in person or by a representative designated in writing, the commission shall continue the hearing on the proposal and shall order notice given to the nonappearing owner requiring appearance of the owner before the commission to show cause, if any, why the land or line or connection should not be included in the proposal. Notice to nonappearing owners may be given by personal service or by letter sent by first-class mail, at least 10 days prior to the date to which the hearing has been continued. The required notice may be waived by the nonappearing owner.

      (4) On the basis of the study and on the basis of the facts presented at the hearing, the boundary commission shall approve the proposed boundary change or application under ORS 199.464 as presented or as modified by the commission or disapprove the proposed change, by an order stating the reasons for the decision of the commission. Jurisdiction for judicial review of such an order is conferred upon the Court of Appeals. Except as provided in ORS 183.315 (1), any person interested in a boundary change may petition for judicial review of the order under ORS 183.482.

      (5) Immediately after the effective date of a final order entered under subsection (4) of this section and a proclamation declaring a minor boundary change approved if any is entered under ORS 199.505 (3), the commission shall file a copy of the order and proclamation, if any, with the Secretary of State, the Department of Revenue, the assessor and the county clerk of each county in which the affected territory, city or district is located, and the clerk of the affected city or district. If the commission disapproves a minor boundary change, it shall send a copy of the final order to the person who actually filed the petition and to the affected city or district.

      (6) Immediately after the effective date of a final order on an application under ORS 199.464, the commission shall file a copy of the order with the applicant, the Oregon Health Authority, the Department of Environmental Quality and the county planning department. [Formerly 199.475; 1979 c.772 §16; 1981 c.265 §9; 1983 c.336 §6; 1989 c.92 §16; 2009 c.595 §176]

 

      199.462 Standards for review of boundary changes; territory that may not be included in certain boundary changes. (1) In order to carry out the purposes described by ORS 199.410 when reviewing a petition for a boundary change or application under ORS 199.464, a boundary commission shall consider local comprehensive planning for the area, economic, demographic and sociological trends and projections pertinent to the proposal, past and prospective physical development of land that would directly or indirectly be affected by the proposed boundary change or application under ORS 199.464 and the goals adopted under ORS 197.225.

      (2) Subject to any provision to the contrary in the principal Act of the affected district or city and subject to the process of transfer of territory:

      (a) Territory within a city may not be included within or annexed to a district without the consent of the city council;

      (b) Territory within a city may not be included within or annexed to another city; and

      (c) Territory within a district may not be included within or annexed to another district subject to the same principal Act. [Formerly 199.515; 1975 c.361 §2; 1979 c.374 §2; 1981 c.748 §18; 1983 c.336 §7; 1989 c.92 §17]

 

      199.463 Notice; hearing. (1) Notice of a public hearing conducted by a boundary commission under ORS 199.461 shall be published by at least one insertion in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected city, district or territory not more than 25 days nor less than 15 days before the hearing. A second notice may be published either by a second insertion in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected city, district or territory or by letter sent first-class mail addressed to each owner of land in the affected territory not more than 15 days nor less than 8 days before the hearing. The commission may also cause the notice to be posted in not less than three public places within the affected city, district or territory at least 15 days before the hearing. The commission may provide for publication by broadcasting on radio or television stations.

      (2) Notice of a hearing shall describe the proposed boundary change or application under ORS 199.464, state the time and place of the hearing and that any interested person may appear and shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

      (3) A hearing may be adjourned or continued to another time so long as notice of the continued hearing meets the requirements of ORS chapter 193. [Formerly 199.520; 1983 c.336 §8; 1989 c.92 §18]

 

      199.464 Commission approval for exercise of additional district function, to extraterritorially extend district or city sewer or water line or to establish privately owned community water system. (1) Approval or disapproval under this section shall be based on the policy stated in ORS 199.410.

      (2) Without the approval of a boundary commission, a district with territory in the jurisdiction of the commission may not initiate an additional function of the district. Any proposal by a district to initiate an additional function shall be referred immediately to the boundary commission that has jurisdiction of the territory in which the district lies. The district shall take no further action on the proposal unless the commission approves the proposal as proposed or modified.

      (3) Except for lines which provide no extraterritorial service, without the approval of a boundary commission, a city or district with territory in the jurisdiction of the commission shall not extend a water or sewer line extraterritorially to an extent not effected on October 5, 1973. Tentative plans for such extraterritorial extension shall be submitted to the boundary commission that has jurisdiction of the territory in which the extension is proposed. If the commission disapproves the plans, no further action may be taken.

      (4) Except as provided in subsection (5)(d) of this section, within territory subject to the jurisdiction of a boundary commission, no person may establish a community water supply system or a privately owned sewerage system or privately owned disposal system or extend a water line or sewer line without commission approval. Tentative plans for such approval shall be submitted to the boundary commission that has jurisdiction of the territory for which the establishment or extension is proposed. However, extension by a city or district of water lines or sewer lines shall be governed by subsection (3) of this section and the requirements of this section shall not apply to establishment of a city-owned or district-owned community water supply system within its boundaries.

      (5)(a) A community water supply system within the territory subject to the jurisdiction of a commission may apply to the commission for allocation of service territory. If the territory is allocated to a community water supply system, no other community water supply system may serve within the territory without approval of the commission and the approval may not be given so long as the existing system is reliable and has an adequate quality and quantity of water.

      (b) In condemning all or part of the properties and allocated service territory of a private community water supply system through eminent domain, the acquisition price shall be fair market value.

      (c) No part of the acquisition price for all or part of a community water supply system acquired by eminent domain shall be specially assessed against the property within the acquired service territory, or its owners on a special benefit assessment basis.

      (d) A community water supply system to which service territory has been allocated under this subsection may extend or establish water lines within the territory without further approval of the commission.

      (6) Action which under this section requires approval by a boundary commission but is taken without that approval may be enjoined, upon suit in a court of competent jurisdiction, by the boundary commission in whose territorial jurisdiction the action is taken.

      (7) As used in this section:

      (a) “Community water supply system” means a source of water and distribution system whether publicly or privately owned that serves more than three residences or other users where water is provided for public consumption including, but not limited to, a school, farm labor camp, an industrial establishment, a recreational facility, a restaurant, a motel, a mobile home or manufactured dwelling park, or a group care home.

      (b) “Disposal system” is that system described by ORS 468B.005, except for individual subsurface disposal systems.

      (c) “Sewer line” includes every gravity sewer line that is eight inches or more in diameter and all force lines regardless of size, except a line connecting a sewer system with the premises of the user unless the line provides for extraterritorial extension of service.

      (d) “Sewerage system” is that system described by ORS 468B.005.

      (e) “Tentative plans” submitted to the boundary commission for approval shall include:

      (A) For the establishment of a water system or extension of a water line:

      (i) The source of the supply and quantity of water available.

      (ii) The transmission, distribution and storage system size and location.

(Boundary Change Procedure)

 

      199.466 Approval of annexation or extraterritorial extension without study or hearing; conditions; appeal. (1) When filing an annexation petition or application under ORS 199.464 (3) or (4) with a boundary commission, the principal petitioner may request that the petition or application be approved without the study, public hearing and adoption of a final order required under ORS 199.461. If such request is made, the executive officer of the commission, not later than the 15th day after the filing of the petition or application, shall prepare a brief analysis of the petition or application and a recommendation for disposition of the proceeding, and send a copy of the analysis and recommendation to each commission member, to the governing body of each city, county and district with territory affected by the annexation or extension, to the owners of the affected territory and to such other persons as may be required by the commission. If the executive officer fails to prepare the analysis and recommendation by the 15th day after the filing of the petition or application, then the petition or application shall be approved only after the study, public hearing and adoption of the final order required under ORS 199.461.

      (2) If, within 25 days after the filing of an annexation petition or application for an extraterritorial water or sewer line extension, a person or governing body that received a copy of the executive officer’s analysis and recommendation under subsection (1) of this section does not ask in writing for a public hearing on the proceeding under ORS 199.461, the petition or application shall be considered approved by the commission. After such approval, the executive officer of the commission shall send written notification of the approval to the officials and persons described in ORS 199.461 (5) or (6). For an annexation petition, the notification shall contain a legal description and map describing the territory approved for annexation, and for an application under ORS 199.464 (3) or (4), a general description and map of the territory affected by the extension. If a request for a public hearing is received by the commission within the 25-day period after the filing, the commission shall proceed as provided by ORS 199.460 to 199.463 and 199.490 to 199.534.

      (3) Any person, city, county or district may appeal the approval of a petition or tentative plans under this section as provided in ORS 199.461 (4). [1981 c.265 §14; 1983 c.336 §12; 1989 c.92 §20]

 

      199.468 Effective date of application submitted under ORS 199.464. If the boundary commission by its final order approves any application submitted pursuant to ORS 199.464, the application shall be effective at the time specified in the final order except that the effective date shall not be more than one year after the date the final order is adopted. If no effective date is specified in the final order, the order shall take effect on the date the order is adopted. [1983 c.336 §11]

      199.476 When petition for major boundary change required; when economic feasibility statement required; effect of filing petition; effect of appeal. (1) When a major boundary change is initiated by a legally sufficient petition as provided by the principal Act, if the territory subject to the petition is within the jurisdiction of a boundary commission, the filing agency notwithstanding the principal Act, shall file, within 10 days after the petition is filed, a certified copy of the petition with the boundary commission having jurisdiction of the change. If the petition proposes formation, consolidation or merger of a city or district it shall be accompanied by the economic feasibility analysis and an estimate of the tax rate derived from the feasibility analysis that will be required to provide the services or functions of the proposed city or district. The analysis and estimate of the tax rate shall be prepared in cooperation with the county assessor and the Department of Revenue. The analysis shall include among other items a description of the services or functions to be performed or provided by the new unit and an analysis of their relationship to other existing or needed government services. The analysis shall also include a first year line item operating budget and a projected third year line item operating budget.

      (2) The proceeding under the principal Act shall be suspended from the date the petition is filed with the filing agency until the date the commission files a certified copy of its final order with the filing agency. Suspension of the proceeding under this section shall not continue for more than 120 days after the date the commission receives the petition.

      (3) If a final order is not adopted within the 120 days, the petition shall be considered approved by the commission.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, if a final order of a commission is appealed for review by the Court of Appeals and a copy of the petition for judicial review is filed with the filing agency within 60 days after the date on which the final order is issued, the suspension period shall be extended and continue until the petition for judicial review is determined and the results thereof certified to the filing agency.

      (5) A determination by the board of directors of a county service district that there is a public need for the continued existence of the district shall be reviewed as provided in this section. [Formerly 199.465; 1983 c.336 §13; 1987 c.504 §10; 1987 c.882 §10; 1989 c.92 §21]

 

      199.480 Filing of major boundary change order; effect of filing. In a proceeding for a major boundary change, a certified copy of the final order of the boundary commission shall be filed with the filing agency from which the commission received the petition. If the copy is so filed and:

      (a) The city council or county or district board need not call or hold a hearing on the petition and shall not change boundaries as described by the final order of the commission.

      (b) An election on the proposed change, if required under the principal Act, shall be held on the next appropriate election date authorized under the principal Act or under ORS 203.085, 221.230 or 255.345.

      (c) The final order, in a proceeding to merge or to consolidate districts or to dissolve a district and transfer its functions, assets and liabilities to a county service district, shall conclude the proceeding for all purposes; and the merger, consolidation or dissolution and transfer shall take effect on the date the order is adopted or at whatever date the commission specifies in its order which shall not be more than one year after the date the final order is adopted. A merger or consolidation to which this paragraph applies includes but is not limited to a merger or consolidation under ORS 198.705 to 198.955 that provides for joining a city to the surviving or successor district.

      (2) If the commission disapproved the petition, the proceeding shall terminate.

      (3) If the commission determines that a county service district subject to a determination of public need for continued existence shall be dissolved, it shall enter an order so providing and dissolution shall take effect at the end of the fiscal year in which the order of the commission is entered. [1969 c.494 §14; 1971 c.462 §11; 1973 c.664 §4; 1983 c.142 §12a; 1983 c.336 §14; 1987 c.504 §11; 1989 c.92 §22]

      199.485 Commission authority to initiate major boundary change; resolution as petition; content and filing of resolution. (1) A boundary commission may initiate a proceeding for a major boundary change in territory subject to its jurisdiction by adopting and within 10 days thereafter filing with the proper filing agency a resolution proposing the change and by proceeding in accordance with the principal Act of the affected city or district, ORS 199.476, 199.480 and this section. When the resolution is filed with the filing agency, thereafter for all purposes the resolution shall be considered as if it were a petition filed in accordance with the principal Act.

      (2) The resolution shall:

      (a) Identify the affected city or district;

      (b) State the kind of boundary change proposed;

      (c) Contain a legal description of the boundaries of the affected territory;

      (d) If the proposal concerns a district, designate the principal Act of the affected district;

      (e) Have attached a map showing the location of the affected territory; and

      (f) Include whatever additional information the principal Act of the affected city or district authorizes or requires petitioners to include in or with a petition for such a boundary change.

      (3) In proceedings initiated under this section, the filing agency is not required to send a copy of the resolution to the boundary commission, but the commission shall, except in formation proceedings, file a certified copy of the resolution with the affected city or district within five days after the date the resolution is filed with the filing agency, unless the city or district is the filing agency. [1969 c.494 §15; 1971 c.462 §12; 1973 c.664 §5]

 

      199.487 Commission authority to initiate minor boundary change; nonapplicability of certain boundary change procedures; effect of commission action. (1) Within the jurisdiction of a boundary commission, a minor boundary change proceeding may be initiated as provided by ORS 199.490. In addition, a city annexation proceeding may be initiated as provided by ORS 222.750 or 222.840 to 222.915. Minor boundary change proceedings shall be conducted as provided by this section and ORS 199.490 to 199.534.

      (2) ORS 222.111 to 222.180, 222.460 and the statutes of the state that govern annexation of territory to, or withdrawal of territory from, districts do not apply in territory subject to the jurisdiction of a boundary commission. However, a city annexation proposal initiated under ORS 199.490 may include a tax differential proposal authorized by ORS 222.111 (3). Notwithstanding ORS 199.490 (2)(b), 222.173 (1), 222.175 or any other requirement for obtaining consent to annexation, a city or district may use a consent to annexation contained in contracts authorized by ORS 198.869 or 222.115 in formulating annexation proposals or petitions under ORS 198.855, 199.490 (2), 222.125 or 222.170 for properties whose owners have signed such consents to annexation. ORS 222.530 shall not apply in territory subject to the jurisdiction of a boundary commission unless the affected territory constitutes at least 60 percent of the area and 60 percent of the assessed value of the district.

      (3) Notwithstanding any charter or statutory provision to the contrary, a final order or a proclamation of a boundary commission declaring a minor boundary change approved is effective to change the boundary of the city or district without the necessity of any further action by the electors or the governing body of the city or district.

      199.490 Procedure for minor boundary changes or transfers of territory. (1) A proceeding for a minor boundary change other than a transfer of territory may be initiated:

      (a) By resolution of the governing body of the affected city or district;

      (b) By petition signed by 10 percent of the electors registered in the affected territory;

      (c) By petition signed by the owners of at least one-half the land area in the affected territory;

      (d) By resolution of a boundary commission having jurisdiction of the affected territory; or

      (e) When the minor boundary change is a withdrawal of a city from a district, by resolution of the governing body of the city, which shall be an affected city for the purposes of ORS 199.410 to 199.534.

      (2)(a)(A) An annexation proceeding may also be initiated by a resolution adopted by the governing body of the affected city or district upon receiving consent to annex their land in writing from more than half of the owners of land in the territory proposed to be annexed, who also own more than half of the land in the territory proposed to be annexed and of real property therein representing more than half of the assessed value of all real property in the territory proposed to be annexed.

      (B) A resolution adopted by the governing body of the affected city or district upon receiving written consent to annexation from a majority of the electors registered in the territory proposed to be annexed and written consent to the annexation of their land from the owners of more than half the land in the territory proposed to be annexed.

      (b) However, before soliciting statements of consent for the purpose of authorizing an annexation under a proceeding initiated as provided by this subsection, the governing body of the affected city or district shall file a notice of intent to annex with the boundary commission having jurisdiction of the affected territory. The notice of intent to annex shall name the affected city or district and generally describe the boundaries of the territory sought to be annexed, which territory must be contiguous to the city or district or separated from it only by a public right of way or a stream, bay, lake or other body of water. The notice of intent to annex shall have attached to it a county assessor’s cadastral map showing the location of the affected territory that the city or district proposes to annex.

      (c) For the purpose of this subsection, consent need not be obtained for any land in a public way included within or contiguous to the territory proposed to be annexed. However, land in such a public way shall, as determined by the commission, be considered annexed to the affected city or district if the minor boundary change is approved, regardless of the land’s ownership, size or assessed valuation.

      (d) For the purpose of this subsection, consent need not be obtained for any real property that is publicly owned, is the right of way for a public utility, telecommunications utility or railroad or is exempt from ad valorem taxation unless the owner of such property files a statement consenting to or opposing annexation with the legislative body of the annexing city or district on or before the date the city or district adopts the resolution required by paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (e) As used in this subsection, “owner” has the additional meaning given that term in ORS 222.120 (7).

      (3) A transfer of territory proceeding may be initiated:

      (a) By joint resolution of the governing bodies of the affected districts or cities;

      (b) By petition signed by 10 percent of the electors registered in the affected territory;

      (c) By petition signed by the owners of at least one-half the land area in the affected territory; or

      (d) By resolution of a boundary commission having jurisdiction of the affected territory.

      (4) The petition or resolution shall:

      (a) Name the affected city or district and state whether it is proposed to annex, withdraw or transfer territory;

      (b) Describe the boundaries of the affected territory;

      (c) If the proposal concerns a district, designate the applicable principal Act;

      (d) Have attached a county assessor’s cadastral map showing the location of the affected territory; and

      (e) Be filed with the boundary commission having jurisdiction of the affected territory.

      (5) When a city annexation is initiated:

      (a) As provided by ORS 222.750 the petition proposing the annexation shall be filed with the boundary commission having jurisdiction of the annexation.

      (b) As provided by ORS 222.840 to 222.915, the findings adopted by the Director of the Oregon Health Authority under ORS 222.880 shall be considered the initiatory action and a certified copy of the findings shall be filed with the boundary commission having jurisdiction of the annexation, at the same time a copy of the finding is filed with the affected city.

      (6) Except when a boundary change is initiated by an affected city or district under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (5) of this section or by the director as provided by subsection (5)(b) of this section, the boundary commission shall notify the affected city or district that a petition has been filed or that the commission has adopted a resolution. If the petition complies with the requirements of the applicable statutes, the commission shall proceed as provided by ORS 199.460 to 199.463 and 199.490 to 199.519.

      (7) Unless the parties appearing at a hearing for a minor boundary change or application under ORS 199.464 agree to a postponement of the adoption of a final order, a final order approving or disapproving a minor boundary change must be adopted within 90 days after the date the petition, resolution or application is filed with the commission. If a final order approving or disapproving a minor boundary change is not adopted within 90 days after the petition, resolution or application is filed or within the period of postponement, the petition, resolution or application shall be considered approved by the commission. A postponement shall not be for a period exceeding one year from the date the petition, resolution or application initiating the proposal is filed with the commission.

      (2) If objections as required by this section are filed by a city council or district board, the council or board shall call and hold an election in the affected city or district on the boundary change as approved. If objections are filed by the electors, the commission shall certify the fact of the objections to:

      (b) The county board of the county where the territory is located, if the change involves an annexation, whereupon the board shall call an election in the territory. Where a minor boundary change has been initiated pursuant to ORS 199.490 (1)(a), cost of an election required by this paragraph shall be paid by the city or district to which the territory is proposed to be annexed.

      (3) An election required by subsection (2) of this section shall be held on the next appropriate election date authorized under ORS 203.085, 221.230 or 255.345.

      (b) A resolution objecting to the change adopted by the district board, governing body of a city-county or city council of any affected city or district is filed with the commission.

      (2) If an objection is filed by the board of a district, governing body of a city-county or city council of a city which under the final order would lose territory, it shall call and hold an election within its boundaries on whether the territory designated for transfer should be withdrawn from the district or city.

      (3) If an objection is filed by the board of a district or city council of a city which under the final order would acquire the territory, it shall call and hold an election within its boundaries on whether the territory designated for transfer should be annexed to the district or city.

      199.510 Financial effects of transfer or withdrawal; exceptions. (1) After the date of a final order or proclamation of annexation or transfer of territory, the territory annexed or transferred shall become subject to the indebtedness, bonded or otherwise, of the affected city or district acquiring the territory in like manner as the territory within the city or district.

      (2)(a) Subject to ORS 222.465, if the affected territory is to be annexed to a city, and lies within the boundaries of a district, the affected territory is withdrawn from the district on the date of the final order unless the city is part of the district. The city shall have the right to exercise the choice permitted by ORS 222.520 (2).

      (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply when the territory to be annexed lies within a water district organized under ORS chapter 264, a sanitary district organized under ORS 450.005 to 450.245 or a park and recreation district organized under ORS chapter 266. Withdrawal of territory from such a water, sanitary district or park and recreation district shall be governed solely by ORS 222.465 and 222.520 to 222.575.

      (c) When a city receives services from a district and is part of that district, any territory thereafter annexed to the city shall be included in the boundaries of the district and shall be subject to all liabilities of the district in the same manner and to the same extent as other territory included in the district.

      (3) After the date of a final order or proclamation withdrawing or transferring territory from an affected city or district, the territory withdrawn or transferred shall be free from assessments and taxes levied thereafter by the affected city or district losing the territory. However, the withdrawn or transferred territory shall remain subject to any bonded or other indebtedness existing at the time of the order, except as provided by ORS 198.882. If the territory is being withdrawn from a district into a city, the city shall have the right to exercise the choice permitted by ORS 222.520 (2). The proportionate share shall be based on the assessed valuation, according to the assessment roll in the year of the levy, of all the property located within the city or district immediately prior to the withdrawal.

The local government boundary commission shall review the feasibility analysis. On the basis of the review and after consultation with the petitioners, if necessary, the boundary commission shall approve or reject the economic feasibility analysis as presented or approve it as modified by the commission. Approval or rejection of the economic feasibility analysis shall be done by an order stating the reasons for the decision of the commission. Approval or rejection of an economic feasibility analysis filed under this section shall be accomplished not later than 120 days after the feasibility analysis is filed with the boundary commission.

      199.530 [1969 c.494 §22; renumbered 199.455]

 

      199.531 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Since 1985 local governments in boundary commission jurisdictions have undertaken programs involving multiple minor boundary changes, including annexation of territory, which have required the transfer of service delivery obligations from the county or special districts which formerly had jurisdiction of the territory to the annexing city or district, along with the need to receive revenue to support the services;

      (2) The local governments and boundary commissions have acted in good faith reliance on state statutes concerning minor boundary changes and in compliance with those statutes;

      (3) The transfer of service responsibility has resulted in extinguishing or dissolution of special service districts and the transfer of capital equipment and employees;

      (4) If a court or administrative agency determines that one or more of the minor boundary changes are invalid because the statute on which they were based is unconstitutional, responsibility for service and revenue must be resolved in order to avoid substantial disruption to citizens; and

      (5) Providing for legislative annexation of the affected territories is the best method for resolving service responsibility and financial obligations without jeopardizing continued service delivery to citizens in the affected territory or imposing unreasonable financial burdens on the city, county and special service districts and their citizens. [1987 c.818 §2]

 

      199.534 Legislative annexation of territory to cities and districts; effective date; effect on other minor boundary changes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or ORS chapter 222, territory annexed or transferred to a city or district by a minor boundary change approved by a boundary commission’s final order adopted after January 1, 1985, but before July 18, 1987, shall be in the annexing city or district by operation of ORS 198.855, 199.490, 199.531, 199.534, 222.120 and 222.170 to 222.177 commencing upon the effective date of the boundary commission’s final order. The creation by ORS 198.855, 199.490, 199.531, 199.534, 222.120 and 222.170 to 222.177 of annexations shall not void or impair any prior or subsequent minor boundary changes inside or outside of the affected territory.
