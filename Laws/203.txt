      (a) The period of time allowed for payment under the contract does not exceed 30 years; and

      (2) The powers granted to counties by this section are in addition to any other powers possessed by counties in this state, and this section may not be construed to limit such powers. [2003 c.794 §184]

 

      Note: 203.015 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 203 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      203.020 [Repealed by 1979 c.492 §1]

 

      203.030 Definition for ORS 203.030 to 203.075. As used in ORS 203.030 to 203.075, “governing body” means the representative body vested with legislative power by statute or charter. [1973 c.282 §1]

 

      203.035 Power of county governing body or electors over matters of county concern. (1) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, the governing body or the electors of a county may by ordinance exercise authority within the county over matters of county concern, to the fullest extent allowed by Constitutions and laws of the United States and of this state, as fully as if each particular power comprised in that general authority were specifically listed in ORS 203.030 to 203.075.

      (2) The power granted by this section is in addition to other grants of power to counties, shall not be construed to limit or qualify any such grant and shall be liberally construed, to the end that counties have all powers over matters of county concern that it is possible for them to have under the Constitutions and laws of the United States and of this state.

      (3) An ordinance adopted by a county governing body that changes the number or mode of selection of elective county officers shall not take effect unless the ordinance is submitted to and approved by the electors of the county at a primary election, general election or election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of an odd-numbered year. However, an ordinance adopted under this section may not change the mode of selection of a county assessor.

      (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the rights of the electors of a county to propose county ordinances through exercise of the initiative power. [1973 c.282 §2; 1981 c.140 §1; 1985 c.756 §1; 1995 c.712 § 87; 2007 c.155 §12]

[1973 c.282 §4; 1977 c.766 §14]

 

      203.045 Procedure for adopting ordinance; inapplicability to county prescribing procedure by charter or other statutes.

      (b) In case of adoption or ratification by the electors of the county, “The People of (name of county) ordain as follows:”.

      (3) Except as subsections (4) and (5) of this section provide to the contrary, every ordinance of a county governing body shall, before being put upon its final adoption, be read fully and distinctly in open meeting of that body on two days at least 13 days apart.

      (4) Except as subsection (5) of this section provides to the contrary, and except ordinances imposing, or providing exemptions from, taxation, an ordinance necessary to meet an emergency may, upon being read first in full and then by title, be adopted at a single meeting of the governing body by unanimous vote of all its members present, provided they constitute a quorum.

      (5) Any reading required by subsection (3) or (4) of this section may be by title only:

      (a) If no member of the governing body present at the meeting requests that the ordinance be read in full; or

      (b) If, not later than one week before the first reading of the ordinance, a copy of it is provided each member, copies of it are available at the headquarters of the governing body, one copy for each person who requests it, and notice of the availability is given by:

      (A) Written notice posted at the courthouse of the county and two other public places in the county; and

      (B) Publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, designated by the county governing body and published in the county or, if no newspaper is so published, then in one published elsewhere.

      (6) An ordinance adopted after being read by title only may have no legal effect if it differs substantially from its terms as it is thus filed prior to the reading, unless each section incorporating such a difference, as finally amended prior to being adopted by the governing body, is read fully and distinctly in open meeting of that body.

      (7) Upon the final vote on an ordinance, the ayes and nays of the members of the governing body shall be taken and recorded in the record of proceedings of the body.

      (8) Upon the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body in accordance with this section, the chairperson and recording secretary of the body at the session at which the ordinance is adopted shall sign it with the date of its adoption and with their names and titles of office or position.

      (9) An ordinance adopted in accordance with this section, if not an emergency ordinance, shall take effect on the 90th day after the date of its adoption, unless it prescribes a later effective date or is referred to the electors of the county. If an ordinance is referred to the electors, it shall take effect only upon the approval of a majority of those voting on the proposed ordinance. An emergency ordinance may take effect immediately upon the date of its adoption. [1973 c.282 §3; 1975 c.736 §1]

      203.060 Judicial review and invalidation of ordinances. Ordinances adopted under ORS 203.030 to 203.075 shall be subject to judicial review and invalidation on account of unreasonableness, procedural error in adoption, or conflict with paramount state law or constitutional provision.

(1) Subject to ORS 153.025, violation of an ordinance adopted by a county governing body under ORS 203.030 to 203.075 is a Class A violation.

      (2) The violator of a county ordinance may be prosecuted by the county in the name of the county, or be made the defendant in a civil proceeding by the county seeking redress of the violation.

      (3) Every act or thing done, or anything existing within the limits of a county, which is declared by an ordinance of the county adopted under ORS 203.030 to 203.075 to be a nuisance, shall constitute a nuisance and may be regarded as such in all actions, suits and proceedings, unless the ordinance is declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (4) Fines recovered under ORS 203.030 to 203.075 shall be paid to the clerk of the court in which recovery is had. After first deducting court costs in the proceedings, the clerk shall pay the remainder to the treasurer of the county for the general fund of the county.

      (5) Any peace officer, as defined by ORS 161.015, may enforce an ordinance adopted under ORS 203.035. [1973 c.282 §8; 1975 c.736 §4; 1977 c.766 §15; 1999 c.1051 §78a]

 

      203.075 Applicable law for local improvement assessments.

      (c) The local agency may arrange for outreach workers to visit the camping site where a notice has been posted to assess the need for social service assistance in arranging shelter and other assistance.

      (d) All unclaimed personal property shall be given to law enforcement officials whether 24-hour notice is required or not. The property shall be stored for a minimum of 30 days during which it will be reasonably available to any individual claiming ownership. Any personal property that remains unclaimed for 30 days may be disposed of. For purposes of this paragraph, “personal property” means any item that is reasonably recognizable as belonging to a person and that has apparent utility. Items that have no apparent utility or are in an insanitary condition may be immediately discarded upon removal of the homeless individuals from the camping site. Weapons, drug paraphernalia and items that appear to be either stolen or evidence of a crime shall be given to law enforcement officials.

      (e) Following the removal of homeless individuals from a camping site on public property, the law enforcement officials, local agency officials and outreach workers may meet to assess the notice and removal policy, to discuss whether the removals are occurring in a humane and just manner and to determine if any changes are needed in the policy.

      (2) The 24-hour notice required under subsection (1) of this section shall not apply:

      (a) When there are grounds for law enforcement officials to believe that illegal activities other than camping are occurring.

      203.081 Sites not subject to ORS 203.077 to 203.081. As used in ORS 203.077 to 203.081, “camping site” does not include:

      (a) Limit camping space at the institution site to three or fewer vehicles at the same time; and

      (b) Provide campers with access to sanitary facilities, including but not limited to toilet, hand washing and trash disposal facilities. [1999 c.319 §1]

      (b) The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

      (3) An emergency election may be held on a date other than those provided in subsection (1) or (2) of this section if the county governing body by resolution finds that an emergency exists that will require an election sooner than the next available election date to avoid extraordinary hardship to the community. A determination under this subsection as to whether an emergency exists is within the sole discretion of the county governing body.

      (4) A county governing body, with adequate notice, shall hold a public hearing, on a date other than a regularly scheduled meeting, for the purpose of making findings substantiating the fact that an emergency exists before scheduling an election on a date other than those specified in subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

      (A) Whether to enter into an intergovernmental agreement under this section;

      (B) The terms and conditions of an intergovernmental agreement entered into under this section; or

      (C) Any extension or modification of an intergovernmental agreement entered into under this section. [2013 c.753 §3; 2015 c.247 §41]

      Sec. 4. (1) An intergovernmental agreement entered into under section 3 of this 2013 Act must specify the functions or activities to be performed and by what means the functions or activities shall be performed.

      (2) Where applicable and subject to section 3 of this 2013 Act, the intergovernmental agreement shall provide for:

      (a) Apportionment among the parties to the agreement of the responsibility for providing funds to pay for expenses incurred in the performance of the functions or activities.

      (b) Apportionment of fees or other revenue derived from the functions or activities and the manner of accounting for the fees or other revenue.

      (c) The transfer of personnel and the preservation of their employment benefits. [2013 c.753 §4]

(1) A unit of local government that is designated, in an intergovernmental agreement entered into under section 3 of this 2013 Act, to perform functions or activities is vested with all powers, rights and duties relating to those functions and activities that are vested by law in each party to the agreement and its officers and agencies.

      (2) An officer designated in an intergovernmental agreement entered into under section 3 of this 2013 Act to perform duties, functions or activities of two or more public officers shall be considered to be holding one office. [2013 c.753 §5]

      Sec. 6. (1) An intergovernmental entity created by an intergovernmental agreement entered into under section 3 of this 2013 Act may, according to the terms of the agreement, adopt all rules necessary to carry out the intergovernmental entity’s powers and duties under the intergovernmental agreement.

      (2) Except as provided in section 3 (3) of this 2013 Act, the debts, liabilities and obligations of an intergovernmental entity shall be, jointly and severally, the debts, liabilities and obligations of the parties to the intergovernmental agreement that created the intergovernmental entity, unless the agreement specifically provides otherwise.

      (2) A county governing body that elects to impose a tax under this section may do so by adopting an ordinance that establishes the rate and duration of the tax, but in all other respects the tax must be imposed in accordance with ORS 403.200 to 403.230, except that:

[2013 c.753 §8a]

      Sec. 8b. To carry out the purposes of sections 2 to 6 of this 2013 Act, counties within the area covered by the proclamation made pursuant to section 2 of this 2013 Act may impose any other assessment the governing body is lawfully capable of imposing, to the extent the governing body determines that the assessment is necessary to satisfy the county’s funding obligations under section 3 (3)(b) of this 2013 Act.

      Sec. 10. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that providing a coordinated and comprehensive response to a local or regional public safety fiscal emergency is a matter of state concern. The Legislative Assembly also finds that the imposition of a tax or assessment described in section 7, 8 or 8b of this 2013 Act is an integral component of any coordinated and comprehensive response, but the Legislative Assembly further finds that an income tax imposed under section 7 of this 2013 Act may not be imposed if the imposition would contradict a county charter that expressly prohibits a county income tax under any circumstance. [2013 c.753 §10]

      Sec. 14. Sections 1 to 10, chapter 753, Oregon Laws 2013, are repealed on January 2, 2024. [2013 c.753 §14; 2017 c.681 §1]

      (3) All members of the committee must be electors of the county. No member shall be engaged, directly or indirectly, in any business with the county that is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of duties as a member of the committee. An initial appointment, or an appointment to fill a vacancy, is made by delivering to the county clerk written notice of the name and address of the person appointed, signed by the person duly authorized to act for the appointing authority. No member of an appointive authority may serve as a member of such committee. If an appointing authority fails to make such an initial appointment within 60 days after the terms of committee members begin to run as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the county court shall make the appointment within 10 days after the expiration of the 60-day period.

      (4) The terms of committee members run either from the date the county court receives the certification from the county clerk that the petition requesting the appointment of the committee is sufficient or from the date the county court files its resolution requesting appointment of the committee, as the case may be. The terms expire on the day of the election at which the committee’s proposed charter is voted upon or within two years from the date the terms began, whichever is the sooner, unless, in the case where a proposed charter is not submitted at an election held within such two-year period, the county court by resolution filed with the county clerk before the expiration of the terms extends them until the day of the election on the proposed charter or for another two years, whichever is the sooner. Any vacancy occurring on the committee, in a position for which an initial appointment has been made, shall be filled by appointment for the unexpired term by the appointing authority that was entitled to make the initial appointment of the member whose position is vacant or, if such appointing authority fails to make the appointment within 10 days after the vacancy occurs, by the county court.

      (5) Not later than 80 days after the terms of committee members begin to run as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the members of the committee shall meet and organize. A majority of the committee constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. The committee may adopt such rules as it deems necessary for its operation. However, the committee may not prohibit the public from attending any of its meetings. [1959 c.527 §5; 1979 c.748 §2; 2005 c.22 §153]

(1) Notwithstanding ORS 294.305 to 294.565, if the county court is notified of the sufficiency of a petition requesting the appointment of a committee, or if it files its resolution requesting the appointment of a committee, the county, acting through the county court, shall cause to be made available from funds of the county an amount equal at least to one cent per elector of the county or $500, whichever amount is greater, for the purpose of paying the expenses of the committee in the preparation of the charter. Members of the committee shall serve without pay. The committee, within the limit of funds available to it, may employ such persons, or contract for their services, as it may deem necessary to aid it in the performance of its functions. Persons employed by the committee are exempt from civil service. The county, acting through the county court, shall cause to be furnished free of charge to the committee adequate office space and, notwithstanding ORS 294.305 to 294.565, may cause money, in addition to the required minimum amount, to be appropriated for the committee. The committee shall submit to the county court a budget covering estimates of its expenditures. With respect to expenditures in excess of the minimum amount of money required to be made available, the budget as approved or revised and approved by the county court shall represent the authorized limits of the committee’s expenditures. Any balance remaining unexpended shall be transferred to the general fund of the county unless other provisions were made at the time of the appropriation to the committee. The county treasurer is authorized to disburse funds of the committee on its order.

      (2) The committee may conduct interviews and make investigations which to it seem necessary in order to draft a charter; and, to the fullest extent practicable, county officials and employees shall cooperate with the committee and provide it with information, advice and assistance. [1959 c.527 §6]

 

      203.760 Submission of proposed charter to electors after public hearing; approval of conflicting charters. (1) The committee shall submit its proposed charter to the county clerk not later than the 90th day before the election at which the proposed charter is to be voted upon. Before the proposed charter is submitted to the county clerk, the committee shall conduct at least one public hearing thereon. After the proposed charter is submitted to the county clerk, the county clerk shall submit the proposed charter to the district attorney for a ballot title as provided in ORS 250.185 (2). The ballot title is subject to judicial review as provided in ORS 250.195.

      (2) The charter proposed by the committee shall take effect on the day fixed therein if approved by majority vote of the electors of the county voting thereon.

      (3) If two or more conflicting county charters are approved at the same election, the one receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall be adopted. [1959 c.527 §7; 1979 c.190 §404; 1981 c.173 §6]

 

      203.770 Copies of charters and amendments, revisions and repeals; judicial notice. (1) Duplicate certificates shall be made, setting forth the county charter adopted and a statement of its ratification, signed by the officers or members of the body canvassing election returns. One of such certified copies shall be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State, the other shall be kept as a permanent record of the county. All courts shall take judicial notice of either copy.

      (2) This section shall also apply to any amendment, revision or repeal of the county charter. [1959 c.527 §8]

 

      203.780 [1959 c.527 §9; 1963 c.290 §1; 1975 c.766 §2b; repealed by 1979 c.190 §431]
