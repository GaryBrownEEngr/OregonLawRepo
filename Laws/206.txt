DUTIES OF SHERIFF

 

      206.010 General duties of sheriff. The sheriff is the chief executive officer and conservator of the peace of the county. In the execution of the office of sheriff, it is the sheriff’s duty to:

      (1) Arrest and commit to prison all persons who break the peace, or attempt to break it, and all persons guilty of public offenses.

      (2) Defend the county against those who, by riot or otherwise, endanger the public peace or safety.

      (3) Execute the process and orders of the courts of justice or of judicial officers, when delivered to the sheriff for that purpose, according to law.

      (4) Execute all warrants delivered to the sheriff for that purpose by other public officers, according to law.

      (5) Attend, upon call, the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Oregon Tax Court, circuit court, justice court or county court held within the county, and to obey its lawful orders or directions. [Amended by 1985 c.339 §1]

 

      206.015 Qualifications of sheriff; certification as police officer; determination of eligibility to be candidate for election to office of sheriff. (1) A person is not eligible to be a candidate for election or appointment to the office of sheriff unless:

      (a) The person is 21 years of age or older;

      (b) The person has at least four years’ experience as a full-time law enforcement officer or at least two years’ experience as a full-time law enforcement officer with at least two years’ post-high-school education; and

      (c) The person has not been convicted of a felony or of any other crime that would prevent the person from being certified as a police officer under ORS 181A.355 to 181A.670.

      (2) As used in subsection (1) of this section, “two years’ post-high-school education” means four semesters or six quarters of classroom education in a formal course of study undertaken after graduation from high school in any accredited college or university. The term does not include apprenticeship or on-the-job training.

      (3) If the person is not certified as a police officer by the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training at the time of accepting appointment or filing as a candidate, a person elected or appointed to the office of sheriff must obtain the certification not later than one year after taking office. A copy of the certification shall be filed with the county clerk or the county official in charge of elections. The county governing body shall declare the office of sheriff vacant when the person serving as sheriff is not certified as a police officer within one year after taking office.

      (4) The Department of Public Safety Standards and Training, in consultation with the Board on Public Safety Standards and Training, shall establish a procedure for determining whether an individual is eligible under subsection (1) of this section to be a candidate for election to the office of sheriff. A copy of the department’s determination of an individual’s eligibility to be a candidate for election to the office of sheriff shall be filed with the county clerk or county official in charge of elections not later than the 61st day before the date of the election. If the department determines that the individual is not eligible to be a candidate for election to the office of sheriff, the county clerk or county official in charge of elections shall not place the name of the individual on the ballot at the election. [1971 c.299 §1; 1981 c.808 §5; 1987 c.484 §1; 1993 c.493 §87; 1997 c.853 §35]

      206.030 Duty to execute process and make return; taking concealed personal property; use of force. An officer to whom any process, order or paper is delivered shall execute or serve it according to its command or direction, or as required by law, and must make a written return of the execution or service thereof. If a sheriff is directed by a court to take personal property into custody at a specific premises, and the property is concealed in a building or enclosure, the sheriff shall demand its delivery.

      206.060 When sheriff justified in executing process. A sheriff is justified in the execution of process regular on its face, and appearing to have been issued by competent authority, whatever may be the defect in the proceedings in which it was issued.

 

      206.070 Excusing liability of sheriff in execution of process. No direction or authority by a party or the attorney of the party to a sheriff or the officer of the sheriff, in respect to the execution of process or the return thereof, or to any act or omission relating thereto, can be shown to discharge or excuse the sheriff from a liability for neglect or misconduct, unless it is contained in a writing signed by the party to be charged or affected thereby or the attorney of the party.

 

      206.080 Certificate of election or appointment to new sheriff; service on former sheriff. When a new sheriff is elected or appointed, and has qualified, the county clerk shall give the new sheriff a certificate of that fact, under the seal of office of the county clerk. Whenever thereafter the new sheriff is authorized by statute to enter upon the duties of the office, the new sheriff shall serve such certificate upon the former sheriff, from which time the powers of the former sheriff cease, except when otherwise specially provided.

 

      206.090 Delivery of jail, prisoners and process to new sheriff. Within one day after the service of the certificate referred to in ORS 206.080 upon the former sheriff, the former sheriff shall deliver to the successor:

      (1) The jail of the county, with its appurtenances and the property of the county therein.

      (2) The prisoners then confined in the county jail.

The new sheriff shall thereupon acknowledge in writing, upon the assignment, the receipt of the property, process, papers and prisoners therein specified, furnish the former sheriff a certified copy thereof and file the original in the county clerk’s office.

 

      206.110 Return of process by former sheriff; completion of execution of process by successor; duty of successor as to defective or lost deeds. (1) The former sheriff shall return all process, whether before or after judgment, which the former sheriff has fully executed, and the new sheriff and the successor in office shall complete the execution of all final process which the predecessor commenced and did not complete.

      (2) In all cases where real property is sold under execution by any sheriff, and the sheriff fails or neglects during the term of office of the sheriff, by virtue of the expiration thereof, or otherwise, to make or execute a proper sheriff’s deed conveying the property to the purchaser, or if through mistake in its execution, or otherwise, any sheriff’s deed is inoperative, or if by reason of the loss of an unrecorded sheriff’s deed, the purchaser, the heirs or assigns or successors in interest of the purchaser desire the execution of another sheriff’s deed, the sheriff in office at any time after the purchaser is entitled to a deed shall execute such conveyance. When executed to cure or replace a defective or lost deed such conveyance shall be to the grantee in the defective or lost deed, but shall relate back and be deemed to take effect as of the date of the execution of the defective or lost deed so as to inure to the benefit of the heirs and assigns, or other successors in interest, of the grantee named therein. Such conveyance so executed by the sheriff in office shall have the same force and effect as if executed by the sheriff who made the sale. [Amended by 2003 c.576 §395]

 

      206.120 Disposition of money in custody when office vacant. When the official term of office of any sheriff ends by expiration of the term, death, resignation, removal from office or otherwise, the money in the custody of the sheriff by virtue of the office of the sheriff, belonging to the county or litigants, shall be turned over immediately to the successor in office, and duplicate itemized receipts therefor immediately shall be filed with the county treasurer.
