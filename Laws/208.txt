      208.020 Payment, nonpayment and interest on county orders. The county treasurer shall pay all orders of the county clerk when presented, if there is money in the treasury for that purpose, and write on the face of such orders the date of redemption and the signature of the county treasurer. If there are no funds to pay an order when presented, the county treasurer shall indorse thereon “Not paid for want of funds,” and the date of presentment, over the signature of the county treasurer, which shall entitle such order thenceforth to draw legal interest; provided, the county court of any county, sitting for the transaction of county business, may, at any regular term thereof, by order duly made and entered of record, prescribe a rate of interest less than the legal rate, and after a rate of interest less than the legal rate is so prescribed, all orders of the county clerk issued while such orders remain unrevoked shall show upon their face the rate of interest so fixed by the court, which rate they shall bear. Such interest shall cease from the date of notice by publication in some newspaper circulated in the county, to be given by the county treasurer, when the county treasurer has as much as $15,000 belonging to the county fund, that there are funds to redeem the outstanding orders.

 

      208.030 Redemption of county orders. County orders shall be redeemed by the treasurer according to the priority of the time of presentment. Such orders, payable out of the county revenue, shall be received in payment of county taxes without any regard to priority of presentment or number, but the treasurer shall not pay any balance thereon over and above such tax when there are outstanding orders unpaid for want of funds.

 

      208.040 Notation of amount of interest paid. When the county treasurer redeems any order on which interest is due, the county treasurer shall note on such order the amount of interest paid thereon, and shall enter on the account the amount of such interest, distinct from the principal.

The county treasurer shall so arrange and keep the books of the county treasurer that the amount received and paid out, on account of separate and distinct funds, or specific appropriations, shall be exhibited in separate accounts, as well as the whole receipts and expenditures by one general account.

 

      208.080 Inspection of books by county court; exhibit of moneys.
