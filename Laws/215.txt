Evidence proving the existence, continuity, nature and extent of the use for the 10-year period preceding application creates a rebuttable presumption that the use, as proven, lawfully existed at the time the applicable zoning ordinance or regulation was adopted and has continued uninterrupted until the date of application;

      (b) Establishing criteria to determine when a use has been interrupted or abandoned under subsection (7) of this section; or

      (c) Conditioning approval of the alteration of a use in a manner calculated to ensure mitigation of adverse impacts as described in subsection (9) of this section.

      (11) For purposes of verifying a use under subsection (5) of this section, a county may not require an applicant for verification to prove the existence, continuity, nature and extent of the use for a period exceeding 20 years immediately preceding the date of application.

An application for the establishment of a dwelling that has been tentatively approved shall be given final approval by the governing body or its designee upon receipt of evidence that the lot or parcel upon which establishment of the dwelling is proposed has been disqualified for special assessment at value for farm use under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 or other special assessment under ORS 308A.315, 321.257 to 321.390, 321.700 to 321.754 or 321.805 to 321.855 and any additional tax imposed as the result of disqualification has been paid.

      (4) The owner of a lot or parcel upon which the establishment of a dwelling has been tentatively approved as provided by subsection (3) of this section shall, before final approval, simultaneously:

      (a) Notify the county assessor that the lot or parcel is no longer being used as farmland or for other specially assessed uses described in subsection (2) or (3) of this section;

      (b) Request that the county assessor disqualify the lot or parcel from special assessment under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128, 308A.315, 321.257 to 321.390, 321.700 to 321.754 or 321.805 to 321.855; and

      (c) Pay any additional tax imposed upon disqualification from special assessment.

      (5) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a lot or parcel that has been disqualified pursuant to subsection (4) of this section may not requalify for special assessment unless, when combined with another contiguous lot or parcel, it constitutes a qualifying parcel.

      (6)(a) A lot or parcel that has been disqualified pursuant to subsection (4) of this section may requalify for wildlife habitat special assessment under ORS 308A.403 to 308A.430 or conservation easement special assessment under ORS 308A.450 to 308A.465 without satisfying the requirements of subsection (5) of this section.

      (b) Upon disqualification from wildlife habitat special assessment under ORS 308A.430 or disqualification from conservation easement special assessment under ORS 308A.465, the lot or parcel shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (5) of this section.

      (7) When the owner of a lot or parcel upon which the establishment of a dwelling has been tentatively approved notifies the county assessor that the lot or parcel is no longer being used as farmland and requests disqualification of the lot or parcel for special assessment at value for farm use, the county assessor shall:

      (a) Disqualify the lot or parcel for special assessment at value for farm use under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 or other special assessment by removing the special assessment;

      (b) Provide the owner of the lot or parcel with written notice of the disqualification; and

      (c) Impose the additional tax, if any, provided by statute upon disqualification.

      (8) The Department of Consumer and Business Services, a building official, as defined in ORS 455.715 (1), or any other agency or official responsible for the administration and enforcement of the state building code, as defined in ORS 455.010, may not issue a building permit for the construction of a dwelling on a lot or parcel in an exclusive farm use zone without evidence that the owner of the lot or parcel upon which the dwelling is proposed to be constructed has paid the additional tax, if any, imposed by the county assessor under subsection (7)(c) of this section.

      215.240 [Repealed by 1963 c.619 §16]

 

      215.243 Agricultural land use policy. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Open land used for agricultural use is an efficient means of conserving natural resources that constitute an important physical, social, aesthetic and economic asset to all of the people of this state, whether living in rural, urban or metropolitan areas of the state.

      (2) The preservation of a maximum amount of the limited supply of agricultural land is necessary to the conservation of the state’s economic resources and the preservation of such land in large blocks is necessary in maintaining the agricultural economy of the state and for the assurance of adequate, healthful and nutritious food for the people of this state and nation.

      (3) Expansion of urban development into rural areas is a matter of public concern because of the unnecessary increases in costs of community services, conflicts between farm and urban activities and the loss of open space and natural beauty around urban centers occurring as the result of such expansion.

      (4) Exclusive farm use zoning as provided by law, substantially limits alternatives to the use of rural land and, with the importance of rural lands to the public, justifies incentives and privileges offered to encourage owners of rural lands to hold such lands in exclusive farm use zones. [1973 c.503 §1]

 

      215.246 Approval of land application of certain substances; subsequent use of tract of land; consideration of alternatives. (1) The uses allowed under ORS 215.213 (1)(y) and 215.283 (1)(v):

      (a) Require a determination by the Department of Environmental Quality, in conjunction with the department’s review of a license, permit or approval, that the application rates and site management practices for the land application of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids ensure continued agricultural, horticultural or silvicultural production and do not reduce the productivity of the tract.

      (b) Are not subject to other provisions of ORS 215.213 or 215.283 or to the provisions of ORS 215.274, 215.275 or 215.296.

      (2) The use of a tract of land on which the land application of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids has occurred under this section may not be changed to allow a different use unless:

      (a) The tract is included within an acknowledged urban growth boundary;

      (b) The tract is rezoned to a zone other than an exclusive farm use zone;

      (c) The different use of the tract is a farm use as defined in ORS 215.203; or

      (d) The different use of the tract is a use allowed under:

      (A) ORS 215.213 (1)(b), (d) to (f), (i) to (n), (p) to (r), (u), (w) or (x);

      (B) ORS 215.213 (2)(a) to (c), (i), (m) or (p) to (r);

      (C) ORS 215.213 (11);

      (D) ORS 215.283 (1)(b), (d), (e), (h) to (L), (n) to (p), (r), (t) or (u);

      (E) ORS 215.283 (2)(a), (j), (L) or (p) to (s); or

      (F) ORS 215.283 (4).

      (3) When a state agency or a local government makes a land use decision relating to the land application of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids under a license, permit or approval by the Department of Environmental Quality, the applicant shall explain in writing how alternatives identified in public comments on the land use decision were considered and, if the alternatives are not used, explain in writing the reasons for not using the alternatives. The applicant must consider only those alternatives that are identified with sufficient specificity to afford the applicant an adequate opportunity to consider the alternatives. A land use decision relating to the land application of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids may not be reversed or remanded under this subsection unless the applicant failed to consider identified alternatives or to explain in writing the reasons for not using the alternatives.

      (4) The uses allowed under this section include:

      (a) The treatment of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids that occurs as a result of the land application;

      (b) The establishment and use of facilities, including buildings, equipment, aerated and nonaerated water impoundments, pumps and other irrigation equipment, that are accessory to and reasonably necessary for the land application to occur on the subject tract;

      (c) The establishment and use of facilities, including buildings and equipment, that are not on the tract on which the land application occurs for the transport of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids to the tract on which the land application occurs if the facilities are located within:

      (A) A public right of way; or

      (B) Other land if the landowner provides written consent and the owner of the facility complies with ORS 215.275 (4); and

      (d) The transport by vehicle of reclaimed water or agricultural or industrial process water to a tract on which the water will be applied to land.

      (5) Uses not allowed under this section include:

      (a) The establishment and use of facilities, including buildings or equipment, for the treatment of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids other than those treatment facilities related to the treatment that occurs as a result of the land application; or

      (b) The establishment and use of utility facility service lines allowed under ORS 215.213 (1)(x) or 215.283 (1)(u). [2001 c.488 §4; 2009 c.850 §5; 2011 c.567 §8; 2013 c.242 §6]

      215.247 Transport of biosolids to tract of land for application. If biosolids are transported by vehicle to a tract on which the biosolids will be applied to the land under a license, permit or approval issued by the Department of Environmental Quality under ORS 454.695, 459.205, 468B.050, 468B.053 or 468B.055 or in compliance with rules adopted under ORS 468B.095, the transport and the land application are allowed outright, and a state or local government license, permit or approval in connection with the use is not a land use decision. [2001 c.488 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 215.246.

 

      215.249 Division of land for application of biosolids. Notwithstanding ORS 215.263, the governing body of a county or its designee may not approve a proposed division of land in an exclusive farm use zone for the land application of reclaimed water, agricultural or industrial process water or biosolids described in ORS 215.213 (1)(y) or 215.283 (1)(v). [2001 c.488 §6; 2009 c.850 §6]

      215.251 Relationship to other farm uses. Nothing in ORS 215.213 (1)(y), 215.246 to 215.249 or 215.283 (1)(v) affects whether the land application of a substance not described in ORS 215.213 (1)(y), 215.246 to 215.249 or 215.283 (1)(v) is a farm use as defined in ORS 215.203. [2001 c.488 §7; 2003 c.14 §100; 2009 c.850 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 215.246.

 

      215.253 Restrictive local ordinances affecting farm use zones prohibited; exception. (1) No state agency, city, county or political subdivision of this state may exercise any of its powers to enact local laws or ordinances or impose restrictions or regulations affecting any farm use land situated within an exclusive farm use zone established under ORS 215.203 or within an area designated as marginal land under ORS 197.247 (1991 Edition) in a manner that would restrict or regulate farm structures or that would restrict or regulate farming practices if conditions from such practices do not extend into an adopted urban growth boundary in such manner as to interfere with the lands within the urban growth boundary. “Farming practice” as used in this subsection shall have the meaning set out in ORS 30.930.

      (2) Nothing in this section is intended to limit or restrict the lawful exercise by any state agency, city, county or political subdivision of its power to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this state. [1973 c.503 §8; 1983 c.826 §12; 1985 c.565 §31; 1995 c.703 §10]

 

      215.255 Farm product processing facility; conditions. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Biofuel” has the meaning given that term in ORS 315.141.

      (b) “Facility for the processing of farm products” means a facility for:

      (A) Processing farm crops, including the production of biofuel, if at least one-quarter of the farm crops come from the farm operation containing the facility; or

      (B) Slaughtering, processing or selling poultry or poultry products from the farm operation containing the facility and consistent with the licensing exemption for a person under ORS 603.038 (2).

      (c) “Processing area” means the floor area of a building dedicated to farm product processing. “Processing area” does not include the floor area designated for preparation, storage or other farm use.

      (2) A county may allow a facility for the processing of farm products as a permitted use under ORS 215.213 (1)(u) and ORS 215.283 (1)(r) on land zoned for exclusive farm use, only if the facility:

      (a) Uses less than 10,000 square feet for its processing area and complies with all applicable siting standards; or

      (b) Notwithstanding any applicable siting standard, uses less than 2,500 square feet for its processing area.

      (3) A county may not apply siting standards in a manner that prohibits the siting of a facility for the processing of farm products under subsection (2)(a) of this section. [2019 c.410 §2]

      215.262 Legislative findings related to nonfarm dwellings. The Legislative Assembly declares that the creation of small parcels for nonfarm dwellings in exclusive farm use zones introduces potential conflicts into commercial agricultural areas and allows a limited number of nonfarm dwellings in exclusive farm use zones. To protect the state’s land base for commercial agriculture from being divided into multiple parcels for nonfarm dwellings while continuing to allow a limited number of nonfarm dwellings on less productive agricultural land not suitable for farm use, it is necessary to:

      (1) Limit the incremental division of lots or parcels larger than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780 into smaller lots or parcels for the purpose of creating new nonfarm dwellings; and

      (2) Allow a limited number of lots or parcels equal to or less than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780 to be partitioned into not more than two parcels unsuitable for farm use and eligible for siting nonfarm dwellings under ORS 215.284. [2001 c.704 §2; 2003 c.621 §69; 2019 c.262 §2]

 

      Note: 215.262 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 215 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      215.263 Land divisions in exclusive farm use zones; criteria for approval; rules. (1) Any proposed division of land included within an exclusive farm use zone resulting in the creation of one or more parcels of land shall be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the governing body or its designee of the county in which the land is situated. The governing body of a county by ordinance shall require prior review and approval for divisions of land within exclusive farm use zones established within the county.

      (2)(a) The governing body of a county or its designee may approve a proposed division of land to create parcels for farm use as defined in ORS 215.203 if it finds that:

      (A) The proposed division of land is appropriate for the continuation of the existing commercial agricultural enterprise within the area;

      (B) The parcels created by the proposed division are not smaller than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780; or

      (C) A portion of a lot or parcel has been included within an urban growth boundary and redesignated for urban uses under the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plan and the portion of the lot or parcel that remains outside the urban growth boundary and zoned for exclusive farm use is smaller than the minimum lot or parcel size established under ORS 215.780, subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) When a parcel for farm use is created in an exclusive farm use zone under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the partition must occur along the urban growth boundary and:

      (A) If the parcel contains a dwelling, the parcel must be large enough to support continued residential use.

      (B) If the parcel does not contain a dwelling, the parcel:

      (i) Is not eligible for siting a dwelling, except as may be authorized under ORS 195.120;

      (ii) May not be considered in approving or denying an application for siting any other dwelling; and

      (iii) May not be considered in approving a redesignation or rezoning of forestlands under the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations, except for a redesignation or rezoning to allow a public park, open space or other natural resource use.

      (3) The governing body of a county or its designee may approve a proposed division of land in an exclusive farm use zone for nonfarm uses, except dwellings, set out in ORS 215.213 (1)(c) or (2) or 215.283 (1)(c) or (2) if it finds that the parcel for the nonfarm use is not larger than the minimum size necessary for the use. The governing body may establish other criteria as it considers necessary. Land that is divided under this subsection pursuant to ORS 215.213 (1)(c) or 215.283 (1)(c) may not later be rezoned by the county for retail, commercial, industrial or other nonresource use, except as provided under the statewide land use planning goals or under ORS 197.732.

      (4) In western Oregon, as defined in ORS 321.257, but not in the Willamette Valley, as defined in ORS 215.010, the governing body of a county or its designee:

      (a) May approve a division of land in an exclusive farm use zone to create up to two new parcels smaller than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780, each to contain a dwelling not provided in conjunction with farm use if:

      (A) The nonfarm dwellings have been approved under ORS 215.213 (3) or 215.284 (2) or (3);

      (B) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that was lawfully created prior to July 1, 2001;

      (C) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that complies with the minimum size established under ORS 215.780;

      (D) The remainder of the original lot or parcel that does not contain the nonfarm dwellings complies with the minimum size established under ORS 215.780; and

      (E) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are generally unsuitable for the production of farm crops and livestock or merchantable tree species considering the terrain, adverse soil or land conditions, drainage or flooding, vegetation, location and size of the tract. A parcel may not be considered unsuitable based solely on size or location if the parcel can reasonably be put to farm or forest use in conjunction with other land.

      (b) May approve a division of land in an exclusive farm use zone to divide a lot or parcel into two parcels, each to contain one dwelling not provided in conjunction with farm use if:

      (A) The nonfarm dwellings have been approved under ORS 215.284 (2) or (3);

      (B) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that was lawfully created prior to July 1, 2001;

      (C) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that is equal to or smaller than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780 but equal to or larger than 40 acres;

      (D) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are:

      (i) Not capable of producing more than 50 cubic feet per acre per year of wood fiber; and

      (ii) Composed of at least 90 percent Class VI through VIII soils;

      (E) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings do not have established water rights for irrigation; and

      (F) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are generally unsuitable for the production of farm crops and livestock or merchantable tree species considering the terrain, adverse soil or land conditions, drainage or flooding, vegetation, location and size of the tract. A parcel may not be considered unsuitable based solely on size or location if the parcel can reasonably be put to farm or forest use in conjunction with other land.

      (5) In eastern Oregon, as defined in ORS 321.805, the governing body of a county or its designee:

      (a) May approve a division of land in an exclusive farm use zone to create up to two new parcels smaller than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780, each to contain a dwelling not provided in conjunction with farm use if:

      (A) The nonfarm dwellings have been approved under ORS 215.284 (7);

      (B) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that was lawfully created prior to July 1, 2001;

      (C) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that complies with the minimum size established under ORS 215.780;

      (D) The remainder of the original lot or parcel that does not contain the nonfarm dwellings complies with the minimum size established under ORS 215.780; and

      (E) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are generally unsuitable for the production of farm crops and livestock or merchantable tree species considering the terrain, adverse soil or land conditions, drainage or flooding, vegetation, location and size of the tract. A parcel may not be considered unsuitable based solely on size or location if the parcel can reasonably be put to farm or forest use in conjunction with other land.

      (b) May approve a division of land in an exclusive farm use zone to divide a lot or parcel into two parcels, each to contain one dwelling not provided in conjunction with farm use if:

      (A) The nonfarm dwellings have been approved under ORS 215.284 (7);

      (B) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that was lawfully created prior to July 1, 2001;

      (C) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are divided from a lot or parcel that is equal to or smaller than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780 but equal to or larger than 40 acres;

      (D) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are:

      (i) Not capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of wood fiber; and

      (ii) Either composed of at least 90 percent Class VII and VIII soils, or composed of at least 90 percent Class VI through VIII soils and are not capable of producing adequate herbaceous forage for grazing livestock. The Land Conservation and Development Commission, in cooperation with the State Department of Agriculture and other interested persons, may establish by rule objective criteria for identifying units of land that are not capable of producing adequate herbaceous forage for grazing livestock. In developing the criteria, the commission shall use the latest information from the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service and consider costs required to utilize grazing lands that differ in acreage and productivity level;

      (E) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings do not have established water rights for irrigation; and

      (F) The parcels for the nonfarm dwellings are generally unsuitable for the production of farm crops and livestock or merchantable tree species considering the terrain, adverse soil or land conditions, drainage or flooding, vegetation, location and size of the tract. A parcel may not be considered unsuitable based solely on size or location if the parcel can reasonably be put to farm or forest use in conjunction with other land.

      (6) This section does not apply to the creation or sale of cemetery lots, if a cemetery is within the boundaries designated for a farm use zone at the time the zone is established.

      215.273 Applicability to thermal energy power plant siting determinations. Nothing in ORS 215.130, 215.203, 215.213, 215.243, 215.253, 215.263, 215.273, 215.283, 215.284, 308A.050 to 308A.128 and 316.844 is intended to affect the authority of the Energy Facility Siting Council in determining suitable sites for the issuance of site certificates for thermal power plants, as authorized under ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619 and 469.930. [1973 c.503 §16; 1983 c.740 §56; 1983 c.826 §19; 1995 c.79 §76; 1997 c.99 §20; 1999 c.314 §56; 2001 c.672 §18]

 

      215.274 Associated transmission lines necessary for public service; criteria; mitigating impact of facility. (1) As used in this section, “associated transmission line” has the meaning given that term in ORS 469.300.

      (2) An associated transmission line is necessary for public service if an applicant for approval under ORS 215.213 (1)(c)(B) or 215.283 (1)(c)(B) demonstrates to the governing body of a county or its designee that the associated transmission line meets:

      (a) At least one of the requirements listed in subsection (3) of this section; or

      (b) The requirements described in subsection (4) of this section.

      (3) The governing body of a county or its designee shall approve an application under this section if an applicant demonstrates that the entire route of the associated transmission line meets at least one of the following requirements:

      (a) The associated transmission line is not located on high-value farmland, as defined in ORS 195.300, or on arable land;

      (b) The associated transmission line is co-located with an existing transmission line;

      (c) The associated transmission line parallels an existing transmission line corridor with the minimum separation necessary for safety; or

      (d) The associated transmission line is located within an existing right of way for a linear facility, such as a transmission line, road or railroad, that is located above the surface of the ground.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the governing body of a county or its designee shall approve an application under this section if, after an evaluation of reasonable alternatives, the applicant demonstrates that the entire route of the associated transmission line meets, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, two or more of the following factors:

      (A) Technical and engineering feasibility;

      (B) The associated transmission line is locationally dependent because the associated transmission line must cross high-value farmland, as defined in ORS 195.300, or arable land to achieve a reasonably direct route or to meet unique geographical needs that cannot be satisfied on other lands;

      (C) Lack of an available existing right of way for a linear facility, such as a transmission line, road or railroad, that is located above the surface of the ground;

      (D) Public health and safety; or

      (E) Other requirements of state or federal agencies.

      (b) The applicant shall present findings to the governing body of the county or its designee on how the applicant will mitigate and minimize the impacts, if any, of the associated transmission line on surrounding lands devoted to farm use in order to prevent a significant change in accepted farm practices or a significant increase in the cost of farm practices on the surrounding farmland.

      (c) The governing body of a county or its designee may consider costs associated with any of the factors listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection, but consideration of cost may not be the only consideration in determining whether the associated transmission line is necessary for public service. [2013 c.242 §2]

 

      Note: 215.274 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 215 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      215.275 Utility facilities necessary for public service; criteria; rules; mitigating impact of facility. (1) A utility facility established under ORS 215.213 (1)(c)(A) or 215.283 (1)(c)(A) is necessary for public service if the facility must be sited in an exclusive farm use zone in order to provide the service.

      (2) To demonstrate that a utility facility is necessary, an applicant for approval under ORS 215.213 (1)(c)(A) or 215.283 (1)(c)(A) must show that reasonable alternatives have been considered and that the facility must be sited in an exclusive farm use zone due to one or more of the following factors:

      (a) Technical and engineering feasibility;

      (b) The proposed facility is locationally dependent. A utility facility is locationally dependent if it must cross land in one or more areas zoned for exclusive farm use in order to achieve a reasonably direct route or to meet unique geographical needs that cannot be satisfied on other lands;

      (c) Lack of available urban and nonresource lands;

      (d) Availability of existing rights of way;

      (e) Public health and safety; and

      (f) Other requirements of state or federal agencies.

      (3) Costs associated with any of the factors listed in subsection (2) of this section may be considered, but cost alone may not be the only consideration in determining that a utility facility is necessary for public service. Land costs shall not be included when considering alternative locations for substantially similar utility facilities. The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall determine by rule how land costs may be considered when evaluating the siting of utility facilities that are not substantially similar.

      (4) The owner of a utility facility approved under ORS 215.213 (1)(c)(A) or 215.283 (1)(c)(A) shall be responsible for restoring, as nearly as possible, to its former condition any agricultural land and associated improvements that are damaged or otherwise disturbed by the siting, maintenance, repair or reconstruction of the facility. Nothing in this section shall prevent the owner of the utility facility from requiring a bond or other security from a contractor or otherwise imposing on a contractor the responsibility for restoration.

      (5) The governing body of the county or its designee shall impose clear and objective conditions on an application for utility facility siting under ORS 215.213 (1)(c)(A) or 215.283 (1)(c)(A) to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the proposed facility, if any, on surrounding lands devoted to farm use in order to prevent a significant change in accepted farm practices or a significant increase in the cost of farm practices on the surrounding farmlands.

      (6) The provisions of subsections (2) to (5) of this section do not apply to interstate natural gas pipelines and associated facilities authorized by and subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. [1999 c.816 §3; 2009 c.850 §9; 2013 c.242 §5]

      215.276 Required consultation for transmission lines to be located on high-value farmland. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Consult” means to make an effort to contact for purpose of notifying the record owner of the opportunity to meet.

      (b) “High-value farmland” has the meaning given that term in ORS 195.300.

      (c) “Transmission line” means a linear utility facility by which a utility provider transfers the utility product in bulk from a point of origin or generation, or between transfer stations, to the point at which the utility product is transferred to distribution lines for delivery to end users.

      (2) If the criteria described in ORS 215.275 for siting a utility facility on land zoned for exclusive farm use are met for a utility facility that is a transmission line, or if the criteria described in ORS 215.274 for siting an associated transmission line are met, the utility provider shall, after the route is approved by the siting authorities and before construction of the transmission line begins, consult the record owner of high-value farmland in the planned route for the purpose of locating and constructing the transmission line in a manner that minimizes the impact on farming operations on high-value farmland. If the record owner does not respond within two weeks after the first documented effort to consult the record owner, the utility provider shall notify the record owner by certified mail of the opportunity to consult. If the record owner does not respond within two weeks after the certified mail is sent, the utility provider has satisfied the provider’s obligation to consult.

      (3) The requirement to consult under this section is in addition to and not in lieu of any other legally required consultation process. [2009 c.854 §1; 2013 c.242 §7]

 

      Note: 215.276 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 215 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      215.277 Farmworker housing; compliance with agricultural land use policy required. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that the provision of farmworker housing, as defined in ORS 215.278, not allow other types of dwellings not otherwise permitted in exclusive farm use zones and that farmworker housing be consistent with the intent and purposes set forth in ORS 215.243. [1989 c.964 §9; 2001 c.613 §10; 2003 c.588 §14; 2011 c.471 §5]

 

      215.278 Accessory dwellings for farmworkers; rules. (1) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall revise administrative rules regarding dwellings customarily provided in conjunction with farm use to allow, under ORS 215.213 and 215.283, the establishment of accessory dwellings needed to provide opportunities for farmworker housing for individuals primarily engaged in farm use whose assistance in the management of the farm is or will be required by the farm operator on the farm unit.

      (2) As used in this section:

      (a) “Farm unit” means the contiguous and noncontiguous tracts in common ownership used by the farm operator for farm use as defined in ORS 215.203.

      (b) “Farmworker” means an individual who, for an agreed remuneration or rate of pay, performs labor, temporarily or on a continuing basis, for a person in the:

      (A) Production of farm products;

      (B) Planting, cultivating or harvesting of seasonal agricultural crops; or

      (C) Forestation or reforestation of land, including but not limited to planting, transplanting, tubing, precommercial thinning and thinning of trees or seedlings, the clearing, piling and disposal of brush and slash and other related activities.

      (c) “Farmworker housing” means housing:

      (A) Limited to occupancy by farmworkers and their immediate families; and

      (B) No dwelling unit of which is occupied by a relative of the owner or operator of the farmworker housing.

      (d) “Owner” means a person that owns farmworker housing. “Owner” does not mean a person whose interest in the farmworker housing is that of a holder of a security interest in the housing.

      (e) “Relative” means:

      (A) A spouse of the owner or operator; and

      (B) An ancestor, lineal descendant or whole or half sibling of the owner or operator or the spouse of the owner or operator. [2001 c.613 §6; 2011 c.471 §6]

      215.279 Farm income standard for dwelling in conjunction with farm use. In any rule adopted by the Land Conservation and Development Commission that establishes a farm income standard to determine whether a dwelling is customarily provided in conjunction with farm use on a tract, the commission shall allow a farm operator to satisfy the income standard by earning the required amount or more of farm income on the tract:

      (1) In at least three of the last five years;

      (2) In each of the last two years; or

      (3) Based on the average farm income earned on the tract in the best three of the last five years. [2011 c.459 §1]

 

      Note: 215.279 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 215 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      Sec. 1. Section 2 of this 2019 Act is added to and made a part of ORS chapter 215. [2019 c.307 §1]

      Sec. 2. (1) Notwithstanding any farm income standard adopted under ORS 215.279, a county shall approve a primary dwelling customarily provided in conjunction with farm use under ORS 215.213 (1)(f) or 215.283 (1)(e), if:

      (a) The tract on which the dwelling will be established is currently employed for farm use involving the raising and harvesting of cranberries;

      (b) The tract on which the dwelling will be established is considered to be high-value farmland on the basis that the tract is growing a specified perennial under ORS 215.710 (2) but the tract is not considered to be high-value farmland on the basis of soil composition under ORS 215.710 (1);

      (c) Except for seasonal farmworker housing approved prior to 2001, there is no other dwelling on lands zoned for exclusive farm use or for farm and forest use owned by the farm operator or on the farm operation;

      (d) The operator of the farm on the tract earned at least $40,000 in gross annual income from the sale of cranberries or cranberry products as described in ORS 215.279, excluding any income:

      (A) From land leased or rented; or

      (B) Used to qualify another lot or parcel for the construction or siting of a primary dwelling customarily provided in conjunction with farm use; and

      (e) As a condition of approval of the new dwelling, in addition to the requirements of ORS 215.293, the property owner agrees to sign and record in the deed records for the county in which the parcel is located, one or more instruments containing irrevocable deed restrictions, enforceable by the county, that prohibit the owner and the owner’s successors from using the dwelling as a rental dwelling unit as defined in ORS 90.100.

      (2) Subsection (1)(b) of this section may not be interpreted to change land use decisions, or determinations, of high-value farmland for any other purpose. [2019 c.307 §2]

      215.280 [Repealed by 1963 c.619 §16]

 

      215.281 Legislative findings related to dwellings in conjunction with commercial dairy farm. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Dairies and dairying are an important part of Oregon agriculture and make a significant contribution to the state and local economies;

      (2) Dairies require continuous on-site labor to operate the dairy and to protect the significant investment in milking and waste disposal facilities, equipment and livestock necessary to operate a commercial dairy; and

      (3) Dairies require more on-site housing than other types of farms because of the year-round labor-intensive nature of a dairy operation and justify different standards for the review of a primary or accessory dwelling customarily provided in conjunction with a commercial dairy farm under ORS 215.213 and 215.283. [2001 c.149 §4]

 

      Note: 215.281 and 215.282 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 215 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      215.282 Dwellings in conjunction with commercial dairy farm; rules. The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall consider the findings of ORS 215.281 and adopt rules that provide standards for the review of a primary or accessory dwelling customarily provided in conjunction with a commercial dairy farm. Notwithstanding any other administrative rule establishing a gross farm income standard, the rules adopted under this section shall allow the siting of a dwelling on a commercial dairy farm prior to the dairy earning any gross farm income. [2001 c.149 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 215.281.

      (B) A significant safety conflict with existing public airports due to bird attractants; or

      (C) A significant health or safety conflict with existing residential uses within the boundaries of the impact area of the proposed use; and

      (b) The county determines that the conflict identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection cannot be minimized through the imposition of reasonable and practicable mitigation measures as conditions of approval.

      (6) For purposes of a county determination described in subsection (5) of this section, the county shall determine the impact area of the proposed use. [1989 c.861 §7; 2017 c.736 §1]

 

      215.299 Policy on mining resource lands. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The extraction of aggregate, other minerals and other subsurface resources is an essential contribution to Oregon’s economic well-being.

      (b) Oregon has an economic and social interest in locating and providing affordable aggregate, other minerals and other subsurface resources in close proximity to the end user of the materials.

      (c) Oregon has an interest in balancing competing land use demands for lands identified as farmlands or forestlands in a manner that protects the economic viability of mining and other resource uses.

      (d) To balance competing resource uses, Oregon has an interest in providing significant volumes of high-quality aggregate, other minerals and other subsurface resources that are critical to building Oregon’s communities and infrastructure while preserving farmland for agricultural production.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that:

      (a) High-value farmland composed predominantly of Class I and Class II soils in the Willamette Valley should not be available for mining unless there is a significant volume of high-quality aggregate and other minerals and other subsurface resources available for extraction.

      (b) State agencies and local governments should balance competing resource uses and not restrict the removal of the full depth of aggregate unless public health and safety concerns necessitate the restriction of mining activity. [2013 c.706 §1]

FARMLAND AND FORESTLAND ZONES

 

(Lot or Parcel of Record Dwellings)

 

      215.700 Resource land dwelling policy. The Legislative Assembly declares that land use regulations limit residential development on some less productive resource land acquired before the owners could reasonably be expected to know of the regulations. In order to assist these owners while protecting the state’s more productive resource land from the detrimental effects of uses not related to agriculture and forestry, it is necessary to:

      (1) Provide certain owners of less productive land an opportunity to build a dwelling on their land; and

      (2) Limit the future division of and the siting of dwellings upon the state’s more productive resource land. [1993 c.792 §10]

      (f) When the lot or parcel on which the dwelling will be sited lies within an area designated in an acknowledged comprehensive plan as habitat of big game, the siting of the dwelling is consistent with the limitations on density upon which the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations intended to protect the habitat are based.

      (g) When the lot or parcel on which the dwelling will be sited is part of a tract, the remaining portions of the tract are consolidated into a single lot or parcel when the dwelling is allowed.

      (2)(a) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (1)(d) of this section, a single-family dwelling not in conjunction with farm use may be sited on high-value farmland if:

      (B) The lot or parcel is protected as high-value farmland as described under ORS 215.710 (1); and

      (C) A hearings officer of a county determines that:

      (ii) The dwelling will comply with the provisions of ORS 215.296 (1).

      (iii) The dwelling will not materially alter the stability of the overall land use pattern in the area.

      (b) A local government shall provide notice of all applications for dwellings allowed under this subsection to the State Department of Agriculture. Notice shall be provided in accordance with the governing body’s land use regulations but shall be mailed at least 20 calendar days prior to the public hearing before the hearings officer under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (3) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (1)(d) of this section, a single-family dwelling not in conjunction with farm use may be sited on high-value farmland if:

      (a) It meets the other requirements of ORS 215.705 to 215.750.

      (b) The tract on which the dwelling will be sited is:

      (A) Identified in ORS 215.710 (3) or (4);

      (B) Not protected under ORS 215.710 (1); and

      (5) A county may, by application of criteria adopted by ordinance, deny approval of a dwelling allowed under this section in any area where the county determines that approval of the dwelling would:

      (a) Exceed the facilities and service capabilities of the area;

      (b) Materially alter the stability of the overall land use pattern in the area; or

      (c) Create conditions or circumstances that the county determines would be contrary to the purposes or intent of its acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulations.

      (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a) of this section, “owner” includes the spouses in a marriage, son, daughter, parent, brother, brother-in-law, sister, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, parent-in-law, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent or grandchild of the owner or a business entity owned by any one or combination of these family members.

      215.783 Land division to preserve open space or park; qualification for special assessment. (1) The governing body of a county or its designee may approve a proposed division by partition of land in a forest zone or a mixed farm and forest zone to create one new parcel if the proposed division of land is for the purpose of allowing a provider of public parks or open space, or a not-for-profit land conservation organization, to purchase one of the resulting parcels as provided in this section.

      (2) A parcel created by the land division that is not sold to a provider of public parks or open space or to a not-for-profit land conservation organization must comply with the following:

      (4) If a proposed division of land under this section results in the disqualification of a parcel for a special assessment described in ORS 308A.718 or the withdrawal of a parcel from designation as riparian habitat under ORS 308A.365, the owner must pay additional taxes as provided under ORS 308A.371 or 308A.700 to 308A.733 before the county may approve the division. [2007 c.143 §2; 2015 c.104 §7]

 

      215.785 Exception to minimum lot or parcel sizes. (1) As used in this section, notwithstanding ORS 215.010, “parcel” has the meaning given that term in ORS 92.010.

      (2) Notwithstanding the minimum lot or parcel size established under ORS 215.780 (1), when a portion of a lawfully established unit of land has been included within an urban growth boundary and redesignated for urban uses under the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plan and the portion of the lawfully established unit of land that remains outside the urban growth boundary and zoned for forest uses or mixed farm and forest uses is smaller than the minimum size established under ORS 215.780 (1), the governing body of a county, or its designee, may approve a proposed division by partition of the land, including the land that remains in a forest zone or a mixed farm and forest zone.

      (3) The parcel created in the forest zone or mixed farm and forest zone must be partitioned along the urban growth boundary and:

      (a) If the parcel contains a dwelling, the parcel must be large enough to support continued residential use.

      (b) If the parcel does not contain a dwelling, the parcel:

      (A) Is not eligible for siting a dwelling, except as may be authorized under ORS 195.120;

      (B) May not be considered in approving or denying an application for siting any other dwelling; and

      (4) In approving a land division under this section, the governing body of the county or its designee shall require as a condition of approval that the owner of a parcel not containing a dwelling sign and record in the deed records for the county in which the parcel is located an irrevocable deed restriction prohibiting the owner and the owner’s successors in interest from pursuing a cause of action or claim of relief alleging an injury from farming or forest practices for which a claim or action is not allowed under ORS 30.936 or 30.937. [2015 c.104 §3]

 

(Review of Lands Zoned for Farm and Forest Use)

 

      215.788 Legislative review of lands zoned for farm and forest use; criteria. (1) For the purposes of correcting mapping errors made in the acknowledgment process and updating the designation of farmlands and forestlands for land use planning, a county may conduct a legislative review of lands in the county to determine whether the lands planned and zoned for farm use, forest use or mixed farm and forest use are consistent with the definitions of “agricultural lands” or “forest lands” in goals relating to agricultural lands or forestlands.

      (2) A county may undertake the reacknowledgment process authorized by this section only if the Department of Land Conservation and Development approves a work plan, from the county, describing the expected scope of reacknowledgment. The department may condition approval of a work plan for reacknowledgment under this section to reflect the resources needed to complete the review required by ORS 197.659 and 215.794. The work plan of the county and the approval of the department are not final orders for purposes of review.

      (3) A county that undertakes the reacknowledgment process authorized by this section shall provide an opportunity for all lands planned for farm use, forest use or mixed farm and forest use and all lands subject to an exception under ORS 197.732 to a goal relating to agricultural lands or forestlands to be included in the review.

      (4) A county must plan and zone land reviewed under this section:

      (a) For farm use if the land meets the definition of “agricultural land” in a goal relating to agricultural lands;

      (b) For forest use if the land meets the definition of “forest land” used for comprehensive plan amendments in the goal relating to forestlands;

      (c) For mixed farm and forest use if the land meets both definitions;

      (d) For nonresource use, consistent with ORS 215.794, if the land does not meet either definition; or

      (e) For a use other than farm use or forest use as provided in a goal relating to land use planning process and policy framework and subject to an exception to the appropriate goals under ORS 197.732 (2).

      (5) A county may consider the current land use pattern on adjacent and nearby lands in determining whether land meets the appropriate definition. [2009 c.873 §5]

 

      Note: 215.788 to 215.794 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 215 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      215.791 Review of nonresource lands for ecological significance; inventory and protection of ecologically significant nonresource lands; criteria. (1) If a county amends its comprehensive plan or a land use regulation mapping zoning designations under ORS 215.788 to 215.794, the county shall review lands that are planned or rezoned as nonresource lands to determine whether the lands contain ecologically significant natural areas or resources. The county shall consider appropriate goals and the “Oregon Conservation Strategy” prepared in September of 2006 by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

      (2) The county shall maintain an inventory in the comprehensive plan of nonresource lands that contain ecologically significant natural areas or resources and establish a program to protect the areas or resources from the adverse effects of new uses allowed by the planning or zoning changes. The county may use nonregulatory programs to protect the resources including, but not limited to, programs for the transfer of severable development interests to other lands that do not contain ecologically significant resources.

      (3) If a county amends its comprehensive plan or a land use regulation mapping zoning designations under ORS 215.788 to 215.794, the county shall review lands that are planned or rezoned as nonresource lands to determine that the uses allowed by the planning or zoning changes are consistent with the carrying capacity of the lands. The county shall ensure that:

      (a) The amount, type, location and pattern of development on lands redesignated as nonresource lands:

      (A) Will be rural in character and will not significantly interfere with orderly and efficient development of urban areas in the vicinity;

      (B) Will not significantly conflict with existing or reasonably foreseeable farm or forest uses or with accepted farm or forest practices; and

      (C) Will not lead to significant adverse effects including, but not limited to, adverse effects on:

      (i) Water quality or the availability or cost of water supply;

      (ii) Energy use;

      (iii) State or local transportation facilities;

      (iv) Fish or wildlife habitat or other ecologically significant lands;

      (v) The risk of wildland fire or the cost of fire suppression;

      (vi) The cost of public facilities or services; or

      (vii) The fiscal health of a local government.

      (b) Additional residential development on nonresource lands is, to the extent practicable, located and clustered to:

      (A) Minimize the effects on farm and forest uses;

      (B) Avoid lands subject to natural hazards; and

      (C) Reduce the costs of public facilities and services. [2009 c.873 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 215.788.

 

      215.794 Review of county rezoning designations; rules. (1) A county shall submit decisions on planning and rezoning designations under ORS 215.788 to 215.794 to the Department of Land Conservation and Development for review pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section and ORS 197.659.

      (2) The department shall coordinate with:

      (a) The State Department of Agriculture in reviewing decisions on planning and rezoning designations for lands planned for farm use or mixed farm and forest use.

      (b) The State Forestry Department in reviewing decisions on planning and rezoning designations for lands planned for forest use or mixed farm and forest use.

      (3) The Land Conservation and Development Commission has exclusive jurisdiction for review of a county’s decision made under ORS 215.788 to 215.794.

      (4) A person who participated in the proceedings leading to the county’s decisions under ORS 215.788 to 215.794 may not raise an issue on review before the commission that was not raised in the local proceedings.

      (5) The commission may adopt rules implementing ORS 215.788 to 215.794. [2009 c.873 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 215.788.

 

WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANNING

 

      215.799 Location of dwellings on wildlife habitat land. (1) New and existing dwellings may be allowed on a lot or parcel subject to wildlife habitat special assessment under ORS 308A.403 to 308A.430 as follows:

      (a) Lawfully existing dwellings, pursuant to ORS 215.130 (5) to (11), may remain.

      (b) For a lot or parcel without an existing dwelling, dwellings may be allowed if each dwelling for which the landowner seeks approval complies with all applicable requirements under the county’s acknowledged zoning ordinance.

      (2) The fact that a lot or parcel is subject to wildlife habitat special assessment may not make it easier or more difficult for a landowner to obtain approval for a dwelling on the lot or parcel. [2003 c.539 §14; 2005 c.94 §1]

 

      Note: 215.799 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 215 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
