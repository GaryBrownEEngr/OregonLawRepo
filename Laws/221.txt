      Sec. 5. Section 6 of this 2005 Act is added to and made a part of ORS 221.020 to 221.100. [2005 c.539 §5]

      Sec. 6. (1) A lot, parcel or tract may not be included in unincorporated territory proposed to be incorporated as a city unless the owner of the lot, parcel or tract gives written consent to the incorporation, if the lot, parcel or tract:

      (a) Is zoned for industrial use or designated for industrial use zoning in an acknowledged comprehensive plan;

      (b) Is land on which no electors reside, unless one or more electors living on-site are employed or engaged to provide security services for the industrial user of the land;

      (c) Has an assessed value of more than $2 million, including improvements; and

      (d) Is in unincorporated Jackson County within the urban unincorporated community of White City, west of Oregon Route 62.

      (2) After incorporation of a city that includes a lot, parcel or tract described in subsection (1) of this section, the development rights that apply to the lot, parcel or tract under the industrial zoning classification applicable to the lot, parcel or tract when the city is incorporated are retained and run with the lot, parcel or tract.

      (3) As used in this section, “urban unincorporated community” means an unincorporated community that:

      (a) Includes at least 150 permanent residential dwelling units;

      (b) Contains a mixture of land uses, including three or more public, commercial or industrial land uses;

      (c) Includes areas served by a community sewer system; and

      Sec. 11. Sections 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, chapter 539, Oregon Laws 2005, are repealed June 30, 2026. [2005 c.539 §11; 2016 c.121 §6]

 

      221.005 Legislative findings; policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that the provisions of ORS 199.476, 221.031, 221.040, 221.061, 221.106, 221.735 and this section are necessary to provide for the orderly incorporation of territory adjoining existing cities. However, the Legislative Assembly does not intend that the incorporation of such territory affect the authority of special districts to enter into agreements with cities newly incorporated under ORS 199.476, 221.031, 221.040, 221.061, 221.106, 221.735 and this section for the performance of functions, services and activities by the district within the boundaries of the city. [1981 c.890 §1]

 

      Note: 221.005 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 221 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      221.010 Definitions for ORS 221.020 to 221.100. As used in ORS 221.020 to 221.100, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (2) “City,” except in the term “incorporated city” in ORS 221.020, means a city incorporated under ORS 221.020 to 221.100 or proposed to be incorporated.

      (3) “Population” means a city’s population as shown by the latest annual estimate made pursuant to ORS 190.520.

      221.020 Authority to incorporate. The people of an area, no part of which lies in an incorporated city and in which 150 persons reside, may incorporate a city by approving at an election called and held according to ORS 221.031 to 221.061 a proposition provided by those sections for incorporating the city.

      221.030 [Amended by 1965 c.579 §2; 1973 c.432 §2; repealed by 1981 c.890 §2 (221.031 enacted in lieu of 221.030)]

The county clerk shall retain the prospective petition and economic feasibility statement and shall immediately send two copies of the prospective petition to the appropriate county court.

      (3)(a) A petition for incorporation filed with the county clerk under subsection (1) of this section shall designate the name and residence address of not more than three persons as chief petitioners, who shall be electors registered within the boundaries of the proposed city.

      (b) The petition shall contain the name of the proposed city.

The tax rate limit shall be calculated for the latest tax year for which the assessed value of the proposed city is available.

      (d) There shall be attached to the cover sheet of the petition a map indicating the exterior boundaries of the proposed city. The map shall not exceed 14 inches by 17 inches in size and shall be used in lieu of a metes and bounds or legal description of the proposed city.

      (e) If the territory proposed to be incorporated is within the jurisdiction of a local government boundary commission, the petition shall be accompanied by the economic feasibility analysis required under ORS 199.476 (1).

If the territory proposed to be incorporated is within the jurisdiction of a local government boundary commission, each signature sheet shall contain a statement that the economic feasibility analysis for the proposed city was approved by the boundary commission, that the analysis is available for inspection at the offices of the boundary commission and that subsequent to the gathering of the petitions the boundary commission must review and finally approve the proposal prior to submission at an election. [1981 c.890 §3 (enacted in lieu of 221.030); 1983 c.83 §17; 1987 c.882 §12; 1989 c.92 §29; 1997 c.541 §351; 1999 c.318 §22; 2005 c.396 §1; 2007 c.669 §3; 2007 c.848 §21; 2010 c.41 §2]

 

      221.032 Annexation during pendency of incorporation. After a person files a petition for incorporation under ORS 221.031, a city or district may not commence annexation proceedings for any part of the area that is included in the boundaries of the area proposed to be incorporated until after a county court removes that part of the area from within the boundaries of the proposed city or the later of the following:

      (1) The county court rejects the petition; or

      (2) The voters do not approve the question of incorporation at an election called by the county court. [2007 c.669 §2]

 

      221.034 Incorporation of rural unincorporated community and contiguous lands. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Neighboring city” means a city that has any part of its territory situated within three miles of the area proposed to be incorporated.

      (b) “Rural unincorporated community” means a settlement with a boundary identified in an acknowledged comprehensive plan of a county and that:

      (A) Is made up primarily of lands subject to an exception to statewide planning goals related to agricultural lands or forestlands;

      (B) Either was identified in the acknowledged comprehensive plan of a county as a “rural community,” “service center,” “rural center,” “resort community” or similar term before October 28, 1994, or is listed in the Department of Land Conservation and Development’s “Survey of Oregon Unincorporated Communities” (January 30, 1997);

      (C) Lies outside the urban growth boundary of a city or a metropolitan service district; and

      (c) “Urban reserve” has the meaning given that term in ORS 195.137.

      (d) “Urban services” has the meaning given that term in ORS 195.065.

      (2) When any of the area proposed to be incorporated as a city lies within an urbanized area, but outside the urban growth boundary of a city or a metropolitan service district:

      (a) The area proposed to be incorporated must also be located entirely within a designated rural unincorporated community and contiguous lands subject to an exception to statewide planning goals related to agricultural lands or forestlands.

      (b) The petition required by ORS 221.031 must be accompanied by an affidavit, signed by a chief petitioner, stating that:

      (A) Ten percent of the electors registered within the area proposed for incorporation favor the incorporation; and

      (B) The chief petitioners have engaged the neighboring cities in discussions concerning the effects of the proposed incorporation, including discussions specifically relating to how those cities and the proposed city will allow for expansion of urban growth boundaries and, where applicable, for creation or expansion of urban reserves.

      (c) The economic feasibility statement required by ORS 221.035 must:

      (A) Indicate that the proposed city must plan for and provide urban services in a cost-effective manner at the minimum level adequate to meet current needs and projected growth;

      (B) Contain a proposed permanent rate limit for operating taxes to provide revenues for urban services; and

      (C) Indicate that the proposed city must plan for residential development at or above the same urban density planned for an existing city, within the county, that has a similar geographic area within the existing city’s urban growth boundary or, for a proposed city within three miles of Metro’s boundary, a minimum urban residential density in accordance with a statewide planning goal and rules pertaining to needed housing for cities within Metro’s urban growth boundary.

      (d) If the proposed city will be required to complete a public facility plan and a transportation systems plan, the proposed city must demonstrate the ability to provide urban services to meet current needs and projected growth. The proposed city may meet this requirement, in whole or in part, by establishing an agreement in principle with a city or a district, as defined in ORS 195.060, to provide the urban services.

      (3) If the governing body of a neighboring city determines that the proposed incorporation adversely affects that city, the governing body may ask the county court with which the petition for incorporation was filed to reject the petition and terminate the incorporation proceedings. The objections by the city to the incorporation shall be heard and considered by the county court at a public hearing held under ORS 221.040.

      (4) If, at the hearing held under ORS 221.040, the county court finds that any of the requirements of subsection (2) of this section are not met or that the proposed incorporation will adversely affect a neighboring city, the county court shall provide by order for the termination of the incorporation proceedings. The order shall contain the findings of the county court relating to the proposed incorporation and the reasons for terminating the incorporation proceedings.

(1) If a person intends to file a petition for incorporation under ORS 221.031 (1), the person may file a notice of intent to prepare an economic feasibility statement with the county clerk of the county in which the proposed city lies or, should it lie in more than one county, with the county clerk of the county in which the largest part of its territory lies.

      (2) When a petition for incorporation is filed under ORS 221.031 (1), an economic feasibility statement concerning the proposed city described in the petition shall also be filed with the county clerk. The economic feasibility statement shall be prepared by the persons designated as the chief petitioners and shall form the basis for the proposed permanent rate limit for operating taxes required by ORS 221.031 (3). The economic feasibility statement shall contain:

      (a) A description of the services and functions to be performed or provided by the proposed city;

      (b) An analysis of the relationship between those services and functions and other existing or needed government services; and

      (c) Proposed first and third year budgets for the new city demonstrating its economic feasibility. [1989 c.92 §28; 1997 c.541 §352; 2001 c.557 §3; 2007 c.669 §4]

 

      221.036 Inclusion of area within urban growth boundary in incorporation of rural unincorporated community. For an area that includes a rural unincorporated community, as defined in ORS 221.034, if a notice of intent to prepare an economic feasibility statement is filed under ORS 221.035 (1) or a petition for incorporation is filed under ORS 221.031 (1) before all or a part of the rural unincorporated community is included in the acknowledged urban growth boundary of a metropolitan service district organized under ORS chapter 268, the incorporation may continue under the statutory requirements that apply to the incorporation of a rural unincorporated community under ORS 221.034. However, the area proposed to be incorporated may include any lands that are included in the acknowledged urban growth boundary. [2001 c.557 §5]

 

      221.040 Hearing on petition to incorporate; order fixing date of election on approved petition. (1) When a petition for incorporation described in ORS 221.031 is signed by 20 percent or, in a county with a population over 300,000, by 10 percent, of the electors registered in the area proposed to be incorporated, the petition shall be filed with the county court of the county in which the proposed petition was filed under ORS 221.031. A petition shall not be accepted for filing unless all the signatures on the petition were obtained within the six-month period immediately following the date on which the petitions were filed under ORS 221.031. Upon the filing of the petition, the county court shall fix the time and place for the hearing of such petition and shall give notice thereof by publication once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published in the county where the petition is filed and of general circulation within the boundaries, and by posting the notice for the same period of time in three public places in the area proposed to be incorporated. The notice shall state the time and place of the hearing, describe the boundaries set forth in the petition and state the purpose of the petition. If any portion of the proposed incorporation of a city lies within another county or counties, then the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the counties and in the same time and manner.

      (2) At the time and place fixed for the hearing, or at any time and place at which the hearing may be continued or postponed, any person interested may appear and present oral or written objections to the granting of the petition, the forming of the proposed incorporated city or the estimated rate of taxation set forth in the petition. The court may alter the boundaries as set forth in the petition to include all territory which may be benefited by being included within the boundaries of the proposed incorporated city, but shall not modify boundaries so as to exclude any land which would be benefited by the formation of the proposed city. No land shall be included in the proposed city which will not, in the judgment of the court, be benefited. If the court determines that any land has been improperly omitted from the proposed city and the owner has not appeared at the hearing, it shall continue the hearing and shall order notice given to the nonappearing owner requiring the owner to appear before it and show cause, if any the owner has, why the owner’s land should not be included in the proposed city. The notice shall be given by publication and posting in the same manner as the original notice for hearing and for the same period. For the purposes of this subsection, “owner” means the legal owner of record except that if there is a vendee under a duly recorded contract, the vendee shall be deemed to be the owner.

      (3) Upon the final hearing of the petition, the court, if it approves the petition as originally presented or in an altered form, shall provide by order for the holding of an election relating to the incorporation of the proposed city. The order calling the election shall fix the date of the election on the date of the next primary election or general election that is not sooner than the 90th day after the date of the order. The order shall contain:

      (a) A description of the exterior boundaries of the proposed city as determined by the court.

      (a) The judgment when docketed in the municipal court exceeds $3,000; or

      (b) Two or more judgments against the same debtor are docketed in a municipal court in favor of a single judgment creditor and the total amount owing to the judgment creditor, determined by adding the amount of each individual judgment as of the date the judgment is docketed, is greater than $3,000.

The judgment must be in an amount in excess of $3,000 as required by subsection (1) of this section, or be in excess of $3,000 when added to one or more other judgments in favor of a single judgment creditor as provided in subsection (1) of this section. The certified copy or lien record abstract may be recorded by the judgment creditor or by the agent of the judgment creditor at any time after the judgment is rendered and before the judgment expires under ORS 18.194 or is fully satisfied. From the time the judgment is recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record, the judgment is a lien upon the real property of the defendant in the county.

      (3) A certified copy of a docketed municipal court judgment or a lien record abstract for the judgment may be recorded in any County Clerk Lien Record.

If a certified copy of the judgment or a lien record abstract for the judgment has been recorded in any County Clerk Lien Record, a lien record abstract for the judgment in the form provided by ORS 18.170 may be recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record for any other county. From the time the certified copy or lien record abstract is recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record of another county, the judgment is a lien upon the real property of the defendant in that county.

      (4) A certified copy of a certificate of extension filed under ORS 18.194, or a lien record abstract for the certificate of extension, may be recorded in a County Clerk Lien Record in the same manner as provided for judgments under this section and with like effect. The judgment must meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) The recording of a certified copy of a municipal court judgment or a lien record abstract under this section does not extend the lien of the judgment more than 10 years from the original entry of the judgment in the municipal court.

APPEALS

 

      221.359 Appeals from conviction in municipal court. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, whenever any person is convicted in the municipal court of any city of any offense defined and made punishable by any city charter or ordinance, such person shall have the same right of appeal to the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the city has its legal situs and maintains its seat of city government as now obtains from a conviction from justice courts. The appeal shall be taken and perfected in the manner provided by law for taking appeals from justice courts, except that in appeals taken under this section, ORS 221.360, 221.380 or 221.390:

      (a) The notice thereof shall be served upon the city attorney;

      (b) When the notice of appeal has been filed with the court from which the appeal is being taken, the appellate court shall have jurisdiction of the cause. Failure to serve a notice of appeal on the appropriate attorney shall not preclude jurisdiction in the appellate court; and

      (c) No undertaking providing for the payment of costs and disbursements shall be required.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, in a prosecution of any offense defined and made punishable by any city charter or ordinance, a plaintiff may appeal to the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the city has its legal situs and maintains its seat of city government in the manner provided by ORS 157.020 (2) for taking appeals from justice courts.

      (3) The provisions of this section apply only to municipal courts that have not become courts of record under ORS 221.342.

[Formerly 221.350; 2003 c.687 §8]

 

      221.360 Appeal on issue of constitutionality of charter provision or ordinance. In all cases involving the constitutionality of the charter provision or ordinance under which the conviction was obtained as indicated in ORS 221.359, such person shall have the right of appeal to the circuit court in the manner provided in ORS 221.359, regardless of any charter provision or ordinance prohibiting appeals from the municipal court because of the amount of the penalty or otherwise. An appeal may likewise be taken in such cases from the judgment or final order of the circuit court to the Court of Appeals in the same manner as other appeals are taken from the circuit court to the Court of Appeals in other criminal cases. Where the right of appeal in such cases depends upon there being involved an issue as to the constitutionality of the charter provision or ordinance, the decision of the appellate court shall be upon such constitutional issue only. [Amended by 1969 c.198 §78; 1985 c.342 §17]

 

      221.370 Validity of charter or ordinance provision determined before merits. Whenever the validity of a charter or ordinance provision of any city comes in issue in a trial for violation of charter or ordinance provision, the trial judge shall determine such issue of validity and make a decision and order thereon before making any decision as to the facts in the particular case.

 

      221.380 Appeal by city from invalidating order; release of defendant during appeal. From an order declaring a charter or ordinance provision invalid, the city may appeal from the municipal court to the circuit court for the county in which the city has its legal situs and maintains its seat of city government; and, from such order by a circuit court, may appeal to the Court of Appeals, in the same manner as appeals are taken in criminal cases to such courts. Upon the order of the appellate court upon such issue the case shall be remanded with direction. If a city so appeals, pending the appellate decision thereon, the defendant shall be released, with or without bond, for reappearance at the discretion of the trial court, until such time as the case is remanded. [Amended by 1975 c.227 §1; 1985 c.342 §18; 1995 c.658 §94; 1999 c.788 §52]

(1) When any person convicted in a municipal court appeals to the circuit court as provided in ORS 221.359 and 221.360, such person shall be tried in the circuit court pursuant to the statutes which prescribe the procedure for trial of violations of the criminal statutes of the state, except that the prosecution shall be handled by an attorney provided by the city with the municipal court from which the appeal was taken.

      (2) Within 10 days following the return of the verdict in the circuit court, the clerk of the court shall notify the recorder or corresponding officer of the city, in writing, of the outcome of the trial, and shall give like notice of any sentence imposed.

      (3) Upon a verdict of guilty the circuit court judge may impose any sentence within the limits prescribed by the charter or ordinance for violation of which the conviction was had, and if a fine is imposed, it shall be paid to the clerk of the court and by the clerk remitted, on or before the 10th day of the following month, to the proper city officer.

      (4) This section does not apply where the appeal involves only an issue of constitutionality of the charter or ordinance. [Amended by 1985 c.342 §19]

Recognizing the independent basis of legislative authority granted to cities in this state by municipal charters, the Legislative Assembly intends by ORS 221.420, 221.450 and 261.305 and this section to reaffirm the authority of cities to regulate use of municipally owned rights of way and to impose charges upon publicly owned suppliers of electrical energy, as well as privately owned suppliers for the use of such rights of way. [1987 c.245 §1]

      (b) Require any public utility, by ordinance or otherwise, to make such modifications, additions and extensions to its physical equipment, facilities or plant or service within such city as shall be reasonable or necessary in the interest of the public, and designate the location and nature of all additions and extensions, the time within which they must be completed, and all conditions under which they must be constructed.

The privilege tax shall be for the use of those public streets, alleys or highways, or all of them, in such city in an amount not exceeding five percent of the gross revenues of the cooperative, utility, district or company currently earned within the boundary of the city. However, the gross revenues earned in interstate commerce or on the business of the United States Government shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. The privilege tax authorized in this section shall be for each year, or part of each year, such utility, cooperative, district or company, or Oregon Community Power, operates without a franchise.

      (3) The state or municipal corporation may notify the owner of the property and materials referred to in subsection (2) of this section that it waives forfeiture and escheat under subsection (2) of this section and may thereafter compel removal of such property and materials from the public highways, streets and alleys and restoration of the public highways, streets and alleys and may maintain court suit to require such removal and restoration by the owner or the payment of the cost thereof by the owner.

      221.480 [Repealed by 1981 c.288 §1]

 

      221.485 Policy on vehicles for hire. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that privately owned taxicabs, limousines and other vehicles for hire are a vital part of the transportation system within this state and provide necessary services in response to the needs of state residents, tourists and business representatives from outside this state. Consequently, the safety and reliability of such vehicles and the economic well-being and stability of their owners and operators are matters of public concern. The regulation of such vehicles is an essential government function and, therefore, it is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to reaffirm the authority of political subdivisions in this state to regulate the operation of privately owned taxicabs, limousines and other vehicles for hire and to exempt such regulation from liability under federal antitrust laws. [1985 c.475 §1]

 

      221.490 [Repealed by 1981 c.288 §1]

 

      221.495 Local regulation of vehicles for hire. Cities and counties in this state are authorized to grant franchises, to license, control and regulate privately owned taxicabs, limousines and other vehicles for hire that operate within their respective jurisdictions. The power to regulate granted under this section includes, but is not limited to:

      (1) Regulating entry into the business of providing taxicab, limousine or other similar services.

      (2) Requiring a license or permit as a condition for operation of taxicabs, limousines and other vehicles for hire and revoking, canceling or refusing to reissue a license or permit for failure to comply with regulatory requirements.

      (4) Regulating routes for such vehicles, including restricting access to airports.

      221.500 [Repealed by 1981 c.288 §1]

 

(Telecommunications Carriers)

 

      221.505 Policy. The Legislative Assembly recognizes that significant changes have occurred in the regulation, technology and marketing of telecommunications carriers as defined in ORS 133.721 over the past decade. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly in adopting the privilege tax authorized by ORS 221.505 to 221.515 and 759.219 to respond to these changes by establishing a uniform base for municipal charges for street use by telecommunications carriers. [1989 c.484 §1; 1999 c.1093 §8]

 

      221.510 Municipal regulation of telecommunications carriers. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Telecommunications carrier” has the meaning given that term in ORS 133.721.

      (b) “Commission” means the Public Utility Commission of Oregon.

      (c) “Council” means the common council, city council, commission or any other governing body of any municipality wherein the property of the telecommunications carrier is located.

      (d) “Municipality” means any town, municipality or other municipal government wherein property of the telecommunications carrier is located.

      (e) “Service” is used in its broadest and most inclusive sense and includes equipment and facilities.

      (2) Every municipality may:

      (a) Determine by contract, or prescribe by ordinance or otherwise, the terms and conditions, including payment of a privilege tax to the extent authorized by ORS 221.515 and other charges and fees, upon which any telecommunications carrier may be permitted to occupy the streets, highways or other public property within such municipality and exclude or eject any telecommunications carrier therefrom.

      (b) Require any telecommunications carrier, by ordinance or otherwise, to make such modifications, additions and extensions to its physical equipment, facilities or plant or service within such municipality as shall be reasonable or necessary in the interest of the public, and designate the location and nature of all additions and extensions, the time within which they must be completed and all conditions under which they must be constructed.

      (c) Provide for a penalty for noncompliance with the provisions of any charter provision, ordinance or resolution adopted by the municipality in furtherance of the powers specified in this subsection. [1989 c.484 §4; 1999 c.1093 §9]

 

      221.515 Privilege tax on telecommunications carriers; maximum rate; deduction of additional fees. (1) The council of every municipality in this state may levy and collect from every telecommunications carrier operating within the municipality and actually using the streets, alleys or highways, or all of them, in such municipality for other than travel, a privilege tax for the use of those streets, alleys or highways, or all of them, in such municipality in an amount which may not exceed seven percent of the gross revenues of the telecommunications carrier currently earned within the boundaries of the municipality. The privilege tax authorized in this section shall be for each year, or part of each year, that such telecommunications carrier operates within the municipality.

      (2) As used in this section, “gross revenues” means those revenues derived from exchange access services, as defined in ORS 403.105, less net uncollectibles from such revenues.

      (3) A telecommunications carrier paying the privilege tax authorized by this section shall not be required to pay any additional fee, compensation or consideration, including the free use or construction of telecommunications facilities and equipment, to the municipality for its use of public streets, alleys, or highways, or all of them, and shall not be required to pay any additional tax or fee on the gross revenues that are the measure of the privilege tax. As used in this subsection, “use” includes, but is not limited to, street openings, construction and maintenance of fixtures or facilities by telecommunications carriers. As used in this subsection, “additional fee, compensation or consideration” does not include commissions paid for siting public telephones on municipal property. To the extent that separate fees are imposed by the municipality on telecommunications carriers for street openings, construction, inspection or maintenance of fixtures or facilities, such fees may be deducted from the privilege tax authorized by this section. However, telecommunications carriers shall not deduct charges and penalties imposed by the municipality for noncompliance with charter provisions, ordinances, resolutions or permit conditions from the privilege tax authorized by this section.

      (4) For purposes of this section, “telecommunications carrier” has the meaning given that term in ORS 133.721. [1989 c.484 §5; 1999 c.1093 §10]

      (a) The question of whether sections 1 to 3 of this 2019 Act are valid under the laws of this state and the United States and Oregon Constitutions; and

      (b) Legislative history and any supporting documents related to the question described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (5) Judicial review under this section shall proceed as follows:

      (a)(A) First, the court shall determine whether section 1 of this 2019 Act is valid.

      (B) If the court determines that section 1 of this 2019 Act is valid, the Secretary of State shall make the determination described in section 1 (1) of this 2019 Act.

      (b)(A) Second, only if the court determines that section 1 of this 2019 Act is invalid under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court shall determine whether sections 2 and 3 of this 2019 Act are valid.

      (B) If the court determines that sections 2 and 3 of this 2019 Act are valid, the court shall issue an order so stating.

      (6)(a) Any party interested in or affected by section 1 of this 2019 Act may request the Secretary of State to make the determination described in section 1 (1) of this 2019 Act:

      (A) If no petition is filed under subsection (3) of this section within the time allowed for filing; or

      (B) In any other circumstances requiring such action in order to have the determination made.

      Note: The May 17, 2016, election at which the voters of the City of Damascus approved chapter 603, Oregon Laws 2015, was invalidated by the Court of Appeals. De Young v. Brown, 297 Or. App. 355 (2019). Sections 1 and 2, chapter 545, Oregon Laws 2019, ratify the results of, and cure the defects in, that election. However, section 4, chapter 545, Oregon Laws 2019, provides for expedited review of sections 1 and 2, chapter 545, Oregon Laws 2019, to the Supreme Court. A petition has been filed pursuant to section 4, chapter 545, Oregon Laws 2019. Thus, the validity of sections 1 and 2, chapter 545, Oregon Laws 2019, and the consequent validity of chapter 603, Oregon Laws 2015, and operability of section 1, chapter 637, Oregon Laws 2015, remain uncertain, pending the decision of the court.

      (a) The volumetric rate, in cents per kilowatt hour, for any customer class shall not exceed five percent of the 1999 gross revenue of an electric utility within the city for the customer class divided by the amount of electric energy in kilowatt hours delivered to the customer class in 1999.

      (b) A city with a franchise fee or privilege tax in effect on July 1, 1999, that was less than five percent shall not establish a volumetric rate for any customer class of the distribution utility in an amount in excess of the city’s 1999 franchise fee or privilege tax rate times the 1999 gross revenue of any electric utility within the city from the customer class divided by the amount of electric energy in kilowatt hours delivered to the customer class in 1999, except following a hearing with notice and opportunity for public comment.

      (3) Subject to the limitations established in subsection (2) of this section, once a city has established volumetric rates for the purpose of calculating the privilege tax under this section, any subsequent change in the volumetric rates shall be applied on an equal percentage basis to all customer classes.

      (4)(a) The Public Utility Commission shall determine the manner in which a privilege tax under this section is collected from the customers of an electric company. The privilege tax shall be allocated across an electric company’s customer classes in the same proportional amounts as levied by the city against the electric company.

      221.919 Powers and duties of marshal; removal from office. The marshal shall be chief of police and shall have control over all police officers when on duty. The marshal shall be a conservator of the peace, and shall arrest all persons guilty of a breach thereof, or of violations of the city ordinances, and take them before the recorder for trial. The marshal shall make and enforce the collection of all delinquent city taxes, as the collection of delinquent county taxes is enforced, and shall perform such other duties as may be required of the marshal by the common council. The marshal may suspend any police officer for negligence or violation of duty until the case may be examined and determined by the council. On complaint being made, charging the marshal with malfeasance or nonfeasance in office, the alderpersons, by a unanimous vote without the concurrence of the mayor, or by a majority vote with the concurrence of the mayor, may remove the marshal from office at any regular meeting, after giving the marshal an opportunity to be heard in the defense of the treasurer, provided they find the charge is true. [Amended by 1991 c.67 §50; 2003 c.14 §111]

      221.924 Authority to make public improvements. The council may, whenever it deems it expedient, improve the public grounds within any city referred to in ORS 221.906, and establish and open additional streets and alleys therein.

[Amended by 1969 c.429 §5]

 

      221.925 Tax deeds; tax warrants. In making a deed for any real property sold for delinquent taxes, it is not necessary to recite or set forth the proceedings prior to the sale, but it is sufficient, if it substantially appears from such deed that the property was sold by virtue of a warrant from any city referred to in ORS 221.906, and the date thereof for delinquent taxes, and the amount thereof, together with the date of the sale and the amount paid thereat by the purchaser. The style of the warrant for the collection of delinquent taxes shall be: “In the name of the city (or town) of______.” The warrant must require the marshal to forthwith levy upon sufficient property of the person or persons owing such taxes and sell the same in the manner provided by law, and return the proceeds of such sale to the city treasurer and the warrant to the recorder, with the doings of the marshal indorsed thereon, together with the receipts of the city treasurer for the proceeds of such sale as paid to the treasurer. The warrant shall have the force and effect of an execution against real and personal property, and shall be executed in a like manner, except as otherwise provided by law or this section. Real property when sold for delinquent taxes may be redeemed in like manner as real property is redeemed after sale thereof for county or state taxes, and not otherwise. The deed of the purchaser must express the true consideration thereof, which is the amount paid by the purchaser, and the return of the marshal executing the warrant must specify the amount for which each lot or part thereof is sold, and the name of the purchaser.

 

      221.926 Authority to enact ordinances. Every city organized under sections 1 to 6, pages 119 to 123, Oregon Laws 1893, may pass any and all necessary ordinances for the purpose of carrying into force and effect any provisions of ORS 221.901 to 221.928 or any other laws concerning city government.

 

      221.927 Approval or veto of ordinances; proceedings after veto. Upon the passage of any ordinance, the enrolled copy thereof, attested by the recorder, shall be submitted to the mayor by the recorder, and if the mayor approves the same the mayor shall write upon it “Approved,” with the date thereof and sign it with the name of office of the mayor. Thereupon, unless otherwise provided, such ordinance shall become a law and be of force and effect. If the mayor does not approve of the ordinance so submitted, the mayor must, within 10 days from the receipt thereof, return the same to the recorder with the reasons of the mayor for not approving it, and if the mayor does not so return it, such ordinance shall become a law as if the mayor had approved it. Upon the first meeting of the council after the return of an ordinance from the mayor not approved, the recorder shall deliver it to the council, with the message of the mayor, which must be read. The ordinance shall then be put upon its passage again, and if two-thirds of all the members constituting the council, as then provided by law, vote in the affirmative, it shall become a law without the approval of the mayor, and not otherwise.

 

      221.928 Record of ordinances; compilation accepted as evidence. The ordinances passed by any common council or any municipal corporation within this state, organized under sections 1 to 6, pages 119 to 123, Oregon Laws 1893, shall be recorded in a book to be kept for that purpose by the recorder of any such city. When so recorded, the record so made shall be received in any court of this state as prima facie evidence of the due passage of such ordinance as recorded. When the ordinances of any such city are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.

      221.929 [Repealed by 1953 c.57 §2]

 

      221.930 [Repealed by 1973 c.64 §3]
