Such territory may lie either wholly or partially within or without the same county in which the city lies.

      (2) A proposal for annexation of territory to a city may be initiated by the legislative body of the city, on its own motion, or by a petition to the legislative body of the city by owners of real property in the territory to be annexed.

      (3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the proposal for annexation may provide that, during each of not more than 10 full fiscal years beginning with the first fiscal year after the annexation takes effect, the rate of taxation for city purposes on property in the annexed territory shall be at a specified ratio of the highest rate of taxation applicable that year for city purposes to other property in the city.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, a proposal for annexation initiated by the legislative body of a city may provide for a duration of not more than 20 full fiscal years.

      (c) The proposal may provide for the ratio to increase from fiscal year to fiscal year according to a schedule of increase specified in the proposal, but in no case may the proposal provide for a rate of taxation for city purposes in the annexed territory that exceeds the highest rate of taxation for city purposes applicable to other property in the city for the current year.

      (d) If the annexation takes place pursuant to a proposal providing for taxation at a ratio, the city may not tax property in the annexed territory at a rate other than the ratio that the proposal authorizes for that fiscal year.

      (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this subsection, during the term of fiscal years provided for pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, the ratio shall be 100 percent for property that is sold or transferred to new ownership, beginning with the first property tax year that begins after the sale or transfer.

      (4)(a) When the territory to be annexed includes a part less than the entire area of a district named in ORS 222.510, the proposal for annexation may provide that if annexation of the territory occurs the part of the district annexed into the city is withdrawn from the district as of the effective date of the annexation.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the affected district is a district named in ORS 222.465, the effective date of the withdrawal of territory shall be determined as provided in ORS 222.465.

      (5) The legislative body of the city shall submit, except when not required under ORS 222.120, 222.170 and 222.840 to 222.915 to do so, the proposal for annexation to the electors of the territory proposed for annexation and, except when permitted under ORS 222.120 or 222.840 to 222.915 to dispense with submitting the proposal for annexation to the electors of the city, the legislative body of the city shall submit such proposal to the electors of the city. The proposal for annexation may be voted upon at a general election or at a special election to be held for that purpose.

      (6) The proposal for annexation may be voted upon by the electors of the city and of the territory simultaneously or at different times not more than 12 months apart.

      (7) Two or more proposals for annexation of territory may be voted upon simultaneously, but in the city, each proposal shall be stated separately on the ballot and voted on separately, and in the territory proposed for annexation, no proposal for annexing other territory may appear on the ballot. [1957 c.613 §2 (enacted in lieu of 222.110); 1959 c.415 §1; 1967 c.624 §13; 1985 c.702 §7; 2019 c.315 §1]

      (2) When the legislative body of the city elects to dispense with submitting the question of the proposed annexation to the electors of the city, the legislative body of the city shall fix a day for a public hearing before the legislative body at which time the electors of the city may appear and be heard on the question of annexation.

      (3) The city legislative body shall cause notice of the hearing to be published once each week for two successive weeks prior to the day of hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and shall cause notices of the hearing to be posted in four public places in the city for a like period.

      (4) After the hearing, the city legislative body may, by an ordinance containing a legal description of the territory in question:

      (a) Declare that the territory is annexed to the city upon the condition that the majority of the votes cast in the territory is in favor of annexation;

      (b) Declare that the territory is annexed to the city where electors or landowners in the contiguous territory consented in writing to such annexation, as provided in ORS 222.125 or 222.170, prior to the public hearing held under subsection (2) of this section; or

      (c) Declare that the territory is annexed to the city where the Oregon Health Authority, prior to the public hearing held under subsection (1) of this section, has issued a finding that a danger to public health exists because of conditions within the territory as provided by ORS 222.840 to 222.915.

      (5) If the territory described in the ordinance issued under subsection (4) of this section is a part less than the entire area of a district named in ORS 222.510, the ordinance may also declare that the territory is withdrawn from the district on the effective date of the annexation or on any subsequent date specified in the ordinance. However, if the affected district is a district named in ORS 222.465, the effective date of the withdrawal of territory shall be determined as provided in ORS 222.465.

      (6) The ordinance referred to in subsection (4) of this section is subject to referendum.

      (7) For the purpose of this section, ORS 222.125 and 222.170, “owner” or “landowner” means the legal owner of record or, where there is a recorded land contract which is in force, the purchaser thereunder. If there is a multiple ownership in a parcel of land each consenting owner shall be counted as a fraction to the same extent as the interest of the owner in the land bears in relation to the interest of the other owners and the same fraction shall be applied to the parcel’s land mass and assessed value for purposes of the consent petition. If a corporation owns land in territory proposed to be annexed, the corporation shall be considered the individual owner of that land.

The legislative body of a city need not call or hold an election in the city or in any contiguous territory proposed to be annexed or hold the hearing otherwise required under ORS 222.120 when all of the owners of land in that territory and not less than 50 percent of the electors, if any, residing in the territory consent in writing to the annexation of the land in the territory and file a statement of their consent with the legislative body. Upon receiving written consent to annexation by owners and electors under this section, the legislative body of the city, by resolution or ordinance, may set the final boundaries of the area to be annexed by a legal description and proclaim the annexation. [1985 c.702 §3; 1987 c.738 §1]

      222.140 [Repealed by 1979 c.317 §26]

 

      222.150 Election results; proclamation of annexation. The city legislative body shall determine the results of the election from the official figures returned by the county clerk.

(Temporary provisions relating to consolidation of certain industrial lands)

 

      Note: Sections 9, 10 and 11, chapter 539, Oregon Laws 2005, provide:

      Sec. 9. Section 10 of this 2005 Act is added to and made a part of ORS 222.210 to 222.310. [2005 c.539 §9]

      Sec. 10. (1) A lot, parcel or tract may not be included in territory proposed to be consolidated to create a newly incorporated city or a consolidated city unless the owner of the lot, parcel or tract gives written consent to the incorporation or consolidation, if the lot, parcel or tract:

      (a) Is zoned for industrial use or designated for industrial use zoning in an acknowledged comprehensive plan;

      (b) Is land on which no electors reside, unless one or more electors living on-site are employed or engaged to provide security services for the industrial user of the land;

      (c) Has an assessed value of more than $2 million, including improvements; and

      (d) Is in unincorporated Jackson County within the urban unincorporated community of White City, west of Oregon Route 62.

      (2) After incorporation or consolidation of a city that includes a lot, parcel or tract described in subsection (1) of this section, the development rights that apply to the lot, parcel or tract under the industrial zoning classification applicable to the lot, parcel or tract when the city is incorporated or consolidated are retained and run with the lot, parcel or tract.

      (b) Contains a mixture of land uses, including three or more public, commercial or industrial land uses;

      (c) Includes areas served by a community sewer system; and

      222.210 Authority to consolidate adjoining and nonadjoining cities or territories; additional method of annexation; limitation. (1) An incorporated city may be created from adjoining or nonadjoining incorporated cities, from an incorporated city and adjoining or nonadjoining unincorporated territory, or from both, after proceedings had as required by ORS 222.210 to 222.310. The legislature expressly declares that those sections do not repeal or amend any other law or laws providing for the incorporation of cities, and that those sections are enacted for the purpose of providing an additional procedure for the incorporation of cities. The unincorporated territory may consist of contiguous or noncontiguous areas.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 222.210 to 222.310, no city shall be created under ORS 222.210 to 222.310 that contains any noncontiguous area which is separated from the rest of the territory of the city by a distance that is nowhere less than or equal to three miles. If a petition filed under ORS 222.230 (2) proposes creation of a city containing noncontiguous areas separated by a distance of more than three miles, the affected city governing bodies shall so declare at the joint convention held under ORS 222.230 (4) and shall cancel any further proceedings related to the petition. If a consolidated city with such noncontiguous areas results from an election called under ORS 222.250 or 222.275, the consolidated city shall consist only of the most populous city included in the consolidated city and those cities or unincorporated areas in which the majority of votes cast favored creation of the consolidated city and which lie not more than three miles from the contiguous area composed of the most populous city and any other city or unincorporated area in which the majority of votes cast favored creation of the consolidated city. [Amended by 1971 c.761 §1; 1983 c.350 §37; 1985 c.702 §22; 1989 c.92 §38; 1997 c.541 §390]

 

      222.220 Initiation of proceedings; signatures on petitions. Proceedings to create an incorporated city under ORS 222.210 to 222.310 may be initiated by petition signed by not less than 10 percent of the electors of each incorporated city to be included within the proposed city. If it is proposed to include one or more unincorporated areas in the proposed city, the petition shall be signed by not less than 10 percent of the electors registered in each such area at the closing of the registration books by the county clerk at the close of registration preceding the last general election. The areas may be contiguous with one another. [Amended by 1971 c.761 §2; 1983 c.83 §24]

 

      222.225 Economic feasibility statement required; contents. When a petition to create a city under ORS 222.210 to 222.310 is filed with the clerk or recorder of a city under ORS 222.230, an economic feasibility statement concerning the proposed city described in the petition shall also be filed with the clerk or recorder. The economic feasibility statement shall be prepared by the petitioners and, if applicable, shall form the basis for the proposed permanent rate limit for operating taxes required by ORS 222.230 (2). The economic feasibility statement shall contain:

      (1) A description of the services and functions to be performed or provided by the proposed city;

      (2) An analysis of the relationship between those services and functions and other existing or needed government services; and

      (3) A proposed first year line item operation budget and a projected third year line item operating budget for the new city that demonstrate its economic feasibility. [1989 c.92 §33; 1997 c.541 §355]

 

      222.230 Form and contents of petition; filing; meeting of city governing bodies. (1) Before circulating a petition to create a city from adjoining or nonadjoining cities or unincorporated territory, the petitioners shall file with the county clerk of the county in which the proposed city lies or, should it lie in more than one county, to the county clerk of the county in which the largest part of its territory lies, a petition for consolidation in a form prescribed by rule of the Secretary of State. If the economic feasibility statement required by ORS 222.225 is submitted with the petition, the county clerk shall immediately date and time stamp the prospective petition and shall authorize the circulation of the petition. The county clerk shall retain the prospective petition and economic feasibility statement and shall immediately send a copy of the prospective petition to each city included in the proposed consolidation.

      (2) The petition shall be addressed to the governing bodies of the cities to be included in the proposed city. The petition shall state the name of the city, which may be, but need not be, the name of any of the cities to be included in the city. If it is proposed to include one or more unincorporated areas, the petition shall describe the boundaries of each of them, in addition to designating the incorporated cities to be included in the proposed city. The petition may be filed in the office of the clerk or recorder of any of the cities to be included in the proposed city. However, a petition shall not be accepted for filing unless all the signatures on the petition were obtained within the one-year period immediately following the date on which the petition was filed under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The petition shall state the proposed permanent rate limit for operating taxes for the city that is to be created. The proposed permanent rate limit shall be the rate that would produce the same tax revenue as the existing city or cities would have cumulatively produced within the city or cities’ territorial boundaries were the consolidation not to take effect, and not taking into account any applicable statutory rate limit on operating taxes.

      (4) When a petition to create a city pursuant to ORS 222.210 to 222.310 contains the required number of signatures and has been so filed, the governing bodies of the cities to be included in the proposed city shall meet in joint convention at the usual place of meeting of the governing body of that one of the cities having the largest population as shown by the last federal census, as soon after the filing of the petition as is convenient, but not more than 20 days after the filing of the petition. At that meeting the governing bodies shall examine the petition and determine:

      (a) Whether it is in proper form and contains the required number of qualified signers; and

      (b) Whether the incorporation of the consolidated city proposed in the petition complies with goals adopted under ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197. [Amended by 1971 c.761 §3; 1985 c.702 §23; 1989 c.92 §34; 1997 c.541 §356; 2001 c.672 §6]

 

      222.240 Approval of petition; appointment of charter commission; employment of assistance; functions. If the governing bodies find that the petition is in proper form, contains the required signatures and proposes an incorporation that complies with goals adopted under ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197, the governing body of each of the cities to be included in the proposed city shall approve the petition and appoint two residents of each of the cities as the members of a charter commission to prepare a charter for the proposed city to be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection at the same election at which is submitted the question of the creation of the proposed city. The charter commission may employ at the expense of the cities such legal and other assistance as it considers advisable to assist it in the preparation of the charter or the performance of its duties, and the expense shall be equally borne by the cities. If the petitions provide that one or more unincorporated areas shall be included in the proposed city, the governing body of the county within which the largest portion of all such areas lies shall appoint to the charter commission two electors residing in those areas. After the commission is selected, it shall prepare a charter for the proposed city within 60 days after the commission has been appointed. [Amended by 1971 c.761 §4; 1985 c.702 §24; 2001 c.672 §7]

 

      222.245 [1971 c.761 §13; repealed by 1989 c.92 §39]

      222.250 Joint convention of governing bodies; election on consolidation, charter and tax rate limit; date; functions of county court; ballot title. (1) After the charter commission has prepared and adopted a charter, the secretary of the charter commission shall file copies of the charter, certified as correct by the secretary or two or more members of the commission, with the governing bodies of each of the incorporated cities to be included in the proposed city. Within 30 days after the filing the governing bodies of the cities shall meet in joint convention, at the usual place of meeting of the governing body of the city having the largest population as shown by the last federal census, to adopt a ballot title for the question of consolidation and adoption of a city charter and tax base. The ballot title shall comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035. The permanent rate limit for operating taxes that is submitted to the electors shall be the permanent rate limit included in the petition for consolidation filed under ORS 222.230.

      (2) The election shall be held on the date of the next primary election or general election that is not earlier than the 90th day after the filing. The election shall be called and held for the purpose of submitting the following question to the electors of each incorporated city and of each unincorporated area to be included in the proposed city:

      (a) Whether an incorporated city shall be created consisting of the largest city proposed to be included therein, of each other incorporated city whose electors vote to create the proposed city, and of each unincorporated area in which the electors vote to create the proposed city;

      (b) Whether the charter proposed by the charter commission shall be adopted as the charter for the city; and

      (c) Whether the proposed permanent rate limit included in the petition for consolidation filed under ORS 222.230 shall be adopted as the proposed permanent rate limit of the new city.

      (3) If the governing bodies cannot agree at the joint convention upon a date and a ballot title for the election, the county court of the county in which is located the administrative office of the city having the largest population of all cities proposed to be included in the consolidated city, by resolution duly adopted by the county court, shall determine a date and adopt a ballot title. The election in that case shall be called by the county court for the purposes provided in the petitions and ORS 222.210 to 222.310.

      (4) The statement summarizing the measure and its major effect in a ballot title for an election under this section shall include a general description of the boundaries of the proposed city. The description shall use streets and other generally recognized features and name the cities proposed to be included in the consolidated city.

      (4) The petition must be filed with the county clerk of the county within which the largest portion of the city or area lies, not later than the 60th day after the date of the first election.

      (4) A city incorporated under ORS 222.210 to 222.310 may not exercise the power granted by ORS 222.750 as to land surrounded by the corporate limits or boundaries of the city at the time of incorporation. [Amended by 1971 c.761 §8; 1983 c.350 §44]

 

      222.290 Officers assume duties under charter. At whatever time the charter of the consolidated city specifies the officers elected at the election referred to in ORS 222.280 shall be entitled to enter upon the duties of their respective offices, upon qualifying therefor in accordance with the charter, and shall hold their respective offices for whatever terms are prescribed by the charter. [Amended by 1971 c.761 §9]

 

      222.295 Effect of consolidation; records, assets and uncollected taxes of consolidating cities transferred to consolidated city.

      (2) From the date the newly formed municipal corporation comes into existence, all complaints and prosecutions for crimes committed or ordinances violated and all suits or causes of action arising within the territory of the municipal corporation prior to its creation may be instituted in said incorporated city with the same effect as if it had been in existence prior to the violations, subject however, to the provisions of the charter of the newly formed municipal corporation.

WITHDRAWAL OF TERRITORY

 

      222.460 Procedures for withdrawal of territory; contents of resolution; hearing; election; taxes and assessments. (1) Except as expressly prohibited by the city charter, when the legislative body of a city determines that the public interest will be furthered by a withdrawal or detachment of territory from the city, the legislative body of the city, on its own motion, may order the withdrawal of territory as provided in this section.

      (2) A withdrawal of territory from the city shall be initiated by a resolution of the legislative body of the city.

      (3) The resolution shall:

      (a) Name the city and declare that it is the intent of the legislative body of the city to change the boundaries of the city by means of a withdrawal of territory;

      (b) Describe the boundaries of the affected territory; and

      (c) Have attached a county assessor’s cadastral map showing the location of the affected territory.

      (4) Not later than 30 days after adoption of the resolution, the legislative body of the city shall hold a public hearing at which the residents of the city may appear and be heard on the question of the withdrawal of territory. The legislative body of the city shall cause notice of the hearing to be given in the manner required under ORS 222.120 (3).

      (5) After receiving testimony at the public hearing, the legislative body of the city may alter the boundaries described in the resolution to either include or exclude territory. If the legislative body of the city still favors the withdrawal of territory pursuant to the resolution, as approved or modified, it shall enter an order so declaring. The order shall set forth the boundaries of the area to be withdrawn. The order shall also fix a place, and a time not less than 20 nor more than 50 days after the date of the order, for a final hearing on the resolution. The order shall declare that if written requests for an election are not filed as provided by subsection (6) of this section, the legislative body of the city, at the time of the final hearing, will adopt a resolution or ordinance detaching the territory from the city.

      (6) An election shall not be held on the question of withdrawal of the affected territory from the city unless written requests for an election are filed at or before the hearing by not less than 15 percent of the electors or 100 electors, whichever is the lesser number, registered in the territory proposed to be withdrawn from the city.

      (7) At the time and place set for the final hearing upon the resolution for withdrawal, if the required number of written requests for an election on the proposed withdrawal have not been filed, the legislative body of the city shall, by resolution or ordinance, declare that the territory is detached from the city.

      (8) If the required number of requests for an election are filed on or before the final hearing, the legislative body of the city shall call an election in the city upon the question of the withdrawal of the affected territory.

      (9) If an election is called and a majority of the votes cast at the election is in favor of the withdrawal of the designated area from the city, the legislative body of the city shall, by resolution or ordinance, declare that the territory is detached from the city. If the majority of the votes cast is against the withdrawal, the legislative body of the city shall enter an order declaring the results of the election and that no withdrawal shall occur.

      (10) The described area withdrawn shall, from the date of entry of the order, be free from assessments and taxes levied thereafter by the city. However, the withdrawn area shall remain subject to any bonded or other indebtedness existing at the time of the order. The proportionate share shall be based on the assessed valuation, according to the assessment roll in the year of the levy, of all the property contained in the city immediately prior to the withdrawal. [1985 c.702 §2; 1989 c.1063 §13]

 

      Note: 222.460 and 222.465 were added to and made a part of ORS chapter 222 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      222.465 Effective date of withdrawal from domestic water supply district, water control district or sanitary district. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or ORS chapter 199 which provides a different effective date, when territory is withdrawn by a city from a domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264, a water control district organized under ORS chapter 553 or a sanitary district organized under ORS chapter 450, if the ordinance, annexation or incorporation that results in the withdrawal is enacted or approved after March 31 in any year, the effective date of the withdrawal of territory shall be July 1 in the following year. However, if the ordinance, annexation or incorporation that results in the withdrawal is enacted or approved before April 1 in any year, the effective date of the withdrawal of territory shall be July 1 in the same year. When less than the entire area of a domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264, a water control district organized under ORS chapter 553 or a sanitary district organized under ORS chapter 450 is annexed by or incorporated into a city, the district shall, for purposes of administration, operation and the collection of service charges, continue to operate that portion of the district separately until the effective date of the withdrawal of territory as determined under this section. This section does not limit any agreement between a city and a district under ORS 222.530 (5), 222.540 (4) or 222.560 (4). [1985 c.702 §4a]

 

      Note: See note under 222.460.

 

ANNEXATION OF PUBLIC SERVICE DISTRICTS

 

      222.510 Annexation of entire district; transfer of assets, liabilities and functions to city; exceptions. (1) Whenever the entire area of a rural fire protection district, a water district, including a domestic water supply corporation, a park and recreation district, a highway lighting district, a county service district, a special road district, a road assessment district or a sanitary district or authority, lawfully organized and existing, becomes incorporated in or annexed to a city in accordance with law, the district is extinguished and the city shall, upon the effective date of the incorporation or annexation, succeed to all the assets and become charged with all the liabilities, obligations and functions of the district. The district officers shall forthwith deliver to the city officers the district assets and records. Uncollected taxes theretofore levied by the district become the property of the city and must be delivered to it by the county treasurer upon collection.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a rural fire protection district, a water district, including a domestic water supply corporation, a park and recreation district, a highway lighting district, a county service district, a special road district, a road assessment district or a sanitary district or authority, lawfully organized and existing, the entire area of which becomes incorporated in a city, may continue to provide services if the continuation is proposed by petitioners in a petition for incorporation that is subsequently approved by voters in an incorporation election. At any time after incorporation, a city may cause a district to be extinguished and succeed to all the assets and become charged with all the liabilities, obligations and functions of the district if:

      (a) The governing body of the city holds a public hearing on the question of the extinguishment, hears objections to the extinguishment at the hearing, determines that the extinguishment is in the best interest of the city and adopts an ordinance extinguishing the district;

      (b) After the hearing, the governing body of the city refers the ordinance extinguishing the district to the electors of the city; and

      (c) The majority of all votes cast favors that the district be extinguished.

      (3) For the public hearing required in subsection (2)(a) of this section, the governing body shall fix a date, time and place for the hearing and cause notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing to be published once each week for two successive weeks prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and shall cause notices of the hearing to be posted in four public places in the city for a like period. [Amended by 1955 c.471 §1; 1963 c.347 §1; 1965 c.509 §1; 1967 c.365 §1; 1967 c.624 §16; 1969 c.78 §1; 1971 c.13 §5; 2007 c.420 §1; 2010 c.41 §1]

 

      222.520 Annexation of less than entire district; assumption of obligations by city conditional. (1) Whenever a part less than the entire area of a district named in ORS 222.510 becomes incorporated as or annexed to a city in accordance with law and the city, after the incorporation or annexation, will provide for the service to the part of the district that the district provided before the incorporation or annexation, the city may cause the part to be withdrawn from the district in the manner set forth in ORS 222.120 or at any time after the incorporation or annexation in the manner set forth in ORS 222.524. Until withdrawn, the part of the district incorporated as or annexed to the city shall continue to be a part of the district.

      (2) The part withdrawn pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is not relieved from liabilities and indebtedness previously contracted by the district. For the purposes of paying the liabilities and indebtedness of the district, property in the part withdrawn shall continue to be subject to assessment and taxation uniformly with property in the area remaining in the district. The city of which it became a part shall, however, assume such obligations if the obligations assumed do not bring the total of the city’s obligations above any applicable limitations prescribed by statute. When the city assumes the obligations it shall be liable to the district for one of the following, at the option of the city:

      (a) The amount of taxes that otherwise would be extended each year for the obligations against the property in the part withdrawn; or

      (b) Payment annually, as the bonds of the district that were outstanding on the effective date of the withdrawal mature, of the same proportion of the outstanding bonds, and the interest on the bonds, as the assessed valuation of the part withdrawn bears to the assessed valuation of the entire district on the effective date of the withdrawal. After the city agrees to make payments under this paragraph, neither the city nor the part withdrawn shall be charged by the district with any future liabilities, obligations or functions of the district. [Amended by 1955 c.471 §2; 1957 c.401 §1; 1963 c.347 §2; 1965 c.509 §2; 1967 c.624 §17; 1985 c.702 §13; 2013 c.277 §1]

 

      222.524 Procedure for withdrawal of part of district from district. (1) If as authorized by ORS 222.520 the governing body of the city elects to cause the withdrawal from a district named in ORS 222.510 of that part of such district theretofore incorporated in or annexed to the city, it shall hold a public hearing on the question of such withdrawal. At the hearing, the governing body of the city shall hear objections to the withdrawal and shall determine whether such withdrawal is for the best interest of the city.

      (2) The governing body shall fix a date, time and place for the hearing and cause notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing to be published once each week for two successive weeks prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and shall cause notices of the hearing to be posted in four public places in the city for a like period.

      (3) After the hearing, the governing body of the city may by ordinance declare that the part of the district which was theretofore incorporated as or annexed to the city is withdrawn from the district.

      (4) The ordinance referred to in subsection (3) of this section is subject to referendum.

      (5) The city may withdraw from all of such districts at the same time in one proceeding under this section or may withdraw from each district in separate proceedings at different times.

      (6) The public hearing and ordinance referred to in this section may be the same as the public hearing and ordinance in ORS 222.120. [1957 c.401 §3; 1963 c.347 §3; 1965 c.509 §3; 1985 c.702 §14]

 

      222.528 Territory withdrawn from district not liable for certain obligations. The liabilities and indebtedness for which a part of a district named in ORS 222.510 remains liable, upon withdrawal by annexation or incorporation as provided in ORS 222.120 or 222.520, shall not include:

      (1) Current operating expenses of the district beyond the fiscal year in which the withdrawal is effective.

      (2) Special tax levies, bond indebtedness or debt service obligations approved in the district subsequent to the withdrawal.

      (3) Any amount which is due beyond the fiscal year in which the withdrawal is effective by reason of a contract for services between the district and another district or municipality where the amount due varies in each fiscal year according to the assessed valuation of the district. [1957 c.573 §2; 1963 c.347 §4; 1965 c.509 §4; 1985 c.702 §15]

 

      222.530 Procedure for division of assets on withdrawal of part of district; arbitration and award. (1) Within 90 days from the date of such withdrawal of part of a rural fire protection district, a highway lighting district, a special road district or a park and recreation district, the governing bodies of the city and the district shall agree upon an equitable division and disposal of the assets of the district. The plan of division of assets shall be arrived at after giving consideration to the assessed valuation of the whole district and the part of it withdrawn, the types of assets, and their location and intended use. However, the plan for division of assets of a rural fire protection district may in no case divide the assets so that the remaining part of the district would have a less favorable fire insurance grade classification, according to filings made pursuant to ORS 737.205, than that which the district had at the time of the withdrawal.

      (2) The remainder of such district shall continue in existence as a district, but may dissolve in the manner provided in the applicable district statutes. After withdrawal, the services for the remaining part may be performed by the remainder of the district acting independently as such; or, such services may be performed by contract with the city, or by agreement of the city directly with the property owners of the remainder if the district determines upon dissolution. If dissolution is determined upon, and the city agrees to furnish service to the remainder of the district, all assets of the district shall become the property of the city.

      (3) If an agreement pursuant to subsection (1) of this section cannot be arrived at within 90 days from the date of withdrawal, upon the request of any party in interest, the county court or board of county commissioners of the county in which the property is situated shall submit the matter to arbitration under ORS 36.600 to 36.740.

      (4) Notice under ORS 36.685 need be made only upon parties in interest who have participated in the arbitration proceedings. An appeal from the award may be taken only to the circuit court for the county in which the property withdrawn is located, subject to further appeal as provided in ORS chapter 19. The functions of the district for the entire preexisting area thereof shall be continued by the district until the final determination of such agreement or arbitration.

      (5) The governing bodies of the city and a rural fire protection district, a special road district or a park and recreation district, as the case may be, may enter into a binding agreement for the joint operation of the fire protection or park and recreation facilities of each that will be beneficial to and equitable for the inhabitants and property owners of each after the withdrawal of part of such districts. [Amended by 1955 c.471 §3; 1957 c.401 §4; 1963 c.347 §5; 1965 c.509 §5; 1969 c.690 §27; 1971 c.13 §6; 2003 c.598 §38]

 

      222.540 Procedure for division of installations on withdrawal of part of water district; appeal; joint operations. (1) When a part of a water district, including a domestic water supply corporation, is withdrawn, the district shall, by action of its governing body, turn over to the city, of which the withdrawn area becomes a part, its water mains, service installations, structures, facilities, improvements and other property in the area withdrawn from the district that are not necessary for the operation of the remainder of the water control or water supply system of the district. All water mains, service installations, reservoirs, structures, facilities, improvements and other property that are necessary for the district to continue maintenance and operation of its water control or water supply system remain the property of the district, regardless of whether they are located within or without the city. If the city is not satisfied with the property division made by the district governing body, or if, within 90 days from the effective date of the withdrawal, the district governing body has failed to make a division, the city’s governing body may request the county court or board of county commissioners of the county in which the property is situated to decide upon the division.

      (2) After giving 10 days’ notice and an opportunity to be heard to the district governing body, the court or board shall, in accordance with the standards of guidance provided in this section for the district governing board, divide the property.

      (3) The decision of the county court or board of commissioners is binding upon all parties in interest, except that an appeal may be taken therefrom for abuse of discretion in arriving at the decision to the circuit court of the county in which the property withdrawn is located within 30 days from the announcement of the decision. The functions of the district must be continued in the entire preexisting area by the district until the final determination of the division of property.

      (4) This section does not prevent the governing bodies of the city and the district from arriving at a binding agreement for a joint operation of the water or other facilities of each that will be beneficial to and equitable for the inhabitants and property owners of each after the withdrawal of part of the water district. [Amended by 1965 c.509 §6; 2007 c.420 §2]

 

      222.550 Withdrawal of greater portion of water district; dissolution optional; transfer of property to city. When the greater portion of a water district including a domestic water supply corporation or a water control district is thus withdrawn, measured by the comparative assessed valuations of the portion withdrawn and the portion remaining in the district, the remainder of the district may dissolve in the manner provided for water districts. If dissolution is determined upon and the city agrees to furnish water or other facilities theretofore provided by the water district to the remainder of the district and if the city agrees to assume the liabilities of the district, then all assets of the district become the property of the city. A city to which the major portion of a water district has been annexed may make such agreement notwithstanding any charter or statute limitation. [Amended by 1965 c.509 §7]

 

      222.560 Procedure for division of installations on withdrawal of part of sanitary district; appeal; joint operation. (1) When a part of a sanitary district is thus withdrawn, the district shall, by action of its governing body, turn over to the city of which the withdrawn area becomes a part, its sewer lines, pumping stations, disposal and any other properties within the area withdrawn from the district that are not necessary for the operation of the remainder of the sewer system of the district. All outfall, trunk and collection lines, pumping stations, disposal and other properties which are necessary for the district to continue maintenance and operation of its sewer and disposal system shall remain the property of the district, regardless of whether they are located within or without the city. If the city is not satisfied with the division of property made by the district governing body, or if, within 90 days from the effective date of the withdrawal, the district governing body has failed to make a division, the city’s governing body may request the county court or board of county commissioners of the county in which the property is situated to decide upon such a division.

      (2) After giving 10 days’ notice and an opportunity to be heard to the district governing body, the court or board shall, in accordance with the standards of guidance provided in this section for the district governing board, divide the property.

      (3) The decision of the court or board shall be binding upon all parties in interest except that an appeal may be taken therefrom for abuse of discretion in arriving at the decision to the circuit court of the county in which the property withdrawn is located within 30 days from the announcement of the decision. The functions of the district shall be continued in the entire preexisting area thereof by the district until the final determination of the division of property.

      (4) This section shall not prevent the governing bodies of the city and the district from arriving at a binding agreement for a joint operation of the sewer, sewage disposal or other properties of each that will be beneficial to and equitable for the inhabitants and property owners of each after the withdrawal of part of the sanitary district.

 

      222.570 Effect on metropolitan sanitary districts. ORS 222.560 shall not prevent the formation of metropolitan sanitary districts which may include cities under authority of other laws.

The agreements referred to in ORS 222.530 (5), 222.540 (4) and 222.560 (4) may be entered into between the city and a district prior to and contingent upon the withdrawal of the annexed or incorporated area from the district under the provisions of ORS 222.524, or they may be made after such withdrawal. [1957 c.401 §5]

 

      222.580 Procedure applicable to prior annexations in which no property division was made. The provisions of ORS 222.510 to 222.570 and 242.050 are applicable to areas annexed to or incorporated as cities prior to March 18, 1949. The procedure provided in those sections may be followed in all cases in which such incorporation or annexation was effective prior to March 18, 1949, and in which no apportionment of property was made by March 18, 1949. As to any such district which has not already been taken over by, or come to an agreement with, the city involved, the effective date of the taking over shall be March 18, 1949, or the date of the agreement arrived at under the standards provided in ORS 222.530 to 222.560.

No cities may become merged unless a majority of the electors of the two cities affected authorize the surrender and merger as provided in ORS 222.620 to 222.680. The elections at which the surrender and merger are authorized in the two cities need not be held simultaneously, but it is sufficient if both are held within a period of one year.

      222.680 Effective date of merger. If the two cities affected vote affirmatively on the question of merger upon the same day, the merger of the two cities shall become effective 30 days after the date on which the elections were held.

However, all county roads lying within the limits of the merged city which have not been laid out or accepted as streets, shall remain county roads until they are laid out or accepted as streets. All debts and liabilities and obligations of the city surrendering its charter shall thereupon be liabilities of the city into which it is merged and the last named city shall thereupon assume all liabilities of the city surrendering its charter. All valid claims against the city surrendering its charter shall thereafter be valid claims against the city into which it is merged. The inhabitants of the city surrendering its charter shall become subject in all respects to the jurisdiction of the authorities of the city into which it is merged. The jurisdiction of any public authority exercised theretofore in the city surrendering its charter, so far as it is in conflict with the corporate authority of the city in which it is merged, shall cease and the city surrendering its charter shall lose its corporate identity entirely. [Amended by 1983 c.350 §50]

 

      222.700 Effect of merger on pending actions and proceedings; street work proceedings.

      (3) This section does not apply if the territory not within a city:

      (a) Is surrounded entirely by water; or

      (b) Is surrounded as provided in subsection (2) of this section, but a portion of the corporate boundaries of the city that consists only of a public right of way, other than Interstate Highway 5, constitutes more than 25 percent of the perimeter of the territory.

      (4) Unless otherwise required by the city charter, annexation by a city under this section must be by ordinance or resolution subject to referendum, with or without the consent of any owner of real property within the territory or resident in the territory.

      (5) For property that is zoned to allow residential use as a permitted use in the zone and is in residential use when annexation is initiated by the city under this section, the city shall specify an effective date for the annexation that is at least three years and not more than 10 years after the date the city proclaims the annexation approved. The city recorder or other officer performing the duties of the city recorder shall:

The property becomes part of the city immediately upon the waiver.

      (7) This section does not limit provisions of a city charter, ordinance or resolution that are more restrictive than the provisions of this section for creating or annexing territory that is surrounded as described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (8) If a city charter, ordinance or resolution requires the city to conduct an election in the city, the city shall allow electors, if any, in the territory proposed to be annexed to vote in the election on the question of annexation. If the governing body of the city finds that a majority of the votes cast in the city and the territory combined favor annexation, the governing body, by ordinance or resolution, shall proclaim the annexation approved. The proclamation shall contain a legal description of each territory annexed. [Amended by 1963 c.444 §1; 1985 c.702 §16; 2007 c.654 §1; 2007 c.706 §1; 2019 c.197 §1; 2019 c.315 §3]

      (4) In determining whether to exclude any area the director may consider whether or not such exclusion would unduly interfere with the removal or alleviation of the danger to public health in the affected territory remaining to be annexed and whether the exclusion would result in an illogical boundary for the extension of services normally provided by an incorporated city.

      (5) The city shall, when requested, aid in the determinations made under subsections (3) and (4) of this section and, if necessary, cause a study to be made.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 222.111 (3), the director, in implementing an order under ORS 222.840 to 222.915, may allow the use of the tax differential authorized by ORS 222.111 (3) for a period not exceeding 15 years with the consent of the affected city.

      (2)(a) With respect to an alternative plan proposed in a petition filed under ORS 222.885 (1), if the authority or commission determines that annexation to the city provides the best and most expeditious method of removing or alleviating the dangerous conditions, the alternative plan shall be rejected and further proceedings on the finding filed under ORS 222.880 shall resume.

      (b) With respect to an alternative plan proposed in a resolution filed under ORS 222.885 (2), if the authority or commission determines that annexation to the city provides the best, most expeditious and most cost-effective method of removing or alleviating the dangerous conditions, the alternative plan shall be rejected and further proceedings on the finding filed under ORS 222.880 shall resume.

      (3) If the authority or commission finds that the alternative plan provides a preferable method of alleviating or removing the dangerous conditions, the petitioners or appropriate governing body shall have six months within which to present to the authority or commission information showing:

      (a) That the territory in which the conditions dangerous to public health exist:

      (A) Has received approval for the extension of a city’s or district’s sewer or water lines within the territory or has annexed to a district authorized by law to provide facilities necessary to remove or alleviate the dangerous conditions, and that financing of the facilities for extension of such facilities to the territory has been assured; or

      (B) Has taken substantial steps to implement the alternative plan.

      (b) Detailed plans and specifications for the construction of any proposed facilities.

      (c) A time schedule for the construction of any proposed facilities.

      (4)(a) The authority or commission shall review the final plan proposed by the petitioners, city or district and shall promptly certify whether the requirements of subsection (3) of this section have been met.

      (b) If the requirements have been met, the authority shall certify the alternative plan. Further annexation proceedings on the findings filed under ORS 222.880 shall be suspended and the city shall be so notified.

      (c) If the requirements of subsection (3) of this section have not been met or whenever the authority or commission determines that the requirements of the certified plan are not being satisfied, further proceedings on the findings filed under ORS 222.880 shall resume.

      222.905 Proposal or petition for annexation. (1) If a local board of health believes that a danger to public health exists within a territory within its jurisdiction that is otherwise eligible for annexation in accordance with ORS 222.111, the board shall proceed in the same manner as a city is authorized to proceed under ORS 222.860.

      (2)(a) Forty percent of the residents of territory otherwise eligible for annexation in accordance with ORS 222.111 who believe a danger to public health exists within the territory may petition the local board of health to initiate proceedings to annex the territory as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) The local board of health shall investigate the matters alleged in the petition within 90 days after receiving the petition and shall either initiate proceedings to annex the territory or certify to the petitioners that the investigation disclosed insufficient evidence to initiate proceedings.

      (3)(a)(A) At any time before the annexation of territory initiated under subsection (2) of this section is final, the petition shall be withdrawn if a number of petitioners described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph provides the local board of health with a copy of an alternative plan that meets the requirements of ORS 222.885 (1)(c).

      (B) The required number of petitioners under this paragraph is any number that, if subtracted from the number of petitioners who signed the petition under subsection (2) of this section, would reduce the total number of petitioners below 40 percent of the residents of the territory.

      (b) If a petition is withdrawn under paragraph (a) of this subsection before the Director of the Oregon Health Authority finds that a danger to public health exists in the territory under ORS 222.880, the Oregon Health Authority and the local board of health shall terminate all proceedings under ORS 222.840 to 222.915 with respect to the territory that was the subject of the petition.

      (c) If a petition is withdrawn under paragraph (a) of this subsection after the director finds that a danger to public health exists in the territory under ORS 222.880, the alternative plan provided under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be evaluated by the authority or the Environmental Quality Commission pursuant to the standards described in ORS 222.890.

      Sec. 4. (1) The amendments to ORS 222.885, 222.890 and 222.905 by sections 1 to 3 of this 2015 Act apply to proceedings initiated pursuant to ORS 222.840 to 222.915 in which the annexation of affected territory to a city or district, or the extraterritorial extension of city or district services to affected territory, is not final before the effective date of this 2015 Act [June 8, 2015].

      (2) The amendments to ORS 222.905 (2) by section 3 of this 2015 Act apply to petitions filed before, on or after the effective date of this 2015 Act that relate to proceedings described in subsection (1) of this section. A petition described in this subsection that does not meet the 40 percent requirement under ORS 222.905 (2) is not valid for any purpose.

      (3) For purposes of this section, annexation or extension is final if all necessary actions under ORS 222.840 to 222.915 have been completed and judicial review under ORS 222.896 is no longer available because of lapse of time or issuance of an order from which there is no further appeal. [2015 c.281 §4]

No officer or employee of the Oregon Health Authority who owns property or resides within affected territory that is subject to proceedings under the provisions of ORS 222.840 to 222.915 shall participate in an official capacity in any investigation, hearing or recommendation relating to such proceedings. If the Director of the Oregon Health Authority is such a person, the director shall so inform the Governor, who shall appoint another person to fulfill the duties of the director in any investigation, hearing or recommendation relating to such proceeding. [1975 c.639 §17 (enacted in lieu of 222.910); 2009 c.595 §191]

 

      222.915 Application of ORS 222.840 to 222.915. The provisions of ORS 222.840 to 222.915 do not apply to proceedings to annex territory to any city if the charter or ordinances of the city conflict with or are inconsistent with ORS 222.840 to 222.915. [1967 c.624 §12; 1971 c.673 §5]
