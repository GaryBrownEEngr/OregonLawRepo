      (2) The provisions of the Bancroft Bonding Act are not mandatory. Any governmental body having charter provisions, or ordinance provisions authorized by charter, for bonding improvement assessments and selling bonds may follow those provisions or the provisions of the Bancroft Bonding Act, or the provisions of any other statute.

      (3) All bonds issued prior to March 20, 1939, in accordance with the charter provisions of any city which, as of March 20, 1939, has or after that date attains a population of 100,000 or more inhabitants, according to the published federal census, and all action taken and proceedings adopted by a city prior to that date for issuing bonds in accordance with charter provisions are ratified, approved and confirmed.

[1977 c.722 §2]

 

      223.208 System development and connection charges of local government subject to Bancroft Bonding Act. (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the rights and duties accorded local governments and the owners of property for financing and assessments under ORS 223.205 to 223.775 shall apply to the following:

      (a) A system development charge designed to finance the purchase or development of a public park or recreational facility or the construction, extension or enlargement of a street, community water supply, storm sewer or sewerage or disposal system as defined in ORS 199.464 imposed by a local government as a condition to issuance of any occupancy permit or imposed by a local government at such other time as, by ordinance, it may determine.

      (b) That portion of a connection charge imposed by a local government that is greater than the amount necessary to reimburse the local government for its costs of inspection and installing connections with system mains.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 223.230, the financing of system development or connection charges under this section may, at the option of the governing body, be a second lien on real property, which lien shall be inferior only to the mortgage or other security interest held by the lender of the owner’s purchase money. Bonds issued under this subsection shall be issued separately from bonds otherwise issued under ORS 223.205 to 223.775 and shall comply with all applicable federal regulations. [1977 c.722 §3; 1979 c.837 §1; 1983 c.349 §1; 1991 c.902 §8; 1997 c.249 §62; 2001 c.662 §1; 2003 c.802 §4]

The notice shall identify the local improvement for which the assessment is to be made, each lot to be assessed and the final assessment for each lot. In addition, the notice shall state that the owner of any property to be assessed shall have the right to make application to the local government for payment of the final assessment in installments as provided in this section.

      223.212 Right of educational, religious, fraternal or charitable organizations and public corporations to bond the assessment. Any educational, religious, fraternal or charitable organization or public corporation owning property assessed for its proportionate share of the cost of constructing a local improvement shall have the same right to bond the final assessment therefor and having bonded the final assessment shall be subject to the same duties and liabilities as a natural person bonding an assessment. However, the limitations on the amount of an assessment that may be bonded do not apply to an educational, religious, fraternal or charitable organization or public corporation. The organization or public corporation shall be permitted to bond to the full extent of the assessment. [1957 c.95 §2; 1991 c.902 §10]

      (c) The application shall also provide that the applicant acknowledges and agrees to pay interest at the rate provided by the governing body of the local government on all unpaid assessments, together with an amount, determined by the governing body, sufficient to pay a proportionate part of the cost of administering the bond assessment program and issuing the bonds authorized under ORS 223.235, including but not limited to legal, printing and consultant’s fees.

      (d) The application shall also contain a statement, by lots or blocks, or other convenient description, of the property of the applicant assessed for the improvement.

      (2) In connection with the final assessments for any local improvement, the governing body of the local government may establish a procedure by which an owner of any property to be assessed may irrevocably elect in writing to have the final assessment levied for a number of years less than 10, which shall be determined by the governing body. The written election shall:

      (a) Be signed by the owner or a duly authorized representative of the owner;

      (3) The election under subsection (2) of this section shall be recorded in the bond lien docket for the local improvement to which the assessment relates.

The entries shall be made as of the date of initial determination and levy of the final assessment.

      (2) The docket shall stand thereafter as a lien docket as for ad valorem property taxes assessed and levied in favor of the local government against each lot or parcel of land or other property, until paid, for the following:

      (a) For the amounts of the unpaid final assessments therein docketed, with interest on the installments of the final assessments at the rate determined by the governing body of the local government under ORS 223.215; and

      (b) For any additional interest or penalties imposed by the local government with respect to any installments of final assessments that are not paid when due.

      (3) All unpaid final assessments together with accrued and unpaid interest and penalties are a lien on each lot or parcel of land or other property, respectively, in favor of the local government, and the lien shall have priority over all other liens and encumbrances whatsoever.

      (4) For a local improvement district assessment lien or system development charge installment payment contract lien to continue, each local government shall make the appropriate lien record, as prescribed by this section and ORS 223.393, available on hard copy or through an online electronic medium.

      223.235 Issuance of bonds; limitations. (1) When in any local government a bond lien docket is made up, as provided in ORS 223.230, as to the final assessments for any local improvement, the local government shall by ordinance or resolution of the governing body authorize the issue of its bonds pursuant to the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 287A and in accordance with this section.

      (2) The bonds authorized to be issued under this section must be issued in an amount that does not exceed the unpaid balance of all final assessments for the related local improvements, plus the amounts necessary to fund any debt service reserve and to pay any other financing costs associated with the bonds.

      (3)(a) If the question of the issuance of the specific bonds has been approved by the electors of the local government and the bonds are issued as general obligation bonds, the local government shall each year assess, levy and collect a tax on all taxable property within its boundaries. The amount of the tax must be sufficient to pay all principal of and interest on the bonds that are due and payable in that year and to replenish any debt service reserves required for the bonds. In computing the amount of taxes to impose, the local government shall:

      (A) Deduct from the total amount otherwise required the amount of final installment payments that are pledged to the payment of the bonds and that are due and payable in that year; and

      (B) Add to this net amount the amount of reasonably anticipated delinquencies in the payments of the installments or the taxes.

      (b) The taxes must be levied in each year and returned to the county officer whose duty it is to extend the tax roll within the time and in the manner provided in ORS 310.060.

      (c) The taxes become payable at the same time and are collected by the same officer who collects county taxes and must be turned over to the local government according to law.

      (d) The county officer whose duty it is to extend the county levy shall extend the levy of the local government in the same manner as city taxes are extended. Property may be sold for nonpayment of the taxes levied by a local government in like manner and with like effect as in the case of county and state taxes.

      (4)(a) All bonds issued pursuant to this section, including general obligation bonds, are secured by and payable from the installments of final assessments with respect to which the bonds were issued.

      (b) In the ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, the governing body of the issuing local government may:

      (A) Provide that installments of final assessments levied with respect to two or more local improvements shall secure a single issue of bonds.

      (B) Reserve the right to pledge, as security for any bonds thereafter issued pursuant to this section, any installments of final assessments previously pledged as security for other bonds issued pursuant to this section.

      (c) All bonds must be secured by a lien on the installments of final assessments with respect to which they were issued. The lien is valid, binding and fully perfected from the date of issuance of the bonds. The installments of final assessments are immediately subject to the lien without the physical delivery thereof, the filing of any notice or any further act. The lien is valid, binding and fully perfected against all persons having claims of any kind against the local government or the property assessed whether in tort, contract or otherwise, and irrespective of whether the persons have notice of the lien.

      (5) As additional security for any bonds issued under this section, including general obligation bonds, the governing body of the issuing local government may pledge or mortgage, or grant security interests in, its revenues, assets and properties, and otherwise secure and enter into covenants with respect to the bonds as provided in ORS chapter 287A.

      (6)(a) A local government may, from time to time after the undertaking of a local improvement has been authorized, borrow money and issue and sell notes for the purpose of providing interim financing for the actual costs of the local improvement.

      (b) Notes authorized under this subsection may be issued in a single series for the purpose of providing interim financing for two or more local improvements.

      (c) Notes authorized under this subsection may not mature later than one year after the date upon which the issuing local government expects to issue bonds for the purpose of providing permanent financing with respect to installment payments of the final assessments for the local improvements.

      (d) Any notes authorized under this subsection may be refunded from time to time by the issuance of additional notes or out of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section. The notes may be made payable from the proceeds of any bonds to be issued under this section to provide permanent financing or from any other sources from which the bonds are payable.

      (e) The governing body of the issuing local government may pledge to the payment of the notes any revenues that may be pledged to the payment of bonds authorized to be issued under this section with respect to the local improvements for which the notes provide interim financing.

[Amended by 1957 c.103 §9; 1975 c.642 §5; 1983 c.349 §6; 1991 c.902 §16; 2003 c.802 §10]

 

      223.262 Assessment contracts; transfer of contract rights by local government; use of proceeds. (1) As used in ORS 223.205 and 223.210 to 223.295:

      (a) “Assessment contract” means the obligation to pay final assessments in installments that arise when a property owner submits an application to pay assessments in installments under ORS 223.210 or a similar provision of a local charter.

      (b) “Assessment contract rights” includes the right to receive installment payments of final assessments, with interest, made under an assessment contract, and the right to enforce the lien of the final assessment.

      (2) Any local government that receives or expects to receive assessment contracts may:

      (a) Sell or assign to third parties all or any portion of its assessment contract rights.

      (b) Create corporations or other business entities to factor assessment contract rights.

      (c) Create grantor trusts and transfer to the trusts assessment contract rights.

      (d) Contract to service assessment contracts and assessment liens for the owners of assessment contract rights, or contract with third parties to service assessment contracts and assessment liens for the owners of assessment contract rights.

      (5) If assessment contract rights that secure outstanding obligations of a local government are sold or assigned under this section, an amount shall be placed irrevocably in escrow that is calculated to be sufficient to pay all principal and interest on the outstanding obligations as they mature or are irrevocably called for prior redemption. Any sale proceeds not required to fund the escrow may be placed in the general fund of the local government. If only a portion of the contract rights securing outstanding obligations is sold, then the amount of outstanding obligations that must be defeased pursuant to this subsection shall be that proportion of the principal amount of the outstanding obligations that the principal amount of the contract rights that are sold represents to the total principal amount of the contract rights that secure the outstanding obligations. [1989 c.603 §2; 1991 c.902 §17; 2003 c.802 §11; 2007 c.783 §75]

 

      223.265 Payment of installments; due dates. (1) The installments due and payable under an assessment contract shall be due and payable periodically as the governing body of the local government shall determine but shall not be due and payable over a term in excess of 30 years. Each installment is due and payable with interest as described under subsection (3) of this section.

      (2) The installments and interest are payable to the treasurer by the property owner whose application to pay the cost of the local improvement by installments has been filed as provided in ORS 223.210.

      (3) The amount of each installment (percentage of the total final assessment) shall be determined by the governing body of the local government and shall be as appears by the bond lien docket described in ORS 223.230. Each installment shall be due and payable with the accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid balance of the final assessment amount at the rate per annum determined by the governing body of the local government under ORS 223.215.

      (4) The first payment shall be due and payable on the date that the governing body shall determine, and subsequent payments shall be due and payable on subsequent periodic dates thereafter as shall have been determined by the governing body.

      223.270 Procedure for collection on default. (1) If the owner neglects or refuses to pay installments under ORS 223.265 as they become due and payable for a period of one year, then the governing body of the local government may, by reason of the neglect or refusal to pay the installments, and while the neglect and refusal to pay continues, pass a resolution:

      (a) Giving the name of the owner then in default in the payment of the sums due;

      (b) Stating the sums due, either principal or interest and any unpaid late payment penalties or charges;

      (c) Containing a description of the property upon which the sums are owing; and

      (d) Declaring the whole sum, both principal and interest, due and payable at once.

      (2) The governing body may then proceed at once to collect all unpaid installments and to enforce collection thereof, with all unpaid late payment penalties and charges added thereto, in the same manner in which delinquent property taxes are collected under applicable law or, in the case of a city, in the same manner as street and sewer assessments are collected pursuant to the terms of the city charter. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §19; 2003 c.802 §13]

 

      223.275 Notice to pay; receipts and entries on lien docket. The recorder of a local government shall, when installments and interest on any final assessment in the bond lien docket are due, make the proper extensions of the installments and interest on the bond lien docket and turn the same over to the treasurer of the local government. The treasurer then shall notify the property owner that the installments are due and payable, but a failure of any owner to receive the notice shall not prevent collection of the installment as provided in ORS 223.270. The treasurer shall issue a receipt to the person paying the installments and interest, and shall file duplicates of the receipts with the recorder. When the treasurer returns the bond lien docket, the recorder shall make the proper entries on the bond lien docket showing the amount of each payment and the date of the payment. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §20; 2003 c.802 §14]

 

      223.280 Right of owner to prepay balance and discharge lien. At any time after issuance of bonds under ORS 223.235, any owner of a lot against which the final assessment is made and lien docketed may pay into the treasury of the issuing local government the whole amount of the final assessment for which the lien is docketed, together with the full amount of interest and late payment penalties and charges accrued thereon to the date of payment. Upon producing to the recorder of the local government the receipt of the treasurer, the recorder shall enter in the lien docket opposite the entry of the lien the fact and date of the payment and that the lien is discharged. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §21; 2003 c.802 §15]

 

      223.285 Separate funds kept for moneys received; investments authorized. Any treasurer receiving any payments of final assessments or interest on unpaid installments by virtue of the Bancroft Bonding Act, shall account for the payments separately from other funds of the local government. The amount of the moneys paid on account of installments, interest on unpaid installments and late payment penalties or charges, shall be placed to the credit of a fund to be known and designated as “Bancroft Bond Redemption Fund” or in any designated account of the redemption fund that may be established by the local government under this section. All interest and principal due on bonds issued under ORS 223.235 shall be paid from the redemption fund or from a designated account of the redemption fund. The amount placed to the credit of the redemption fund or any account of the fund shall from time to time, under the direction of the governing body of the issuing local government, be invested as provided in ORS 294.035 or 294.805 to 294.895. [Amended by 1975 c.495 §1; 1991 c.902 §22; 2003 c.802 §16]

 

      223.290 Payments entered on lien docket; lien discharge. Entries of payments of installments, interest and late payment penalties or charges, made under the Bancroft Bonding Act, shall be made in the lien docket as they are received, with the date of payment. The payments so made and entered shall discharge the lien to the amount of the payment and from the date of the payment. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §23; 1995 c.709 §3; 1997 c.840 §3]

 

      223.295 Limit on city indebtedness. (1) A city may incur indebtedness in the form of general obligation bonds and general obligation interim financing notes pursuant to ORS 223.235 to an amount which shall not exceed 0.03 of the latest real market valuation of the city.

      (2) The general obligation bonds and general obligation interim financing notes issued pursuant to ORS 223.235 shall be determined by deducting from the sum total of outstanding general obligation bonds and general obligation interim financing notes issued pursuant to ORS 223.235, the aggregate of sinking funds or other funds applicable to the payment thereof, less the aggregate of overdrafts, if any, in the related improvement bond interest fund. [Amended by 1955 c.28 §1; 1955 c.686 §1; 1959 c.653 §7; 1963 c.545 §2; 1965 c.282 §3; 1985 c.441 §1; 1991 c.459 §351; 1991 c.902 §24]

 

SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES

 

      223.297 Policy. The purpose of ORS 223.297 to 223.314 is to provide a uniform framework for the imposition of system development charges by local governments, to provide equitable funding for orderly growth and development in Oregon’s communities and to establish that the charges may be used only for capital improvements. [1989 c.449 §1; 1991 c.902 §25; 2003 c.765 §1; 2003 c.802 §17]

 

      Note: 223.297 to 223.314 were added to and made a part of 223.205 to 223.295 by legislative action, but were not added to and made a part of the Bancroft Bonding Act. See section 10, chapter 449, Oregon Laws 1989.

 

      223.299 Definitions for ORS 223.297 to 223.314. As used in ORS 223.297 to 223.314:

      (1)(a) “Capital improvement” means facilities or assets used for the following:

      (A) Water supply, treatment and distribution;

      (B) Waste water collection, transmission, treatment and disposal;

      (C) Drainage and flood control;

      (D) Transportation; or

      (E) Parks and recreation.

      (b) “Capital improvement” does not include costs of the operation or routine maintenance of capital improvements.

      (2) “Improvement fee” means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements to be constructed.

      (3) “Reimbursement fee” means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements already constructed, or under construction when the fee is established, for which the local government determines that capacity exists.

      (4)(a) “System development charge” means a reimbursement fee, an improvement fee or a combination thereof assessed or collected at the time of increased usage of a capital improvement or issuance of a development permit, building permit or connection to the capital improvement. “System development charge” includes that portion of a sewer or water system connection charge that is greater than the amount necessary to reimburse the local government for its average cost of inspecting and installing connections with water and sewer facilities.

      (b) “System development charge” does not include any fees assessed or collected as part of a local improvement district or a charge in lieu of a local improvement district assessment, or the cost of complying with requirements or conditions imposed upon a land use decision, expedited land division or limited land use decision. [1989 c.449 §2; 1991 c.817 §29; 1991 c.902 §26; 1995 c.595 §28; 2003 c.765 §2a; 2003 c.802 §18]

 

      Note: See note under 223.297.

 

      223.300 [Repealed by 1975 c.642 §26]

 

      223.301 Certain system development charges and methodologies prohibited. (1) As used in this section, “employer” means any person who contracts to pay remuneration for, and secures the right to direct and control the services of, any person.

      (2) A local government may not establish or impose a system development charge that requires an employer to pay a reimbursement fee or an improvement fee based on:

      (a) The number of individuals hired by the employer after a specified date; or

      (b) A methodology that assumes that costs are necessarily incurred for capital improvements when an employer hires an additional employee.

      (3) A methodology set forth in an ordinance or resolution that establishes an improvement fee or a reimbursement fee shall not include or incorporate any method or system under which the payment of the fee or the amount of the fee is determined by the number of employees of an employer without regard to new construction, new development or new use of an existing structure by the employer. [1999 c.1098 §2; 2003 c.802 §19]

 

      Note: See note under 223.297.

 

      223.302 System development charges; use of revenues; review procedures. (1) Local governments are authorized to establish system development charges, but the revenues produced therefrom must be expended only in accordance with ORS 223.297 to 223.314. If a local government expends revenues from system development charges in violation of the limitations described in ORS 223.307, the local government shall replace the misspent amount with moneys derived from sources other than system development charges. Replacement moneys must be deposited in a fund designated for the system development charge revenues not later than one year following a determination that the funds were misspent.

      (2) Local governments shall adopt administrative review procedures by which any citizen or other interested person may challenge an expenditure of system development charge revenues. Such procedures shall provide that such a challenge must be filed within two years of the expenditure of the system development charge revenues. The decision of the local government shall be judicially reviewed only as provided in ORS 34.010 to 34.100.

      (3)(a) A local government must advise a person who makes a written objection to the calculation of a system development charge of the right to petition for review pursuant to ORS 34.010 to 34.100.

      (b) If a local government has adopted an administrative review procedure for objections to the calculation of a system development charge, the local government shall provide adequate notice regarding the procedure for review to a person who makes a written objection to the calculation of a system development charge. [1989 c.449 §3; 1991 c.902 §27; 2001 c.662 §2; 2003 c.765 §3; 2003 c.802 §20]

 

      Note: See note under 223.297.

 

      223.304 Determination of amount of system development charges; methodology; credit allowed against charge; limitation of action contesting methodology for imposing charge; notification request. (1)(a) Reimbursement fees must be established or modified by ordinance or resolution setting forth a methodology that is, when applicable, based on:

      (A) Ratemaking principles employed to finance publicly owned capital improvements;

      (B) Prior contributions by existing users;

      (C) Gifts or grants from federal or state government or private persons;

      (D) The value of unused capacity available to future system users or the cost of the existing facilities; and

      (E) Other relevant factors identified by the local government imposing the fee.

      (b) The methodology for establishing or modifying a reimbursement fee must:

      (A) Promote the objective of future system users contributing no more than an equitable share to the cost of existing facilities.

      (B) Be available for public inspection.

      (2) Improvement fees must:

      (a) Be established or modified by ordinance or resolution setting forth a methodology that is available for public inspection and demonstrates consideration of:

      (A) The projected cost of the capital improvements identified in the plan and list adopted pursuant to ORS 223.309 that are needed to increase the capacity of the systems to which the fee is related; and

      (B) The need for increased capacity in the system to which the fee is related that will be required to serve the demands placed on the system by future users.

      (b) Be calculated to obtain the cost of capital improvements for the projected need for available system capacity for future users.

      (3) A local government may establish and impose a system development charge that is a combination of a reimbursement fee and an improvement fee, if the methodology demonstrates that the charge is not based on providing the same system capacity.

      (4) The ordinance or resolution that establishes or modifies an improvement fee shall also provide for a credit against such fee for the construction of a qualified public improvement. A “qualified public improvement” means a capital improvement that is required as a condition of development approval, identified in the plan and list adopted pursuant to ORS 223.309 and either:

      (a) Not located on or contiguous to property that is the subject of development approval; or

      (b) Located in whole or in part on or contiguous to property that is the subject of development approval and required to be built larger or with greater capacity than is necessary for the particular development project to which the improvement fee is related.

      (5)(a) The credit provided for in subsection (4) of this section is only for the improvement fee charged for the type of improvement being constructed, and credit for qualified public improvements under subsection (4)(b) of this section may be granted only for the cost of that portion of such improvement that exceeds the local government’s minimum standard facility size or capacity needed to serve the particular development project or property. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that a particular improvement qualifies for credit under subsection (4)(b) of this section.

      (b) A local government may deny the credit provided for in subsection (4) of this section if the local government demonstrates:

      (A) That the application does not meet the requirements of subsection (4) of this section; or

      (B) By reference to the list adopted pursuant to ORS 223.309, that the improvement for which credit is sought was not included in the plan and list adopted pursuant to ORS 223.309.

      (c) When the construction of a qualified public improvement gives rise to a credit amount greater than the improvement fee that would otherwise be levied against the project receiving development approval, the excess credit may be applied against improvement fees that accrue in subsequent phases of the original development project. This subsection does not prohibit a local government from providing a greater credit, or from establishing a system providing for the transferability of credits, or from providing a credit for a capital improvement not identified in the plan and list adopted pursuant to ORS 223.309, or from providing a share of the cost of such improvement by other means, if a local government so chooses.

      (d) Credits must be used in the time specified in the ordinance but not later than 10 years from the date the credit is given.

      (6) Any local government that proposes to establish or modify a system development charge shall maintain a list of persons who have made a written request for notification prior to adoption or amendment of a methodology for any system development charge.

      (7)(a) Written notice must be mailed to persons on the list at least 90 days prior to the first hearing to establish or modify a system development charge, and the methodology supporting the system development charge must be available at least 60 days prior to the first hearing. The failure of a person on the list to receive a notice that was mailed does not invalidate the action of the local government. The local government may periodically delete names from the list, but at least 30 days prior to removing a name from the list shall notify the person whose name is to be deleted that a new written request for notification is required if the person wishes to remain on the notification list.

      (b) Legal action intended to contest the methodology used for calculating a system development charge may not be filed after 60 days following adoption or modification of the system development charge ordinance or resolution by the local government. A person shall request judicial review of the methodology used for calculating a system development charge only as provided in ORS 34.010 to 34.100.

      (8) A change in the amount of a reimbursement fee or an improvement fee is not a modification of the system development charge methodology if the change in amount is based on:

      (a) A change in the cost of materials, labor or real property applied to projects or project capacity as set forth on the list adopted pursuant to ORS 223.309; or

      (b) The periodic application of one or more specific cost indexes or other periodic data sources. A specific cost index or periodic data source must be:

      (A) A relevant measurement of the average change in prices or costs over an identified time period for materials, labor, real property or a combination of the three;

      (B) Published by a recognized organization or agency that produces the index or data source for reasons that are independent of the system development charge methodology; and

      (C) Incorporated as part of the established methodology or identified and adopted in a separate ordinance, resolution or order. [1989 c.449 §4; 1991 c.902 §28; 1993 c.804 §20; 2001 c.662 §3; 2003 c.765 §§4a,5a; 2003 c.802 §21]

      223.305 [Repealed by 1971 c.325 §1]

 

      223.307 Authorized expenditure of system development charges. (1) Reimbursement fees may be spent only on capital improvements associated with the systems for which the fees are assessed including expenditures relating to repayment of indebtedness.

      (2) Improvement fees may be spent only on capacity increasing capital improvements, including expenditures relating to repayment of debt for such improvements. An increase in system capacity may be established if a capital improvement increases the level of performance or service provided by existing facilities or provides new facilities. The portion of the improvements funded by improvement fees must be related to the need for increased capacity to provide service for future users.

      (3) System development charges may not be expended for costs associated with the construction of administrative office facilities that are more than an incidental part of other capital improvements or for the expenses of the operation or maintenance of the facilities constructed with system development charge revenues.

      (4) Any capital improvement being funded wholly or in part with system development charge revenues must be included in the plan and list adopted by a local government pursuant to ORS 223.309.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, system development charge revenues may be expended on the costs of complying with the provisions of ORS 223.297 to 223.314, including the costs of developing system development charge methodologies and providing an annual accounting of system development charge expenditures. [1989 c.449 §5; 1991 c.902 §29; 2003 c.765 §6; 2003 c.802 §22]

 

      Note: See note under 223.297.

 

      223.309 Preparation of plan for capital improvements financed by system development charges; modification. (1) Prior to the establishment of a system development charge by ordinance or resolution, a local government shall prepare a capital improvement plan, public facilities plan, master plan or comparable plan that includes a list of the capital improvements that the local government intends to fund, in whole or in part, with revenues from an improvement fee and the estimated cost, timing and percentage of costs eligible to be funded with revenues from the improvement fee for each improvement.

      (2) A local government that has prepared a plan and the list described in subsection (1) of this section may modify the plan and list at any time. If a system development charge will be increased by a proposed modification of the list to include a capacity increasing capital improvement, as described in ORS 223.307 (2):

      (a) The local government shall provide, at least 30 days prior to the adoption of the modification, notice of the proposed modification to the persons who have requested written notice under ORS 223.304 (6).

      (b) The local government shall hold a public hearing if the local government receives a written request for a hearing on the proposed modification within seven days of the date the proposed modification is scheduled for adoption.

      (c) Notwithstanding ORS 294.160, a public hearing is not required if the local government does not receive a written request for a hearing.

      (d) The decision of a local government to increase the system development charge by modifying the list may be judicially reviewed only as provided in ORS 34.010 to 34.100. [1989 c.449 §6; 1991 c.902 §30; 2001 c.662 §4; 2003 c.765 §7a; 2003 c.802 §23]

      223.311 Deposit of system development charge revenues; annual accounting. (1) System development charge revenues must be deposited in accounts designated for such moneys. The local government shall provide an annual accounting, to be completed by January 1 of each year, for system development charges showing the total amount of system development charge revenues collected for each system and the projects that were funded in the previous fiscal year.

      (2) The local government shall include in the annual accounting:

      (a) A list of the amount spent on each project funded, in whole or in part, with system development charge revenues; and

      (b) The amount of revenue collected by the local government from system development charges and attributed to the costs of complying with the provisions of ORS 223.297 to 223.314, as described in ORS 223.307. [1989 c.449 §7; 1991 c.902 §31; 2001 c.662 §5; 2003 c.765 §8a; 2003 c.802 §24]

APPORTIONMENT OF GOVERNMENT ASSESSMENTS UPON PARTITION

 

      223.317 Apportionment of special assessment among parcels in subsequent partition of tract. (1) Notwithstanding any other law, a local government may apportion a final assessment levied by it against a single tract or parcel of real property among all the parcels formed from a subsequent partition or other division of that tract or parcel, if the subsequent partition or division is in accordance with ORS 92.010 to 92.192 and is consistent with all applicable comprehensive plans as acknowledged by the Land Conservation and Development Commission under ORS 197.251. The proportionate distribution of a final assessment authorized under this subsection may be made whenever the final assessment remains wholly or partially unpaid, and full payment or an installment payment is not due.

      (2) A local government shall apportion a final assessment under this section when requested to do so by any owner, mortgagee or lienholder of a parcel of real property that was formed from the partition or other division of the larger tract of real property against which the final assessment was originally levied. When the deed, mortgage or other instrument evidencing the applicant’s ownership or other interest in the parcel has not been recorded by the county clerk of the county in which the parcel is situated, the local government shall not apportion the final assessment unless the applicant files a true copy of that deed, mortgage or instrument with the local government.

      (3) Apportionment of a final assessment under this section shall be done in accordance with an order or resolution of the governing body of the local government. The order or resolution shall describe each parcel of real property affected by the apportionment, the amount of the final assessment levied against each parcel, the owner of each parcel and such additional information as is required to keep a permanent and complete record of the final assessments and the payments thereon. A copy of the order or resolution shall be filed with the recorder required to maintain the lien docket for the local government, who shall make any necessary changes or entries in the lien docket for the local government.

      223.322 Proration of unpaid installments. When a final assessment is being paid in installments under the Bancroft Bonding Act or ORS 450.897, if the final assessment is apportioned among smaller parcels of real property under ORS 223.317 to 223.327, the installments remaining unpaid shall be prorated among those smaller parcels so that each parcel shall be charged with that percentage of the remaining installment payments equal to the percentage of the unpaid final assessment charged to the parcel upon apportionment.

ASSESSMENTS FOR LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS

 

      223.387 Description of real property; effect of error in name of owner. In levying, collecting and enforcing assessments for local improvement, the following shall apply:

      (1) Real property may be described by giving the subdivision according to the United States survey when coincident with the boundaries thereof, or by lots, blocks and addition names, or by giving the boundaries thereof by metes and bounds, or by reference to the book and page of any public record of the county where the description may be found, or by designation of tax lot number referring to a record kept by the assessor of descriptions of real properties of the county, which record shall constitute a public record, or in any other manner as to cause the description to be capable of being made certain. Initial letters, abbreviations, figures, fractions and exponents, to designate the township, range, section, or part of a section, or the number of any lot or block or part thereof, or any distance, course, bearing or direction, may be employed in any description of real property.

      (2) If the owner of any land is unknown, the land may be assessed to “unknown owner,” or “unknown owners.” If the property is correctly described, no final assessment shall be invalidated by a mistake in the name of the owner of the real property assessed or by the omission of the name of the owner or the entry of a name other than that of the true owner. Where the name of the true owner, or the owner of record, of any parcel of real property is given, the final assessment shall not be held invalid on account of any error or irregularity in the description if the description would be sufficient in a deed of conveyance from the owner, or is such that, in a suit to enforce a contract to convey, employing such description a court of equity would hold it to be good and sufficient.

      (3) Any description of real property which conforms substantially to the requirements of this section shall be a sufficient description in all proceedings of assessment relating or leading to a final assessment for a local improvement, foreclosure and sale of delinquent assessments, and in any other proceeding related to or connected with levying, collecting and enforcing final assessments for special benefits to the property. [1959 c.219 §1; 1965 c.282 §4; 1971 c.198 §1; 1991 c.902 §36]

 

      223.389 Procedure in making local assessments for local improvements. (1) The governing body of a local government may prescribe by ordinance or resolution the procedure to be followed in making estimated assessments and final assessments for benefits from a local improvement upon the lots that have been benefited by all or part of the local improvement, to the extent that the charter of the local government does not prescribe the method of procedure. In addition, in any case where the charter of a local government specifies a method of procedure that does not comply or is not consistent with the requirements of the Oregon Constitution, the governing body of the local government may prescribe by ordinance or resolution the procedure that shall comply and be consistent with the requirements of the Oregon Constitution, and the provisions of the ordinance or resolution shall apply in lieu of the charter provisions.

      (2)(a) The ordinance or resolution prescribing the procedure shall provide for adoption or enactment of an ordinance or resolution designating the local improvement as to which an assessment is contemplated, describing the boundaries of the district to be assessed. Provision shall be made for at least 10 days’ notice to owners of property within the proposed district in which the local improvement is contemplated. The notice may be made by posting, by newspaper publication or by mail, or by any combination of such methods. The notice shall specify the time and place where the governing body will hear and consider objections or remonstrances to the proposed local improvement by any parties aggrieved thereby.

      (b) If the governing body determines that the local improvement shall be made, when the estimated cost thereof is ascertained on the basis of the contract award or the departmental cost of the local government, the governing body shall determine whether the property benefited shall bear all or a portion of the cost. The recorder or other person designated by the governing body shall prepare the estimated assessment to the respective lots within the assessment district and file it in the appropriate office of the local government. Notice of the estimated assessment shall be mailed or personally delivered to the owner of each lot proposed to be assessed. The notice shall state the amounts of the estimated assessment proposed on that property and shall fix a date by which time objections shall be filed with the recorder. Any objection shall state the grounds for the objection. The governing body shall consider the objections and grounds and may adopt, correct, modify or revise the estimated assessments.

      (c) The governing body shall determine the amount of estimated assessment to be charged against each lot within the district, according to the special and peculiar benefits accruing to the lot from the local improvement, and shall by ordinance or resolution spread the estimated assessments. [1959 c.219 §2; 1991 c.902 §37; 2003 c.802 §28]

 

      223.391 Notice of proposed assessment to owner of affected lot. If a notice is required to be sent to the owner of a lot affected by a proposed assessment, the notice shall be addressed to the owner or the owner’s agent. If the address of the owner or of the owner’s agent is unknown to the recorder, the recorder shall mail the notice addressed to the owner or the owner’s agent at the address where the property is located. Any mistake, error, omission or failure with respect to the mailing shall not be jurisdictional or invalidate the assessment proceedings, but there shall be no foreclosure or legal action to collect until notice has been given by personal service upon the property owner, or, if personal service cannot be had, then by publication once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper designated by the governing body and having general circulation within the boundaries of the local government where the property is located. [1959 c.219 §3; 1991 c.902 §38; 2003 c.802 §29]

 

      223.393 Estimated and final assessments become liens. Estimated and final assessments shall become a lien upon the property assessed from and after the passage of the ordinance or resolution spreading the same and entry in appropriate lien record of the local government. The estimated assessment lien shall continue until the time the estimated assessment becomes a final assessment. The local government may enforce collection of such assessments as provided by ORS 223.505 to 223.650. [1959 c.219 §4; 1991 c.902 §39; 2003 c.802 §30]

 

      223.395 Deficit assessments or refunds when initial assessment based on estimated cost. If the initial assessment has been made on the basis of estimated cost, and upon the completion of the work the cost is found to be greater than the estimated cost, the governing body may make a deficit assessment for the additional cost. Proposed assessments upon the respective lots within the assessment district for the proportionate share of the deficit shall be made; and notices shall be sent; opportunity for objections shall be given; such objections shall be considered; and determination of the assessment against each particular lot, block or parcel of land shall be made as in the case of the initial assessment; and the deficit assessment spread by ordinance. If assessments have been made on the basis of estimated cost, and upon completion the cost is found to be less than the estimated cost, provision shall be made for refund of the excess or overplus. [1959 c.219 §5; 1991 c.902 §40]

 

      223.396 [2009 c.753 §75; 2014 c.32 §1; renumbered 223.680 in 2015]

 

      223.397 [1959 c.219 §§6,7; repealed by 1963 c.507 §1]

 

      223.399 Powers of local government concerning assessments for local improvements. The governing body of a local government may impose additional procedural requirements. The procedural provisions of ORS 223.387 to 223.399 apply only where the charter or an ordinance of a local government does not specify otherwise and the charter or ordinance provisions comply and are consistent with the requirements of the Oregon Constitution. The charter or ordinance provisions shall apply to local improvements permitted by law. A local government may not authorize a local improvement prohibited by percentage of remonstrance or otherwise under the charter of the local government. [1959 c.219 §8; 1965 c.133 §1; 1991 c.902 §41; 2003 c.802 §31; 2017 c.17 §19]

 

      223.401 Review of assessment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of ORS 223.387 to 223.399, owners of any property against which an assessment for local improvements has been imposed may seek a review of the assessment under the provisions of ORS 34.010 to 34.100. [1965 c.133 §2; 2017 c.17 §20]

 

REASSESSMENT

 

      223.405 Definitions for ORS 223.405 to 223.485. As used in ORS 223.405 to 223.485, unless the context requires otherwise, “objection” includes remonstrances. [Amended by 1965 c.282 §5; 1991 c.902 §42]

 

      223.410 Authority of governing body to make reassessment. Whenever all or part of any estimated or final assessment for local improvements was or is declared void or set aside for any reason or its enforcement refused by any court by reason of jurisdictional or other defects in procedure, whether directly or by virtue of any court decision or when the governing body is in doubt as to the validity of all or part of any estimated or final assessment by reason of such defects in procedure, the governing body may by ordinance or resolution make a new estimated or final assessment or reassessment with respect to all or part of the original estimated or final assessment upon the lots which have been benefited by all or part of the local improvement to the extent of their respective and proportionate shares of the full value of such benefit. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §43]

 

      223.415 Basis for, amount and method of reassessment. The reassessment shall be based upon the special and peculiar benefit of the local improvement to the respective lots at the time of the original making of the local improvement. The amount of the reassessment shall not be limited to the amount of the original estimated or final assessment. In the case of a reassessment of a final assessment:

      (1) The property embraced in the reassessment shall be limited to property embraced in the original final assessment;

      (2) Property on which the original final assessment was paid in full shall not be included in the reassessment; and

      (3) Interest from the date of delinquency of the original final assessment may be added by the governing body to the reassessment in cases where the property was included in the original final assessment, but such interest shall not apply to any portion of the reassessment that exceeds the amount of the original final assessment. The reassessment shall be made in an equitable manner as nearly as may be in accordance with the law in force at the time the local improvement was made, but the governing body may adopt a different plan of apportioning benefits or exclude portions of the district when in its judgment it is essential to secure an equitable assessment. Credit shall be allowed on the new assessment for all payments made on the original final assessment. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §44]

 

      223.420 Effect of reassessment; exceptions. The reassessment when made shall become a charge upon the property upon which it is laid notwithstanding the omission, failure or neglect of any officer, body or person to comply with the provisions of the charter or law connected with or relating to the local improvement and original estimated or final assessment or any previous reassessment, and although the proceedings of the governing body or the acts of any officer, contractor or other person connected with the local improvement or assessment may have been irregular or defective, whether such irregularity or defect was jurisdictional or otherwise. The reassessment shall not be made in case of any local improvement wherein a remonstrance sufficient in law to defeat it has been duly filed prior to the making of the local improvement. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §45]

 

      223.425 Resolution to reassess. The proceedings required by the charter or other law for making of the original estimated or final assessment are not required with reference to the making of a reassessment. The reassessment shall be initiated by adoption of a resolution designating the improvement as to which a reassessment is contemplated, describing the boundaries of the district that the governing body contemplates for the reassessment and directing the recorder or other person to prepare a proposed reassessment upon the property included within the district. After passage of such resolution, the recorder or other person shall prepare the proposed reassessment and file it in the office of the recorder. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §46]

 

      223.430 Publication of notice of reassessment; contents. After the proposed reassessment is filed in the office of the recorder, the recorder shall give notice thereof by not less than four successive publications in a newspaper published in the city in which the principal offices of the local government are located and, if there is no newspaper published in the city, in a newspaper to be designated by the governing body. The notice shall show that the proposed reassessment is on file in the office of the recorder, giving the date of the passage of the resolution authorizing it, the boundaries of the district or a statement of the property affected by the proposed reassessment, and specifying the time and place where the governing body will hear and consider objections to the proposed reassessment by any parties aggrieved thereby. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §47; 2003 c.802 §32]

 

      223.435 Personal notice to each owner; right to file objections. The recorder shall, within five days after the date of first publication of the notice, mail or personally deliver to the owner of each lot affected by the proposed reassessment, or to the agent of such owner, a notice of the proposed reassessment, stating the matters set out in the printed notice and also the amount proposed to be charged against the lot. If the address of the owner or of the owner’s agent is unknown to the recorder, the recorder shall mail the notice addressed to the owner or owner’s agent at the address where such property is located. Any mistake, error, omission or failure with respect to such mailing shall not be jurisdictional or invalidate the reassessment proceedings. The owners of any property included in the description of the printed notice, or any person having an interest in that property, may, within 10 days from the day of last insertion of the printed notice, file in writing with the recorder objections against the proposed reassessment. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §48]

 

      223.440 Hearing on objections; revision of reassessment. At the time and place appointed in the notice the governing body shall hear and determine all objections filed under ORS 223.435. The governing body may adjourn the hearing from time to time, and correct, modify or revise the proposed reassessment or set it aside and order the making of a new proposed reassessment. However, if the proposed reassessment is corrected or revised so as to increase the amount proposed to be charged against any property, such reassessment shall not be made until after a new notice has been given as stated in ORS 223.435 to the owners of property against which the amount of assessment is proposed to be thus increased. The publication of the notice may be for not less than two successive insertions in a newspaper as provided in ORS 223.430, and the time when action may be taken thereon may be not less than five days after the date of last insertion. If the proposed reassessment is set aside and a new apportionment ordered, notice shall be given of the new apportionment in the manner stated in ORS 223.430 and 223.435 and action taken thereon as provided in ORS 223.435 and 223.440. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §49]

 

      223.445 Reassessment ordinance or resolution. When the governing body has determined what in its judgment is a fair, just and reasonable reassessment, it shall pass an ordinance or resolution setting out and making the reassessment. The reassessment so made shall be deemed to be regular, correct, valid and just, except as it may be modified under ORS 223.450 and 223.455. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §50]

 

      223.450 Lien docket entry; crediting prior payments. When the reassessment is duly made it shall be entered in the lien docket of the local government. All provisions for bonding and paying by installments shall be applicable, and such liens of the local government shall be enforced and collected in the manner provided for collection of liens for an original local improvement. All sums paid upon the former final assessment or any previous reassessment shall be credited to the property on account of which it was paid and as of the date of payment. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §51; 2003 c.802 §33]

 

      223.455 Right of purchaser at sale under prior assessment. In cases where a sale was made under the original final assessment or any previous reassessment, with reference to such local improvement, and the property was not redeemed from the sale, the purchaser at the sale is subrogated to the rights of the local government with reference to the property upon such reassessment if the purchaser waives all penalties and interest, except such interest as may be provided for on the reassessment, and delivers up for cancellation any certificate or other evidence of the sale. If a deed was issued at the sale, the grantee therein, or the heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns of the grantee, shall execute a deed of release and quitclaim of all right, title and interest in the property under such sale to the owner of the property and deliver the deed to the recorder, so that the owner’s title may be cleared of the sale. The recorder shall act as escrow holder of such certificate or other evidence of sale and of such deed pending completion of reassessment. If the reassessment is not completed, the recorder shall return the certificate or other evidence of sale and the deed to the person delivering it to the recorder. If the reassessment is completed, the certificate or other evidence of sale shall be canceled and placed on file in the office of the recorder and the deed shall be delivered to the owner of the property specified therein. If any such purchaser, or the heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns of such purchaser fails to comply with this section, that person is not entitled to subrogation. In any event, the amount of subrogation shall not exceed the amount that has been paid to the local government on such sale, together with interest at the rate of six percent per annum from the date of sale until the date of payment. This amount is to be paid by the local government to the purchaser, or the heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns of the purchaser if and when the local government collects the amount of the reassessment against the property. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §52; 2003 c.802 §34]

 

      223.460 [Repealed by 1965 c.71 §1]

 

      223.462 Review of reassessment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of ORS 223.405 to 223.485, owners of any property against which a reassessment for local improvements has been imposed may seek a review thereof under the provisions of ORS 34.010 to 34.100. [1965 c.71 §4]

 

      223.465 [Repealed by 1965 c.71 §1]

 

      223.470 [Repealed by 1965 c.71 §1]

 

      223.475 [Repealed by 1965 c.71 §1]

 

      223.480 [Repealed by 1965 c.71 §1]

 

      223.485 When reassessment authority inapplicable; time limitation. (1) The authority granted in ORS 223.405 to 223.455 does not apply to any local government if the local government has provided a method of reassessment by ordinance or charter.

      (2) No proceedings for making a reassessment shall be instituted after 20 years from the date when the first assessment was entered on the lien docket. [Amended by 1965 c.71 §3; 1991 c.902 §53; 2003 c.802 §35]

 

METHODS OF ENFORCING LIENS AND COLLECTING ASSESSMENTS

 

      223.505 Definitions for ORS 223.505 to 223.595. As used in ORS 223.505 to 223.595:

      (1) “Lawfully established unit of land” has the meaning given that term in ORS 92.010.

      (2) “Tract” has the meaning given that term in ORS 215.010.

      (3) “Treasurer” means the officer designated by charter or ordinance of the local government to collect unpaid liens or final assessments, take all steps necessary to enforce delinquent liens or assessments and to maintain records pertaining to collection proceedings thereon. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §54; 2003 c.802 §36; 2012 c.47 §1]

 

      223.510 Authority to sell property for delinquent liens and assessments. In addition to the method provided by law, ordinance or the charter of any local government for the sale of real property for delinquent liens or final assessments, every local government may cause the real property to be sold as provided in ORS 223.510 to 223.590 for any final assessment, lien or installment thereof at any time after one year from the date such lien, final assessment or installment becomes due and payable, if bonded; otherwise, at any time after 60 days from the time it is entered in the lien docket of the local government. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §55; 2003 c.802 §37]

 

      223.515 Preparation, transmission and contents of delinquent list. If any installment on any lien bonded, as provided by law, ordinances or charter of the local government, is delinquent for a period of one year from the time it became due and payable, or at any time after 60 days from the time it became due and payable if not bonded, the recorder may thereafter prepare and transmit to the treasurer a list in tabular form, made up from the lien docket, describing each lien, assessment or installment due on any bonded lien that is so delinquent. The list shall also contain the name of the person to whom assessed, a particular description of the property, the amount of the lien or final assessment or the amount of the installment due on any bonded lien, and any other facts necessary to be given. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §56; 2003 c.802 §38]

 

      223.520 Procedure in collecting delinquencies. Upon receipt of the list described in ORS 223.515, the treasurer shall proceed to collect the unpaid liens or final assessments named in the list by advertising and selling the lawfully established units of land or tracts in the manner now provided by law for the sale of real property on execution, except as otherwise provided in ORS 223.525 to 223.580 and except that sale may be made at the place within the boundaries of the local government designated in the notice of sale. [Amended by 1991 c.902 §57; 2003 c.802 §39; 2012 c.47 §2]

 

      223.523 Notice of sale; publication; personal notice to property owner and occupant. (1) Before a sale of real property under ORS 223.505 to 223.590 takes place, the treasurer shall have notice of the sale printed once a week for four successive weeks in a daily or weekly newspaper, as defined in ORS 193.010, generally circulated in the county in which the sale will be held.

The treasurer shall retain and file the return receipt for the registered or certified mail. [1977 c.403 §2; 1985 c.231 §1; 1991 c.902 §58; 2009 c.510 §5]

 

      223.525 Conduct of foreclosure sale. (1) Each lawfully established unit of land or tract must be sold separately and for a sum equal to or exceeding the greater of:

      (a) The amount of the unpaid final assessment plus interest, penalties and the costs of conducting the sale; or

      (b) Seventy-five percent of the total assessed value of the real property, as determined by the assessor of the county in which the land and improvements are located.

      (3) If none of the bids equals or exceeds the minimum sum for which real property may be sold under this section or the sale is not completed for any other reason, the real property may be offered for sale as provided in ORS 223.560.

      (4) If the sum received for the sale of real property under this section exceeds the amount of the unpaid final assessment, plus interest, penalties and the costs of conducting the sale, the treasurer shall apply the proceeds of the sale as follows:

      223.565 Procedure and conditions of redemption. (1) The owner, or legal representatives of the owner, or the successor in interest of the owner, or any person having a lien by judgment or mortgage, or owner of a tax lien, on any property sold by virtue of ORS 223.520 may redeem it upon conditions provided in this section. Redemption of any real property sold for a delinquent final assessment or lien under the provisions of ORS 223.505 to 223.590 may be made by paying to the treasurer, at any time within one year from the date of the certificate of sale, the purchase price and 10 percent thereof as penalty, and interest on the purchase price at the rate of 10 percent per annum, from the date of the certificate. Where redemption is made by the holder of a tax lien the holder may have such redemption noted upon the record of the lien in like manner and with like effect as prescribed in this section. Such redemption shall discharge the property so sold from the effect of the sale and, if made by a lien creditor, the amount paid for the redemption shall thereafter be deemed a part of the judgment, mortgage or tax lien, as the case may be, and shall bear like interest, and may be enforced and collected as a part thereof.

      (2) Anyone applying or seeking to redeem property sold under the provisions of ORS 223.505 to 223.590 must pay or offer to pay the sum necessary in lawful money of the United States.

      (3) When an individual purchases real property at a foreclosure sale under ORS 223.505 to 223.590, if, with the approval of the local government, that purchaser incurs costs for maintaining or improving the property during the period allowed for redemption and if the property is subsequently redeemed, the treasurer may return all or part of the penalty paid by the person redeeming the property to the purchaser as provided by charter or ordinance of the local government.

The deed shall be prima facie evidence of title in the grantee, except as stated in this section, and that all proceedings and acts necessary to make such deed in all respects good and valid have been had and done. Such prima facie evidence shall not be disputed, overcome or rebutted, or the effect thereof avoided, except by satisfactory proof of either:

      (1) Fraud in making the final assessment or in the final assessment, or in the procuring of the lien.

      (2) Payment of the final assessment or lien before sale or redemption after sale.

      (2) When requested by the property owner and authorized by the municipal utility, a single water meter may serve several parcels of real property owned by the same owner. The owner of those parcels of real property shall be considered the user of the water. If payment for such water is not made when due and the water has not been shut off or will not be shut off, the municipal utility providing such service may place a lien on the real property to which water service was provided for the amount due for such service.

      (3) At any time after 60 days from the time the lien is entered in the lien docket of the local government, in addition to any method provided by law, ordinance or the charter of any local government, the lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided under ORS 223.510 to 223.595.

The amount of the assessment shall be paid by the cemetery authority as provided in this section.

      (3)(a) Within 60 days after the date the ordinance levying the initial assessment is enacted by the local government, the cemetery authority shall furnish the local government with a list of platted burial lots within the benefited property unsold on the date such ordinance was enacted.

      (b) Out of the first funds received for the sales price of any of such lots, the cemetery authority after setting aside perpetual care and maintenance funds as required by law or otherwise shall credit five percent of such sales price to a special account for the payment of the assessment until a sum equal to the assessment and any interest due thereon has been so credited.

      223.884 Eminent domain authority within and without city limits.

The determination of the council, commission of public docks, or other administrative body of the city having jurisdiction of its wharf or dock property that the acquiring of any particular real property is necessary to carry out the purposes of ORS 223.882 shall be sufficient foundation for the exercise of the right of eminent domain, notwithstanding that there is other real property available that might be used for those purposes.

In borrowing money for any of these purposes the cities may secure money so borrowed by executing and giving a mortgage or similar indenture on any such real property and its revenues. If repayment of money borrowed for acquisition or improvement of any such real property is not to be secured solely by the real property and the income derived therefrom, then, before a debt for the purpose of this section or ORS 223.882 can be contracted or incurred, the consent of the electors of the city must first be obtained. [Formerly 223.865]

 

      223.888 Authority of city to carry out law. In the execution of powers conferred by ORS 223.882 to 223.886, a city may act through its council, commission of public docks, or other administrative body having jurisdiction of its wharves, docks or waterfront property.
