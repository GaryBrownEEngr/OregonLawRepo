      (2) It shall be unlawful to receive or record such plat or replat or deed in any public office unless the same bears thereon the approval, by indorsement, of such commission or city engineer. However, the indorsement of the commission or city engineer of the city with boundaries nearest the land such document affects shall satisfy the requirements of this section in case the boundaries of more than one city are within six miles of the property so mapped or described. If the governing bodies of such cities mutually agree upon a boundary line establishing the limits of the jurisdiction of the cities other than the line equidistant between the cities and file the agreement with the recording officer of the county containing such boundary line, the boundary line mutually agreed upon shall become the limit of the jurisdiction of each city until superseded by a new agreement between the cities or until one of the cities files with such recording officer a written notification stating that the agreement shall no longer apply.

Within six miles of the limits of any city, the commission, if there is one, or if no such commission legally exists, then the city engineer, shall recommend to the city council the renaming of any existing street, highway or road, other than a county road or state highway, if in the judgment of the commission, or if no such commission legally exists, then in the judgment of the city engineer, such renaming is in the best interest of the city and the six mile area. Upon receiving such recommendation the council shall afford persons particularly interested, and the general public, an opportunity to be heard, at a time and place to be specified in a notice of hearing published in a newspaper of general circulation within the municipality and the six mile area not less than once within the week prior to the week within which the hearing is to be held. After such opportunity for hearing has been afforded, the city council by ordinance shall rename the street or highway in accordance with the recommendation or by resolution shall reject the recommendation. A certified copy of each such ordinance shall be filed for record with the county clerk or recorder, and a like copy shall be filed with the county assessor and county surveyor. The county surveyor shall enter the new names of such streets and roads in red ink on the county surveyor’s copy of any filed plat and tracing thereof which may be affected, together with appropriate notations concerning the same. The original plat may not be corrected or changed after it is recorded with the county clerk. [Amended by 2001 c.173 §4]

      (D) An appeal from a hearings officer’s decision made without hearing under this subsection shall be to the planning commission or governing body of the city.

In either case, the appeal shall be to a de novo hearing.

      (E) The de novo hearing required by subparagraph (D) of this paragraph shall be the initial evidentiary hearing required under ORS 197.763 as the basis for an appeal to the Land Use Board of Appeals. At the de novo hearing:

If an appellant prevails at the hearing or upon subsequent appeal, the fee for the initial hearing shall be refunded.
