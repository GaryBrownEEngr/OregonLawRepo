The board shall hold meetings as frequently as may be necessary for the performance of its duties.

      (6) Within the limitations of ORS 237.414 and 237.950 to 237.980, the board shall have the power to establish and enforce rules and regulations for transacting its business and administering ORS 237.414 and 237.950 to 237.980.

      (7) Members of the board shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for their necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties as such members. [1953 c.180 §9; 1953 c.521 §3; 1991 c.67 §57]

      237.960 Transfer of assets and administration of retirement fund. (1) All assets of the previously existing Public Employees Retirement System, as of March 27, 1953, including moneys and securities, accounts receivable, office equipment and all personal property of any description, hereby are transferred to the Public Employees Retirement Board created and established by ORS 237.952, which board shall have control thereof for the purpose of liquidating the obligations of the Public Employees Retirement System and otherwise applying such assets as herein directed.

      (2) During the period of liquidation the board may invest and reinvest moneys, purchase, sell and exchange securities as in its judgment to the best interest of beneficiaries.

      (3) The board shall succeed to all the duties and prerogatives of the Public Employees Retirement Board created by chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, in relation to the Public Employees Retirement Fund. Said fund shall be and remain a trust fund for the purpose of liquidating the obligations of the abolished retirement system, and the Public Employees Retirement Board created by ORS 237.952 hereby is declared to be the trustee of said fund.

      (4) From the current service account of the State of Oregon in the Public Employees Retirement Fund there shall be transferred to the Social Security Revolving Account an amount of $60,000 which shall be recovered from the participating employers in the manner prescribed by ORS 237.520 (2003 Edition), and upon recovery shall be repaid to the Public Employees Retirement Board. [1953 c.180 §3; 2005 c.755 §60]

 

      237.964 Collection of accrued liabilities. In order to liquidate accrued liabilities with respect to prior service credit and delinquent contributions, each public employer which at any time prior to March 27, 1953, has participated in the Public Employees Retirement System shall continue to remit payments to the Public Employees Retirement Board at the rate and in the time and manner prescribed by chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended. The board shall have a right of action against any such public employer for the enforcement of the provisions of this section. [1953 c.180 §5]

 

      237.968 Continuation of retirement benefits of certain members. The board shall pay all retirement benefits to which members of the Public Employees Retirement System who retired prior to March 27, 1953, may be entitled under the provisions of chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, and shall give full recognition to all rights to which such members are entitled under said law. The board also shall determine and pay in accordance with the provisions of that law retirement benefits to which members of the Public Employees Retirement System are entitled by the provisions of said law. [1953 c.180 §4]

 

      237.972 Continuation of abolished system with regard to certain members. Notwithstanding any other provision of chapter 180, Oregon Laws 1953, chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any employee of a public employer which heretofore withdrew from the Public Employees Retirement System pursuant to subsection (5) of section 8 of said law, as amended by section 1, chapter 322, Oregon Laws 1951, who did not sign the petition for such withdrawal. Such employee shall be and remain a member of the Public Employees Retirement System with full rights and benefits thereunder as if chapter 180, Oregon Laws 1953, had not been passed; and until the entire obligation of the public employer with respect to all such employees, as provided in chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, shall have been paid in full, such public employer shall continue to deduct from payrolls and transmit the contributions thereby required and make the matching contributions thereby required to the Public Employees Retirement Board created by ORS 237.952 and such public employer shall remain liable to such Public Employees Retirement Board for all contributions required by such law together with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of any delinquency. [1953 c.180 §11]

 

      237.976 Disposition of contributions made under abolished system. (1) From contributions of each employee and the matching contributions of the employer, respectively, due and paid to the Public Employees Retirement Fund for services performed after January 1, 1951, there shall be deducted as much thereof as necessary to constitute an amount equal to the total sum of the tax which would have been imposed upon the employee and the employer, respectively, by sections 1400 and 1410 of the Internal Revenue Code, if the services of the employee subsequent to January 1, 1951, had constituted employment as defined by section 1426 of such Code; provided, however, that no such deductions shall be made from the contributions of the employees referred to in ORS 237.972 or from the matching contributions of their employers, heretofore or hereafter paid into the Public Employees Retirement Fund. A sum equal to the total of the amounts deducted as provided in the preceding sentence hereby is transferred from the Public Employees Retirement Fund to the Social Security Revolving Account in the General Fund created by ORS 237.490, and shall be expended by the Public Employees Retirement Board in payment of the contributions required to secure coverage under the system of Old Age and Survivors Insurance established by title 2 of the Social Security Act, effective from January 1, 1951, for all employees with respect to whom such deductions were made.

      (2) Each member of the Public Employees Retirement System shall have the right to a refund of all contributions heretofore paid by the member into the fund after deducting therefrom the amount herein specified for Social Security coverage, providing that within 60 days after March 27, 1953, the member signs and files a written request therefor with the Public Employees Retirement Board, in which event such contribution shall be paid to the member by the Public Employees Retirement Board as soon thereafter as practicable and in no case later than October 1, 1953. The refund of all contributions paid by the member, as by this section authorized, in the case of each applicant who receives such refund shall extinguish all the rights of membership in the Public Employees Retirement System established by chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, including the right to claim credit for any time whatever spent in public employment prior to the receipt of such refund. Unless an employee shall have filed such request for refund within said 60 days the balance of contributions of the employee remaining after such deduction, together with an equal amount contributed by the employer, and the contributions of the employers based on the prior service credit of the employee, shall be used to purchase retirement benefits for such employee in accordance with ORS chapter 238. If, pending such disposition of employees’ contributions, any employee should die, the accumulated contributions of the employee shall be paid as the employee shall have directed in writing. In the absence of such written direction, the accumulated contributions shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended.

      (3) There shall be no refund made to any participating employer until such time as all liabilities against such employer have been fully liquidated and discharged. [1953 c.180 §6; 1953 c.521 §1]

 

      237.980 Rights and moneys exempt from taxation, execution and bankruptcy and are unassignable. During the entire period of liquidation of the Public Employees Retirement System, the right of a person to a pension, annuity or a retirement allowance, to the return of contributions upon separation from service with a public employer, the refund of contributions authorized by ORS 237.976, the payment of annuity, or retirement allowance itself, any optional benefit or death benefit, or any right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of the repealed Public Employes’ Retirement Act [chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945] or ORS 237.412 to 237.418 or 237.950 to 237.980, shall be exempt from all state, county and municipal taxes, and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment or any other process or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, and shall not be assignable. [1953 c.180 §7; 1953 c.521 §2]
