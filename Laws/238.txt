MEMBERSHIP

 

(Membership Generally)

 

      238.015 Membership generally. (1) No person may become a member of the system unless that person is in the service of a public employer and has completed six months’ service uninterrupted by more than 30 consecutive working days during the six months’ period. Every employee of a participating employer shall become a member of the system at the beginning of the first full pay period of the employee following the six months’ period. Contributions for new members shall first be made for those wages that are attributable to services performed by the employee during the first full pay period following the six months’ period, without regard to when those wages are considered earned for other purposes under this chapter. All public employers participating in the Public Employees Retirement System established by chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, at the time of repeal of that chapter, and all school districts of the state, shall participate in, and their employees shall be members of, the system, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.

      (2) Any active member of the Public Employees Retirement System who, through the annexation of a political subdivision employing the member or by change of employment, becomes the employee of another political subdivision which is participating in the Public Employees Retirement System and has also a separate retirement system for its employees, shall remain an active member of the Public Employees Retirement System unless, within 60 days after the effective date of the annexation or change of employment or April 8, 1953, the member shall by written notice to the Public Employees Retirement Board and to the administrative body of the new public employer elect to relinquish membership in the Public Employees Retirement System and become a member of the separate retirement system of the employer, if eligible for membership in that retirement system, and the member shall be so carried by the new employer. Immediately upon such annexation of any political subdivision or such change of employment, the new public employer shall inform such employee in writing of the right of the employee to exercise an election as in this section provided.

      (3) A political subdivision (other than a school district) not participating in the retirement system established by chapter 401, Oregon Laws 1945, as amended, which employs one or more employees, each of whose position requires 600 hours of service per year, or an agency created by two or more political subdivisions to provide themselves governmental services, which employs one or more employees, each of whose position requires 600 hours of service per year, may, through its governing body, notify the board in writing, that it elects to include its employees in the system hereby established. Such public employer may request the board to make a study and estimate of the cost of including it and its eligible employees, other than volunteer firefighters, in the system, which the board thereupon shall cause to be made and the cost of which the employer shall bear. Upon completion of the study and estimate the employer may apply for admission to the system, whereupon it shall begin to participate therein and its eligible employees other than volunteer firefighters shall become members of the system. If the employer is an agency created by two or more political subdivisions to provide themselves governmental services and ceases thereafter to transmit to the board contributions for any of its eligible employees, the benefits based upon employer contributions to which such employees would otherwise be entitled shall be reduced accordingly.

      (4) No adult in custody in a state institution or an alien on a training or educational visa working for any participating employer, even though the adult in custody or alien received compensation from a participating employer, shall be eligible to become a member of the system. No person employed by a participating employer and defined by such employer as a student employee is eligible to become a member of the system for such student employment.

      (5) A person holding an elective office or an appointive office with a fixed term or an office as head of a department to which the person is appointed by the Governor may become a member of the system by giving the board written notice of desire to do so within 30 days after taking the office or, in the event that the officer is not eligible to become a member of the system at the time of taking the office, within 30 days after becoming so eligible. Membership so established shall not be discontinued during the appointive or elective term of the officer except upon separation of the officer from service.

      (6) A public employer employing volunteer firefighters may apply to the board at any time for them to become members of the system. Upon receiving the application the board shall fix a wage at which, for purposes of this chapter only, they shall be considered to be employed and which shall be the basis for computing the amounts of the contributions, if any, which they pay into, and of the benefits which they and their beneficiaries receive from, the fund; and if the wage so fixed is satisfactory to the employer, shall include the firefighters in the system.

      (7)(a) In the event that an employee enters the service of a public employer which is participating in or later begins to participate in the system and in the event that at the time of entering that service or at the time that the employer begins to participate in the system the employee has commenced to purchase and is continuing to purchase a retirement annuity, if the employer deems the annuity adequate for the purposes of this chapter, it may enter into an agreement with the employee and the board pursuant to which the employee may be exempted from contributing to the Public Employees Retirement Fund, and, if no public funds are being used to purchase the annuity or a corresponding pension, the employer, in lieu of the contributions which it otherwise would make to the fund on account of the employee, may make contributions toward the cost of purchasing the annuity. Such employee otherwise shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter, except that neither the employee nor any person claiming under the employee shall receive any payments from the retirement fund as service or disability allowance.

      (b) An employee who enters into an agreement under paragraph (a) of this subsection may elect at any time thereafter to start to participate in the system by giving written notice of desire to participate to the board and to the employer. The employee shall receive no retirement credit for the period during which the employee was exempted from contributing to the fund under the agreement, but the employee shall be considered to have completed the six months’ service required for membership in the system. When the employee starts to participate in the system the employer shall start to contribute to the fund on account of the employee in the same manner as the employer contributes on account of other employees who are active members of the system and the employer shall stop making contributions toward the cost of purchasing the retirement annuity.

      (8)(a) All new appointees in the Federal Cooperative Extension Service or in any other service in which participation in the Federal Civil Service retirement program is mandatory, who receive a federal appointment on or after July 1, 1955, may participate in the Public Employees Retirement System only by giving written notice of their election to so participate to the Public Employees Retirement Board within six months after the effective date of their appointment.

      (b) All persons employed by the Federal Cooperative Extension Service or by any other service in which participation in the Federal Civil Service retirement program is mandatory, who are under federal appointment as of July 1, 1955, and who are members of the state retirement system, shall continue such membership unless, prior to February 1, 1956, they give written notice to the Public Employees Retirement Board of their desire to cancel their membership.

      (c) Any person who is an active member of the Public Employees Retirement System, who, on or after July 1, 1955, is employed by the Federal Cooperative Extension Service or by any other service in which participation in the Federal Civil Service retirement program is mandatory, and who is given a federal appointment, shall continue such membership in the Public Employees Retirement System unless, within six months after the effective date of the appointment, the person gives written notice to the Public Employees Retirement Board of the desire to cancel membership.

      (d) A cancellation of membership under paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection terminates membership in the Public Employees Retirement System and cancels the right to any benefits from, or claims against, that system. Such cancellation prevents the withdrawing member from claiming thereafter any retirement credit for any period of employment before the cancellation. Upon receipt of a notice of cancellation, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall refund the member account of the withdrawing member, regardless of the age of the withdrawing member.

      (9) Employees, including managers, of foreign trade offices of the Oregon Business Development Department who live and perform services in foreign countries under the provisions of ORS 285A.075 (1)(g) shall not be members of the system. However, any person who is an active member of the system immediately before becoming an employee of a foreign trade office shall continue to be a member of the system during the period of time the person serves as an employee of the foreign trade office.

      (10) An employee who is participating in an alternative retirement program established pursuant to ORS 353.250 or an optional retirement plan established pursuant to ORS 341.551 may not be an active member of the Public Employees Retirement System.

      (3) The board, upon such terms as are set forth in a contract between the board and the employer, shall allow every employee in the designated class to become members of the Public Employees Retirement System in accordance with this chapter.

      (4) All employees who have completed the period of service with the public employer that is required under ORS 238.015 shall become members of the system on a date specified by the board. All other employees in the designated class shall become members upon completion of the required period of service.

      (5) The contract provided for in subsection (3) of this section may be in addition to or in lieu of a contract of integration under ORS 238.680.

      (6) An employer entering into a contract under subsection (3) of this section may at any time thereafter enter into a contract with the board to provide membership to all or part of the employees who do not become members of the system at the time that the employer becomes a participating employer. Except as may be provided for prior service credit, or under a contract of integration under ORS 238.680, employees shall receive no retirement credit for the period during which the employee was exempted from contributing to the fund under the agreement, but the employee shall be considered to have completed the six months’ service required for membership in the system if the employee has served with the employer for at least six months. When the employee starts to participate in the system the employer shall start to contribute to the fund on account of the employee in the same manner as the employer contributes on account of other employees who are members of the system.

      (2) After August 1, 1991, any judge who would have become eligible to receive retirement pay from the Judges’ Retirement Fund shall, upon retirement, be a retired member of the Public Employees Retirement System, except that:

      (3) On August 1, 1991, the Judges’ Retirement Fund shall cease to exist as a separate fund and the assets and earnings of the Judges’ Retirement Fund shall be paid into the employer reserves for judge members of the Public Employees Retirement Fund.

      (5) The amount of retirement pay or pension payable to a judge or spouse of a retired judge who previously received retirement pay or a pension from the Judges’ Retirement Fund, or who would have received retirement pay or a pension from the Judges’ Retirement Fund, shall not be recalculated or affected in any way based on the provisions of ORS chapter 238, nor shall the eligibility of a judge or surviving spouse of a judge to receive retirement pay or a pension be affected by ORS chapter 238.

(Membership of Retired Employees)

 

      238.078 Reemployment of retired members. (1)(a) A member who has been retired for service for more than six consecutive calendar months may be reemployed by a participating public employer in the manner provided by this subsection.

      (b) Any person reemployed as provided in this subsection shall resume making employee contributions, and the employer shall make contributions on behalf of the person as provided in ORS 238.225. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, payments of retirement allowance and other benefits received by the person, including lump sum or installment payments received by the person under ORS 238.305 (2) or (3), shall not be repaid into the retirement fund after the person reenters public employment. Upon reemployment under this subsection, the board shall cease making payments of retirement allowance and other benefits to the person, including installment payments to the person under ORS 238.305 (4). The board shall reestablish the member account of the person and reduce the account by all payments of retirement allowance and other benefits, including installment payments, that were previously received by the person and that were derived from the member account. Amounts that were credited to the reserve established by the board for the payment of the person’s benefits that were not derived from the member account shall be credited pro rata to the funds from which the amounts were derived.

      (c) Upon reemployment under this subsection, the former retirement of the reemployed person and any election of option for payment of retirement benefits made by the person shall be canceled. When the person again retires the person may elect any option for payment of retirement benefits authorized by this chapter, except that a person who elected to receive a service retirement benefit pursuant to ORS 238.305 (2) or (3) at the time of former retirement may not elect any other option at the time of subsequent retirement unless an amount equal to the lump sum and the interest that would have accumulated on the sum has been repaid by the employee to the fund. Upon such subsequent retirement any prior service pension due the employee shall be derived from the unused portion of the prior service credit reserve and shall be calculated on the basis of then attained age.

      (2) A member who has been retired for service for less than six consecutive calendar months may be reemployed by a participating public employer only upon immediate repayment in a lump sum by the member of the amount of retirement benefits drawn. The member account of the member shall be reestablished just as it was at the time of former retirement after the lump sum repayment is made.

[Formerly 237.071 (1) to (3); 2001 c.945 §43; 2003 c.67 §1; 2003 c.625 §9; 2013 c.768 §110]

 

      238.205 Payment of employee contribution by employer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and subject to the provisions of this section, a public employer participating in the system may agree, by a written employment policy or agreement in effect on or after July 1, 1979, to “pick-up,” assume or pay the full amount of employee contributions required or permitted by ORS 238.200 for all or less than all active members of the system employed by the employer to the extent employee contributions are required or permitted by ORS 238.200. If a public employer so agrees:

      (1) The rate of contribution of each active member of the system employed by the employer who is covered by such policy or agreement shall uniformly be six percent of salary regardless of the amount of monthly salary.

      (2) The full amount of required employee contributions assumed or paid by the employer on behalf of its employees shall be considered “salary,” as defined in ORS 238.005, only for the purpose of computing a member’s “final average salary,” as defined in ORS 238.005, and shall not constitute additional “salary” or “other advantages,” as defined in ORS 238.005, for any other purpose.

      (3) The full amount of required employee contributions “picked-up” by the employer on behalf of its employees shall be considered “salary,” as defined in ORS 238.005, for the purpose of calculating the amount of the contribution, for the purpose of computing a member’s “final average salary,” as defined in ORS 238.005, and for all other purposes.

      (4) The full amount of required employee contributions “picked-up,” assumed or paid by the employer on behalf of its employees shall be added to the member accounts of the members for their annuities and shall be considered employee contributions for all other purposes of this chapter.

      (5) For the purposes of this section:

      (a) Employee contributions are “picked-up” if the written employment policy or agreement described in subsection (1) of this section provides that employee compensation will be reduced to generate the funds needed to make the employee contributions; and

      (b) Employee contributions are “assumed or paid” by an employer if the written employment policy or agreement described in subsection (1) of this section provides that additional amounts shall be paid by the employer for the purpose of making the employee contributions, and employee compensation will not be reduced for the purpose of generating the funds needed to make the employee contributions.

      (6) A participating public employer must give written notice to the Public Employees Retirement Board at the time that a written employment policy or agreement described in subsection (1) of this section is adopted or changed. The notice must indicate whether the employer will “pick-up” or “assume or pay” the employee contributions as described in subsection (5) of this section. Any change in the manner in which employee contributions are to be paid applies only to employee contributions made on and after the date the notice is received by the board. [Formerly 237.075; 1997 c.175 §8; 2001 c.945 §44; 2003 c.67 §2]

 

      238.210 Payment of certain circuit court judge employee contributions by employer. The state shall “pick-up,” assume or pay the full amount of contributions to the fund required of circuit court judges who were district court judges before January 15, 1998, and who are members of the system, but not judge members under ORS 238.500 to 238.585. The full amount of those contributions “picked-up,” assumed or paid by the state shall be treated as provided in ORS 238.205 (2) to (4). [Formerly 237.079; 1997 c.175 §§9,10]

 

      238.215 Contributions by certain higher education employees. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter:

      (1) An employee, as defined in ORS 243.910 (2), who is an active member of the system and who has elected, and not canceled that election, to be assisted under ORS 243.920 (1) by the governing board of a public university listed in ORS 352.002, may not contribute to the fund on any part of the annual salary of the employee in excess of $4,800 at any time during which the governing board assists the employee under ORS 243.920 (1).

      (2) The current service pension, whether for service or disability retirement, under this chapter provided by the contributions of the employers of such employee shall be:

      (a) If the governing board is assisting such employee under ORS 243.920 (1) at the time of retirement, a pension equal to the annuity provided by the employee’s accumulated contributions to the fund.

      (b) If the governing board is not assisting such employee under ORS 243.920 (1) at the time of retirement, but previously so assisted the employee:

      (A) For service before the date the governing board last ceased to assist the employee, a pension equal to the annuity provided by the employee’s accumulated contributions to the fund before that date.

      (B) For service on and after the date the governing board last ceased to so assist the employee, a pension computed as provided in ORS 238.300 (2), but if the employee retires before reaching the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced and computed on the then attained age. For the purpose of computing the pension under this subparagraph, only the number of years of membership of the employee after the day before that date and only the salary of the employee on which the employee contributes to the fund for those years shall be considered.

      (3) Subsection (2) of this section does not apply to an employee, as defined in ORS 243.910 (2), who is an active member of the system, who elected to be assisted by the State Board of Higher Education or governing board under ORS 243.920 (1) before January 1, 1968, who canceled that election within the first 60 days of the calendar year 1968 as provided in ORS 243.940 (5) and who does not thereafter elect to be assisted by the board under ORS 243.920 (1).

      (4) Subsection (2) of this section does not apply to an employee, as defined in ORS 243.910 (2), who is an active member of the system and has been an active member of the system continuously since any date before January 1, 1968; who elected to be assisted by the State Board of Higher Education or governing board under ORS 243.920 (1) before January 1, 1968; and who cancels that election in any calendar year after 1968, but before the calendar year in which the employee retires, as provided in ORS 243.940 (5) and does not thereafter elect to be assisted by the board under ORS 243.920 (1). In this case the benefit, whether for service or disability retirement, shall be computed as under ORS 238.300; however, for service during periods in which the employee was assisted by the board under ORS 243.920 (1), a year of membership as used in ORS 238.300 (2) shall be a portion of a year which is represented by a fraction the numerator of which is $4,800 and the denominator of which is the salary earned by the employee in that year. However, in no case shall the fraction be greater than one. [Formerly 237.073; 2013 c.768 §111; 2015 c.767 §62]

 

(Employee Rollover Contributions)

 

      238.220 Employee rollover contributions; rules. (1) The Public Employees Retirement Board may, at its discretion, accept rollover contributions from an active member. The board may accept rollover contributions under this section only if the amounts contributed qualify for pretax rollover treatment under the federal income tax laws governing qualified retirement plans.

      (2) If the board accepts a rollover contribution under this section, the contribution shall be paid into the Public Employees Retirement Fund and credited to an individual rollover account in the name of the member who made the contribution. The rollover account must be kept separate from the member account of the member and must be invested separately from all other moneys in the Public Employees Retirement Fund. All earnings on the rollover account shall be credited by the board to the rollover account. If the membership of the employee in the Public Employees Retirement System is terminated under the provisions of ORS 238.095, the board shall cease investment of the amounts in the rollover account and, after the effective date of the termination, shall no longer credit earnings and losses to the rollover account.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, amounts in a rollover account established under this section shall be invested in the same manner as funds in regular accounts. However, ORS 238.255 does not apply to rollover accounts.

      (4) Amounts held in a rollover account under this section shall be distributed to the member within 90 days after the member’s effective date of retirement under this chapter, or within 90 days after termination of the person’s membership in the system under ORS 238.095.

      (5) Distribution from a member’s rollover account shall be made in a single lump sum payment. Distribution from a member’s rollover account shall not affect the calculation of any other service or disability retirement allowance, death benefit or other benefit payable to a member under this chapter.

      (6) The board shall adopt rules and establish procedures for determining whether a member will be allowed to make a rollover contribution under this section. Rules and procedures adopted by the board must ensure that the rollover contributions do not adversely affect the status of the system and the Public Employees Retirement Fund as a qualified governmental plan and trust under federal income tax law.

      (7) The board shall by rule establish a maintenance fee for rollover accounts established under this section. The fee may be collected out of earnings on rollover accounts or, if there are no earnings, from the principal amounts paid into the rollover accounts. The fee shall be in an amount determined by the board to be adequate to pay the full cost to the system of maintaining rollover accounts under this section. [1999 c.988 §2; 2001 c.945 §45; 2003 c.67 §29]

 

      238.222 Trustee-to-trustee transfers to fund restoration of forfeited service or purchase of retirement credit; rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 238.220, a member of the Public Employees Retirement System who is eligible to obtain restoration of forfeited creditable service under ORS 238.115, or to purchase retirement credit under ORS 238.125, 238.135, 238.145, 238.148, 238.156, 238.157, 238.160, 238.162, 238.165, 238.175 or 526.052, and who participates in an eligible retirement plan described in subsection (3) of this section, may use moneys transferred by way of a trustee-to-trustee transfer from the eligible retirement plan to the Public Employees Retirement Board for the purpose of obtaining restoration of the forfeited creditable service or to purchase the retirement credit. The board may not make any amount transferred under this section available to the member, and may use the amount only for the purposes described in this section. The amount transferred under this section may not exceed the amount needed to obtain restoration of the forfeited creditable service or to purchase the retirement credit.

      (2) If amounts transferred under this section are not sufficient to pay the full amount necessary to obtain restoration of the forfeited creditable service or to purchase the retirement credit, the member must pay the remaining amount that is needed to obtain restoration of the forfeited creditable service or to purchase the retirement credit.

      (3) The following are eligible retirement plans for the purposes of this section:

      (a) A governmental deferred compensation plan described in section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code; and

      (b) A tax sheltered annuity described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (4) The board shall adopt rules and establish procedures for determining whether a member is allowed to obtain restoration of the forfeited creditable service or to purchase the retirement credit by means of a trustee-to-trustee transfer under this section. The rules and procedures must ensure that transfers under this section do not adversely affect the status of the system and the Public Employees Retirement Fund as a qualified governmental plan and trust under federal income tax law. [2009 c.894 §2; 2011 c.722 §7]

 

(Employer Contributions)

 

      238.225 Employer contributions. A participating public employer shall, at intervals designated by the Public Employees Retirement Board, transmit to the board those amounts the board determines to be actuarially necessary to adequately fund the benefits to be provided by the contributions of the employer under this chapter and the benefits to be provided under the pension program established by ORS 238A.100 to 238A.250, except for the disability benefit for which funding is provided under ORS 238A.240. From time to time, the board shall determine the liabilities of the system and shall set the amount of contributions to be made by participating public employers, and by other public employers who are required to make contributions on behalf of members, to ensure that those liabilities will be funded no more than 40 years after the date on which the determination is made. [Formerly 237.081; 2001 c.945 §13; 2002 s.s.1 c.9 §1; 2002 s.s.3 c.5 §1; 2003 c.625 §8; 2003 c.746 §7; 2003 c.802 §160; 2005 c.808 §10]

 

      Note: Sections 27 and 28, chapter 355, Oregon Laws 2019, provide:

      Sec. 27. In the year 2019, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall determine the liabilities of the Public Employees Retirement System attributable to the benefits to be provided to members who established membership in the system before August 29, 2003, and shall set the amount of contributions to be made by participating public employers, and by other public employers that are required to make contributions on behalf of members, to ensure that those liabilities will be funded 22 years after the date on which the determination is made. [2019 c.355 §27]

      Sec. 28. Section 27 of this 2019 Act is repealed on January 2, 2020. [2019 c.355 §28]

 

      238.227 Pooling of employers for purpose of computing employer contributions. (1) For the purpose of computing the employer contributions required under ORS 238.225 for benefits to be provided under this chapter:

      (a) The Public Employees Retirement Board shall group together the school districts of the state and treat the school districts of the state as a single employer for actuarial purposes; and

      (b) The board shall group together all community college districts and the state and treat the community college districts and the state as a single employer for actuarial purposes.

      (2) For the purpose of computing the employer contributions required under ORS 238.225 for benefits to be provided under this chapter, any participating public employer other than school districts may elect to be grouped with the state and all community college districts and treated as a single employer for actuarial purposes. An election under this subsection is irrevocable.

      (3) The computation of the contributions of a participating public employer that makes an election under subsection (2) of this section shall be based only on the liabilities of the employer under this chapter that are incurred after the effective date of the employer’s election. The board shall separately compute the contribution of the employer for the liabilities incurred by the employer under this chapter before the effective date of the employer’s election.

      (4) A participating public employer may make an election under subsection (2) of this section only by the adoption of a resolution or ordinance by the governing body of the public employer.

      (5) Except as provided in this section, the board may not require that any participating public employer be grouped with any other participating public employer for the purpose of computing the employer contributions required under ORS 238.225 for benefits to be provided under this chapter. If two participating public employers merge or otherwise consolidate, and one of the public employers has made an election under subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) The board may not require that the public employer that is the product of the consolidation be grouped with the state and all community college districts unless the public employer makes an election under subsection (2) of this section; and

      (b) The board may require that the participating public employer that is the product of the consolidation make contributions based on the group rate only for those members for whom contributions based on the group rate were made before the consolidation. [2005 c.808 §12]

 

      238.229 Effect of lump sum payment to side account on contributions of pooled employer; application of excess amounts to offset contributions to individual account program; rules. (1) If a participating public employer is grouped with any other public employer for the purpose of computing employer contributions under ORS 238.225 and the individual public employer makes a lump sum payment that is in addition to the normal employer contribution of the public employer, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall adjust the amount of employer contributions to be made by the individual public employer to ensure that the benefit of the lump sum payment accrues only to the individual public employer making the payment. An individual public employer that makes a lump sum payment under the provisions of this subsection shall remain grouped with other public employers as provided by ORS 238.227 and 238A.220 for the purpose of all liabilities of the employer that are not paid under this subsection. The board by rule may establish a minimum lump sum payment that must be made by an individual public employer before adjusting employer contributions under this subsection. Notwithstanding any minimum lump sum payment established by the board, the board must allow an individual public employer to make a lump sum payment under this subsection if the payment is equal to the full amount of the individual public employer’s accrued unfunded liabilities under this section and ORS chapter 238A.

      (2) The board shall establish one or more separate accounts within the Public Employees Retirement Fund for one or more lump sum payments made under this section by an individual public employer. The board shall credit to each account all interest and other income received from investment of the account funds during the calendar year. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the board may not collect any administrative expense or other charge from the account or from earnings on the account. Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, the account shall be used to offset contributions to the system that the public employer would otherwise be required to make for the liabilities against which the lump sum payment is applied.

      (3) The board may charge a participating public employer expenses for administration of an account established under subsection (2) of this section in an amount not to exceed $2,500 for the calendar year in which the account is established and for the immediately following two calendar years, and in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per year for all subsequent years.

      (4) If a participating public employer has any liabilities that are attributable to creditable service by employees of the employer before the participating public employer was grouped with other public employers under ORS 238.227, whether under this section or pursuant to board rule, any lump sum payment made under this section must be applied first against those liabilities, with the oldest liability being paid first. Any amounts remaining after application under this subsection must be deposited in a separate account established under subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, if the board determines at any time after an actuarial study that the amounts in an account established under subsection (2) of this section exceed the amounts necessary to fund the employer’s actuarial liabilities under the system, upon request of the employer, the board shall apply the excess amounts to offset contributions to the individual account program that the employer has agreed to pay under ORS 238A.335 or 238A.340. The board may apply excess amounts to offset contributions to the individual account program under this subsection only to the extent that the application will not result in the balance in the account being reduced to less than the outstanding principal balance owed on the bonds issued to fund the account. If the request is made by a school district, the school district must attach to the request a copy of a resolution adopted by the district school board for the district authorizing the request. The board shall adopt rules governing offsets under the provisions of this subsection.

      (6) The board shall apply any excess amounts in an account established under subsection (2) of this section to offset contributions to the individual account program pursuant to subsection (5) of this section only if the board has determined that applying the excess amounts does not cause the system or the Public Employees Retirement Fund to lose qualification as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust under the Internal Revenue Code and under regulations adopted pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. [2005 c.808 §13; 2009 c.889 §1; 2017 c.746 §10a]

 

      238.230 [Formerly 237.017 (2); repealed by 2001 c.945 §15]

 

      238.231 [2005 c.808 §14; renumbered 238.235 in 2019]

 

      238.232 Choice of amortization period for certain lump sum payments to side accounts. (1) If a participating public employer makes a lump sum payment from moneys not borrowed by the employer to an account established under ORS 238.229 in an amount equal to or greater than $10 million, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall allow the participating public employer to choose an amortization period of six years, 10 years, 16 years or 20 years for the use of the lump sum payment to offset contributions to the system that the public employer would otherwise be required to make for the liabilities against which the lump sum payment is applied.

      (2)(a) The board shall allow a participating public employer making a lump sum payment under this section to choose the year in which to begin to use the lump sum payment to offset contributions to the system that the public employer would otherwise be required to make for the liabilities against which the lump sum payment is applied. The board shall begin using the lump sum payment on July 1 of the year chosen under this subsection, with the beginning contribution offset rate based on the actuarial report under ORS 238.605 most recently published as of the date chosen by the public employer.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the board may, after consultation with the participating public employer, begin using a lump sum payment to offset contributions in an earlier year than the year chosen by the public employer under this section to ensure that the period for using the lump sum payment, including earnings accrued, will end no later than 20 years after the date of the actuarial report under ORS 238.605 for the year the lump sum payment is made.

      (c) A lump sum payment for which a participating public employer chooses when to begin to use the lump sum payment to offset contributions under this subsection is not a qualifying lump sum payment for purposes of section 2, chapter 105, Oregon Laws 2018.

      (d) In lieu of the expenses authorized under ORS 238.229 (3), the board may charge a participating public employer expenses for administration of an account as provided by this subsection in an amount established by the board by rule. [2018 c.105 §3b; 2019 c.355 §20]

 

      Note: The amendments to 238.232 by section 21, chapter 355, Oregon Laws 2019, become operative January 1, 2024. See section 61, chapter 355, Oregon Laws 2019. The text that is operative on and after January 1, 2024, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      238.232. If a participating public employer makes a lump sum payment from moneys not borrowed by the employer to an account established under ORS 238.229 in an amount equal to or greater than $10 million, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall allow the participating public employer to choose an amortization period of six years, 10 years, 16 years or 20 years for the use of the lump sum payment to offset contributions to the system that the public employer would otherwise be required to make for the liabilities against which the lump sum payment is applied.

 

      238.235 Unfunded liability or surplus after employee transfer or employer merger, consolidation or split. (1) If a participating public employer transfers employees who are members of the Public Employees Retirement System to another public employer, the two public employers must enter into a written agreement that addresses the manner in which any unfunded liability or surplus of the transferring public employer under the system will be paid or credited.

      (2) If two or more public employers merge or consolidate, and any of the public employers participate in the system, the public employers that merged or consolidated must enter into a written agreement that addresses the manner in which any unfunded liability or surplus of the merged or consolidated public employers under the system will be paid or credited.

      (3) If a participating public employer splits into two or more public employers, the public employers that result from the split must enter into a written agreement that addresses the manner in which any unfunded liability or surplus of the original participating public employer under the system will be paid or credited.

      (4) A written agreement entered into under this section must be delivered to the Public Employees Retirement Board not later than 60 days after the transfer, merger, consolidation or split becomes effective. If public employers affected by a transfer, merger, consolidation or split, including public employers created by a merger, consolidation or split, fail to deliver to the board a written agreement that addresses the unfunded liabilities or surpluses, or fail to deliver to the board a written agreement that addresses the unfunded liabilities or surpluses in a manner satisfactory to the board, the board shall decide the manner in which unfunded liabilities or surpluses will be allocated among the public employers. [Formerly 238.231]

 

MEMBER ACCOUNTS

 

(Generally)

 

      238.250 Regular accounts. The board shall provide for a regular account for each active and inactive member of the system who has made contributions to the fund. The regular account of the member shall show the amount of the member’s contributions to the fund and the interest which they have earned. The board shall furnish a written statement thereof upon request by any member or beneficiary of the system. [Formerly 237.275; 2001 c.945 §46; 2003 c.67 §22]

 

      238.255 Credits to regular accounts when earnings less than assumed interest rate. (1) The regular account for an active or inactive member of the Public Employees Retirement System shall be examined each year. If the regular account is credited with earnings for the previous year in an amount less than the earnings that would have been credited pursuant to the assumed interest rate for that year determined by the Public Employees Retirement Board, the amount of the difference shall be credited to the regular account and charged to a reserve account in the Public Employees Retirement Fund established for the purpose. A reserve account so established may not be maintained on a deficit basis for a period of more than five years. Earnings in excess of the assumed interest rate for years following the year for which a charge is made to the reserve account shall first be applied to reduce or eliminate the amount of a deficit.

      (2) The regular account for an active or inactive member who established membership in the system before January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, may not be credited with earnings in excess of the assumed interest rate until:

      (a) The reserve account established under subsection (1) of this section no longer has a deficit;

      (b) The reserve account established under subsection (1) of this section is fully funded with amounts determined by the board, after consultation with the actuary employed by the board, to be necessary to ensure a zero balance in the account when all members who established membership in the system before January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, have retired; and

      (c) The reserve account established under subsection (1) of this section has been fully funded as described in paragraph (b) of this subsection in each of the three immediately preceding calendar years. [Formerly 237.277; 2001 c.945 §4; 2003 c.3 §1; 2003 c.67 §5; 2003 c.625 §10; 2011 c.722 §13]

 

      238.258 [2003 c.67 §8; 2003 c.625 §12; repealed by 2011 c.722 §15]

 

      238.260 Variable Annuity Account; rules. (1) The purpose of this section is to establish a well balanced, broadly diversified investment program for certain contributions and portions of the member accounts so as to provide retirement benefits for members of the system that will fluctuate as the value and earnings of the investments vary in relation to changes in the general economy. It is anticipated that investment of those contributions and portions of the member accounts in equities will result in the accumulation of larger deposit reserves for those members during their working years, tend to preserve the purchasing power of those reserves and the retirement benefits provided thereby and afford better protection in periods of economic inflation.

      (2) There is established in the Public Employees Retirement Fund an account, separate and distinct from the General Fund, to be known as the Variable Annuity Account. Interest earned by the account shall be credited to the account. The account is part of the Public Employees Retirement System and is not a separate defined contribution plan or account for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (3)(a) A member who is making contributions to the fund may elect at any time to have 25, 50 or 75 percent of contributions by the member to the fund on and after the effective date of the election paid into the Variable Annuity Account, credited to a variable account, and reserved for the purchase of a variable annuity. A member who has elected to have a percentage of contributions so paid, credited and reserved may elect at any time thereafter to have an additional 25 or 50 percent of contributions by the member, but not to exceed a maximum of 75 percent, so paid, credited and reserved. An election shall be in writing on a form furnished by the board and be filed with the board. An election shall be effective on January 1 following the filing thereof.

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a member may not contribute to the Variable Annuity Account after December 31, 2003.

      (4) A member who has elected to have contributions paid into the Variable Annuity Account under subsection (3) of this section may thereafter cause the contributions to cease being paid into the member’s variable account by filing a request in writing on a form furnished by the board and filed with the board. The contributions shall cease being paid into the member’s variable account after December 31 following the filing of the request.

Contracts so entered into:

      (a) May provide that annuities purchased thereunder be payable in variable dollar amounts, but if that provision is made, provision also shall be made that a member of the system who has a variable account, upon retiring from service and before the first payment of retirement allowance becomes normally due, may elect an option to have the annuities payable to the member or the beneficiary of the member in fixed or variable dollar amounts or both.

      (10) When an annuity is payable under this chapter to a member of the system who has a variable account, or is payable to a beneficiary of that person, the portion of the annuity payable from the Variable Annuity Account shall be proportionately increased or decreased for a calendar year when, as of October 31 of the preceding calendar year, the balance of the member’s variable account exceeds or is less than the current value of the annuity, determined in accordance with the rate of interest and approved actuarial tables then in effect.

      (11) Notwithstanding subsection (10) of this section, the board, in the event of extraordinary fluctuation in the market value of investments of the Variable Annuity Account and in order to avoid substantial inequities, may increase or decrease the portions of annuities paid from the account for periods less than a calendar year and determined as of dates other than October 31.

      (a) The board shall determine the difference between the member account of the member and what the member account of the member would have been had the member not participated in the variable annuity program on or after January 1, 1982, plus the contributions made on salary in excess of $4,800 per year during the period January 1, 1956, through December 31, 1967.

      (b) If the member account of the member due to participation in the variable annuity program or due to the contributions made on salary in excess of $4,800 per year is greater, the monthly retirement allowance of the member shall be increased by the value of the difference, using the annuity tables applicable to the plan selected by the member.

      (c) If the member account of the member due to participation in the variable annuity program or due to the contributions made on salary in excess of $4,800 per year is lesser, the monthly retirement allowance of the member shall be decreased by the value of the difference, using the annuity tables applicable to the plan selected by the member.

      (13) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the rights and benefits under this chapter of an active or retired member of the system or of a beneficiary of the member are not affected by this section and the provisions of this chapter applicable to regular accounts of active and retired members of the system in the fund are also applicable to variable accounts.

      (14)(a) In addition to the transfer provided for in subsection (9) of this section, a member of the system who has a variable account may at any time prior to retirement elect to transfer the balance in that account to the regular account of the member in the fund if:

      (A) The member is other than a police officer or firefighter and has attained the age of 50;

      (B) The member is a police officer or firefighter and has attained the age of 45; or

      (C) The member has a combined total of 25 years or more of creditable service in the system and prior service credit.

      (c) An election under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be in writing and shall be filed with the board. The board by rule shall prescribe a form for the purposes of application. An election so made shall be effective on January 1 of the year following the year in which the election is made. If the member account of the member as of the effective date of the election is less than what the member account of the member would have been had the member not participated in the variable annuity program, not including the contributions made on salary in excess of $4,800 per year during the period January 1, 1956, through December 31, 1967, the monthly retirement allowance of a member calculated under ORS 238.300 (2)(a) or (b)(B) shall be decreased by the value of the difference.

      (d) As of the effective date of an election under this subsection, the board shall credit all earnings to the member’s variable account based on the actual calendar year variable earnings rate for the year in which the election is made. This account balance shall:

      (A) Be used by the board in determining whether the member’s election is effective under paragraph (c) of this subsection; and

      (B) Be the account balance credited by the board to the regular account of the member in the fund if the election is determined to be effective.

      (e) Subject to paragraph (c) of this subsection, the annuity of a member who makes an effective transfer under this subsection shall be based on the amount in the regular account of the member in the fund as otherwise provided in this chapter, and the member shall not receive a variable annuity as provided in this section.

      (1) A refund annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions, if any, by the member under this chapter and interest thereon credited at the time of retirement, which annuity shall provide an allowance payable during the life of the member and at death a lump sum equal in amount to the difference between accumulated contributions at the time of retirement and the sum of the annuity payments actually made to the member during life shall be paid to such person, if any, as the member nominates by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board or shall otherwise be paid according to the provisions of this chapter for disposal of an amount credited to the member account of a member at the time of death in the event the member designates no beneficiary to receive the amount or no such beneficiary is able to receive the amount. If death of the member occurs before the first payment is due, the member account of the member shall be treated as though death had occurred before retirement.

      (2)(a) A life pension (nonrefund) for current service provided by the contributions of employers and, for pension benefits that accrue on or after July 1, 2020, amounts in the employee pension stability account established for the member under ORS 238A.353, which pension, subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, shall be an amount which, when added to the sum of the annuity, if any, under subsection (1) of this section and the annuity, if any, provided on the same basis and payable from the Variable Annuity Account, both annuities considered on a refund basis, results in a total of:

      (A) For service as a police officer or firefighter, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as a police officer or firefighter before the effective date of retirement.

      (B) For service as other than a police officer or firefighter, including service as a member of the Legislative Assembly, 1.67 percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as other than a police officer or firefighter before the effective date of retirement.

      (b) A pension under this subsection shall be at least:

      (A) For a member who first establishes membership in the system before July 1, 2003, the actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the member. A person establishes membership in the system before July 1, 2003, for the purposes of this subparagraph if:

      (i) The person is a member of the system, or a judge member of the system, on the day immediately before July 1, 2003; or

      (ii) The person performed any period of service for a participating public employer before July 1, 2003, that is credited to the six-month period of employment required of an employee under ORS 238.015 before an employee may become a member of the system.

The number of years of membership of a member who received a refund of contributions as provided in ORS 237.976 (2) is limited to the number of years after the day before the date on which the refund was received. The number of years of membership of a member who is separated, for any reason other than death or disability, from all service entitling the member to membership in the system, who withdraws the amount credited to the member account of the member in the fund during absence from such service and who thereafter reenters the service of an employer participating in the system but does not repay the amount so withdrawn as provided in this chapter, is limited to the number of years after the day before the date of so reentering.

      (3) An additional life pension (nonrefund) for prior service credit, including military service, credited to the member at the time of first becoming a member of the system, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, which pension shall be provided by the contributions of the employer.

If death of the member occurs before the first payment is due, the member account of the member shall be treated as though death had occurred before retirement.

      (2)(a) A life pension (nonrefund) for current service provided by the contributions of employers, which pension, subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, shall be an amount which, when added to the sum of the annuity, if any, under subsection (1) of this section and the annuity, if any, provided on the same basis and payable from the Variable Annuity Account, both annuities considered on a refund basis, results in a total of:

      (A) For service as a police officer or firefighter, two percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as a police officer or firefighter before the effective date of retirement.

      (B) For service as other than a police officer or firefighter, including service as a member of the Legislative Assembly, 1.67 percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of membership in the system as other than a police officer or firefighter before the effective date of retirement.

      (b) A pension under this subsection shall be at least:

      (A) For a member who first establishes membership in the system before July 1, 2003, the actuarial equivalent of the annuity provided by the accumulated contributions of the member. A person establishes membership in the system before July 1, 2003, for the purposes of this subparagraph if:

      (i) The person is a member of the system, or a judge member of the system, on the day immediately before July 1, 2003; or

      (ii) The person performed any period of service for a participating public employer before July 1, 2003, that is credited to the six-month period of employment required of an employee under ORS 238.015 before an employee may become a member of the system.

      (B) For a member who made contributions before August 21, 1981, the equivalent of a pension computed pursuant to this subsection as it existed immediately before that date.

      (c) As used in this subsection, “number of years of membership” means the number of full years of creditable service plus any remaining fraction of a year of creditable service. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, in determining a remaining fraction a full month shall be considered as one-twelfth of a year and a major fraction of a month shall be considered as a full month. Membership of a school district employee, an employee of an institution of higher education engaged in teaching or other school activity or an employee of the Department of Human Services, the Oregon Youth Authority, the Department of Corrections or the State Board of Education engaged in teaching or other school activity at an institution supervised by the authority, board or department, for all portions of a school year in a calendar year in which the district school, institution of higher education or school activity at an institution so supervised in which the member is employed is normally in session shall be considered as a full one-half year of membership. The number of years of membership of a member who received a refund of contributions as provided in ORS 237.976 (2) is limited to the number of years after the day before the date on which the refund was received. The number of years of membership of a member who is separated, for any reason other than death or disability, from all service entitling the member to membership in the system, who withdraws the amount credited to the member account of the member in the fund during absence from such service and who thereafter reenters the service of an employer participating in the system but does not repay the amount so withdrawn as provided in this chapter, is limited to the number of years after the day before the date of so reentering.

      (3) An additional life pension (nonrefund) for prior service credit, including military service, credited to the member at the time of first becoming a member of the system, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, which pension shall be provided by the contributions of the employer.

      (c) The same prior service pension the member would have received had the member worked until normal retirement age.

      (2) As used in subsection (1) of this section, “injury” means bodily injury causing the disability directly and independently of all other causes and effected solely through accidental means.

      (3) Whenever an employee who is a member of the system and who has been an employee for 10 years or more of an employer participating in the system is found, after being examined by one or more physicians selected by the board, to be mentally or physically incapacitated for an extended duration, as determined by medical examination, and thereby unable to perform any work for which qualified, from cause other than injury or disease sustained while in actual performance of duty or intentionally self-inflicted, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

After having established membership in the Public Employees Retirement System a member shall be considered to have been employed one year for each 12-month period or major fraction thereof during which time the member received compensation for employment which entitled the member to membership in the system, as evidenced by payroll records. For the purpose of determining a member’s eligibility for disability benefits, no leave of absence after a member ceases to work for any participating employer shall be considered other than accumulated sick leave not in excess of 90 days. The effective date of the disability shall not in any event be determined by the board as prior to the last day for which the disabled member performed services for a participating employer. No benefits may be paid for any month in which the member received salary or sick leave benefits from the participating employer.

      (7) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (3) of this section, a member of the system shall be considered to be mentally or physically incapacitated for an extended duration if the mental or physical incapacity can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 90 days.

      Option 2A. A reduced disability retirement allowance payable during the period of incapacity which, unless modified under subsection (3) of this section, continues after death, if death shall occur after the effective date of the disability and during the period of incapacity, for the life of the beneficiary whom the member nominates by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board at the time of election, should the beneficiary survive the member; or

      Option 3. A reduced disability retirement allowance payable during the period of incapacity, with the provision that after death, if death shall occur after the effective date of the disability and during the period of incapacity, such allowance shall continue at one-half the rate paid to the member and be paid for the life of the beneficiary whom the member has designated in writing duly acknowledged and filed with the board at the time of election, should the beneficiary survive the member; or

      Option 3A. A reduced disability retirement allowance payable during the period of incapacity which, unless modified under subsection (3) of this section, continues after death, if death shall occur after the effective date of the disability and during the period of incapacity, at one-half the rate paid to the member and is paid for the life of the beneficiary whom the member nominates by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board at the time of election, should the beneficiary survive the member; or

      (2) The beneficiary designated by a member to receive any benefit under this section shall be the same as designated under ORS 238.390 (1). The designation of a beneficiary or the election of an option may be changed by a member within 60 days after the date of the first benefit payment, except that the designation of a beneficiary under Option 4 may be changed by the member at any time before the member’s death.

      (3) If a retired member has elected to receive a disability retirement allowance under Option 2A or Option 3A as provided in subsection (1) of this section, and if the beneficiary under that option dies after the expiration of the time within which the member could change the election of an option or if the beneficiary is the spouse of the member and the marriage relationship is terminated as provided by law after the expiration of the time within which the member could change the election of an option, the member may elect to receive, in lieu of the optional form of allowance previously elected, the allowance that the member would have received on the effective date of retirement under Option 1 as provided in subsection (1) of this section and adjusted by the actual amount of any cost-of-living or other post-retirement adjustments made to the original allowance since the effective date of retirement.

      (b) If not eligible for benefits under ORS 238.395, elect to receive benefits under ORS 238.390 (1); or

      (c) Elect Option 2 or 3 under subsection (1) of this section and designate the surviving spouse as beneficiary thereunder with the same force and effect as if the election and designation had been properly made by the deceased member.

(1)(a) Upon the request by a public employer that its employees be compensated for accumulated unused sick leave with pay in the form of increased retirement benefits upon service or disability retirement, the board shall establish a procedure for adding to the gross amount of salary used in determining final average salary the monetary value of one-half of the accumulated unused sick leave with pay of each retiring employee of the requesting public employer and shall establish benefits of the retiring employee on the basis of a final average salary reflecting that addition.

      (b) For employees of a common school district, a union high school district, an education service district or an institution of higher education engaged in teaching or other school activity, or employees of the school operated under ORS 346.010 engaged in teaching or other school activity, who are employed under contract for a period of less than 12 consecutive months and who are entitled to sick leave with pay of less than 96 hours for a year, each hour of accumulated unused sick leave with pay shall be valued on the basis of the actual number of contract hours of employment during the last year of contributing membership of an employee before retiring and the salary of the employee during the same period. This paragraph does not apply to any employee who is employed under contract for 12 consecutive months in any of the three or less years used in determining the final average salary of the employee.

      (c) For the purpose of this subsection, accumulated unused sick leave with pay includes unused sick leave with pay accumulated by an active member of the system while in the service of any public employer participating in the system that has the request described in paragraph (a) of this subsection in effect at the time of the member’s separation from the service of the employer, whether that employer is or is not the employer of the member at the time of the member’s retirement.

      (d) The board shall establish rules requiring all public employers participating in the system to transmit to the board reports of unused sick leave with pay accumulated by their employees who are members of the system and to provide timely notification to each of those employees of unused sick leave with pay accumulated by the employee and reported to the board.

      (2) Accumulated unused sick leave with pay may be considered for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section only in accordance with the following requirements:

      (a) Sick leave not credited at the rate actually provided by the public employer may not be considered. The amount of sick leave exceeding an amount credited at the lowest rate in effect for any employee of the public employer who is normally entitled to sick leave, and in any event exceeding an amount credited at a rate of eight hours for each full month worked, may not be considered.

      (b) Sick leave credited for periods when an employee was absent from employment on sabbatical leave, educational leave or any leave without pay may not be considered.

      (c) Any period during which an employee was absent from employment for illness or injury that was charged against sick leave not qualified for consideration shall be deducted from sick leave qualified for consideration.

      (d) Sick leave for any period for which the public employer provides no sick leave with pay for its employees may not be considered.

      (e) Sick leave accumulated on and after July 1, 1973, may be considered only to the extent it is supported by records of accumulation and use pursuant to a plan adopted formally by the public employer.

      (f) Accumulated unused sick leave for periods before July 1, 1973, may be considered as follows:

      (A) If any department, bureau or other organizational unit of a public employer maintained formal records of accumulation and use even though the public employer did not require that those records be maintained, the accumulated unused sick leave shall be considered according to those records.

      (B) Where the public employer provided sick leave before July 1, 1973, but formal records of accumulation and use were not required or if required, are unavailable or incomplete, or the sick leave was subject to administrative limitations on total accumulation or transfer between public employers, accumulated unused sick leave for periods before July 1, 1973, may be considered as equal to 2.675 hours for each full month worked or an amount per month equal to the average monthly accumulation by an employee during the period beginning July 1, 1973, and ending at the time of retirement, whichever amount is greater, but reduced by the amount of any accumulated unused sick leave credited to the employee on July 1, 1973.

      (g) The written certification of a member or former member of the Legislative Assembly shall constitute a formal record of accumulation and use in determining the amount of accumulated unused sick leave of an employee of the Legislative Assembly, either of its houses or any of its committees or officers for periods of employment before July 1, 1981. Sick leave accumulated on and after July 1, 1981, by employees of the Legislative Assembly, either of its houses or any of its committees or officers may be considered only to the extent it is supported by records of accumulation and use maintained by the Legislative Administration Committee, or any statutory, standing, special or interim committee of the Legislative Assembly or either house thereof, or any constitutional or statutory office of the Legislative Assembly or either house thereof, pursuant to a plan adopted formally by the committee or officer.

      (3)(a) As used in this subsection, “legislative employee” means any person employed by the Legislative Assembly, either of its houses or any of its committees or officers, but does not include a regular employee of a statutory committee or statutory office of the Legislative Assembly described in ORS 173.005 (1).

      (b) Upon the request of a retiring legislative employee who is a member of the system, and the request of the public employer of the legislative employee, that the legislative employee be compensated for accumulated unused vacation with pay for periods of legislative employment in the form of increased retirement benefits upon service or disability retirement, the board shall add to the gross amount of salary used in determining final average salary of the legislative employee the monetary value of one-half of the accumulated unused vacation with pay of the legislative employee and shall establish the benefits of the legislative employee on the basis of a final average salary reflecting that addition.

      (c) Accumulated unused vacation with pay may be considered for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection only in accordance with the following requirements:

      (A) Vacation not credited at the rate actually provided by the public employer may not be considered.

      (B) Amounts of vacation exceeding amounts creditable to employees in the classified service of the state service pursuant to ORS 240.515 (1), and rules adopted pursuant thereto, in effect on June 30, 1981, shall not be considered.

      (C) Vacation accumulated before, on and after July 1, 1981, may be considered only to the extent it is supported by records of accumulation and use pursuant to a plan adopted formally by the public employer. However, the written certification of a member or former member of the Legislative Assembly shall constitute a formal record of accumulation and use in determining the amount of accumulated unused vacation of a legislative employee for periods of legislative employment before July 1, 1981.

      (4) Employers with plans providing payments on account of sickness in lieu of sick leave with pay may request the board to consider the monetary value of accumulated unused payments on account of sickness as if such payments were an equivalent amount of accumulated unused sick leave with pay under the same terms and conditions specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. [Formerly 237.153; 1997 c.249 §68; 2001 c.295 §10; 2007 c.70 §57; 2007 c.858 §60; 2009 c.562 §16; 2011 c.637 §74]

 

      238.355 Computation of unused sick leave for community college employees. Notwithstanding ORS 238.350 (2)(a), unused sick leave for community college employees shall accumulate for an unlimited number of days and shall accumulate at the rate of 10 days per school year or one day per month employed, whichever is greater. Except as provided in ORS 238.350 (1)(b), unused sick leave accumulated by community college employees shall be computed in the same manner as for employees in state classified service for computation of retirement benefits. [Formerly 237.017 (1)]

 

(Cost-of-Living Adjustments)

 

      238.360 Cost-of-living adjustments. (1) On July 1 of each year, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall increase the yearly allowance that a member or member’s beneficiary receives or is entitled to receive, as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The increase is first payable with the allowance that the member or the member’s beneficiary receives or is entitled to receive on August 1.

      (2)(a) If the member’s or member’s beneficiary’s yearly allowance is $60,000 or less, the allowance shall be increased by 1.25 percent.

      (b) If the member’s or member’s beneficiary’s yearly allowance is more than $60,000, the allowance shall be increased by $750 plus 0.15 percent of the amount of the yearly allowance exceeding $60,000.

      (3) Any increase in the allowance shall be paid from contributions of the public employer under ORS 238.225.

      (4) As used in this section, “yearly allowance” means the monthly allowance that a member or member’s beneficiary is entitled to on July 1 of the year in which the board is calculating the increase under subsection (1) of this section, multiplied by 12. [Formerly 237.060; 2001 c.945 §79; 2013 c.53 §§1,3; 2013 s.s. c.2 §1]

 

      Note: The text of 238.360, as it existed before the amendments to 238.360 by sections 1 and 3, chapter 53, Oregon Laws 2013, and section 1, chapter 2, Oregon Laws 2013 (special session), is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      238.360. (1) As soon as practicable after January 1 each year, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall determine the percentage increase or decrease in the cost-of-living for the previous calendar year, based on the Consumer Price Index (Portland area–all items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor for the Portland, Oregon, area. Prior to July 1 each year the allowance which the member or the member’s beneficiary is receiving or is entitled to receive on August 1 for the month of July shall be multiplied by the percentage figure determined, and the allowance for the next 12 months beginning July 1 adjusted to the resultant amount.

      (2) Such increase or decrease shall not exceed two percent of any monthly retirement allowance in any year and no allowance shall be adjusted to an amount less than the amount to which the recipient would be entitled if no cost-of-living adjustment were authorized.

      (3) The amount of any cost-of-living increase or decrease in any year in excess of the maximum annual retirement allowance adjustment of two percent shall be accumulated from year to year and included in the computation of increases or decreases in succeeding years.

      (4) Any increase in the allowance shall be paid from contributions of the public employer under ORS 238.225. Any decrease in the allowance shall be returned to the employer in the form of a credit against contributions of the employer under ORS 238.225.

 

      238.361 Consumer price index for calculation of cost of living adjustments. When the Public Employees Retirement Board is required to use a consumer price index to calculate cost of living adjustments to benefits payable under ORS chapter 238 or 238A, the board shall use the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. [2019 c.57 §40]

 

(Benefit Increases in Compensation of Claims Based on Taxation of Benefits)

 

      238.362 Increased benefits payable in compensation for certain damages attributable to taxation of benefits. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 3 to 10, chapter 569, Oregon Laws 1995, the increased benefits payable under ORS 238.364 and 238.368 (2), including all increased benefits payable to judge members by reason of the application of ORS 238.364 and 238.368 (2) to judge members, and under section 10, chapter 569, Oregon Laws 1995:

      (a) Shall not be paid in any tax year in which retirement benefits that are payable under the Public Employees Retirement System and that are attributable to service rendered by the member before September 29, 1991, are wholly exempt from Oregon personal income taxation under Oregon law.

      (b) Shall be reduced proportionately for any tax year in which retirement benefits that are payable under the Public Employees Retirement System and that are attributable to service rendered by the member before September 29, 1991, are partially exempt from Oregon personal income taxation under Oregon law.

      (2) An overpayment of benefits that results from the operation of subsection (1) of this section is not recoverable from the recipient of the benefits, but the Public Employees Retirement Board shall ensure that no additional overpayments are made.

      (3) No member of the system or beneficiary of a member of the system shall acquire a right, contractual or otherwise, to the increased benefits provided by sections 3 to 10, chapter 569, Oregon Laws 1995.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a class action may not be commenced on or after July 14, 1995, based on a claim for damages arising out of the subjecting of benefits paid under this chapter to Oregon personal income taxation by act of the Legislative Assembly.

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any court in which there is pending on May 30, 1997, a class action that was commenced before July 14, 1995, based on a claim for damages arising out of the subjecting of benefits paid under this chapter to Oregon personal income taxation, may at any time after May 30, 1997, reopen that class action if by act of the Legislative Assembly there is a decrease in the benefit payable under ORS 238.364 or 238.368 (2), or in the benefits payable to judge members by reason of the application of ORS 238.364 or 238.368 (2) to judge members, or in the benefits payable to any member, judge member or beneficiary under section 10, chapter 569, Oregon Laws 1995, without an equivalent decrease in the personal income tax imposed under Oregon law on benefits paid under the system that are attributable to service rendered before September 29, 1991. Upon reopening the class action, the court may change the membership of the classes and may grant such further relief as may be warranted, including the entry of a judgment for damages or a judgment for supplemental relief under ORS 28.080. [Formerly 238.375]

 

      238.364 Calculation of increased benefit payable under ORS 238.362. (1)(a) Upon retirement of an employee who is a member of the Public Employees Retirement System and computation of that member’s service retirement allowance under ORS 238.300, 238.305 or 238.425, or computation of any disability retirement allowance under ORS 238.320, 238.325, 238.330, 238.345 or 238.425, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall add to the amount of the allowance, including amounts attributable to prior service credit and the amount of any refund of accumulated employee contributions, the greater of the percentage increase calculated under ORS 238.366 or a percentage increase calculated under subsection (4) of this section. No benefit shall be paid to a member or beneficiary under ORS 238.366 if the benefit payable to the member or beneficiary under this section is larger than the benefit payable under ORS 238.366.

      (b) The percentage increase provided for in this section shall be adjusted by the board to reflect increases or decreases in a member’s retirement allowance that are attributable to the member’s participation in the Variable Annuity Account established by ORS 238.260, that are attributable to a change in the member’s beneficiary or payment option under ORS 238.305 or 238.325, or that are attributable to corrections to the member’s retirement allowance calculation.

      (c) The percentage increase provided for in this section shall be applied to any lump sum payment made to a member or a beneficiary of a member on or after January 1, 1991, that is attributable to a retroactive correction or adjustment of the amount payable to the member or beneficiary as a retirement allowance or that is attributable to a retroactive correction or adjustment to any other benefit that entitles a member or beneficiary to an increased benefit under this section. The percentage increase payable under this paragraph applies only to the principal amounts included in the lump sum payment as a retroactive correction or adjustment and does not apply to any interest on the retroactive correction or adjustment paid as part of the lump sum payment.

      (2) The amount of any death benefit under ORS 238.390, 238.395, 238.400 or 238.405, including the amount of any monthly payments, shall be increased by the greater of the percentage provided for in ORS 238.366 or the percentage calculated under subsection (4) of this section.

      (3)(a) A member of the system who elects to receive a lump sum in lieu of a retirement allowance or other benefit under ORS 238.315 shall receive an increase based on the greater of the percentage provided for in ORS 238.366 or the percentage calculated under subsection (4) of this section.

      (b) A member of the system who withdraws the amount credited to the member account, if any, of the member in the fund under the provisions of ORS 238.265, or whose member account is returned to the employee after the membership of the employee is terminated under the provisions of ORS 238.095, shall receive an additional amount calculated by multiplying the amount of the member account of the member by the greater of the percentage provided for in ORS 238.366 or the percentage calculated under subsection (4) of this section. If a member thereafter elects to obtain restoration of creditable service by repaying the amount of the withdrawn member account pursuant to the provisions of ORS 238.105, the member must also repay all amounts paid under this section, together with interest from the date of withdrawal at the same rate as applied to the withdrawn member account under ORS 238.105. If a member repays only part of the withdrawn member account pursuant to the provisions of ORS 238.115, the member must repay that part of the amount paid under this section that is proportionate to the portion of the withdrawn member account that is repaid under ORS 238.115, together with interest from the date of withdrawal at the same rate as applied to the withdrawn member account under ORS 238.115. All amounts paid to the member that are subsequently repaid under ORS 238.105 or 238.115 shall be deposited by the board to the employer reserve for pension accounts in the fund.

      (4)(a) The Public Employees Retirement Board shall calculate a multiplier for the purposes of this section equal to the percentage produced by the following formula:

 

      1

      ________

      .91

 

      (b) Upon the retirement or death of a member of the system, the board shall determine the fraction of the member’s retirement allowance or death benefit, including any refund or lump sum payment, that is attributable to service rendered by the member before October 1, 1991. The board shall then calculate a percentage that is equal to that fraction multiplied by the multiplier determined by the board under paragraph (a) of this subsection. The percentage so calculated shall be used to determine the amount of the increase in benefits provided to a member, if any, under this section.

      (5) For the purpose of determining that portion of a retirement allowance or death benefit attributable to service rendered before October 1, 1991, the board shall divide the number of years of creditable service performed before October 1, 1991, by the total number of years of creditable service during which the pension income was earned. For the purposes of this subsection:

      (a) The number of years of creditable service does not include any period of employment for which a benefit is paid for prior service credit.

      (b) Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, the number of years of creditable service includes all retirement credit of the member, and any retirement credit of a member that is attributable to periods of service, employment or other activity performed before October 1, 1991, shall be considered creditable service performed before October 1, 1991.

      (6) The increased benefits provided for in this section shall be funded by employer contributions.

      (7) The increased benefits provided by this section apply only to members who establish membership in the Public Employees Retirement System before July 14, 1995, and whose effective date of retirement or date of death is on or after January 1, 1991. The increased benefits provided by this section do not apply to any creditable service or prior service credit acquired by a member under the terms of a contract of integration entered into pursuant to ORS 238.035, 238.680 or 238.690 on or after October 1, 1991.

      (8) If a member is entitled to receive an increased benefit under the provisions of this section, and any portion of the member’s retirement allowance or other benefit payable under the system is payable to an alternate payee under the provisions of ORS 238.465, the increased benefits payable under this section shall be divided between the member and the alternate payee in proportion to the share of the total benefit received by each person. If an alternate payee elects to begin receiving benefits under ORS 238.465 (1) before the member’s effective date of retirement, the alternate payee may not begin receiving the increased benefit provided for in this section until benefits are first paid from the system on behalf of the member.

      (9) A person establishes membership in the system before July 14, 1995, for the purposes of subsection (7) of this section if:

      (a) The person is a member of the system, or a judge member of the system, on July 14, 1995;

      (b) The person was a member of the system before July 14, 1995, ceased to be a member of the system under the provisions of ORS 238.095, 238.265 or 238.545 before July 14, 1995, but restores part or all of the forfeited creditable service from before July 14, 1995, under the provisions of ORS 238.105 or 238.115 after July 14, 1995; or

      (c) The person performed any period of service for a participating public employer before July 14, 1995, that is credited to the six-month period of employment required of an employee under ORS 238.015 before an employee may become a member of the system. [Formerly 238.380]

      (b) The percentage increase provided for in this section shall be adjusted by the board to reflect increases or decreases in a member’s retirement allowance that are attributable to the member’s participation in the Variable Annuity Account established by ORS 238.260, that are attributable to a change in the member’s beneficiary or payment option under ORS 238.305 or 238.325, or that are attributable to corrections to the member’s retirement allowance calculation.

      (c) The percentage increase provided for in this section shall be applied to any lump sum payment made to a member or a beneficiary of a member on or after January 1, 1991, that is attributable to a retroactive correction or adjustment of the amount payable to the member or beneficiary as a retirement allowance or that is attributable to a retroactive correction or adjustment to any other benefit that entitles a member or beneficiary to an increased benefit under this section. The percentage increase payable under this paragraph applies only to the principal amounts included in the lump sum payment as a retroactive correction or adjustment and does not apply to any interest on the retroactive correction or adjustment paid as part of the lump sum payment.

      (2) The amount of any death benefit under ORS 238.390, 238.395, 238.400 or 238.405, including the amount of any monthly payments, shall be increased by an amount equal to the percentage increase provided in subsection (4) of this section.

If a member thereafter elects to obtain restoration of creditable service by repaying the amount of the withdrawn member account pursuant to the provisions of ORS 238.105, the member must also repay all amounts paid under this section, together with interest from the date of withdrawal at the same rate as applied to the withdrawn member account under ORS 238.105. If a member repays only part of the withdrawn member account pursuant to the provisions of ORS 238.115, the member must repay that part of the amount paid under this section that is proportionate to the portion of the withdrawn member account that is repaid under ORS 238.115, together with interest from the date of withdrawal at the same rate as applied to the withdrawn member account under ORS 238.115.

(Death Benefits)

 

      238.390 Death benefit. (1) If a member of the system dies before retiring, the amount of money, if any, credited at the time of death to the member account of the member in the fund shall be paid to the beneficiaries designated by the member. For this purpose a member may designate as a beneficiary any person or the executor or administrator of the estate of the member or a trustee named by the member to execute an express trust in regard to such amount. The termination of a person’s membership in the system pursuant to ORS 238.095 (1) or (2) invalidates any designation of beneficiary made by the person before the termination of membership.

      (2) If a member dies before retiring and has not designated a beneficiary under subsection (1) of this section, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall pay the amount of money, if any, credited at the time of death to the member account of the deceased member to a personal representative appointed for the estate of the deceased member. If a small estate affidavit has been filed under ORS 114.505 to 114.560, and the amount of money credited to the account does not exceed the maximum amount of personal property for which a small estate affidavit may be filed under ORS 114.505 to 114.560, the board shall pay the amount to the person who filed the affidavit.

      (3) The beneficiary designated under subsection (1) of this section may elect to receive the amount payable in actuarially determined monthly payments for the life of such beneficiary as long as such monthly payments are at least $200.

      (4) Accrued benefits due a retired member at the time of death are payable to the designated beneficiary or as provided in subsection (2) of this section. For the purpose of determining accrued benefits due a retired member at the time of death, accrued benefits are considered to have ceased as of the last day of the month preceding the month in which the retired member dies; but if Option 2 or Option 3 under ORS 238.305 has been elected as provided in this chapter and the beneficiary survives the retired member, the benefits to the beneficiary shall commence as of the first day of the month in which the retired member dies, and payment of benefits under Option 2 or Option 3 shall cease with the payment for the month preceding the month in which the beneficiary dies.

      (5) If a member dies before retiring and has designated a beneficiary under subsection (1) of this section, but the beneficiary dies before the member, or dies before distribution is made under this section, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall pay the amount of money, if any, that would otherwise have been paid to the beneficiary to a personal representative appointed for the estate of the deceased beneficiary. If a small estate affidavit has been filed under ORS 114.505 to 114.560, and the amount of money that would have been paid to the beneficiary does not exceed the maximum amount of personal property for which a small estate affidavit may be filed under ORS 114.505 to 114.560, the board shall pay the amount to the person who filed the small estate affidavit on behalf of the estate of the beneficiary.

      (6) Interest upon the member account of the member shall accrue until the date that the amount in the member account is distributed. Any balance in the variable account of the deceased member is considered to be transferred to the regular account of the member as of the date of death. The board shall establish procedures for computing and crediting interest on the balance in the member account for the period between the date of death and date of distribution.

      (7) Payment by the board of amounts in the manner provided by this section completely discharges the board and system on account of the death, and shall hold the board and system harmless from any claim for wrongful payment. [Formerly 237.165; 2001 c.945 §56; 2003 c.67 §25; 2003 c.625 §1; 2005 c.808 §28; 2019 c.165 §22]

 

      238.395 Additional death benefit. (1)(a) In addition to any other benefits under this chapter, a death benefit, provided by contributions of the public employer under ORS 238.225 and, for benefits that accrue on or after July 1, 2020, amounts in the employee pension stability account established for the member under ORS 238A.353, shall be paid to the beneficiaries designated under ORS 238.390 (1) of a person who is an active or inactive member of the Public Employees Retirement System and who dies as a result of injuries received while employed in the service of the public employer or within 120 days after termination from service with a participating public employer. A member who is on a leave of absence without pay from employment with a participating public employer has not terminated service with that participating public employer for the purposes of this section.

      (b) The death benefit under this subsection is an amount equal to the amount in the member account of the deceased member at the time of death.

      (c) In the event that a beneficiary has not been named as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection and ORS 238.390 (1), the death benefit under this subsection shall be paid in the manner provided for payment of money credited to the member account of the member in ORS 238.390 (2).

      (d) The beneficiary designated under paragraph (a) of this subsection and ORS 238.390 (1) may elect to receive the amount payable in actuarially determined monthly payments for the life of such beneficiary as long as such monthly payments, plus the monthly amount if elected under ORS 238.390 (3), are at least $200.

      (e) Interest upon the death benefit provided by this subsection accrues until the date that the benefit is distributed. The Public Employees Retirement Board shall establish procedures for computing interest to be credited on the benefit for the period between the date of death and date of distribution.

      (2)(a) If a member of the system dies while employed in the service of a participating public employer or within 120 days after termination from service with a participating public employer and the member’s spouse is the member’s beneficiary under ORS 238.390, the member’s spouse may elect to receive the benefit provided under this subsection in lieu of the death benefits provided under ORS 238.390 and subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) The member’s spouse must notify the board in writing of an election under this section no later than 60 days after the date of death of the member.

      (c) The death benefit to be paid under this subsection is for the life of the member’s spouse and is the actuarial equivalent of 50 percent of the service retirement allowance that would otherwise have been paid to the deceased member, which shall be calculated:

      (A) As of the date of death, if the member dies after the earliest retirement date for the member under ORS 238.280; or

      (B) As if the member became an inactive member on the date of death and retired at the earliest retirement date for the member under ORS 238.280.

      (d) The death benefit provided under this subsection is first effective on the first day of the month following the election of the member’s spouse to receive the death benefit under this subsection. The member’s spouse may elect to delay payment of the death benefit, but payment must commence no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the deceased member would have reached 70-1/2 years of age.

      (3) Payment by the board of additional death benefits in the manner provided by this section completely discharges the board and system on account of the death, and shall hold the board and system harmless from any claim for wrongful payment. [Formerly 237.169; 2001 c.945 §57; 2003 c.625 §4; 2019 c.355 §17; 2019 c.487 §1]

A member who is on a leave of absence without pay from employment with a participating public employer has not terminated service with that participating public employer for the purposes of this section.

      (b) The death benefit under this subsection is an amount equal to the amount in the member account of the deceased member at the time of death.

      (d) The beneficiary designated under paragraph (a) of this subsection and ORS 238.390 (1) may elect to receive the amount payable in actuarially determined monthly payments for the life of such beneficiary as long as such monthly payments, plus the monthly amount if elected under ORS 238.390 (3), are at least $200.

      238.400 Payment upon death of retired member who dies before making election of retirement benefits. If a person who is a member of the system, who has attained normal retirement age and who has retired from service, dies without making an election under ORS 238.305 and prior to the expiration of the time within which such an election could be made by the person, and the records of the Public Employees Retirement Board indicate that the person has designated the surviving spouse as the beneficiary under ORS 238.390 (1), such surviving spouse may, not more than 60 days after the date of the death of such deceased member, elect to receive the amount referred to in ORS 238.390 (1), or elect Option 2 or Option 3 under ORS 238.305 and designate self as the beneficiary thereunder with the same force and effect as if the election and designation had been properly made by the deceased member.

The benefit shall be equal to 25 percent of the unmodified retirement allowance the police officer or firefighter was receiving or was entitled to receive at the time of death under ORS 238.345 or under this chapter.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies to an eligible rollover distribution of death benefits to a beneficiary who is not treated as the spouse of the decedent for federal tax purposes and who is the decedent’s designated beneficiary for the purposes of the minimum required distribution requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9). To the extent provided by rules of the Public Employees Retirement Board, a trust maintained for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries must be treated by the board in the same manner as a trust that is designated as a beneficiary for the purposes of the minimum required distribution requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9).

      (3) As used in this section, “eligible rollover distribution” has the meaning given that term in 26 U.S.C. 402(c)(4), as in effect on January 1, 2008. [2007 c.628 §4]

      (2) The Public Employees Retirement Board shall conduct a continuing study and investigation of all matters connected with the providing of health care insurance protection to eligible persons. The board shall design benefits, devise specifications, invite proposals, analyze carrier responses to advertisements for proposals and do acts necessary to award contracts to provide health care insurance, including insurance that provides coverage supplemental to federal Medicare coverage, with emphasis on features based on health care cost containment principles, for eligible persons.

The board periodically shall review a current contract or contracts and make suitable study and investigation for the purpose of determining whether a different contract or contracts can and should, in the best interest of eligible persons, be entered into. If it would be advantageous to eligible persons to do so, the board shall enter into a different contract or contracts. Contracts shall be signed by the chairperson on behalf of the board.

      (9) Until all liabilities for health benefits under the system are satisfied, contributions and earnings in the Standard Retiree Health Insurance Account, the Retiree Health Insurance Premium Account under ORS 238.415 and the Retirement Health Insurance Account under ORS 238.420 may not be diverted or otherwise put to any use other than providing health benefits and payment of reasonable costs incurred in administering this section and ORS 238.415 and 238.420. Upon satisfaction of all liabilities for providing health benefits under this section, any amount remaining in the Standard Retiree Health Insurance Account shall be returned to the participating public employers who have made contributions to the account.

      238.435 Provisions applicable to persons establishing membership on or after January 1, 1996. (1) Notwithstanding the definition of “salary” or “other advantages” provided by ORS 238.005, for the purpose of calculating the retirement allowance of a person who establishes membership in the system on or after January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall not include any lump sum payment for accrued vacation pay made to the member during the last 36 calendar months of membership before the effective date of retirement of the member, or during any period of time taken into account for purposes of determining the three years in which the member was paid the highest salary for the purposes of determining the member’s final average salary.

      (2) Notwithstanding the definition of “final average salary” provided by ORS 238.005, for the purpose of calculating the retirement allowance of a person who establishes membership in the system on or after January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, and who is not employed by a local government as defined in ORS 174.116, the term “final average salary” means whichever of the following is greater:

      (a) The average salary per calendar year paid to a public employee who is an active member of the system in three of the calendar years of membership before the effective date of retirement of the employee, in which three years the employee was paid the highest salary. The three calendar years in which the employee was paid the largest total salary may include calendar years in which the employee was employed for less than a full calendar year. If the number of calendar years of active membership before the effective date of retirement of the employee is three or less, the final average salary for the employee is the average salary per calendar year paid to the public employee in all of those years, without regard to whether the employee was employed for full calendar years.

      (b) One-third of the total salary paid to a public employee who is an active member of the system in the last 36 calendar months of membership before the effective date of retirement of the employee.

      (3) For the purposes of calculating the final average salary of a member under subsection (2) of this section, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall:

      (c) Exclude any salary for any pay period before the first full pay period that is included in the last 36 calendar months of membership under subsection (2)(b) of this section.

      (4) Notwithstanding the definition of “final average salary” provided by ORS 238.005, for the purpose of calculating the retirement allowance of a person who establishes membership in the system on or after January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, and who is employed by a local government as defined in ORS 174.116, the term “final average salary” means whichever of the following is greater:

      (a) The average salary per calendar year earned by a public employee who is an active member of the system in three of the calendar years of membership before the effective date of retirement of the employee, in which three years the employee earned the highest salary. The three calendar years in which the employee earned the largest total salary may include calendar years in which the employee was employed for less than a full calendar year. If the number of calendar years of active membership before the effective date of retirement of the employee is three or less, the final average salary for the employee is the average salary per calendar year earned by the public employee in all of those years, without regard to whether the employee was employed for full calendar years.

      (b) One-third of the total salary earned by a public employee who is an active member of the system in the last 36 calendar months of membership before the effective date of retirement of the employee.

      (5) The normal retirement age is 60 years of age for a member who establishes membership in the system on or after January 1, 1996, as described in ORS 238.430, and who retires as other than a police officer or firefighter.

(Optional Purchase of Benefit Units by Police and Firefighters)

 

      238.440 Optional purchase of benefit units by police and firefighters. (1) A police officer or firefighter who is a member of the system may elect to make additional contributions to the fund to purchase increased benefits between the date of retirement and age 65. The rate of additional contribution shall be determined by the actuary, dependent upon the age of the police officer or firefighter at the date of election, so as to provide monthly payments on the basis of $10 per unit of benefits purchased. No police officer or firefighter may elect to purchase more than eight units. For each $10 unit purchased by the police officer or firefighter, the employer shall purchase an equal $10 unit. A police officer or firefighter who is retained until age 65 shall receive a lump sum refund of the additional contributions made toward units purchased, plus interest thereon, but shall receive no benefits from the additional contributions by the employer for such units. If a police officer or firefighter retires after age 60 but prior to age 65, the units purchased by additional contributions shall provide increased monthly benefits based on life expectancy, but the matching units purchased by the employer shall not, regardless of age, exceed $10 per month per unit purchased by the police officer or firefighter. If a police officer or firefighter is absent from the employment of a participating employer for any reason and because of such absence is unable to make monthly additional contributions, the benefits provided under this section shall be actuarially reduced upon the retirement of the police officer or firefighter. The Public Employees Retirement Board shall establish an account for each member who elects to make additional contributions under this section and shall credit all contributions made by that member and interest on those contributions to the account.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a police officer or firefighter who retires prior to age 60 may apply for and receive an actuarially reduced unit income commencing at any date between the date of early retirement and age 60, with monthly benefits payable for at least 60 months or any other monthly formula in excess of 60 months but always terminating by age 65. Such a police officer or firefighter may elect to pay in a lump sum within the 60 days immediately preceding early retirement the contribution that the police officer or firefighter would have made to the account had the police officer or firefighter worked to age 60.

      (3) Any police officer or firefighter who elects to make additional contributions to purchase increased benefits may elect at any time before termination to cancel such election. Having once canceled such election, no police officer or firefighter shall be again permitted to make additional contributions.

      (4) A member may withdraw the amounts credited to the account established for the member under this section if:

      (a) The member is separated from all service with participating public employers; and

      (b) The member is separated from all service with employers who are treated as part of a participating public employer’s controlled group under the federal laws and rules governing the status of the system and the fund as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust.

      (5) A member who withdraws the amounts credited to the account established for the member pursuant to subsection (4) of this section may not thereafter make additional contributions under this section.

      (6) A police officer or firefighter who has elected to make additional contributions under this section and who transfers to employment in which not entitled to make such additional contributions may retain the account established under subsection (1) of this section for five years immediately following such transfer by not requesting a withdrawal. If, at the end of the five-year period, the police officer or firefighter has not reached age 50, or has not returned to employment in which entitled to make additional contributions under this section, the election shall be canceled and the amount of the account established under subsection (1) of this section shall be refunded to the police officer or firefighter.

      (7) Any election to make additional contributions under this section and any cancellation of such election shall be submitted to the employer and to the board in writing. [Formerly 237.071 (4); 1999 c.317 §5a; 2007 c.52 §6]

 

(Prior Service Credit)

 

      238.442 Prior service credit. (1) Subject to the rules of the Public Employees Retirement Board, upon commencing participation in the system a public employer that is not a school district may elect to provide prior service credit for employees of the employer who are employees of the employer on the date on which the employer commences participation. Prior service credit may be provided only for employees who are members of the system. Prior service credit under this section may be provided for continuous service by the employee to the public employer before the public employer commenced participation in the system and for any accumulated seasonal employment by an employee before the public employer commenced participation in the system. The public employer and the board shall enter into an agreement that will specify the number of years of prior service credit that employees of the employer will receive. Prior service credit under this section shall be equal to $4 for each year of prior service or major fraction of a year.

      (2) If a public employer elects to provide prior service credit under this section, the board shall issue a certificate to each employee entitled to receive prior service credit. The certificate shall show the amount of prior service credit that the employee is entitled to receive under the agreement between the board and the public employer. The certificate shall be final unless the board, upon the motion of the member or upon the board’s own motion, modifies the certificate for cause.

      (3) Prior service credit under this section shall be funded by employer contributions in the manner provided by ORS 238.225.

      (4) A public employer who agrees to provide prior service credit under this section may elect to treat any year, or part of a year, for which prior service credit is granted as a year in which the employee is an active member for the purpose of becoming vested. An election under this subsection must be made at the time the public employer enters into the agreement providing for prior service credit. [2001 c.945 §75; 2001 c.945 §75a; 2003 c.67 §32]

      238.450 Computation of retirement allowance or benefit; notice of dispute. (1) Upon receiving an application for a retirement allowance or benefit from a member of the Public Employees Retirement System and obtaining information necessary for computation of the retirement allowance or benefit to which the member is entitled upon retirement, the system shall provide to the member a written computation of the retirement allowance or benefit to which the member is entitled upon retirement and summary of the information used in making that computation.

      (2) A member of the system may dispute the accuracy of the information used by the system in making the computation only by filing a written notice of dispute with the system not later than whichever of the following days occurs last:

      (a) The 240th day after the date on which the computation and information summary is provided to the member pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) The 240th day after the date on which the retirement allowance or benefit to which the member is entitled first becomes payable.

      (3) The filing of a notice of dispute under subsection (2) of this section extends the time allowed for election of an optional form of retirement allowance or benefit until the 30th day after the conclusion of the proceeding and any judicial review thereof if the proceeding or review results in a change in the computation of the retirement allowance or benefit.

      (4) Upon receiving a notice of dispute under subsection (2) of this section, the system shall determine the accuracy of the disputed information and make a written decision either affirming the accuracy of the information and computation based thereon or changing the computation using corrected information. The system shall provide to the member a copy of the decision and a written explanation of any applicable statutes and rules. The member is entitled to judicial review of the decision as provided in ORS 183.484 and rules of the board consistent with applicable statutes.

      (5) This section does not affect any authority of the system, on its own initiative, to correct an incorrect computation of any retirement allowance or benefit. [Formerly 237.210; 2007 c.53 §1]

 

      238.455 Estimated benefit payments. (1)(a) Whenever a member of the system is retired for service and is entitled to receive a retirement allowance or benefit that is payable monthly, and the Public Employees Retirement Board is unable to calculate the amount of the monthly payment in time to allow mailing of the monthly payment to the member within 62 days of the date the first monthly payment is due, the board shall calculate an estimated amount for the monthly payment based on the information then available to the board and shall mail that payment to the member within 62 days of the date the first monthly payment is due.

      (b) Whenever a member of the system is retired for disability and is entitled to receive a retirement allowance or benefit that is payable monthly, and the board is unable to calculate the amount of the monthly payment in time to allow mailing of the monthly payment to the member within 10 days of either the date the board approves the member’s application or the date that the first monthly payment is due, whichever is later, the board shall calculate an estimated amount for the monthly payment based on the information then available to the board and shall mail that payment to the member within 10 days of the date the board approves the member’s disability benefit, the date the board receives the member’s election of one of the optional forms of disability retirement allowance or the date the first monthly payment is due, whichever is later.

      (2) The board shall continue to mail estimated payments under subsection (1) of this section until such time as the correct amount of the monthly payment is determined.

      (3) The board shall notify the member receiving an estimated payment under subsection (1) of this section that the payment is an estimated payment only. The board shall further notify the member of the provisions of subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) If the board determines that any estimated payment made to the member under subsection (1) of this section resulted in payment to the member of an amount other than the correct amount due the member as a retirement allowance or benefit, the board shall immediately so notify the member. Thereafter, the board may increase or decrease the monthly payment to the member until such time as the total difference between the amount or amounts the member received and the amount or amounts the member should have received is accounted for. Thereafter the member shall receive the monthly payment as finally calculated by the board.

      (5) If the estimated payment made to the member under subsection (1) of this section results in an underpayment to the member of $10 or more a month, the board shall pay interest on the balance of such underpayment at a rate established by rule of the board until such time as the underpayment is paid to the member pursuant to subsection (4) of this section.

      (6) No member shall have any right to any allowance or other benefit other than that provided for in this chapter and ORS chapter 238A based on the board’s estimate under this section or based on any other estimate made by the board for any other purpose under this chapter and ORS chapter 238A. [Formerly 237.159; 2003 c.733 §53; 2005 c.302 §1]

 

      238.458 Unclaimed benefits. (1) A benefit that is owed to a member or beneficiary of a member under the Public Employees Retirement System shall be forfeited at the end of the system’s plan year in which the benefit becomes due if the Public Employees Retirement Board is unable to locate the member or beneficiary. If the member, beneficiary or any other person thereafter establishes a right to the forfeited benefit, the board shall reinstate the benefit. If the benefit is a periodic payment, the board shall make a retroactive payment to the member, beneficiary or other person in a lump sum for all amounts that would have been paid before reinstatement of the benefit. No interest shall be paid on the benefit for the period commencing when the benefit became due and the date of the retroactive payment.

      (2) Death benefits and other amounts payable by reason of the death of a member do not escheat to the state when the member dies without heirs, devisees or beneficiaries designated under ORS 238.390. If a beneficiary has not been designated under ORS 238.390, and a personal representative or a person filing a small estate affidavit under ORS 114.505 to 114.560 fails to make claim for the benefits within one year after the member dies, the benefits shall be forfeited to the Public Employees Retirement Fund in the manner provided by subsection (1) of this section and are subject to reinstatement only upon subsequent appointment of a personal representative or the filing of a small estate affidavit in the manner provided by ORS 114.505 to 114.560. If benefits are paid to a personal representative or a person filing a small estate affidavit under ORS 114.505 to 114.560, the personal representative or person filing the affidavit shall return to the board the amount that would otherwise escheat to the state after payment of administrative expenses and claims against the estate. Any amounts returned to the board under this subsection shall be forfeited to the fund. [1999 c.317 §20; 2003 c.625 §2; 2019 c.165 §25]

 

      238.460 Waiver of retirement allowance. (1) If receipt in full by a person of a retirement allowance or other benefit under this chapter or ORS chapter 238A would prevent such person from receiving in full any other governmental pension to which the person is entitled, such person may waive for a calendar year sufficient monthly payments, or portions thereof, of retirement allowance or other benefit under this chapter or ORS chapter 238A to permit the person to receive in full the other governmental pension. The waiver shall be made in writing and filed with the Public Employees Retirement Board not less than 15 days before the first day of the month to which the waiver applies.

      (2) If for any month the waiver does not apply to the full retirement allowance due under this chapter, the waiver applies first to all or the necessary portion of prior service pension, then to all or to the necessary portion of current service pension, and then to the necessary portion of annuity.

      (3) The waiver may be revoked at any time, but no retirement allowance or other benefit waived for the period of time in which the waiver is in effect shall be paid. The revocation shall be made in writing and filed with the board. If a person dies during the period of time in which the waiver is in effect, the waiver is considered revoked on the date of such death. [Formerly 237.157; 2003 c.733 §54; 2005 c.22 §177]

 

      238.462 Spousal consent required for certain optional forms of retirement allowance. (1) A member of the Public Employees Retirement System who is married on the effective date of the member’s retirement shall receive a service retirement allowance in the form provided for in Option 3 under ORS 238.305 (1) or a disability retirement allowance in the form provided for in Option 3 under ORS 238.325 (1) unless the member provides proof of spousal consent to receiving an allowance in the form provided by ORS 238.300 or 238.320, or in one of the optional forms provided for in ORS 238.305 and 238.325 other than Option 3.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a member of the system who is married on the effective date of the member’s retirement may not change the form in which a retirement allowance is paid after an election has been made as to the form of the retirement allowance unless the member provides proof of spousal consent.

      (3) A member of the system who is married on the effective date of the member’s retirement is not required to provide spousal consent to a change in the form in which a retirement allowance is paid if the spouse of the member dies after the effective date of the member’s retirement or disability and the change in the form of the allowance is made within the time periods provided by ORS 238.305 and 238.325. A member seeking to change the form of a retirement allowance without spousal consent under the provisions of this subsection must provide a notarized statement to the Public Employees Retirement Board that certifies to the board that the spouse of the member is deceased.

      (4) Any member of the system who is not married on the effective date of the member’s retirement must provide a notarized statement to the Public Employees Retirement Board that certifies to the board that the member is not married. No retirement allowance may be paid to a member of the system who is not married until the statement required by this subsection is provided to the board.

      (5) A member of the system who is married on the effective date of the member’s retirement must provide proof of spousal consent for the purposes of this section by submitting a statement to the board that:

      (a) Contains the notarized signature of the member’s spouse;

      (b) Indicates the form in which the retirement allowance is to be paid; and

      (c) Contains a statement that the member’s spouse consents to the payment of the retirement allowance in the specified form.

      (6) If a member of the system who is married on the effective date of the member’s retirement fails to provide proof of spousal consent as required by this section, the board shall calculate and pay to the member a retirement allowance in the form provided for in Option 3 under ORS 238.305 (1) if the retirement is for service, or a retirement allowance in the form provided for in Option 3 under ORS 238.325 (1) if the retirement is for disability. The allowance will be calculated based on the ages of the member and the spouse, and the spouse will be designated as the beneficiary for any survivor benefits that may thereafter become payable.

      (7) Proof of spousal consent under this section is not required for, and cannot alter, the designation of any form of a retirement allowance that is required under the terms of any judgment of annulment or dissolution of marriage or of separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any judgment of annulment or dissolution of marriage or of separation, that has been received by the board in compliance with the requirements prescribed by ORS 238.465. [1997 c.476 §2; 1999 c.407 §5; 2003 c.576 §404; 2005 c.22 §178]

 

      238.465 Benefits payable to others under certain judgments; rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 238.445 or any other provision of law, payments under this chapter or ORS chapter 238A of any pension, annuity, retirement allowance, disability benefit, death benefit, refund benefit or other benefit that would otherwise be made to a person entitled thereto under this chapter or ORS chapter 238A shall be paid, in whole or in part, by the Public Employees Retirement Board to an alternate payee if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any judgment of annulment or dissolution of marriage or of separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any judgment of annulment or dissolution of marriage or of separation. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the total actuarial value of benefits payable to a member and to an alternate payee under this section may not be greater than the value of the benefits the member would otherwise be eligible to receive if the annulment or dissolution of marriage or separation had not occurred. Any payment under this subsection to an alternate payee bars recovery by any other person.

      (2) A judgment, order or settlement providing for payment to an alternate payee under subsection (1) of this section may also provide:

      (a) That payments to the alternate payee may commence, at the election of the alternate payee, at any time after the earlier of:

      (A) The earliest date the member would be eligible to receive retirement benefits if the member separates from service; or

      (B) The date the member actually separates from service due to death, disability, retirement or termination of employment.

      (b) That the alternate payee may elect to receive payment in any form of pension, annuity, retirement allowance, disability benefit, death benefit, refund benefit or other benefit, except a benefit in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, that would be available to the member under this chapter or ORS chapter 238A, or that would be available to the member if the member retired or separated from service at the time of election by the alternate payee, without regard to the form of benefit elected by the member.

      (c) That the alternate payee’s life is the measuring life for the purpose of measuring payments to the alternate payee under the form of benefit selected by the alternate payee and for the purpose of determining necessary employer reserves.

      (d) Except as provided in ORS 238.305 (10) and 238.325 (7), that any person designated by the member as a beneficiary under ORS 238.300, 238.305, 238.325, 238A.190 or 238A.400 be changed, even though the member has retired and has begun receiving a retirement allowance or pension. If a change of beneficiary is ordered under this paragraph, the board shall adjust the anticipated benefits that would be payable to the member and the beneficiary to ensure that the cost to the system of providing benefits to the member and the new beneficiary does not exceed the cost that the system would have incurred to provide benefits to the member and the original beneficiary. The judgment, order or settlement may not provide for any change to the option selected by the retired member under ORS 238.300, 238.305, 238.320, 238.325, 238A.190 or 238A.400 as to the form of the retirement benefit.

      (e) That death benefits under ORS 238A.230 to which the alternate payee has been entitled as the spouse of a member shall be available to the alternate payee after the effective date of the judgment of annulment or dissolution of marriage or of separation.

      (3) The board shall adopt rules that provide for:

      (a) The creation of a separate account in the name of the alternate payee reflecting the judgment’s, order’s or agreement’s distribution of the member’s benefits under this chapter or ORS chapter 238A;

      (b) The establishing of criteria to determine whether domestic relations judgments, orders and agreements comply with this section; and

      (c) The definitions and procedures for the administration of this section.

      (4) An alternate payee may designate a beneficiary for the purposes of death benefits payable under ORS 238.390 and 238.395. Subject to ORS 238A.410 (2), an alternate payee may designate a beneficiary for the purposes of death benefits payable under ORS 238A.410. If the alternate payee fails to designate a beneficiary for the purposes of death benefits payable under ORS 238.390 and 238.395, the benefits shall be paid as provided by ORS 238.390 (2). If the alternate payee fails to designate a beneficiary for the purposes of death benefits payable under ORS 238A.410, the benefits shall be paid as provided by ORS 238A.410 (3). If a judgment, order or agreement awards an interest to an alternate payee, and if the alternate payee predeceases the member before the alternate payee has commenced receiving benefits, the alternate payee shall be considered a member of the system who died before retiring for the purposes of the death benefits provided in ORS 238.390, 238.395, 238A.230 and 238A.410, but for purposes of the death benefits provided in ORS 238.395, the alternate payee shall be considered a member of the system who died before retiring only if the member would have been eligible for death benefits under ORS 238.395 had the member died at the same time as the alternate payee. Payment of the death benefits to the beneficiaries, estate or other persons entitled to receive the benefits under ORS 238.390, 238.395, 238A.230 and 238A.410, shall constitute payment in full of the alternate payee’s interest under the judgment, order or agreement.

      (5) Any increase in the retirement allowance provided to the member shall increase the amounts paid to the alternate payee in the same proportion, except that:

      (a) An alternate payee is not entitled to receive cost-of-living adjustments under ORS 238.360 or any other retirement allowance increase until benefits are first paid from the system on behalf of the member; and

      (b) Cost-of-living adjustments under ORS 238.360 or 238A.210 to the retirement allowance paid to an alternate payee shall be calculated on the basis of the amount of the alternate payee’s yearly allowance or yearly pension or benefit, as those terms are defined in ORS 238.360 and 238A.210.

      (6) An alternate payee under this section is not eligible to receive the benefits provided under ORS 238.410, 238.415, 238.420 and 238.440 by reason of the provisions of this section.

      (7) An alternate payee who elects to begin receiving payments under subsection (1) of this section before the member’s effective date of retirement is not eligible to receive any additional payment by reason of credit in the system acquired by the member after the alternate payee begins to receive payments.

      (8) Subsection (1) of this section applies only to payments made by the board after the date of receipt by the board of written notice of the judgment, order or agreement and such additional information and documentation as the board may prescribe.

      (9) Whenever the board is required to make payment to an alternate payee under the provisions of this section, the board shall charge and collect out of the benefits payable to the member and the alternate payee actual and reasonable administrative expenses and related costs incurred by the board in obtaining data and making calculations that are necessary by reason of the provisions of this section. The board may not charge more than $300 for total administrative expenses and related costs incurred in obtaining data or making calculations that are necessary by reason of the provisions of this section. The board shall allocate expenses and costs charged under the provisions of this subsection between the member and the alternate payee based on the fraction of the benefit received by the member or alternate payee.

      (10) Unless otherwise provided by the judgment, order or agreement, a member has no interest in the benefit payable to an alternate payee under this section. Upon the death of an alternate payee, the board shall make such payment to the beneficiary designated by the alternate payee as may be required under the form of benefit elected by the alternate payee. If a death benefit is payable under ORS 238.390 or 238.395 by reason of the death of an alternate payee, payment of the death benefit shall be made to the beneficiary designated by the alternate payee under ORS 238.390 (1), or as otherwise provided by ORS 238.390 and 238.395.

      (11) As used in this section, “court” means any court of appropriate jurisdiction of this or any other state or of the District of Columbia. [Formerly 237.205; 2001 c.945 §§82,89; 2003 c.576 §405; 2003 c.733 §55; 2005 c.808 §32; 2013 s.s. c.2 §6; 2015 c.506 §2]

 

      238.470 Interest on payments from fund. Interest is not payable on any payment from the Public Employees Retirement Fund unless specifically provided for in this chapter. [Formerly 237.202]

 

      238.475 Effect of transfer of employee to another participating employer. No transfer after July 1, 1946, by a member of the system from the service of one employer participating in the system to the service of another such employer shall impair any rights or deprive the member of any credits accruing to the member as a result of membership in the system after July 1, 1946, and prior to the transfer. [Formerly 237.101]

 

      238.480 Effect of change to calendar year on contributions and credit of members. All contributions made and all service credit earned under the Public Employes’ Retirement Act of 1953 prior to January 1, 1956, on the basis of a fiscal year shall not be affected by the change from fiscal year basis to calendar year basis on January 1, 1956, under the 1955 amendments of the Public Employes’ Retirement Act of 1953, and such contributions and credit are recognized as if no such change had been made. [Formerly 237.107]

 

PUBLIC EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EQUALIZATION FUND

 

      238.485 Fund established. (1) Pursuant to section 415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, there is established a Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund, separate and distinct from the General Fund and from the Public Employees Retirement Fund. The Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund is declared to be a trust fund. Interest earned on the fund, if any, shall inure to the benefit of the fund. The Public Employees Retirement Board shall administer the fund and shall act as trustee for the fund.

      (2) The assets of the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund that are attributable to the contributions of a participating public employer pursuant to ORS 238.488 remain available to the general creditors of the employer in the event of the employer’s insolvency until those assets are distributed to members of the Public Employees Retirement System, distributed to the beneficiaries of those members or used to pay the administrative expenses of the fund. Before distribution, members of the Public Employees Retirement System and beneficiaries of those members have no right to or interest in any asset of the fund.

      (3) All moneys paid into the fund shall be deposited with the State Treasurer, who is custodian of the fund. The board may draw warrants and issue checks on the fund in the same manner that it draws warrants and issues checks on the Public Employees Retirement Fund.

      (4) Any warrant, check or order issued by the board for payment from the fund that is canceled, declared void, abandoned or otherwise made unpayable pursuant to law because it is outstanding and unpaid for a period of more than two years, may be reissued by the board without bond if the payee is located after such warrant, check or order is canceled, declared void, abandoned or otherwise made unpayable pursuant to law. [1997 c.201 §2; 2005 c.808 §8]

 

      238.488 Payment of benefits; employer contributions. (1) A member of the Public Employees Retirement System, or the beneficiary of that member, who by reason of the benefit limitations imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 415 receives a retirement allowance under the system that is less than the allowance the member or beneficiary would otherwise have received under ORS chapter 238, excluding any payments the member or beneficiary may receive under this section and ORS 238.485 and 238.490, shall receive from the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund a monthly amount equal to the difference. Any overpayment or improperly made payment from the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund may be recovered from the member or beneficiary, or from payments to the member or beneficiary from the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund, in the same manner as provided in ORS 238.715 for recovery of overpayments and improperly made payments from the Public Employees Retirement Fund. Notwithstanding ORS 238.445, an overpayment or improperly made payment from the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund may be recovered on behalf of the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund from payments to the member or beneficiary from the Public Employees Retirement Fund in the same manner as provided in ORS 238.715 for recovery of overpayments and improperly made payments from the Public Employees Retirement Fund if:

      (a) No payments are being made to the member or beneficiary from the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund at the time recovery of an overpayment or improperly made payment is sought; or

      (b) The Public Employees Retirement Board in its discretion determines that the payments being made from the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund are inadequate to ensure full recovery of the overpayment or improperly made payment.

      (2) A public employer that participates or has participated in the Public Employees Retirement System and that employs or has employed a member of the system who receives a benefit under subsection (1) of this section, or whose beneficiary receives a benefit under subsection (1) of this section, must contribute to the Public Employees Retirement Board a sum equal to all amounts paid to the member or beneficiary that is attributable to the member’s employment by the public employer, plus any amount assessed by the board to pay administrative costs under ORS 238.490 (3). If the member has retirement credit attributable to employment with more than one public employer, the board shall allocate the costs of the benefit under this section among the public employers involved, based on the member’s length of service with each employer.

      (3) A public employer that makes a contribution to the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund under subsection (2) of this section shall receive a credit equal to the amount of the contribution against any obligation of the public employer to make contributions to the Public Employees Retirement Fund under ORS 238.225. The credit shall be equal to the amount paid by the employer to the board under subsection (2) of this section less any sums paid to the board by the public employer for administrative costs under ORS 238.490 (3). The board shall apply the credit to reduce the public employer’s payment obligation under ORS 238.225 for the month in which the payment is made under this section. The credit does not reduce any obligation below zero and any credit not used may be carried over as a credit against future obligations under ORS 238.225.

      (4) All amounts collected from public employers under this section shall be deposited in the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund established by ORS 238.485.

      (5) The Public Employees Retirement Board shall pay the benefits specified in subsection (1) of this section only to the extent that the benefits have been funded by contributions made by the member’s employer under subsection (2) of this section before the date on which the benefits are to be paid. The Public Employees Retirement Board may enforce the provisions of subsection (2) of this section in the manner provided in ORS 238.705 and 238.710 for the enforcement of employer contributions to the Public Employees Retirement Fund.

      (6) The board shall notify all participating employers of the records and information needed for the implementation and administration of this section. Each participating employer shall maintain records for all employees who are members of the system, and all former employees who have been members of the system, and shall supply the board with all information required by the board to allow the board to identify members and beneficiaries who are entitled to payment under subsection (1) of this section. [1997 c.201 §3]

 

      238.490 Administrative expenses. (1) The administrative expenses incurred by the Public Employees Retirement Board in administering the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund shall be paid from interest earned by the fund. If the interest is insufficient, the excess expense shall be paid from the contributions by participating employers under ORS 238.488.

      (2) In order to facilitate financing the establishment and administration of the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund, the board may designate fiscal periods and may provide that extraordinary expenses incurred during a period, such as expenses for equipment and actuarial studies, may, for purposes of equitably distributing part of the burden of expenses, be apportioned to subsequent fiscal periods in any manner that seems equitable to the board.

      (3) For each fiscal period designated by the board, the administrative expenses of the fund for that period shall be deducted from the interest earned by the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund. If such interest be insufficient for such purpose, each employer contributing to the Public Employee Benefit Equalization Fund shall pay a fraction of those administrative expenses determined by dividing the employer’s total contribution to the fund for the period by the sum of all the employers’ contributions to the fund for the period. [1997 c.201 §4]

 

      238.492 Rules for administration of fund. The Public Employees Retirement Board may adopt rules for the administration of ORS 238.485, 238.488 and 238.490. In adopting rules under this section, the board shall consider and take into account all federal law requirements relating to deferred compensation plans, including the requirements imposed for the deferral of income tax on deferred compensation benefits until those benefits are paid or made available to the recipient. [1997 c.201 §5]

 

      Note: 238.492 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 238 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (i) Physical or mental incapacitation of a judge that prevents the judge from discharging the duties of judicial office;

      (ii) Failure of the appointing authority to assign a judge to the requisite amount of pro tem service, whether because of insufficient need for pro tem judges, a determination by the appointing authority that the skills of a judge do not match the needs of the courts, clerical mistake, or otherwise; or

      (iii) Death of a judge.

      (B) “Good cause” does not include:

      (i) A judge’s refusal, without good cause, to accept pro tem assignments sufficient to meet the required amount; or

      (ii) A judge’s affirmative voluntary act that makes the judge unqualified to serve as a judge of this state including, but not limited to, failure to maintain active membership in the Oregon State Bar, acceptance of a position in another branch of state government, or acceptance of a position in the Government of the United States or of another state or nation.

      (e) The Chief Justice may make rules for the implementation of this subsection.

      (2) As used in subsection (1) of this section, “final average salary” means whichever of the following is greater:

      (b) One-third of the total salary paid to a judge member in the last 36 calendar months of service as a judge before the judge member retires.

      (3) As used in subsection (1) of this section, “number of years of service” means the number of full years plus any remaining fraction of a year. In determining a remaining fraction, a full month shall be considered as one-twelfth of a year and a major fraction of a month shall be considered as a full month.

      (4) For a judge who elects to become a judge member as provided in ORS 237.215 (3) (1989 Edition), the service retirement allowance under subsection (1) of this section on retirement at the age of 70 years and either 12 years of service or two full six-year terms as a judge shall be at least the equivalent of the retirement pay the judge would have received had the judge retired under ORS 1.314 to 1.390 (1989 Edition).

      (5) A judge member who has made contributions to the Public Employees Retirement Fund during each of five calendar years and who attains the age of 60 years shall be retired upon written application by the judge member to the board on a reduced service retirement allowance that shall be the actuarial equivalent of the service retirement allowance provided for in subsection (1)(a) of this section.

      (6) For the purposes of this section, a judge who elects to become a judge member as provided in ORS 237.215 (3) (1989 Edition) shall be considered to have made contributions to the Public Employees Retirement Fund during one calendar year for each calendar year during which the judge made contributions to the Judges’ Retirement Fund.

      (B) On September 27, 1987, the judge had more than 28 years of service that were creditable under the Judges’ Retirement Fund established pursuant to ORS 1.314 to 1.390 (1989 Edition) and the judge became a member of the system under the provisions of ORS 237.215 (3)(b) (1989 Edition).

      (b) The maximum percentage used in calculating the annual amount of the life pension (nonrefund) of a judge member who meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not exceed 45 percent plus 1.67 percent multiplied by the number of years of service as a judge that exceed 16 years and that were served on or before September 27, 1987.

      (c) In computing the annual amount of the life pension of a judge who meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the board shall use the percentage specified by paragraph (b) of this subsection and the final average salary of the judge computed on the date of retirement, not the final average salary of the judge computed as of September 27, 1987. In making the computation under this subsection, the board shall use the definition of “final average salary” provided by ORS 238.535 as amended by section 2, chapter 625, Oregon Laws 1987. [Formerly 237.220; 1997 c.801 §19; 1999 c.317 §21; 2005 c.22 §179]

      238.540 [Renumbered 237.365 in 1995]

 

      238.545 Withdrawal of member account; retirement allowance of inactive judge member. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a judge member may withdraw from the Public Employees Retirement Fund the amount credited to the member account of the judge member if:

      (a) The judge member is separated from all service with participating public employers;

      (b) The judge member is separated from all service with employers who are treated as part of a participating public employer’s controlled group under the federal laws and rules governing the status of the Public Employees Retirement System and the Public Employees Retirement Fund as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust;

      (c) The judge member has not attained 60 years of age; and

      (d) The separation from service is not by reason of death or disability.

      (2) If a judge member wishes to withdraw the member account balance under this section, the judge member must transmit to the Public Employees Retirement Board a withdrawal request. The board shall deny the withdrawal, or shall take all reasonable steps to recover withdrawn amounts, if:

      (a) The board determines that the separation is not a bona fide separation; or

      (b) The judge member fails to remain absent from the service of all employers described in subsection (1) of this section for at least one calendar month following the month in which the judge member separates from service.

      (3) If a judge member who is eligible to withdraw as provided in subsection (1) of this section does not elect to withdraw, the member account of the judge member shall remain to the credit of the judge member, and the judge member is entitled to such death benefits and disability retirement allowance as ORS 238.500 to 238.585 provide. Before attaining 60 years of age, a judge member who is eligible to withdraw as provided in subsection (1) of this section but who does not withdraw must elect in writing to retire under either ORS 238.535 (1)(a) or (b). The election is irrevocable after the judge member attains 60 years of age. Any inactive judge member who fails to make the election provided for in this subsection prior to attaining 60 years of age shall be retired under the provisions of ORS 238.535 (1)(a). The service retirement allowance of an inactive judge member who retires under ORS 238.535 (1)(a) shall be a reduced service retirement allowance that is the actuarial equivalent of the service retirement allowance provided for in ORS 238.535 (1)(a). An inactive judge member who elects to retire under ORS 238.535 (1)(b) must meet all other requirements imposed by ORS 238.535 for retirement under ORS 238.535 (1)(b).

      (4) If approved by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, an inactive judge member who elects to retire under ORS 238.535 (1)(b) pursuant to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section may commence to serve the pro tem service obligation imposed by ORS 238.535 before the judge member’s date of retirement. If the Chief Justice determines, at any time after the judge member commences performing the pro tem service obligation, that the judge member has failed to perform the pro tem services in the manner required by ORS 238.535 (1)(c), and the judge member has not been relieved of the obligation to perform those services in the manner provided by ORS 238.535 (1)(c), the Chief Justice shall notify the Public Employees Retirement Board. If the judge member has not yet retired, the board shall calculate the service retirement allowance of the noncomplying judge member at the time of retirement in the manner provided by ORS 238.535 (1)(a). If the judge member has retired, the board shall recalculate the service retirement allowance of the noncomplying judge member in the manner provided by ORS 238.535 (1)(a), and the noncomplying judge member shall receive only that recalculated amount thereafter. An inactive judge member may be relieved of the pro tem service obligation imposed by ORS 238.535 (1)(c) in the same manner as provided in ORS 238.535 for retired judge members.

      (5) Withdrawal of the member account balance under this section cancels all membership rights in the system, including the right to claim credit for any employment before withdrawal.

      (6) ORS 238.105 and 238.115 (1) apply to a former judge member who has withdrawn the member account balance under this section. [Formerly 237.223; 1997 c.801 §20; 1999 c.317 §6; 2001 c.566 §1; 2001 c.945 §60]

      (3) The effective date of the disability of a judge member shall not be determined by the board as prior to the last day for which the judge member performed service as a judge.

      (2)(a) If a judge member who has six or more years of service as a judge dies before retiring, and the judge member is not an inactive judge member who is performing a pro tem service obligation under the provisions of ORS 238.545 (4), the surviving spouse of the judge member shall receive a life pension, payable monthly, equal to two-thirds of the service retirement allowance the judge member would have received under ORS 238.535 (1)(a) had the judge member retired on the date of death.

      (b) If a judge member who has six or more years of service as a judge dies before retiring, and the judge member is an inactive member who is performing a pro tem service obligation under the provisions of ORS 238.545 (4), the surviving spouse of the judge member shall receive a life pension, payable monthly, equal to two-thirds of the service retirement allowance the judge member would have received under ORS 238.535 (1)(b) had the judge member retired on the date of death.

      (c) If a surviving spouse receiving a pension under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection dies and the total amount received as pension by the surviving spouse is less than the amount credited to the member account of the judge member in the fund on the date of death of the judge member, the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall receive a lump sum amount equal to the difference between the total amount received by the surviving spouse and the amount so credited to the member account of the judge member.

      (d) If a judge member who has six or more years of service as a judge dies before retiring and has no surviving spouse, the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall receive a lump sum amount equal to the amount credited to the member account of the judge member in the fund on the date of death of the judge member.

      (e) If the surviving spouse of a judge member who dies before retiring is not entitled to a pension under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, the surviving spouse shall receive a lump sum amount equal to the amount credited to the member account of the judge member in the fund on the date of death of the judge member.

      (3)(a) If a judge member dies after retiring, the surviving spouse of the judge member shall receive a life pension, payable monthly, equal to two-thirds of the retirement allowance the judge member is receiving or is entitled to receive on the date of death.

      (b) If a surviving spouse receiving a pension under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection dies and the total amount received as retirement allowance by the retired judge member and as pension by the surviving spouse is less than the amount credited to the member account of the judge member on the date of retirement of the judge member, the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall receive a lump sum amount equal to the difference between the total amount received as retirement allowance and pension and the amount so credited to the member account of the judge member.

      (c) If a judge member dies after retiring and has no surviving spouse, and the total amount received as retirement allowance by the retired judge member is less than the amount credited to the member account of the judge member on the date of retirement of the judge member, the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall receive a lump sum amount equal to the difference between the total amount received as retirement allowance and the amount so credited to the member account of the judge member.

      (4) At any time after becoming a judge member, but not later than the date on which the first payment on account of retirement is due, a judge member may elect to provide an addition to the pension of the surviving spouse of the judge member under subsection (3)(a) of this section by selecting a reduced retirement allowance for the judge member. The additional pension to the surviving spouse shall be the actuarial equivalent of the reduction in the retirement allowance of the judge member and, in no event, when added to the pension under subsection (3)(a) of this section, shall it exceed the reduced retirement allowance elected by the judge member.

      (5) Any accrued retirement allowance due a retired judge member that is unpaid at the time of death of the judge member shall be paid to the surviving spouse of the judge member.

If a judge member is married at the time an election is made under this subsection, the spouse of the judge member must give written consent to the election.

ADMINISTRATION

 

(Public Employees Retirement System)

 

      238.600 System established; legislative intent. (1) A system of retirement and of benefits at retirement or death for employees of public employers hereby is established and shall be known as the Public Employees Retirement System. The Public Employees Retirement System consists of this chapter and ORS chapter 238A. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that the system be qualified and maintained under sections 401(a), 414(d) and 414(k) of the Internal Revenue Code as a tax-qualified defined benefit governmental plan.

      (2) If the Public Employees Retirement System is terminated, or if contributions may no longer be made to the system, each member of the system has a nonforfeitable right to the benefits that the member has accrued as of the date of the termination, or as of the date that contributions may no longer be made to the system, to the extent that those benefits are funded. [Formerly 237.005; 1997 c.121 §2; 1999 c.317 §9; 2003 c.733 §55a; 2005 c.808 §1]

 

      238.601 Legislative findings and intent; administration of system. The Legislative Assembly finds that the maintenance of a solid, affordable public employees retirement plan is essential to providing effective, efficient services to the citizens of Oregon by allowing the state and political subdivisions of the state to hire and retain employees who are committed to providing those services. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that the Public Employees Retirement Board, in performing its duties as trustee of the Public Employees Retirement Fund, recognize that the continued stability and viability of the Public Employees Retirement System depends on the ability of public employers and taxpayers to pay the costs of the system. Consistent with this intent, the board shall administer the system to create and maintain long-term stability and viability in the system, and shall act to achieve full funding for the benefits provided by the system, giving equal consideration to the interests of the public employer and the employee to the extent that treatment does not violate the fiduciary duties of the board. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose a fiduciary duty on the board to consider the interests of public employers, and the board shall consider the interests of public employers only with respect to matters unrelated to the board’s fiduciary duties as trustee of the fund. [2001 c.945 §2]

 

      238.605 Actuarial report on system; determination of unfunded actuarial liability. (1) At least once every two years the Public Employees Retirement Board shall cause a competent actuary familiar with public systems of retirement and death benefits to prepare a report evaluating the current and prospective assets and liabilities of the system and indicating its current and prospective financial condition. In preparing the report the actuary shall investigate the mortality, disability, service and other experience of the members of, and employers participating in the system, shall state fully the condition of the system, and shall make such recommendations as the actuary deems advisable to facilitate administering it properly. The board shall publish and distribute a summary of the report to all the public employers participating in the system. The board may authorize the transfer of any portion of the funds collected under the provisions of ORS 238.225 to carry out the recommendations of the actuary.

      (2) For the purpose of evaluating the system under this section and for the purpose of issuing reports on the system, the actuary and the board shall determine the unfunded actuarial liability of the system by calculating the difference between the actuarial value of the current and prospective liabilities of the system and the actuarial value of the assets of the system, including any lump sum payments made under ORS 238.229. When reporting on the unfunded actuarial liability in any official documentation or report, the board shall report on the unfunded actuarial liability as determined under this subsection. [Formerly 237.285; 2017 c.746 §12]

 

      238.606 Independent review of actuarial report on system; reports. (1)(a) At least once every four years, the Secretary of State shall contract with a firm qualified to perform an independent actuarial review of the report on the Public Employees Retirement System prepared under ORS 238.605. The firm shall review the report that was most recently used to calculate employer contribution rates under ORS 238.225.

      (b) The firm conducting the review required by this section shall use all appropriate actuarial standards of practice.

      (c) The Secretary of State shall determine the scope of the review required by this section. The review must include, but is not limited to, an examination of the reasonableness and consistency of the following aspects of the report described in paragraph (a) of this subsection:

      (A) Actuarial methods used;

      (B) Demographic and economic assumptions used;

      (C) Census and asset data used;

      (D) Valuation of the system, including projected future benefit payments, system liabilities, system normal cost and funded status;

      (E) Employer contribution rates calculated;

      (F) Rate collaring policy and calculation;

      (G) Assumed rate of return and discount rate used;

      (H) Comparison of legislative impact to actual impact; and

      (I) Instructions provided by the Public Employees Retirement Board to the actuary.

      (d) A review under this section must include a quantitative and qualitative analysis of any changes to actuarial methods and demographic and economic assumptions that were recommended by the actuary, adopted by the board, and used to prepare the report under ORS 238.605.

      (e) The Public Employees Retirement System, the State Treasurer, and the Oregon Investment Council shall cooperate with the firm conducting the review required by this section in all respects and shall permit the firm full access to all information the firm deems necessary to complete the review.

      (f) An actuary that prepared a report under ORS 238.605 may not conduct a review under this section for a period of six years after the actuary has provided any services for the board.

      (g) The Public Employees Retirement Board shall pay the cost of the review performed under this section.

      (2) A review performed under this section shall be available for public inspection, in accordance with the Secretary of State’s established rules and procedures governing public disclosure of public reports.

      (3) The Secretary of State shall submit the review performed under this section to the Public Employees Retirement Board and the Joint Legislative Audit Committee no later than February 15 of the year after the review is initiated. [2018 c.98 §11]

 

      Note: 238.606 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 238 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      238.607 Actuarial equivalency factor tables. (1) Once every two calendar years, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall adopt actuarial equivalency factor tables for the purpose of computing the payments to be made to members and their beneficiaries, alternate payees and judge members and their spouses and beneficiaries. The tables may be adopted in conjunction with the system evaluation required by ORS 238.605. Tables adopted under this section must use the best actuarial information on mortality available at the time the board adopts the tables, as provided by the actuary engaged by the board. Actuarial equivalency factor tables adopted under this section become effective on January 1 of the calendar year following adoption of the tables by the board. All computations of payments must use the actuarial equivalency factor tables that are in effect on:

      (a) The effective date of retirement for any member, judge member or alternate payee;

      (b) The date that the first payment is due for any death beneficiary; or

      (c) The date that the first payment is due for any recalculation of payments that is not attributable to error, including but not limited to recalculations under ORS 238.465 (2).

      (2) The board may not defer or delay implementation of the actuarial equivalency factor tables adopted under this section. [2003 c.68 §2]

 

      Note: Sections 3 and 4, chapter 68, Oregon Laws 2003, provide:

      Sec. 3. The Public Employees Retirement Board shall first adopt actuarial equivalency factor tables under section 2 of this 2003 Act [238.607] to become effective January 1, 2005. [2003 c.68 §3]

      Sec. 4. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, for the purpose of computing the retirement allowance of members and alternate payees with effective dates of retirement on or after July 1, 2003, and before January 1, 2005, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall use actuarial equivalency factor tables that are based on the mortality assumptions of the actuary’s 2001 experience study as adopted by the board on September 10, 2002.

      (2) The retirement allowance of any member or alternate payee who has an effective date of retirement on or after July 1, 2003, shall be the higher of the following amounts:

      (a) The amount calculated for the retirement allowance selected by the member under ORS 238.300, 238.305, 238.320 or 238.325 determined as of the member’s or alternate payee’s effective date of retirement, using all calculations applicable to the member under ORS 238.300 (2) and using actuarial equivalency factor tables in effect on the effective date of retirement for the purpose of all calculations using actuarial equivalency factor tables; or

      (b) The amount calculated under subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) For each member or alternate payee described in subsection (2) of this section, the board shall establish years of service, an account balance and a final average salary as of June 30, 2003. Years of service for the member as of June 30, 2003, shall include all creditable service of the member determined as of June 30, 2003, including any retirement credit acquired by the member under ORS 238.105 to 238.175 before July 1, 2003. The account balance shall include all employee contributions made by or on behalf of the member as of June 30, 2003, and earnings on those contributions as of June 30, 2003, credited in the manner provided by board rules in effect on May 9, 2003, governing crediting of earnings upon retirement of a member. The board shall then calculate the retirement allowance selected by the member under ORS 238.300, 238.305, 238.320 or 238.325, using all calculations applicable to the member under ORS 238.300 (2), except that:

      (a) The board shall use the actuarial equivalency factor tables in effect on June 30, 2003, for the purpose of all calculations using actuarial equivalency factor tables; and

      (b) The board shall use the years of service, account balance and final average salary established by the board under this subsection for the member as of June 30, 2003.

      (4) The board need not perform the calculations described in subsections (2) and (3) of this section for a member if the board actuarially determines that one of the calculations described in subsection (2) or (3) of this section necessarily provides the highest amount.

      (5) Any monthly payments to be made to a death beneficiary under ORS 238.390, 238.395 or 238.405 for a member who dies on or after May 9, 2003, shall be calculated using the actuarial equivalency factor tables that are in effect on the date that the first payment is due to the death beneficiary.

      (6) This section and section 2, chapter 68, Oregon Laws 2003 [238.607], do not apply to the calculation of the retirement allowance and surviving spouse pension of a person who is a judge member on June 30, 2003, and who makes an election under ORS 238.565 (4). The board shall use the actuarial equivalency factor tables in effect on June 30, 2003, for the purpose of calculating the retirement allowance and surviving spouse pension of a person who is a judge member on June 30, 2003, and who makes an election under ORS 238.565 (4), whether that election is made before, on or after June 30, 2003. [2003 c.67 §40; 2003 c.68 §4; 2003 c.625 §16]

 

      238.608 Separate actuarial equivalency factor tables for certain police officers and firefighters. (1) The Public Employees Retirement Board shall conduct a study of the life expectancy of members of the Public Employees Retirement System in the categories described in subsection (2) of this section. If the board determines that members in the categories described in subsection (2) of this section have a life expectancy that is substantially shorter than the life expectancy of members of the system generally, the board shall adopt and use separate actuarial equivalency factor tables under ORS 238.607 for the purpose of computing the payments to be made to members in the categories described in subsection (2) of this section and to the beneficiaries and alternate payees of those members. Any actuarial equivalency factor tables adopted under this section shall first become effective January 1, 2005.

      (2) The provisions of this section apply to members of the system who are defined as firefighters under ORS 238.005 or as police officers under ORS 238.005 (19)(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (L), (m), (o), (p) or (q). [2003 c.68 §7; 2003 c.625 §18; 2011 c.9 §26; 2011 c.506 §34; 2011 c.637 §74b]

 

      238.610 Administrative expenses of system; rules. (1)(a) The administrative expenses of the Public Employees Retirement System shall be paid from interest earned by the Public Employees Retirement Fund; provided, that if such interest be insufficient the expense in excess thereof shall be paid from the contributions which this chapter and ORS 238A.220 and 238A.240 require participating employers to pay into the Public Employees Retirement Fund. The Public Employees Retirement Board by rule may establish procedures for recovering administrative costs from members for services provided in estimating retirement benefit amounts and processing payments if the board determines that the services requested by an individual member result in extraordinary costs to the system.

      (b) The board may adopt rules establishing procedures for recovering administrative costs from participating public employers for providing to those employers information or services needed to report in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. Administrative costs recovered under this paragraph may be recovered only from interest earned on employer contributions made under ORS 238.225 or 238A.220.

      (2) In order to facilitate financing the establishment and administration of the system the board may designate fiscal periods and may provide that extraordinary expenses incurred during one such period, such as expenses for equipment and actuarial studies, may, for purposes of equitably distributing part of the burden of the expenses, be apportioned to subsequent fiscal periods in such manner as to the board seems equitable.

      (3) For each fiscal period designated by the board there shall be deducted from the interest earned by the fund, the administrative expenses of the system for that period; provided, that if such interest be insufficient for such purpose, the excess expense shall be paid by deducting from the account of each employer participating in the system that fraction of the administrative expense of the system for that period which the employer’s total contribution to the fund for the period is of the sum of all the employers’ contributions to the fund for the period.

      (4) Amounts payable as refunds and retirement allowances shall not for any purpose be deemed expenses of the board and shall not be included in its biennial departmental budget. [Formerly 237.291; 2003 c.105 §5; 2003 c.733 §56; 2014 c.105 §1]

 

      238.615 Revolving fund for payment of administrative expenses. (1) On request from the Public Employees Retirement System, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall draw warrants on amounts authorized for payment of the administrative expenses of the system for use by the system as a revolving fund. The revolving fund shall not exceed the aggregate sum of $5,000 including unreimbursed advances. The revolving fund shall be deposited with the State Treasurer to be held in a special account against which the system may draw checks.

      (2) The revolving fund may be used by the system to pay travel expenses for employees of the system and for any consultants or advisors for whom payment of travel expenses is authorized by law, or advances therefor, or for salary advances or payment to terminating employees, or for receipt and disbursement of funds made available to the system through vocational rehabilitation training programs.

      (3) All claims for reimbursement of amounts paid from the revolving fund shall be approved by the system and by the department. When such claims have been approved, a warrant covering them shall be drawn in favor of the system and charged against the appropriate fund or account and shall be used to reimburse the revolving fund. [Formerly 237.293]

 

      238.618 Exclusion of employer or employee from system to maintain tax qualification. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Public Employees Retirement Board may deny or terminate participation by an employer in the Public Employees Retirement System, and may deny or terminate membership in the system for any employee, if the board determines that allowing participation by the employer or membership for the employee would cause the system or the Public Employees Retirement Fund to lose qualification as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust under the Internal Revenue Code and under regulations adopted pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. [1999 c.317 §3]

 

      238.620 [1995 c.296 §2; repealed by 1999 c.317 §14]

 

      238.622 Report on changes to actuarial methods and assumptions. At least 30 days before the Public Employees Retirement Board adopts changes to actuarial methods and assumptions used for purposes of the Public Employees Retirement System, the board shall submit a report to the Joint Committee on Ways and Means or the Joint Interim Committee on Ways and Means detailing the proposed changes and the associated, actuarially determined impact to the total liability of the system, the accrued liability of the system and employer contribution rates. [2019 c.355 §57]

(Public Employees Retirement Fund)

 

      238.660 Fund generally; board review of legislative proposals. (1) The Public Employees Retirement Fund is declared to be a trust fund, separate and distinct from the General Fund, for the uses and purposes set forth in this chapter and ORS chapter 238A and ORS 237.950 to 237.980, and for no other use or purpose, except that this provision shall not be deemed to amend or impair the force or effect of any law of this state specifically authorizing the investment of moneys from the fund. Interest earned by the fund shall be credited to the fund. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, the Public Employees Retirement Board established by ORS 238.630 is declared to be the trustee of the fund. Consistent with the legislative intent expressed in ORS 238.601, and to the extent it is consistent with the board’s fiduciary duties, the board shall give equal consideration to the interests of participating public employers and the interests of members. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impose a fiduciary duty on the board to consider the interests of public employers, and the board shall consider the interests of public employers only with respect to matters unrelated to the board’s fiduciary duties as trustee of the fund.

      (2) Until all liabilities to members and their beneficiaries are satisfied, assets of the fund may not be diverted or otherwise put to any use that is not for the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries. This subsection does not limit return of employer contributions for health benefits in the manner provided by ORS 238.410, 238.415 and 238.420 upon satisfaction of all liabilities for health benefits under those sections.

      (3) The State of Oregon and other public employers that make contributions to the fund have no proprietary interest in the fund or in the contributions made to the fund by them. The state and other public employers disclaim any right to reclaim those contributions and waive any right of reclamation they may have in the fund. This subsection does not prohibit alteration or refund of employer contributions if the alteration or refund is authorized under this chapter or ORS chapter 238A and is due to erroneous payment or decreased liability for employer contributions under the system. This subsection does not prohibit the offset of contributions to the individual account program under ORS 238.229 (5).

      (4) The board may accept gifts of money or other property from any source, given for the uses and purposes of the system. Money so received shall be paid into the fund. Money or other property so received shall be used for the purposes for which received. Unless otherwise prescribed by the source from which the money or other property is received, the money shall be considered as income of the fund and the other property shall be retained, managed and disposed of as are investments of the fund.

      (5) All moneys paid into the fund shall be deposited with the State Treasurer, who shall be custodian of the fund and pay all warrants drawn on it in compliance with law. No such warrant shall be paid until the claim for which it is drawn is first approved by the director or designee and otherwise audited and verified as required by law. Monthly, each beneficiary’s gross benefit shall be calculated; applicable deductions made for taxes, insurance and other withholdings; and the net amount paid to the beneficiary, by check or by electronic funds transfer (EFT) to the beneficiary’s bank. A deduction summary shall be made, by type, and a check issued for the aggregate of each type for transmittal to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction, vendor or institution. A voucher shall be prepared and transmitted to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services for reimbursement of the checking account, and the department shall draw a warrant on the State Treasurer, payable to the Public Employees Retirement System, for the amount thereof.

      (6) Any warrant, check or order for the payment of benefits or refunds under the system out of the fund issued by the board which is canceled, declared void or otherwise made unpayable pursuant to law because it is outstanding and unpaid for a period of more than two years, may be reissued by the board without bond if the payee is located after such warrant, check or order is canceled, declared void or otherwise made unpayable pursuant to law.

      (7) All references in this chapter to checks or warrants are subject to the provisions of ORS 291.001.

      (8) The board shall provide for an annual audit of the retirement fund and for an annual report to the Legislative Assembly and to all members of, retirees of, and all employers participating in, the system. The annual report must contain financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The financial statements must include the report of any independent auditor.

      (9) The board may review legislative proposals for changes in the benefits provided under this chapter and ORS chapter 238A and may make recommendations to committees of the Legislative Assembly on those proposed changes. In making recommendations under this subsection, the board acts as a policy advisor to the Legislative Assembly and not as a fiduciary. In making recommendations under this subsection on the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan established by ORS chapter 238A, the board shall seek to maintain the balance between benefits and costs, and the relative risk borne by employers and employees with respect to investment performance, reflected in ORS chapter 238A as in effect on January 1, 2004.

      (10) The board shall appoint a committee to advise the board on legislative proposals for changes in the benefits provided under this chapter and ORS chapter 238A. The committee must have an equal number of members representing labor and management. No costs of reviewing legislative proposals and making recommendations under this subsection may be charged to the fund. Any member of the committee who is an active member of the system shall be released by the participating public employer who employs the member for the purpose of conducting the official business of the committee, and the wages or salary of the member may not be reduced by the employer during periods that the member is released from duty for the purpose of conducting the official business of the committee.

      238.665 Contributions and interest not included in board’s budget. Contributions required by this chapter or ORS chapter 238A to be placed in the retirement fund, and interest required to be allocated to the member accounts of members of the retirement system and to participating employers, shall not be included in the biennial departmental budget of the board.

(1) At the close of each calendar year in which the earnings on the Public Employees Retirement Fund equal or exceed the assumed interest rate established by the Public Employees Retirement Board under ORS 238.255, the board shall set aside, out of interest and other income received through investment of the Public Employees Retirement Fund during that calendar year, such part of the income as the board may deem advisable, not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the combined total of such income, which moneys so segregated shall remain in the fund and constitute therein a reserve account. The board shall continue to credit the reserve account in the manner required by this subsection until the board determines that the reserve account is adequately funded for the purposes specified in this subsection, but the board may not credit further amounts to the reserve account if the amounts in the reserve account exceed $50 million. Such reserve account shall be maintained and used by the board to prevent any deficit of moneys available for the payment of retirement allowances, due to interest fluctuations, changes in mortality rate or, except as provided in subsection (3) or (4) of this section, other contingency. In addition, the reserve account may be used by the board for the following purposes:

      (a) To prevent any deficit in the fund by reason of the insolvency of a participating public employer. Reserves under this paragraph may be funded only from the earnings on employer contributions made under ORS 238.225.

      (b) To pay any legal expenses or judgments that do not arise in the ordinary course of adjudicating an individual member’s benefits or an individual employer’s liabilities.

      (2) At the close of each calendar year, the board shall set aside, out of interest and other income received during the calendar year, after deducting the amounts provided by law and to the extent that such income is available, a sufficient amount to credit to the reserves for pension accounts and annuities varying percentage amounts adopted by the board as a result of periodic actuarial investigations. If total income available for distribution exceeds those percentages of the total accumulated contributions of employees and employers, the reserves for pensions and annuities shall participate in such excess.

      (3) The board may set aside, out of interest and other income received through investment of the fund, such part of the income as the board considers necessary, which moneys so segregated shall remain in the fund and constitute one or more reserve accounts. Such reserve accounts shall be maintained and used by the board to offset gains and losses of invested capital. The board, from time to time, may cause to be transferred from the reserve account provided for in subsection (1) of this section to a reserve account provided for in this subsection such amount as the board determines to be unnecessary for the purposes set forth in subsection (1) of this section and to be necessary for the purposes set forth in this subsection.

      (4) The board may provide for amortizing gains and losses of invested capital in such instances as the board determines that amortization is preferable to a reserve account provided for in subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) At least 30 days before crediting any interest and other income received through investment of the Public Employees Retirement Fund to any reserve account in the fund, the board shall submit a preliminary proposal for crediting to the appropriate legislative review agency, as defined in ORS 291.371

(1), for its review and comment. [Formerly 237.281; 2001 c.945 §5; 2017 c.746 §11]

 

      238.672 Crediting of earnings to employer upon death or retirement of member. Upon the death or retirement of a member of the Public Employees Retirement System, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall credit earnings to the participating public employer or employers that employed the member. The board shall credit earnings to the amounts charged to each employer by reason of the death or retirement. The earnings rate used by the board shall be the same rate that the board uses for crediting member accounts at the time the charge is made. [2001 c.945 §21]

 

      238.675 Transfer of unclaimed death benefit or account balance to other account or reserve. (1)(a) Any benefit payment that is payable as the result of the death of a member may be transferred by the Public Employees Retirement Board to another account or reserve in the fund if:

      (A) The total benefit payable to the beneficiaries designated by the deceased member is less than $250 in amount;

      (B) Ten years have passed since the death of the member; and

      (C) No claim has been made for the benefit payment.

      (b) Amounts transferred under this section shall be credited to accounts or reserves in the fund designated by the board in its discretion.

      (c) The board shall establish procedures for the filing of a delayed claim by a beneficiary of a deceased member who would otherwise be entitled to receive a benefit payment. Delayed claims may be filed after the 10-year period provided for in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (2)(a) The Public Employees Retirement Board may transfer the amount credited to the member account of a former member to another account or reserve in the fund if:

      (A) The total amount credited to the member account of the former member is less than $250;

      (B) The membership of the person in the system has been terminated under the provisions of ORS 238.095 (2) or the membership of the person in the pension program or individual account program has been terminated under ORS 238A.110 or 238A.310; and

      (C) Ten years have passed since the former member ceased to be a member of the system and no claim has been made for payment of the amount credited to the member account of the former member.

      (b) Amounts transferred under this section shall be credited to reserves or accounts in the fund designated by the board in its discretion.

      (c) The board shall establish procedures for the filing of a delayed claim by a former member of the system who would otherwise be entitled to receive amounts credited to the member account of the former member.

(1) Employees whose membership in a previously established retirement system excludes them from membership in the system established by this chapter may apply to the Public Employees Retirement Board in writing for the former system to be integrated into the latter and for them to be allowed to become members of the latter. Whenever two-thirds of them and their employer, through its governing body, so apply, the board:

      (b) The proposed contract so adopted and approved shall be submitted to a vote of the active members of the association. In submitting a proposed contract, an association shall follow the procedure provided in its bylaws for the promulgation and adoption of bylaws.

      (c) Adoption by the membership of an association of a proposed contract of integration shall be by an affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the active members of the association at the time of the election.

      (d) The proposed contract so formulated, approved and adopted shall be submitted to the retirement board created by ORS 238.630 for acceptance or rejection. In the event that the proposed contract is accepted by the board, then the integration shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the contract.

      (e) No contract of integration shall in any way alter, impair or adversely affect any rights, benefits or privileges which have vested under the provisions of law in a member of an association by virtue of retirement, either on account of disability or on account of having attained the retirement age, prior to the effective date of the contract of integration.

      (f) A contract of integration formulated, approved and adopted as provided in this subsection shall contain provisions whereby there will be provided to each active member of the association who becomes a member of the retirement system created by this chapter pursuant to a contract of integration, retirement benefits, in addition to the retirement benefits accruing for subsequent service under the Public Employes’ Retirement Act of 1953, determined in compliance with sound actuarial practice and with the findings of an accredited actuary on the basis of the reserves of the members at the time of the integration.

      (g) A contract of integration shall likewise provide that any active member of an association which integrates with the retirement system may elect at the time of the integration as to whether the member shall obtain a refund of the amount standing to the credit of the member on the books of the association at the time of the integration. In the event that a member so elects, then the amount standing to the credit of the member shall be refunded and the additional benefits provided under paragraph (f) of this subsection shall not be available to the member to whom the refund is made.

      (4) If a public employer applies for inclusion of a class of employees under ORS 238.035, application for integration under subsection (1) of this section shall be made by the employer and by two-thirds of the class of employees who are to become members of the system, or if the class designated under ORS 238.035 is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, application for the class shall be approved under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.

      (5) If a public employer entering into an integration contract under the provisions of this section continues to maintain the public employer’s previously established system for the purpose of providing benefits to some or all of the employer’s employees who become members of the system under the integration contract, the board may allow an employee or alternate payee to waive the right to receive all other benefits that would otherwise be paid under this chapter if:

      (a) The employee or alternate payee elects to receive a refund of accumulated member contributions along with interest credited to those contributions at the time of refund; and

      (b) The employer certifies to the board that the waiver of benefits other than the refund of member contributions is required as a condition of the employee’s or alternate payee’s receipt of benefits under the previously established system.

      (6) A waiver under subsection (5) of this section must be made before an employee’s effective date of retirement or the effective date of an alternative payee’s election to commence receiving payments. The waiver is irrevocable as to the benefits waived and applies to all future payment of those benefits that would otherwise be made to the employee, the alternate payee or the beneficiaries of the employee or alternate payee. The provisions of subsection (5) of this section apply only to:

      (a) By agreeing to pay such portion of the obligation to the Public Employees Retirement System over a period of not to exceed 40 years, together with an appropriate rate of interest as determined by the Public Employees Retirement Board and the board of directors of the school district.

      (b) By issuing one or more series of general obligation bonds for the estimated amount of such portion of the obligation and paying it from the proceeds or interest thereon. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the initial authorization for the original issue of such bonds shall require approval of the electors of the district and shall otherwise conform to all requirements of law governing the issuance, sale, redemption, refunding and refinancing of bonds by the school district, the retention, segregation and use of bond proceeds and the levy of taxes for their payment.

      (c) By issuing other notes, contracts or evidences of indebtedness for the estimated amount of such portion of the obligation and paying it therewith or from the proceeds or interest thereon. The interest rate on such notes, contracts or evidences of indebtedness shall be such as the board of directors of the school district finds is reasonably competitive with interest rates on bonds which could be issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (d) By contracting with an insurance company authorized to write annuity contracts in this state to assume and pay the pensions of retired, active or former members of the association.

      (2) Such agreement, bonds, notes, contracts or evidences of indebtedness, or any part of them, may be issued or entered into without an election, but in such case:

      (a) To the extent the principal and interest on such agreement, bonds, notes, contracts or evidences of indebtedness are paid from operating taxes within the district’s permanent tax rate limit, the school district shall each year divide its operating taxes into two portions, both within the district’s permanent tax rate limit, and one of such portions shall be the amount used to pay the principal and interest on such agreement, bonds, notes, contracts or evidences of indebtedness for such year and the proceeds of such portion shall not be used for other purposes; and

      (b) To the extent the principal and interest on such agreement, bonds, notes, contracts or evidences of indebtedness are paid from revenues other than operating tax proceeds, the school district need not divide its levy as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection and the principal and interest may be paid out of such other revenues.

      (3) Part or all of the agreement, bonds, notes, contracts or evidences of indebtedness authorized by this section may be issued prior to or after the execution of the contract of integration. The validity or enforceability thereof shall not be affected by the terms of the contract of integration or by whether operating taxes are properly apportioned as provided in subsection (2)(a) of this section.

      (c) Adoption by the employees or members of the affected bargaining unit of the applicable labor organization of the proposed contract of integration or participation shall be by an affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the affected employees or active members of the affected bargaining unit of the applicable labor organization at the time of the election.

      (d) The proposed contract so formulated, approved and adopted shall be submitted to the Public Employees Retirement Board. The board may exercise its authority to negotiate and enter into a contract with the mass transit district that would accomplish the integration or participation without adversely affecting the current operational and capital requirements of the mass transit district. The board may not enter into any contract that prevents those adverse effects by adjusting the level of benefits received by any of the employees of the mass transit district.

      (e) A contract of prospective participation does not in any way alter, impair or adversely affect any rights, benefits or privileges that have vested under the provisions of law or collective bargaining agreement in an employee of a mass transit district by virtue of retirement, either on account of disability or on account of having attained the retirement age, prior to the effective date of the contract of integration or participation.

      (f) When a public employer enters into a contract with the board under this section, the public employer shall agree to eventually extend coverage under this chapter to all eligible employees of the employer through subsequent contracts with the board.

The writs, among other things, shall direct the defendant to make contributions to the retirement fund on account of the defendant’s employees as may appear, from records and information concerning the defendant’s employees, to be required by law.

      238.715 Recovery of overpayments; rules. (1) If the Public Employees Retirement Board determines that a member of the Public Employees Retirement System or any other person receiving a monthly payment from the Public Employees Retirement Fund has received any amount in excess of the amounts that the member or other person is entitled to under this chapter and ORS chapter 238A, the board may recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment by:

      (a) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or other person for as many months as may be determined by the board to be necessary to recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment; or

      (b) Reducing the monthly payment to the member or other person by an amount actuarially determined to be adequate to recover the overpayment or other improperly made payment during the period during which the monthly payment will be made to the member or other person.

      (2)(a) Any person who receives a payment from the Public Employees Retirement Fund and who is not entitled to receive that payment, including a member of the system who receives an overpayment, holds the improperly made payment in trust subject to the board’s recovery of that payment under this section or by a civil action or other proceeding.

      (b) The board may recover an improperly made payment in the manner provided by subsection (1) of this section from any person who receives an improperly made payment from the fund and who subsequently becomes entitled to receive a monthly payment from the fund.

      (c) The board may recover an improperly made payment by reducing any lump sum payment in the amount necessary to recover the improperly made payment if a person who receives an improperly made payment from the fund subsequently becomes entitled to receive a lump sum payment from the fund.

      (3) Unless the member or other person receiving a monthly payment from the fund authorizes a greater reduction, the board may not reduce the monthly payment made to a member or other person under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section by an amount that is equal to more than 10 percent of the monthly payment.

      (4) Before reducing a benefit to recover an overpayment or erroneous payment, or pursuing any other collection action under this section, the board shall give notice of the overpayment or erroneous payment to the person who received the payment. The notice shall describe the manner in which the person who received the payment may appeal the board’s determination that an overpayment or erroneous payment was made, the action the board may take if the person does not respond to the notice and the authority of the board to assess interest, penalties or costs of collection.

      (5) If the board determines that an overpayment or erroneous payment was not caused by the system or by a participating public employer, the board may assess interest in an amount equal to one percent per month on the balance of the improperly made payment until the payment is fully recovered. The board may also assess to the member or other person all costs incurred by the system in recovering the payment, including attorney fees. Interest and costs may be collected in the manner prescribed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The board may waive the interest and costs on an overpayment or other improperly made payment for good cause shown.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 293.240, the board may waive the recovery of any payment or payments made to a person who was not entitled to receive the payment or payments if the total amount of the overpayment or other improperly made payments is less than $50.

      (7) A payment made to a person from the fund may not be recovered by the board unless within six years after the date that the payment was made the board has commenced proceedings to recover the payment. For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the board shall be considered to have commenced proceedings to recover the payment upon mailing of notice to the person receiving a monthly payment that the board has determined that an overpayment or other improperly made payment has been made.

      (8) The remedies authorized under this section are supplemental to any other remedies that may be available to the board for recovery of amounts incorrectly paid from the fund to members of the system or other persons.

      (9) The board shall adopt rules establishing the procedures to be followed by the board in recovering overpayments and erroneous payments under this section. [Formerly 237.312; 2003 c.105 §6; 2003 c.733 §66]

 

      238.720 Rollover contributions; application against payments improperly made to retirees; rules. (1) The Public Employees Retirement Board may accept rollover contributions from a retired member solely for the purpose of paying amounts claimed by the board as overpayments or other improperly made payments. The board may accept rollover contributions under this section only if the amounts contributed qualify for pretax rollover treatment under the federal income tax laws governing qualified retirement plans.

      (2) If the board accepts a rollover contribution under this section, the contribution shall be paid into the Public Employees Retirement Fund and credited against the amounts claimed by the board as overpayments or other improperly made payments.

      (3) The board shall adopt rules and establish procedures for determining whether a retired member will be allowed to make a rollover contribution under this section. Rules and procedures adopted by the board must ensure that the rollover contributions do not adversely affect the status of the Public Employees Retirement System and the Public Employees Retirement Fund as a qualified governmental plan and trust under federal income tax law.
