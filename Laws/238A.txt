OREGON PUBLIC SERVICE RETIREMENT PLAN

 

      238A.025 Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan established. (1) The Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan is established. The purpose of the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan is to provide career public employees with a secure and fair retirement income at an affordable, stable and predictable cost to the taxpayers. The Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan is composed of a pension program and an individual account program. The pension program and the individual account program are separate accounts for purposes of federal income tax qualification, and the assets of each program must be held as part of the trust established by ORS 238.660 for the exclusive benefit of the participants and beneficiaries. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that pursuant to section 414(k) of the Internal Revenue Code the individual account program be established and maintained as a tax-qualified defined contribution governmental plan for the purposes of sections 72(d) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Public Employees Retirement Board may create separate accounts within the Public Employees Retirement Fund for the pension program and the individual account program.

      (2) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 238, any person who is employed by a participating public employer on or after August 29, 2003, and who has not established membership in the Public Employees Retirement System before August 29, 2003, is entitled to receive only the benefits provided under the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan for periods of service with participating public employers on and after August 29, 2003, and has no right or claim to any benefit under ORS chapter 238 except as specifically provided by this chapter.

      (3) Any person who is a member of the Public Employees Retirement System on August 28, 2003, is entitled to receive the benefits provided by ORS chapter 238 for all service performed before, on and after August 29, 2003, unless the person’s membership in the system is subsequently terminated under ORS 238.095. If the person’s membership in the system is terminated under ORS 238.095 on or after August 29, 2003, the person is entitled to receive the benefits provided under the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan for periods of service with participating public employers after the termination of membership.

      (4) A person establishes membership in the system before August 29, 2003, for the purposes of this section if:

      (a) The person is a member of the system, or a judge member of the system, on August 28, 2003; or

      (b) The person performed any period of service for a participating public employer before August 29, 2003, that is credited to the six-month period of employment required of an employee under ORS 238.015 before an employee may become a member of the system.

      (5) Except as provided in this chapter, ORS chapter 238 does not apply to the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan.

      (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to a person elected or appointed as a judge as defined in ORS 238.500. [2003 c.733 §2; 2005 c.332 §6; 2005 c.808 §9; 2007 c.624 §1; 2007 c.769 §1a]

 

      238A.030 Information technology system. Subject to such direction and oversight as may be provided by the Legislative Assembly, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall take all steps necessary to develop and implement a dedicated information technology system to manage the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan established by ORS chapter 238A. The board shall ensure that the essential record keeping components of the information technology system are in operation as soon as practicable. The board shall ensure that the information technology system is designed to support the current and future business and technology needs of the Public Employees Retirement System arising out of the implementation of ORS chapter 238A. [2003 c.733 §83]

 

      Note: 238A.030 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 238A or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (b) Employer contributions for new members of the pension program shall first be made under ORS 238A.220 for those wages that are attributable to services performed by the employee during the first full pay period following the six-month period, without regard to when those wages are considered earned for other purposes under this chapter.

      (2) A person who is elected or appointed to an office with a fixed term other than as a member of the Legislative Assembly, or who is appointed by the Governor to an office as head of a department, may elect not to become a member of the pension program by giving the Public Employees Retirement Board written notice not later than 30 days after taking office.

An election under this subsection is irrevocable during the term of office for which the election is made. [2003 c.733 §5; 2015 c.326 §1]

 

      238A.110 Termination of membership. Membership under the pension program terminates when:

      (3) If a member of the pension program who is not vested in the pension program performs fewer than 600 hours of service in each of five consecutive calendar years, hours of service performed before the first calendar year of the period of five consecutive calendar years shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the member is vested under subsection (1)(a) of this section.

Tables adopted under this section must use the best actuarial information on mortality available at the time the board adopts the tables, as provided by the actuary engaged by the board. Actuarial equivalency factor tables adopted under this section become effective on January 1 of the calendar year following adoption of the tables by the board. All computations of payments must use the actuarial equivalency factor tables that are in effect on:

      (a) The effective date of retirement for any member or alternate payee;

      (b) The date that the first payment is due for any person receiving a death benefit under ORS 238A.230; or

Before July 1 each year, the board shall adjust every pension payable under ORS 238A.180, 238A.185 and 238A.190, every disability benefit under ORS 238A.235 and every death benefit payable under ORS 238A.230 by multiplying the monthly payment by the percentage figure determined by the board. If a person has been receiving a pension or benefit for less than 12 months on July 1 of a calendar year, the board shall make a pro rata reduction of the adjustment based on the number of months that the pension or benefit was received before July 1 of the year. The adjustment shall be made for the payments payable on August 1 and thereafter.

      (2) An increase or decrease in the benefit payments under this section may not exceed two percent in any year. A pension or death benefit may not be adjusted to an amount that is less than the amount that would have been payable if no cost-of-living adjustment had been made since the pension or death benefit first became payable.
