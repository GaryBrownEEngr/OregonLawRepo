ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

 

      240.005 Short title. This chapter shall be known as the State Personnel Relations Law. [Amended by 1979 c.468 §2]

 

      240.010 Purpose of chapter. The general purpose of this chapter is to establish for the state a system of personnel administration based on merit principles. [Amended by 1979 c.468 §3]

 

      240.011 Policy on public service contracts; review. (1) The Legislative Assembly declares that the interests of the state are best served by a system that goes beyond consideration of mere short-term cost to encompass other benefits, such as efficiency, continuity of operations, public protection and avoidance of the spoils system. The state has a basic obligation to protect the public by attempting to assure the orderly and uninterrupted operations, services and functions of all public agencies.

      (2) It is the policy of the state that contracts for public services entered into by any public agency be entered with full knowledge of costs and benefits to the public and that contracts be subject to ongoing review to insure accountability of the contractor for the quantity and quality of contracted services. [1989 c.862 §1(1),(2)]

 

      Note: 240.011 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 240 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      240.012 Job sharing; policy statement. The Legislative Assembly finds that job sharing is an efficient and effective technique which should be used to improve management of state agencies. It further finds that job sharing offers employment opportunities to those who otherwise may be unable to participate in state employment and contribute to state operations. [1977 c.462 §1]

Note: 240.012 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 240 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      240.013 Job-sharing positions; adjustment of benefits and detriments. Insofar as reasonably possible, individuals who hold job-sharing positions shall be entitled to benefits and privileges and suffer detriments under this chapter in proportion to their seniority as adjusted in the proportion that their monthly time employed bears to the monthly time employed by individuals holding full-time positions. [1979 c.302 §7]

 

      240.015 Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

      (1) “Administrator” means the Administrator of the Personnel Division.

      (2) “Appointing authority” means an officer or agency having power to make appointments to positions in the state service.

      (3) “Board” means the Employment Relations Board.

      (4) “Class” or “classification” means a group of positions in the state classified service sufficiently alike in duties, authority and responsibilities that the same qualifications may reasonably be required for, and the same schedule of pay can be equitably applied to, all positions in the group.

      (5) “Division” means, except in the phrase “division of the service,” the Personnel Division referred to in ORS 240.055.

      (6) “Division of the service” means a state department or any division or branch thereof, any agency of the state government, or any branch of the state service, all the positions in which are under the same appointing authority.

      (7) “Job-sharing position” means a full-time position in the classified service that is classified as one that may be held by more than one individual on a shared time basis whereby the individuals holding the position work less than full-time.

      (8) “Regular employee” means an employee who has been appointed to a position in the classified service in accordance with this chapter after completing the trial service period.

      (9) “State service” means all offices and positions in the employ of the state other than those of commissioned, warrant and enlisted personnel in the military and naval services thereof. However, as provided in ORS 396.330, the term includes members of the Oregon National Guard or Oregon Civil Defense Force who are not serving pursuant to provisions of Title 10 or 32 of the United States Code and who are employed as state employees in the Oregon Military Department. [Amended by 1959 c.690 §1; 1969 c.80 §30; 1975 c.147 §9; 1979 c.302 §4; 1979 c.468 §4a; 1995 c.114 §1; 2005 c.22 §182; 2017 c.472 §2]

 

      240.055 Personnel Division. The Department of Civil Service that has heretofore functioned under ORS chapter 240 is hereby renamed the Personnel Division and transferred into the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. [Amended by 1969 c.80 §31]

 

      240.057 Administrator of Personnel Division; appointment. The Personnel Division shall be under the supervision and control of an administrator who shall be appointed by and hold office at the pleasure of the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. [1979 c.468 §7]

 

      240.060 Employment Relations Board; qualification of members; outside activities. (1) The Civil Service Commission that has functioned under this chapter shall be continued as a board of three members to be known as the Employment Relations Board. Each member of the board shall be a citizen of the state known to be in sympathy with the application of merit principles to public employment and shall be of recognized standing and known interest in public administration and in the development of efficient methods of selecting and administering personnel. In the selection of the members of the Employment Relations Board, the Governor shall give due consideration to the interests of labor, management and the public. Each member of the board shall be trained or experienced in labor-management relations and labor law or the administration of the collective bargaining process. No member of the board shall hold, or be a candidate for, any public office.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a member of the board shall not hold any other office or position of profit, pursue any other business or vocation, or serve on or under any committee of any political party, but shall devote the member’s entire time to the duties of the office of the member.

      (3) A member of the board may:

      (a) Serve as an arbitrator, fact finder or mediator for parties located outside of the State of Oregon;

      (b) Teach academic or professional classes for entities that are not subject to the board’s jurisdiction;

      (c) Have a financial interest but an inactive role in a business unrelated to the duties of the board; and

      (d) Publish, and receive compensation or royalties for, books or other publications that are unrelated to the member’s duties, provided that activity does not interfere with the performance of the member’s duties.

      (4) A member of the board shall be on leave status or act outside of normal work hours when pursuing any activity described in subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section. [Amended by 1969 c.80 §32; 1973 c.536 §26; 1975 c.147 §10; 1977 c.808 §1; 1999 c.248 §1]

 

      240.065 Appointment; terms; vacancies. (1) The members of the Employment Relations Board shall be appointed by the Governor for a term of four years.

      (2) Each member shall be appointed for a term ending four years from the date of the expiration of the term for which the predecessor of the member was appointed, except that a person appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of such term shall be appointed for the remainder of the term. Appointments to the board by the Governor are subject to confirmation by the Senate in the manner provided in ORS 171.562 and 171.565. [Amended by 1969 c.80 §34; 1973 c.536 §27; 1973 c.792 §6a; 1977 c.808 §2; 1991 c.67 §59]

      240.071 Compensation and expenses of members. A member shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of ORS 240.240. However, the Personnel Division shall adopt a salary plan that requires the chairperson of the Employment Relations Board to receive a higher salary than the other members. In addition, subject to any other applicable law regulating travel and other expenses of state officers, a member shall receive the actual and necessary travel and other expenses incurred in the performance of official duties. [1967 c.73 §4 (enacted in lieu of 240.070); 1969 c.80 §34a; 1969 c.314 §16; 1975 c.518 §1; 1977 c.808 §3]

 

      240.075 Removal of members. A member of the Employment Relations Board shall be removable by the Governor only for cause, after being given a copy of charges against the member and an opportunity to be heard publicly on such charges before the Governor. A copy of the charges and a transcript of the record of the hearing shall be filed with the Secretary of State.

 

      240.080 Chairperson appointed by Governor; meetings; quorum; hearings.

The chairperson shall be the chief administrative officer of the board. The board shall meet at such times and places as are specified by call of the chairperson or a majority of the board. All hearings shall be open to the public. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.

[Amended by 1973 c.536 §29; 1977 c.808 §4]

      (1) Review any personnel action affecting an employee, who is not in a certified or recognized appropriate collective bargaining unit, that is alleged to be arbitrary or contrary to law or rule, or taken for political reason, and set aside such action if it finds these allegations to be correct.

      (2) Review and enforce arbitration awards involving employees in certified or recognized appropriate collective bargaining units. The awards shall be enforced unless the party against whom the award is made files written exceptions thereto for any of the following causes:

      (a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud or undue means.

      (b) There was evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrator.

      (c) The arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party were prejudiced.

      (d) The arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.

      (e) There was an evident material miscalculation of figures or an evident material mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the award.

      (f) The arbitrators awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, unless it was a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matters submitted.

      (g) The award is in violation of law.

      (3) Adopt such rules or hold such hearings as it finds necessary to perform the duties, functions and powers imposed on or vested in it by law. [1969 c.80 §35a (enacted in lieu of 240.085); 1971 c.575 §5; 1975 c.605 §14; 1979 c.468 §5]

 

      240.088 Review of arbitration awards after written exceptions filed. (1) If after a hearing on the exceptions filed as provided in ORS 240.086 (2), it appears to the Employment Relations Board that the award should be vacated or modified, the board may by order refer the award back to the arbitrator with proper instructions for correction or rehearing. Upon failure of the arbitrator to follow the instructions, the board shall have jurisdiction over the case and proceed to its final determination by order.

      (2) Review of arbitration awards shall be limited exclusively to that provided under ORS 240.086 and this section, except for such judicial review as may be provided for under ORS 183.480. [1979 c.468 §6]

[2007 c.296 §4]

In addition to the duties imposed upon the administrator elsewhere in this chapter, the administrator shall:

      (1) Establish and maintain a roster of all employees in state service, in which there shall be set forth, as to each employee, the class title of the position held, the salary or pay; any change in class title, pay, status or merit rating; and any other data about the employee that the division deems necessary.

      (2) Select for appointment, under this chapter, such employees of the division and such experts and special assistants as are necessary to carry out effectively the provisions of this chapter.

      (3) Prepare such rules, policies and procedures, tests and eligible lists as are necessary to carry out the duties, functions and powers of the Personnel Division under this chapter.

      (4) Devise plans for and cooperate with appointing authorities and other supervisory officers in the conduct of employee training programs, to the end that the quality of service rendered by state personnel may be continually improved.

      (5) Investigate from time to time the operation and effect of this chapter and the rules thereunder, and report findings and recommendations to the director of the department.

      (6) Make annual reports to the director of the department regarding the work of the division, and such special reports as the director considers desirable. [Amended by 1969 c.80 §43; 1971 c.695 §1; 1979 c.468 §9]

[Amended by 1969 c.80 §45]

 

      240.165 Cost of operating Personnel Division divided among various agencies of state government. (1) The administrative expenses and costs of operating the Personnel Division shall be paid by the various divisions of the service in the state government. To establish an equitable division of the costs, the amount to be paid by each division of the service shall be determined in such proportion as the service rendered to each division of the service bears to the total service rendered by the Personnel Division.

      (2) The Personnel Division, at such times as its administrator deems proper, shall estimate in advance the expenses that will be incurred during a given period of not to exceed six months and, upon approval by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, the division shall render to each division of the service affected thereby an invoice for its pro rata share of such expenses. Each division of the service shall pay such invoice as an administrative expense of that division of the service from funds or appropriations available to that division of the service in the same manner as other claims against the state are paid. If the estimated expenses in the case of any division of the service are more or less than the actual expenses, the difference shall be reflected in the next following estimate of expenses and invoice for that division of the service. [Amended by 1969 c.80 §46; 1969 c.489 §6]

 

      240.167 Cost of operating Employment Relations Board divided among various divisions of state government. (1) The administrative expenses and costs of operation of the Employment Relations Board in behalf of the state service shall be paid by the various divisions of the service in the state government. The board shall determine the amount of the expenses and costs to be paid by each division of the service on the basis of the proportion of employees of that division who have rights under the State Personnel Relations Law or ORS 243.650 to 243.782 to the total number of employees of all divisions of the service who have such rights. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall transfer the assessed money to the Employment Relations Board Administrative Account established under ORS 240.131.

      (2) The board shall set standards for the assessment of administrative expenses and costs under subsection (1) of this section. The standards shall include the establishment of written policies and procedures the board must follow when determining the assessment. [1969 c.658 §4; 1979 c.66 §1; 2017 c.496 §2]

 

      240.170 Oregon Department of Administrative Services Operating Fund. All moneys received by the Personnel Division pursuant to the state personnel management program shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services Operating Fund and are appropriated continuously out of that fund for the payment of all expenses incurred by the division for administration of the state personnel management program. [Amended by 1957 c.437 §2; 1969 c.80 §47; 1969 c.489 §8; 1993 c.500 §8a; 2007 c.296 §6]

      (2) The population figure shall be that required by ORS 190.510 to 190.610.

      (3) This section applies to all full-time equivalent budgeted positions.

      (4) This section does not apply to the Governor, the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, the Supreme Court or the Legislative Assembly in the conduct of duties vested in any of them by the Oregon Constitution. However, this exception applies only to the office of the Governor and not to the executive branch of government.

      (5) This section does not apply to personnel who administer unemployment insurance benefits programs of the Employment Department, to personnel who administer programs required to be implemented as a condition for the continued certification of the Employment Division Law by the United States Secretary of Labor or to personnel who administer programs implemented by the United States Department of Labor under federal law if the state is required to enter into contracts to provide such programs.

CATEGORIES OF SERVICE; CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

 

      240.190 Policy on comparability of value of work and compensation and classification. (1) It is declared to be the public policy of the State of Oregon to attempt to achieve an equitable relationship between the comparability of the value of work, as defined in ORS 292.951, performed by persons in state service and the compensation and the classification structure within the state system. To further the effort to achieve and maintain equity for undervalued jobs and job classifications, the state shall employ a neutral and objective method of determining the comparability of the value of work. The first priority in attaining equitable relationships shall be achieving compensation equity for the most undervalued classes in the lowest salary ranges.

      (2) State management, in each branch of government, shall, when establishing or modifying personnel plans and policies in compensation and classification matters, or in collective bargaining, arbitration and grievance procedures, hold equity in compensation and classification matters as an important consideration. Where applicable, an exclusive representative of a collective bargaining unit shall hold the same considerations to achieve consistency with the policies stated in this section and ORS 292.951 to 292.971.

      (3) No employee shall have wages decreased in order to achieve the policy set forth in this section. [1983 c.814 §1; 1987 c.772 §2]

      (2) The allocation of positions within the various operating agencies to the classifications in the classification plan shall be performed by the agency appointing authority with post-audit review by the division. Agencies shall allocate positions to the available class that most accurately describes the work based upon the assigned duties, authorities and responsibilities.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, each employee in the classified service shall be paid a rate within the salary range set forth in the merit pay system for the class of positions in which employed.

(1) Recruiting, selecting and promoting employees shall be on the basis of their relative ability, knowledge, experience and skills, determined by open competition and consideration of qualified applicants, without regard to an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age, disability, political affiliation or other nonjob related factors, with proper regard for an individual’s privacy. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the obligation of the state or the rights of employees concerning claims of employment discrimination as prescribed by applicable state and federal employment discrimination laws.

      (2) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall establish procedures to provide for statewide open recruitment and selection for classifications that are common to state agencies. The procedures shall include adequate public notice, affirmative action to seek out underutilized members of protected minorities, and job related testing. The department may delegate to individual operating agencies the responsibility for recruitment and selection of classifications where appropriate.

      (3) Competition for appropriate positions may be limited to facilitate employment of those with a substantial disability or who are economically disadvantaged, or for purposes of implementing a specified affirmative action program.

      (4) Appointments to positions in state service shall be made on the basis of qualifications and merit by selection from eligible lists established by the department or a delegated operating agency.

      (5)(a) Noncompetitive selection and appointment procedures may be used for unskilled or semiskilled positions, or where job related ranking measures are not practical or appropriate.

      (b) Noncompetitive selection and appointment or direct appointment also may be used by agency appointing authorities to fill positions that:

      (A) Require special or unique skills such as expert professional level or executive positions; or

      (B) Have critical timing requirements affecting recruitment.

      (6) Minimum qualifications and performance requirements and duties of a classification may be appropriately modified to permit the appointment and promotion of trainees to positions normally filled at full proficiency level.

      (7) The department or delegated agencies shall establish systems to provide opportunities for promotion through meritorious service, training, education and career development assignments. The department shall certify to the eligibility of persons selected for promotion or delegate that responsibility to operating agencies in appropriate situations. Provision shall be made to bring persons into state service through open competition at higher levels when the competition provides abilities not available among existing employees, enrich state service or contribute to improved employment opportunity for underrepresented groups.

      (5) Subject to the requirements of ORS 183.452, the state agency need not be represented by legal counsel in these proceedings before the Employment Relations Board. The board may adopt, by rule, special informal proceedings to review these matters and may, in its discretion, rely on any grievance procedure records developed by the state agency. If the board adopts a rule under this subsection, the employer shall not be required to comply with ORS 183.452 (2)(b) for hearings conducted under the board rule. Any court review of the board’s decision under this section shall give special deference to the informality of the proceedings in reviewing the sufficiency of the record.

Agency actions under this subsection are subject to post-audit review by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services as provided in ORS 240.311.

      (5) Employment of a temporary employee for different workload needs shall not exceed the equivalent of six calendar months in a 12-month period.
