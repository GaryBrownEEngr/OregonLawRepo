      (1) To make ORS 241.016 to 241.990, providing a system of civil service under which county employees shall be employed, applicable to such county;

      241.210 Board of county commissioners to control creation of positions and fixing of compensation. All positions subject to civil service in the county shall be created by the board of county commissioners and the board is authorized to fix the compensation of all employees employed therein. In the creation of each position subject to civil service, and in determining the amount of compensation thereof, the board shall give due consideration to the recommendation of the civil service commission and the appointing power of the department under which the position is created.

 

      241.215 Classification and compensation; rules. (1) The commission shall classify, with reference to the examinations provided for in ORS 241.016 to 241.990, all positions in the public service of the county to which ORS 241.016 to 241.990 apply. The classifications shall be based upon the respective functions of the positions and the compensation attached thereto, and shall be arranged so as to permit the grading of positions of like character in groups and subdivisions, to the end that like compensation shall be paid for like duties.

      (2) The commission shall establish maximum and minimum salary limits for each grade in its classification, and shall provide by rule for advancement or promotion from grade to grade on the basis of efficiency and length of service.

      (3) The classifications and grades may, from time to time, be amended, added to, consolidated or abolished by the commission, but no person holding any position under any established classification or grade shall be affected by any such change so as to deprive the person of any of the benefits attached to the classification or grade applicable to the position then held by the person.

      (4) The positions so classified and graded shall constitute the classified civil service of the county.

 

      241.220 Examinations; notice. (1) The commission shall, from time to time, hold public competitive examinations to ascertain the fitness of applicants for all positions in the classified service.

      (2) Notice of the time, place and general scope of every examination shall be given by the commission by publication in a newspaper of general circulation and printed and published in the county, once each week for two consecutive weeks. Notices shall also be posted in three public places in the county, one of which shall be the office of the commission, for not less than two weeks prior to the examination.

 

      241.225 Qualification for examination. Examinations shall be confined to citizens of the United States who can read and write the English language and who also possess such qualifications as to fitness, habits and moral character as are prescribed by rules of the commission. [Amended by 1959 c.689 §7; 1961 c.135 §4]

 

      241.230 Character of examinations. (1) All examinations shall be practical in character and shall relate only to those matters which fairly test the relative fitness of persons examined to discharge the duties of the positions for which they are applicants. Examinations shall include, when appropriate, tests of health and physical qualification, and of manual, clerical or professional skill.

      (2) No question in any examination shall relate to political or religious preference, affiliation, opinion or services.

 

      241.235 Civil service examiners. The commission shall control all examinations and shall designate the persons who shall act as examiners at any examination. When a person in the official service of the county is designated as examiner, the person shall act as such without extra compensation. Any commissioner may act as examiner.

 

      241.240 Credits to experienced applicants. The regulations of the commission shall provide for a credit on original entrance examinations, in a percentage to be determined by the commission, for experience in work similar to that for which examinations are held. [Amended by 1959 c.84 §1; 1977 c.854 §2]

 

      241.245 Examinations for promotions. (1) Examinations for promotions shall be among the members of the lower classifications or grades established for each department who desire to offer themselves for such examination. The regulations adopted for examination of applicants for promotion shall, as near as may be, follow the regulations governing the examination of applicants for original appointment.

      (2) The commission shall by its regulations prescribe the weight to be given to the recommendation of the appointing power touching the qualifications of the candidate for promotion, and where a record of fidelity and efficiency is regularly kept in good faith in any department the commission shall give it at least equal value with the record of examination for promotion.

 

      241.250 Register of eligibles; relative rank; striking of names; rules. The commission shall prepare and keep a register for each grade and classification in the classified civil service of all persons whose general average standing upon examination for such grade or classification is not less than the minimum fixed by the rules of the commission, and who are otherwise eligible. Such persons shall take rank upon such register, as candidates, in the order of their relative excellence, as determined by examination and investigation. Candidates of equal standing shall take rank upon the register according to the order in which their applications are filed. The commission may, by rule, provide for striking candidates from the list after they have remained thereon for a specified time, and may limit the number of times the same candidate shall be certified to the appointing power.

 

      241.255 Vacancies filled by promotion if practicable. The commission shall by regulations provide that wherever practicable vacancies shall be filled by promotion.

 

      241.260 Classified civil service vacancies; certification of candidates for vacancies. Whenever there is a vacancy in any position in the classified civil service, the appointing power shall immediately notify the commission thereof. The commission shall thereupon certify to the appointing power the names and addresses of the three eligible candidates standing highest upon the register for the classification or grade to which such position belongs. If there are fewer than three, the commission shall certify all candidates upon the register. When vacancies exist in two or more positions of the same classification in the same department at the same time, the commission shall certify at least two candidates for each position, but those certified must be the eligible candidates standing highest upon the register. The appointing power may require the candidates so certified to come before the appointing power, and the appointing power may inspect their examination papers.

[Amended by 2005 c.22 §183]

 

      241.265 Probationary appointments; discharge during probation; effect of failure of promoted candidate to qualify. (1) The appointing power shall appoint to each vacant position one of the candidates certified. The person so appointed shall be on probation for a period to be fixed by the regulations of the commission, not to exceed one year if the position is in the police department of the office of the sheriff, otherwise not to exceed six months. During probation the appointing power may discharge the probationer, and in like manner appoint another of such candidates, and so continue until all candidates have been appointed. The reasons, in each instance, for such discharge, shall be filed in writing with the commission. If the reasons are deemed insufficient by the commission, the discharged candidate shall, notwithstanding such discharge, retain the rank upon the eligible list.

      (2) When any person who has taken a promotional examination, and who has been appointed to a position in a higher classification or grade on probation, fails to qualify for the position in the higher classification or grade within the probationary period, the person shall not lose seniority in the lower classification or grade from which such promotion was made but shall return to employment and be reinstated in the position held by the person in such lower classification or grade. [Amended by 1965 c.186 §1]

 

      241.270 Waiver of appointment. Any person on the eligible list may waive any appointment and in such event shall retain rank on the eligible list.

 

      241.275 Permanent appointments. The appointing power must make permanent appointments from the list of candidates certified, unless, for reasons assigned in writing by the appointing power, the commission consents to and certifies a new list of candidates. If any probationer is not discharged during the period of probation, the appointment of the probationer shall be deemed permanent.

 

      241.280 Temporary appointments. When there is no eligible list from which a position may be filled, the appointing power may, with the consent of the commission, fill such position by temporary appointment. A temporary appointment shall not continue for a longer period than three months, nor shall successive temporary appointments be made to the same position under this section without the previous consent of the commission. In no case shall any person hold a position under a temporary appointment for a period longer than six months without the unanimous consent of the commission. All temporary appointments caused by leaves of absence shall be made from the eligible list of the classified service.

Copies of the records shall be filed with the commission from time to time, as it may require.

      (2) The commission shall investigate all efficiency records and may make its own records, and shall rate upon such records the item of ascertained merit in examinations for promotion.

If the deputy sheriffs in the county are under civil service, only a deputy sheriff serving in the law enforcement department of the office of the sheriff is eligible for appointment as a deputy undersheriff.

      (2) Any person appointed undersheriff, deputy undersheriff or administrative aide to the sheriff, upon termination of such appointment, shall be reinstated in the person’s previous rank on the eligible list or in the person’s last held position at the salary rates prevailing for such positions on the date of resumption of duty, without loss of seniority or other employment rights and with service credit for the time served as undersheriff or deputy undersheriff.

      (2) No transfer or reinstatement shall be made from a position in one classification or grade to a position in another classification or grade, nor shall a person be transferred to or reinstated in a position for entrance to which there is required by ORS 241.016 to 241.990 or the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, an examination involving essential tests or qualifications different from or higher than those required for original appointment to the position held by such person.

 

      241.420 Suspensions. Any appointing power may, without hearing or trial, preemptorily suspend any subordinate for cause for a reasonable period, not exceeding 30 days, with loss of salary or other compensation. No suspension shall be made except upon written charges served upon the accused and filed with the commission, with the privilege to the accused of serving upon the appointing power a written answer and explanation of such charges, and filing a copy of the same with the commission. No suspension made by any appointing power pursuant to this section shall be subject to review by the commission or any other tribunal.

      241.435 Necessity of a hearing prior to dismissal. Employees may be dismissed without a previous hearing except that persons who have been employed in the county public service continuously for five or more years shall be dismissed only after a hearing before the accusing authority.

 

      241.440 Investigation of dismissal. A dismissed employee may, within 10 days from the time of dismissal, file with the commission a written demand for an investigation. If the demand alleges, or if it otherwise appears to the commission, that the dismissal was made for political or religious reasons, or because of reasons of age as described in ORS chapter 659A, or was not made in good faith for cause, the commission shall conduct an investigation. The investigation shall be confined to the determination of the question of whether the dismissal was or was not made for political or religious reasons or because of reasons of age as described in ORS chapter 659A and was or was not made in good faith for cause. The burden of proof shall be upon the dismissed person. [Amended by 1959 c.689 §8; 1977 c.770 §7; 2001 c.621 §72]

 

      241.445 Right of employee to public hearing and representation; limitations.

However, the right of the accused to a public hearing and to representation by counsel shall not apply to any preliminary trial or hearing before the accusing authority.

 

      241.450 Orders of commission on review of investigation. After an investigation, the commission may affirm the dismissal or if it finds that the dismissal was made for political or religious reasons, or because of reasons of age as described in ORS chapter 659A, or was not made in good faith for cause, shall order the immediate reinstatement and reemployment of the employee in the position from which the employee was dismissed. Reinstatement shall be retroactive and entitle the dismissed employee to pay or compensation from the time of dismissal. The commission, upon investigation, in lieu of affirming the dismissal, may modify the order of dismissal, by directing a suspension without pay for a given period, and a subsequent restoration to duty, or a demotion in classification, grade or pay. The findings of the commission shall be certified in writing to the appointing power and forthwith enforced by the appointing power. [Amended by 1959 c.689 §9; 1977 c.400 §2; 1977 c.770 §8; 1993 c.778 §25; 2001 c.621 §73]

The commission shall, within 10 days after the filing of such notice, make, certify and file such transcript with the court.

      (3) The circuit court shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine such appeal in a summary manner, and its decision shall be final. The hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether the judgment or order of removal, discharge, demotion or suspension, made by the commission, was or was not made for political or religious reasons, or because of reasons of age as described in ORS chapter 659A, and was or was not made in good faith for cause. No appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such grounds. [Amended by 1959 c.689 §10; 1977 c.770 §9; 2001 c.621 §74]
