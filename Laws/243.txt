      (10) By January 1, 2023, the board shall spend at least 12 percent of its total medical expenditures in self-insured health benefit plans on payments for primary care.

      (11) No later than February 1 of each year, the board shall report to the Legislative Assembly on the board’s progress toward achieving the target of spending at least 12 percent of total medical expenditures in self-insured health benefit plans on payments for primary care.

(Long Term Care Insurance)

 

      243.291 Plan eligibility; costs to be paid by participants; fees. (1) The Public Employees’ Benefit Board may make available one or more fully insured long term care insurance plans.

Notwithstanding ORS 243.105, for purposes of this subsection, “family members” includes family members as defined by the board and also includes the parents of the employee or retiree and the parents of the spouse of the employee or retiree.

      (2) Employees of local governments and employees of political subdivisions may participate in the plans under terms and conditions established by the board, if it does not jeopardize the financial viability of the board’s long term care insurance plans.

      (3) Participation of eligible employees or retired employees in any long term care insurance plan made available by the board is voluntary and is subject to reasonable underwriting guidelines and eligibility rules established by the board.

The board is authorized to charge a reasonable administrative fee, in addition to the premium charged by the long term care insurer, to cover the cost of administration and consumer education materials.

      (a) “Health care” means medical, surgical, hospital or any other remedial care recognized by state law and related services and supplies and includes comparable benefits for persons who rely on spiritual means of healing.

      (b) “Local government” means any city, county, school district or other special district in this state.

      (c) “Retired employee” means a former officer or employee of a local government who is retired for service or disability, and who received or is receiving retirement benefits, under the Public Employees Retirement System or any other retirement system or plan applicable to officers and employees of the local government.

      (2) The governing body of any local government that contracts for or otherwise makes available health care insurance coverage for officers and employees of the local government shall, insofar as and to the extent possible, make that coverage available for any retired employee of the local government who elects within 60 days after the effective date of retirement to participate in that coverage and, at the option of the retired employee, for the spouse of the retired employee and any unmarried children under 18 years of age. The health care insurance coverage shall be made available for a retired employee until the retired employee becomes eligible for federal Medicare coverage, for the spouse of a retired employee until the spouse becomes eligible for federal Medicare coverage and for a child until the child arrives at majority, and may, but need not, be made available thereafter. The governing body may prescribe reasonable terms and conditions of eligibility and coverage, not inconsistent with this section, for making the health care insurance coverage available. The local government may pay none of the cost of making that coverage available or may agree, by collective bargaining agreement or otherwise, to pay part or all of that cost.

      (3) A local government and a health care insurer may not create a group solely for the purpose of rating or of establishing a premium for health care insurance coverage of retired employees and their dependents that is separate from the group for health care insurance coverage of officers and employees of the local government and their dependents. Nothing in this subsection prevents a local government from allocating rates or premiums differently among retired employees and their dependents and officers and employees of the local government and their dependents once the rating or premium is established.

      (4) All moneys paid into the plan shall be deposited into the Deferred Compensation Fund.

      (5) The assets of the state deferred compensation plan that are held in the Deferred Compensation Fund may be used only for the payment of benefits under the plan and for payment of expenses or refund liabilities incurred by the system in administration of the state deferred compensation plan.

      (6) If the board determines that a state plan participant or any other person has received any amount in excess of the amounts that the participant or other person is entitled to receive under ORS 243.401 to 243.507, the board may recover the overpayment or other improperly paid amount in the same manner as provided for the recovery of overpayments from the Public Employees Retirement Fund under ORS 238.715.

      (7) A state plan participant may not assign, anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, pledge or in any way encumber any of the rights a participant may have under the state deferred compensation plan, and the state shall reject and refuse to honor any such purported action with respect to those rights. [1997 c.179 §8]

 

      243.440 Salary reduction for deferred compensation plan; amount; payment. (1) The state and an eligible state employee may enter into a written deferred compensation contract that provides that a specified portion of the compensation payable to the employee for services rendered by the employee will not be paid or otherwise made available at the time the services are rendered but instead will be paid or otherwise made available at some future date. The deferred compensation contract must specify the amount by which the employee’s compensation will be reduced each month for the purpose of funding the deferred compensation benefit for the employee. The amount of the reduction may not be less than $25 per month and may not exceed the maximum amount allowable under rules adopted by the Public Employees Retirement Board under ORS 243.470.

      (2) The state officer or official authorized to disburse moneys in payment of salaries and wages of employees is authorized, upon written request of an eligible state employee, to reduce each month the salary of the eligible state employee by an amount of money designated by that employee in the employee’s deferred compensation contract. The state officer or official may pay that amount to the Public Employees Retirement System for deposit in the Deferred Compensation Fund. [1977 c.721 §5; 1983 c.789 §3; 1991 c.618 §4; 1997 c.179 §9]

The preference indicated by the employee is not binding on the state.

      (2) Any change in the net value of the assets of an eligible state employee invested under the state deferred compensation plan shall result in a commensurate change in the total amount distributable to the employee or the beneficiary of the employee, and shall not result in any increase or decrease in the net worth of the state. [1977 c.721 §11; 1983 c.789 §4; 1991 c.618 §5; 1997 c.179 §10]

 

      243.450 Disclosure statement; contents. The Public Employees Retirement System shall give each eligible state employee who enters into a deferred compensation contract under the state deferred compensation plan, prior to the deferral of any part of that employee’s salary, a disclosure statement in writing that contains information regarding the options available under the plan for the investment of deferred compensation, including the probable income and probable safety of the moneys deferred, that persons of reasonable prudence and discretion require when determining the permanent disposition of their funds.

If the amount is deferred on a pretax basis, the amount shall not be considered current taxable income for the purpose of computing federal and state income taxes withheld on behalf of the employee.

      (2) The state deferred compensation plan established by ORS 243.401 to 243.507 supplements all other retirement and pension systems established by the State of Oregon, and participation by an eligible state employee in the state deferred compensation plan shall not cause a reduction of any retirement or pension benefits provided to the employee by law. [1977 c.721 §6; 1997 c.179 §12; 2011 c.722 §18]

 

      243.462 Option to defer compensation on after-tax basis. (1) The Public Employees Retirement Board may allow an eligible state employee who is participating in the state deferred compensation plan to defer compensation on an after-tax basis.

      (2) The Public Employees Retirement Board may allow an eligible state employee who is participating in the state deferred compensation plan to convert compensation that was deferred on a pretax basis to compensation that is deferred on an after-tax basis to the extent allowed by federal law and subject to any requirements of federal law for the conversion. [2011 c.722 §17]

 

      243.465 Rollover distribution of deferred amounts to beneficiary. (1) If a benefit is payable under the state deferred compensation plan described in ORS 243.401 to 243.507 to a beneficiary by reason of the death of an eligible state employee participating in the plan, the beneficiary may elect to have all or part of the distribution of deferred amounts paid as an eligible rollover distribution to an individual retirement plan described in 26 U.S.C. 408(a), or an individual retirement annuity, other than an endowment contract, described in 26 U.S.C. 408(b), if the plan or annuity is established for the purpose of receiving the eligible rollover distribution on behalf of the designated beneficiary.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies to an eligible rollover distribution of deferred amounts to a beneficiary who is not treated as the spouse of the decedent for federal tax purposes and who is the decedent’s designated beneficiary for the purposes of the minimum required distribution requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9). To the extent provided by rules of the Public Employees Retirement Board, a trust maintained for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries must be treated by the board in the same manner as a trust that is designated as a beneficiary for the purposes of the minimum required distribution requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9).

      (3) As used in this section, “eligible rollover distribution” has the meaning given that term in 26 U.S.C. 402(c)(4), as in effect on January 1, 2008. [2007 c.628 §8]

 

      243.470 Administration of deferred compensation program; rules. (1) Subject to ORS chapter 183, the Public Employees Retirement Board may adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions of ORS 243.401 to 243.507 and determine the terms and conditions of eligible state employee participation and coverage. Rules adopted by the board under this subsection shall establish the terms and conditions of deferred compensation contracts for eligible state employees.

      (2) The Public Employees Retirement System shall adopt forms and maintain accounts and records necessary and appropriate to the efficient administration of ORS 243.401 to 243.507 or which may be required by agencies of the State of Oregon or the United States.

      (3) The board shall adopt rules and take all actions necessary to maintain compliance of the state deferred compensation plan with requirements for governmental deferred compensation plans imposed by the Internal Revenue Code and by regulations adopted pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.

      (4) The Public Employees Retirement System may contract with a private corporation or institution able and qualified to provide consolidated billing services, state plan participant enrollment services, educational services, state plan participant accounts, data processing, record keeping and other related services that are necessary or appropriate to the administration of the state deferred compensation plan under ORS 243.401 to 243.507. [1977 c.721 §8; 1983 c.789 §5; 1991 c.618 §7; 1997 c.179 §13]

 

      243.472 Costs of plan administration assessed against participants; apportionment of expenses; expenses not board budgeted items. (1) ORS 243.401 to 243.507 shall be implemented and administered by the Public Employees Retirement Board so that no expense is incurred by the State of Oregon or the Public Employees Retirement Fund and so that the State of Oregon and the Public Employees Retirement System incur no liabilities other than those liabilities that may be imposed under ORS 243.401 to 243.507 or other law. In addition to the amounts that may be deducted by the State Treasurer pursuant to ORS 293.718, the Public Employees Retirement System may assess a charge against the accounts of state plan participants in the Deferred Compensation Fund. The charge may not exceed two percent of the balances of those accounts. Funds collected pursuant to the charge are continuously appropriated for and shall be used only to cover the costs incurred by the system to administer the state deferred compensation plan, to issue refunds and to pay costs incurred in investing the plan assets.

      (2) For the purpose of implementing and administering the provisions of ORS 243.401 to 243.507, including implementation and administration of service agreements entered into with local governments under ORS 243.478, the Public Employees Retirement Board may designate fiscal periods. The board may apportion extraordinary expenses incurred during any fiscal period, including but not limited to expenses for equipment and actuarial studies, to subsequent fiscal periods for purposes of equitably distributing the burden of the expenses. The board may carry forward unexpended fees collected in one fiscal period to a later fiscal period for the payment of future expenses.

      (3) In the event the assessment provided for in subsection (1) of this section is inadequate to meet the administrative expenses incurred by the system for the state deferred compensation plan, and these expenses are not carried over to another fiscal period, the excess expenses may be paid by an additional one-time assessment against the account balances of state plan participants in the Deferred Compensation Fund. The additional assessment shall be in an amount determined by the Public Employees Retirement Board to be sufficient to pay the excess expenses in the fiscal period in which the assessment is made. The one-time assessment is in addition to the regular assessment provided for in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) Deferred compensation benefit payments, and amounts payable as refunds, shall not for any purpose be deemed expenses of the board and shall not be included in its biennial departmental budget. [1997 c.179 §14; 2001 c.716 §23]

(1) A local government that establishes a deferred compensation plan may invest all or part of the plan’s assets through the deferred compensation investment program established by the Oregon Investment Council under ORS 243.421. Plan assets of a local government deferred compensation plan invested through the deferred compensation investment program are not subject to the limitations on investment imposed by ORS 294.033 and 294.035. Local governments that invest through the deferred compensation investment program are subject to the policies and procedures established by the council for the administration of the program.

      (2) A local government that wishes to become a participating local government pursuant to this section must enter into a written agreement with the Public Employees Retirement System. The agreement must set forth the terms of the investment and the record keeping and related services to be performed by the system for the invested funds. The Public Employees Retirement Board may require that the local government enter into a service agreement under ORS 243.478 as a condition of an agreement under this subsection. If the local government and the system cannot reach an agreement under the provisions of this subsection, the local government may not become a participating local government.

      (3) All funds invested by the council for a participating local government must be accounted for separately. Investment of funds under this section must be implemented and administered so that the State of Oregon incurs no expense or liability other than those liabilities that may be imposed under ORS 243.401 to 243.507 or other law.

      (4) In addition to those amounts that may be deducted by the State Treasurer pursuant to ORS 293.718, the system may assess a charge against the total account balances of all participating local governments that is sufficient to reimburse the system for any additional costs of investing funds for participating local governments. The Public Employees Retirement Board shall not act as a trustee or be considered the trustee of any trust established by a local government deferred compensation plan.

      (5) The terms of the agreement provided for in subsection (2) of this section shall govern the nature and extent of the information that must be provided to local government officers and employees about the investment of deferred compensation through the deferred compensation investment program. [1997 c.179 §15]

 

      243.476 Compliance with federal requirements. (1) As a condition of allowing a local government to become a participating local government, and at any time thereafter, the Oregon Investment Council, the Public Employees Retirement Board or the Director of the Public Employees Retirement System may require that the local government provide proof that the local government deferred compensation plan complies with the provisions of section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, that apply to governmental plans, including but not limited to any required declaration of trust related to plan assets and appointment of a trustee. The council, board or director may require an opinion of counsel or other assurance satisfactory to the council, board or director that participation of a local government deferred compensation plan in the deferred compensation investment program does not cause the State of Oregon, its agencies or employees to violate any federal or state laws or regulations related to investments and securities.

      (2) Participating local governments shall take all actions that the Oregon Investment Council, the Public Employees Retirement Board or the Director of the Public Employees Retirement System, in their discretion, deem necessary for compliance by the deferred compensation investment program with all applicable federal and state laws or for qualification of the program for any exemptions from regulation available under those laws, including but not limited to the federal Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and ORS chapter 59. [1997 c.179 §16; 2011 c.9 §30]

 

      243.478 Plan administration agreements; costs. (1) A participating local government and the Public Employees Retirement System may enter into a written agreement for the system to provide consolidated billing services, participant enrollment services, participant accounts, data processing, record keeping and other related services that are necessary or appropriate to the administration of the local government deferred compensation plan. The agreement may provide that the services be provided directly by the system or through contracts with other providers.

      (2) Agreements under this section must require that the participating local government remain the responsible administrator for the local government deferred compensation plan. The agreement may provide any additional terms and conditions that the system determines necessary for the purposes of offering the services described in subsection (1) of this section to local government deferred compensation plans, including proof of compliance under ORS 243.476. The system may require that participating local governments that enter into agreements with the system under this section have uniform provisions on plan administration and record keeping.

      (3) The system may assess a charge, in an amount to be determined by the system, against the total account balances in the Deferred Compensation Fund of all local governments that have entered into service agreements under this section. The charge imposed under this subsection is in addition to any charges that may be assessed against local governments by the system under ORS 243.474 or deducted by the State Treasurer under ORS 293.718.

      (4) In the event the assessment provided for in subsection (3) of this section is inadequate to meet the administrative expenses incurred by the system for local government deferred compensation plans during a fiscal period, and the expenses are not carried over to another fiscal period pursuant to ORS 243.472 (2), the excess expenses may be paid by an additional one-time assessment against the account balances in the Deferred Compensation Fund of participating local governments that have entered into service agreements under this section. [1997 c.179 §17]

The obligation to meet and negotiate does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. This subsection may not be construed to prohibit a public employer and a certified or recognized representative of its employees from discussing or executing written agreements regarding matters other than mandatory subjects of bargaining that are not prohibited by law as long as there is mutual agreement of the parties to discuss these matters, which are permissive subjects of bargaining.

      (5) “Compulsory arbitration” means the procedure whereby parties involved in a labor dispute are required by law to submit their differences to a third party for a final and binding decision.

Upon the filing with the board of a petition by 30 percent or more of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit covered by such union security agreement declaring they desire that the agreement be rescinded, the board shall take a secret ballot of the employees in the unit and certify the results thereof to the recognized or certified bargaining representative and to the public employer. Unless a majority of the votes cast in an election favor the union security agreement, the board shall certify deauthorization of the agreement. A petition for deauthorization of a union security agreement must be filed not more than 90 calendar days after the collective bargaining agreement is executed.

A “managerial employee” need not act in a supervisory capacity in relation to other employees. Notwithstanding this subsection, “managerial employee” does not include faculty members at a community college, college or university.

      (17) “Mediation” means assistance by an impartial third party in reconciling a labor dispute between the public employer and the exclusive representative regarding employment relations.

      (18) “Payment-in-lieu-of-dues” means an assessment to defray the cost for services by the exclusive representative in negotiations and contract administration of all persons in an appropriate bargaining unit who are not members of the organization serving as exclusive representative of the employees.

      (19) “Public employee” means an employee of a public employer but does not include elected officials, persons appointed to serve on boards or commissions, incarcerated persons working under section 41, Article I of the Oregon Constitution, or persons who are confidential employees, supervisory employees or managerial employees.

Failure to assert supervisory status in any Employment Relations Board proceeding or in negotiations for any collective bargaining agreement does not thereafter prevent assertion of supervisory status in any subsequent board proceeding or contract negotiation.

      (b) “Supervisory employee” includes a faculty member of a public university listed in ORS 352.002 or the Oregon Health and Science University who:

      243.656 Policy statement. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) The people of this state have a fundamental interest in the development of harmonious and cooperative relationships between government and its employees;

      (2) Recognition by public employers of the right of public employees to organize and full acceptance of the principle and procedure of collective negotiation between public employers and public employee organizations can alleviate various forms of strife and unrest. Experience in the private and public sectors of our economy has proved that unresolved disputes in the public service are injurious to the public, the governmental agencies, and public employees;

      (3) Experience in private and public employment has also proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and negotiate collectively safeguards employees and the public from injury, impairment and interruptions of necessary services, and removes certain recognized sources of strife and unrest, by encouraging practices fundamental to the peaceful adjustment of disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, terms and other working conditions, and by establishing greater equality of bargaining power between public employers and public employees;

      (4) The state has a basic obligation to protect the public by attempting to assure the orderly and uninterrupted operations and functions of government;

      (5) It is in the public interest to ensure that exclusive representatives of public employees are able to effectively carry out their statutory duties by having direct access to represented employees, including communicating with the employees at the workplace or otherwise;

      (6) It is the purpose of ORS 243.650 to 243.806 to obligate public employers, public employees and their representatives to enter into collective negotiations with willingness to resolve grievances and disputes relating to employment relations and to enter into written and signed contracts evidencing agreements resulting from such negotiations. It is also the purpose of ORS 243.650 to 243.806 to promote the improvement of employer-employee relations within the various public employers by providing a uniform basis for recognizing the right of public employees to join organizations of their own choice, and to be represented by such organizations in their employment relations with public employers; and

      (7) Ensuring meaningful communication between labor organizations and employees increases the effectiveness of public employees’ work performance. [1973 c.536 §2; 2019 c.429 §8]

 

      243.662 Rights of public employees to join labor organizations. Public employees have the right to form, join and participate in the activities of labor organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation and collective bargaining with their public employer on matters concerning employment relations. [Formerly 243.730]

 

      243.666 Certified or recognized labor organization as exclusive employee group representative. (1) A labor organization certified by the Employment Relations Board or recognized by the public employer is the exclusive representative of the employees of a public employer for the purposes of collective bargaining with respect to employment relations.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, an individual employee or group of employees at any time may present grievances to their employer and have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the labor organization, if:

      (a) The adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining contract or agreement then in effect; and

      (b) The labor organization has been given opportunity to be present at the adjustment.

      (3) Nothing in this section prevents a public employer from recognizing a labor organization which represents at least a majority of employees as the exclusive representative of the employees of a public employer when the board has not designated the appropriate bargaining unit or when the board has not certified an exclusive representative in accordance with ORS 243.686. [Formerly 243.735; 1983 c.740 §65; 2019 c.429 §9]

 

      243.668 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) It is the policy of this state that public funds may not be used to subsidize interference with an employee’s choice to join or to be represented by a labor union.

      (b) Some public employers use public funds to aid or subsidize efforts to deter union organizing.

      (c) Use of public funds to deter union organizing is contrary to the purposes for which the funds were appropriated and is wasteful of scarce public resources.

      (2) The purpose of ORS 243.670 is to maintain the neutrality of public bodies in labor organizing by forbidding the use of public funds for unintended purposes and to conserve public resources by ensuring that public funds are used as intended. [2013 c.663 §3]

 

      Note: 243.668 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 243 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (3) If an employee requests the opinion of the employee’s employer or supervisor about union organizing, nothing in this section prohibits the employer or supervisor from responding to the request of the employee.

      (b) Nothing in this section prohibits a public employer from spending public funds for the purpose of:

      (C) Providing paid excused time to public employees who engage in the activities described under ORS 243.798. [2013 c.663 §4; 2019 c.429 §10]

 

      Note: 243.670 was added to and made a part of 243.650 to 243.806 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (c) Discriminate in regard to hiring, tenure or any terms or condition of employment for the purpose of encouraging or discouraging membership in an employee organization. Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the entering into of a fair-share agreement between a public employer and the exclusive bargaining representative of its employees. If a “fair-share” agreement has been agreed to by the public employer and exclusive representative, nothing prohibits the deduction of the payment-in-lieu-of-dues from the salaries or wages of the employees.

      (d) Discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has signed or filed an affidavit, petition or complaint or has given information or testimony under ORS 243.650 to 243.806.

      (e) Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative.

      (f) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision of ORS 243.650 to 243.806.

      (3) It is an unfair labor practice for any labor organization to engage in unconventional strike activity not protected for private sector employees under the National Labor Relations Act on June 6, 1995. This provision applies to sitdown, slowdown, rolling, intermittent or on-and-off again strikes.

      (4) It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to picket or cause, induce, or encourage to be picketed, or threaten to engage in such activity, at the residence or business premises of any individual who is a member of the governing body of a public employer, with respect to a dispute over a collective bargaining agreement or negotiations over employment relations, if an objective or effect of such picketing is to induce another person to cease doing business with the governing body member’s business or to cease handling, transporting or dealing in goods or services produced at the governing body’s business. For purposes of this subsection, a member of the Legislative Assembly is a member of the governing body of a public employer when the collective bargaining negotiation or dispute is between the State of Oregon and a labor organization. The Governor and other statewide elected officials are not considered members of a governing body for purposes of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection may be interpreted or applied in a manner that violates the right of free speech and assembly as protected by the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Oregon.

      (5) It is not an unfair labor practice or a violation of subsection (2)(a) of this section for the exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit to charge the following employees in the unit reasonable fees and costs for representation that are unrelated to the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement, provided that the employees are not members of the labor organization that is the exclusive representative and have not voluntarily entered into a fair-share agreement:

      (a) A police officer of a city or municipal police department;

      (b) A sheriff or deputy sheriff; or

      (c) A police officer commissioned by a university under ORS 352.121 or 353.125.

For each unfair labor practice complaint filed, a fee of $300 is imposed. For each answer to an unfair labor practice complaint filed with the board, a fee of $300 is imposed. The board may allow any other person to intervene in the proceeding and to present testimony. A person allowed to intervene shall pay a fee of $300 to the board. The board may, in its discretion, order fee reimbursement to the prevailing party in any case in which the complaint or answer is found to have been frivolous or filed in bad faith. The board shall deposit fees received under this section to the credit of the Employment Relations Board Administrative Account. [1973 c.536 §4; 1995 c.286 §2; 2007 c.296 §1; 2011 c.593 §2; 2013 c.663 §6; 2019 c.429 §11; 2019 c.439 §1]

(1) Whenever a written complaint is filed alleging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice listed in ORS 243.672 (1) to (4) and 243.752, the Employment Relations Board or its agent shall:

      (a) Cause to be served upon such person a copy of the complaint;

      (b) Investigate the complaint to determine if a hearing on the unfair labor practice charge is warranted. If the investigation reveals that no issue of fact or law exists, the board may dismiss the complaint; and

      (c) Set the matter for hearing if the board finds in its investigation made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection that an issue of fact or law exists. The hearing shall be before the board or an agent of the board not more than 20 days after a copy of the complaint has been served on the person.

      (2) Where, as a result of the hearing required pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section, the board finds that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice charged in the complaint, the board shall:

      (a) State its findings of fact;

      (b) Issue and cause to be served on such person an order that the person cease and desist from the unfair labor practice;

      (c) Take such affirmative action, including but not limited to the reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as necessary to effectuate the purposes of ORS 240.060, 240.065, 240.080, 240.123, 243.650 to 243.806 and 341.290;

      (d) Designate the amount and award representation costs, if any, to the prevailing party; and

      (e) Designate the amount and award attorney fees, if any, to the prevailing party on appeal, including proceedings for Supreme Court review, of a board order.

      (a) Issue an order dismissing the complaint; and

      (b) Designate the amount and award representation costs, if any, to the prevailing party.

      (4)(a) The board may award a civil penalty to any person as a result of an unfair labor practice complaint hearing, in the aggregate amount of up to $1,000 per case, without regard to attorney fees, if:

      (A) The complaint has been affirmed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section and the board finds that the person who has committed, or who is engaging, in an unfair labor practice has done so repetitively, knowing that the action taken was an unfair labor practice and took the action disregarding this knowledge, or that the action constituting the unfair labor practice was egregious; or

      (B) The complaint has been dismissed pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, and that the complaint was frivolously filed, or filed with the intent to harass the other person, or both.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the board finds that a public employer named in the complaint violated ORS 243.670 (2), the board shall impose a civil penalty equal to triple the amount of funds the public employer expended to assist, promote or deter union organizing.

      (5) As used in subsections (1) to (4) of this section, “person” includes but is not limited to individuals, labor organizations, associations and public employers. [1973 c.536 §5; 1979 c.219 §1; 1983 c.504 §1; 1983 c.559 §1; 2013 c.663 §7; 2019 c.429 §12; 2019 c.439 §2]

 

(Representation Matters)

 

      243.682 Representation questions; investigation and hearings on petitions; certification without election; rules; elections. (1) If a question of representation exists, the Employment Relations Board shall:

      (a) Upon application of a public employer, a public employee or a labor organization, designate the appropriate bargaining unit, and in making its determination shall consider such factors as community of interest, wages, hours and other working conditions of the employees involved, the history of collective bargaining, and the desires of the employees. The board may determine a unit to be the appropriate unit in a particular case even though some other unit might also be appropriate. Unless a labor organization and a public employer agree otherwise, the board may not designate as appropriate a bargaining unit that includes:

      (A) A faculty member described in ORS 243.650 (23)(c)(C) who supervises one or more other faculty members; and

      (B) Any faculty member who is supervised by a faculty member described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

      (b) Investigate and conduct a hearing on a petition that has been filed by:

      (A) A labor organization alleging that 30 percent of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit desire to be represented for collective bargaining by an exclusive representative;

      (B) A labor organization alleging that 30 percent of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit assert that the designated exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of the employees in the unit;

      (C) A public employer alleging that one or more labor organizations has presented a claim to the public employer requesting recognition as the exclusive representative in an appropriate bargaining unit; or

      (D) An employee or group of employees alleging that 30 percent of the employees assert that the designated exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of employees in the unit.

      (2)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, when an employee, group of employees or labor organization acting on behalf of the employees files a petition alleging that a majority of employees in a unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining wish to be represented by a labor organization for that purpose, or when a labor organization files a petition alleging that the majority in a group of unrepresented employees seek to be added to an existing bargaining unit, the board shall investigate the petition. If the board finds that a majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for bargaining or a majority of employees in a group of unrepresented employees that is appropriate to add to an existing bargaining unit have signed authorizations designating the labor organization specified in the petition as the employees’ bargaining representative and that no other labor organization is currently certified or recognized as the exclusive representative of any of the employees in the unit or in the group of unrepresented employees seeking to be added to an existing bargaining unit, the board may not conduct an election but shall certify the labor organization as the exclusive representative unless a petition for a representation election is filed as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

      (b) The board by rule shall develop guidelines and procedures for the designation by employees of a bargaining representative in the manner described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The guidelines and procedures must include:

      (A) Model collective bargaining authorization language that may be used for purposes of making the designations described in paragraph (a) of this subsection;

      (B) Procedures to be used by the board to establish the authenticity of signed authorizations designating bargaining representatives;

      (C) Procedures to be used by the board to notify affected employees of the filing of a petition requesting certification under subsection (3) of this section;

      (E) Procedures for expedited resolution of any dispute about the scope of the appropriate bargaining unit. The resolution of the dispute may occur after an election is conducted.

      (b) The petition requesting a representation election must be supported by at least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit designated by the petition, or 30 percent of the unrepresented employees seeking to be added to an existing bargaining unit.

      (c) The representation election shall be conducted on-site or by mail not later than 45 days after the date on which the petition was filed.

      (4) Except as provided in ORS 243.692, if the board finds in a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section that a question of representation exists, the board shall conduct an election by secret ballot, at a time and place convenient for the employees of the jurisdiction and also within a reasonable period of time after the filing has taken place, and certify the results of the election. [1973 c.536 §7; 2007 c.833 §1; 2013 c.663 §8; 2017 c.496 §3; 2017 c.553 §2]

      (5) In any election where there are more than two choices on the ballot and none of the choices receives a majority of the votes cast, a runoff election shall be conducted. The ballot in the runoff election shall contain the two choices on the original ballot that received the largest number of votes.

      (6) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the waiving of hearings by stipulation for the purpose of a consent election, in conformity with the rules of the board. [1973 c.536 §8; 1983 c.83 §27; 1997 c.11 §4; 2010 c.22 §1]

(Bargaining; Mediation; Fact-Finding)

 

      243.696 State agency representatives in bargaining; Chief Justice as representative of judicial branch. (1) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall represent all state agencies which have bargaining units in collective bargaining negotiations with the certified or recognized exclusive representatives of all appropriate bargaining units of exempt, unclassified and classified employees, except those unclassified employees governed by the provisions of ORS 240.240. The department may delegate such collective bargaining responsibility to operating agencies as may be appropriate.

      (2) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall represent the judicial department in collective bargaining negotiations with the certified or recognized exclusive representatives of all appropriate bargaining units of officers and employees of the courts of this state who are state officers or employees. The Chief Justice may delegate such collective bargaining responsibility to the state court administrator. [1973 c.536 §10; 1979 c.468 §25; 1983 c.763 §64]

 

      243.698 Expedited bargaining process; notice; implementation of proposed changes. (1) When the employer is obligated to bargain over employment relations during the term of a collective bargaining agreement and the exclusive representative demands to bargain, the bargaining may not, without the consent of both parties and provided the parties have negotiated in good faith, continue past 90 calendar days after the date the notification specified in subsection (2) of this section is received.

      (2) The employer shall notify the exclusive representative in writing of anticipated changes that impose a duty to bargain.

      (3) Within 14 calendar days after the employer’s notification of anticipated changes specified in subsection (2) of this section is sent, the exclusive representative may file a demand to bargain. If a demand to bargain is not filed within 14 days of the notice, the exclusive representative waives its right to bargain over the change or the impact of the change identified in the notice.

      (4) The expedited bargaining process shall cease 90 calendar days after the written notice described in subsection (2) of this section is sent, and the employer may implement the proposed changes without further obligations to bargain. At any time during the 90-day period, the parties jointly may agree to mediation, but that mediation shall not continue past the 90-day period from the date the notification specified in subsection (2) of this section is sent. Neither party may seek binding arbitration during the 90-day period. [1995 c.286 §13]

 

      Note: 243.698 was added to and made a part of 243.650 to 243.806 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      243.702 Renegotiation of invalid provisions in agreements. (1) In the event any words or sections of a collective bargaining agreement are declared to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, by ruling by the Employment Relations Board, by statute or constitutional amendment or by inability of the employer or the employees to perform to the terms of the agreement, then upon request by either party the invalid words or sections of the collective bargaining agreement shall be reopened for negotiation.

      (2) Renegotiation of a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to this section is subject to ORS 243.698. [1973 c.536 §11; 1995 c.286 §4]

 

      243.706 Agreement may provide for grievance and other disputes to be resolved by binding arbitration or other resolution process; powers of arbitrator. (1) A public employer may enter into a written agreement with the exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit setting forth a grievance procedure culminating in binding arbitration or any other dispute resolution process agreed to by the parties. As a condition of enforceability, any arbitration award that orders the reinstatement of a public employee or otherwise relieves the public employee of responsibility for misconduct shall comply with public policy requirements as clearly defined in statutes or judicial decisions including but not limited to policies respecting sexual harassment or sexual misconduct, unjustified and egregious use of physical or deadly force and serious criminal misconduct, related to work. In addition, with respect to claims that a grievant should be reinstated or otherwise relieved of responsibility for misconduct based upon the public employer’s alleged previous differential treatment of employees for the same or similar conduct, the arbitration award must conform to the following principles:

      (a) Some misconduct is so egregious that no employee can reasonably rely on past treatment for similar offenses as a justification or defense to discharge or other discipline.

      (b) Public managers have a right to change disciplinary policies at any time, notwithstanding prior practices, if such managers give reasonable advance notice to affected employees and the change does not otherwise violate a collective bargaining agreement.

      (2) In addition to subsection (1) of this section, a public employer may enter into a written agreement with the exclusive representative of its employees providing that a labor dispute over conditions and terms of a contract may be resolved through binding arbitration.

      (3) In an arbitration proceeding under this section, the arbitrators, or a majority of the arbitrators, may:

      (a) Issue subpoenas on their own motion or at the request of a party to the proceeding to:

      (A) Compel the attendance of a witness properly served by either party; and

      (B) Require from either party the production of books, papers and documents the arbitrators find are relevant to the proceeding;

      (b) Administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses; and

      (c) Adjourn a hearing from day to day, or for a longer time, and from place to place.

      (4) The arbitrators shall promptly provide a copy of a subpoena issued under this section to each party to the arbitration proceeding.

      (5) The arbitrators issuing a subpoena under this section may rule on objections to the issuance of the subpoena.

      (6) If a person fails to comply with a subpoena issued under this section or if a witness refuses to testify on a matter on which the witness may be lawfully questioned, the party who requested the subpoena or seeks the testimony may apply to the arbitrators for an order authorizing the party to apply to the circuit court of any county to enforce the subpoena or compel the testimony. On the application of the attorney of record for the party or on the application of the arbitrators, or a majority of the arbitrators, the court may require the person or witness to show cause why the person or witness should not be punished for contempt of court to the same extent and purpose as if the proceedings were pending before the court.

      (7) Witnesses appearing pursuant to subpoena, other than parties or officers or employees of the public employer, shall receive fees and mileage as prescribed by law for witnesses in ORS 44.415 (2). [1973 c.536 §12; 1995 c.286 §5; 1999 c.75 §1]

 

      243.710 [1963 c.579 §2; repealed by 1969 c.671 §1 (243.711 enacted in lieu of 243.710)]

 

      243.711 [1969 c.671 §2 (enacted in lieu of 243.710); 1973 c.536 §1; renumbered 243.650]

 

      243.712 Mediation upon failure to agree after 150-day period; impasse; final offer; fact-finding; effect of subsequent arbitration decision. (1) If after a 150-calendar-day period of good faith negotiations over the terms of an agreement or 150 days after certification or recognition of an exclusive representative no agreement has been signed, either or both of the parties may notify the Employment Relations Board of the status of negotiations and the need for assignment of a mediator. Any period of time in which the public employer or labor organization has been found by the Employment Relations Board to have failed to bargain in good faith shall not be counted as part of the 150-day period. This provision cannot be invoked by the party found to have failed to bargain in good faith. The parties may agree to request a mediator before the end of the 150-day period. Upon receipt of such notification or request, the board shall appoint a mediator and shall notify the parties of the appointment. The 150-day period shall begin when the parties meet for the first bargaining session and each party has received the other party’s initial proposal or on an alternative date to which the parties agree in writing.

      (2) The board, upon receipt of a notification or request under subsection (1) of this section, shall render assistance to resolve the labor dispute according to the following schedule:

      (a) Mediation shall be provided by the State Conciliation Service as provided by ORS 662.405 to 662.455. Any time after 15 days of mediation, either party may declare an impasse. The mediator may declare an impasse at any time during the mediation process. Notification of an impasse shall be filed in writing with the board, and copies of the notification shall be submitted to the parties on the same day the notification is filed with the board.

      (b) Within seven days of the declaration of impasse, each party shall submit to the mediator in writing the final offer of the party, including a cost summary of the offer. Upon receipt of the final offers, the mediator shall make public the final offers, including any proposed contract language and each party’s cost summary dealing with those issues, on which the parties have failed to reach agreement. Each party’s proposed contract language shall be titled “Final Offer.”

      (c) Within 30 days after the mediator makes public the parties’ final offers, the parties may jointly petition the Employment Relations Board to appoint a fact finder. If the parties jointly petition for fact-finding, a fact finder shall be appointed and the hearing conducted as provided in ORS 243.722.

      (d) If an agreement has not been reached 30 days after the mediator makes public the final offers, or if the parties participated in fact-finding, 30 days after the receipt of the fact finder’s report, the public employer may implement all or part of its final offer, and the public employees have the right to strike. After a collective bargaining agreement has expired, and prior to agreement on a successor contract, the status quo with respect to employment relations shall be preserved until completion of impasse procedures except that no public employer shall be required to increase contributions for insurance premiums unless the expiring collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise. Merit step and longevity step pay increases shall be part of the status quo unless the expiring collective bargaining agreement expressly provides otherwise.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall be construed to prohibit the parties at any time from voluntarily agreeing to submit any or all of the issues in dispute to final and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be scheduled and conducted in accordance with ORS 243.746. The arbitration shall supersede the dispute resolution procedures set forth in ORS 243.726 and 243.746. [1973 c.536 §13; 1987 c.84 §1; 1995 c.286 §6; 2017 c.119 §1]

 

      243.716 Use of volunteers not contracting out for services. The use of volunteers to provide services shall not be considered contracting out for services. The use of reserve police personnel that does not require layoff shall not be considered contracting out for services. [1995 c.286 §14]

 

      Note: 243.716 was added to and made a part of 243.650 to 243.806 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      243.720 [1963 c.579 §1; repealed by 1973 c.536 §39]

 

      243.722 Fact-finding procedure; costs; basis for findings and opinions; effect of subsequent arbitration decision. (1) In carrying out the fact-finding procedures authorized in ORS 243.712 (2)(c), the public employer and the exclusive representative may select their own fact finder.

      (2)(a) Where the parties have not selected their own fact finder within five days after written acknowledgment by the Employment Relations Board that fact-finding has been jointly initiated, the board shall submit to the parties a list of seven qualified, disinterested, unbiased persons. A list of Oregon fact-finding interest arbitrations for which each person has issued an award shall be included. Each party shall alternately strike three names from the list. The order of striking shall be determined by lot. The remaining individual shall be designated the “fact finder.”

      (b) When both parties desire a panel of three fact finders instead of one as provided in this subsection, the board shall submit to the parties a list of seven qualified, unbiased, disinterested persons. Each party shall alternately strike two names from the list. The order of striking shall be determined by lot. The remaining three persons shall be designated “fact finders.”

      (c) When the parties have not designated the fact finder and notified the board of their choice within five days after receipt of the list, the board shall appoint the fact finder from the list. However, if one of the parties strikes the names as prescribed in this subsection and the other party fails to do so, the board shall appoint the fact finder only from the names remaining on the list.

      (d) The concerns regarding the bias and qualifications of the person designated by lot or by appointment may be challenged by a petition filed directly with the board. A hearing shall be held by the board within 10 days of filing the petition and the board shall issue a final and binding decision regarding the person’s neutrality within 10 days of the hearing.

      (3) The fact finder shall establish dates and places of hearings. Upon the request of either party or the fact finder, the board shall issue subpoenas. The fact finder may administer oaths and shall afford all parties full opportunity to examine and cross-examine all witnesses and to present any evidence pertinent to the dispute. Not more than 30 days from the date of conclusion of the hearings, the fact finder shall make written findings of fact and recommendations for resolution of the dispute and shall serve such findings and recommendations upon the parties and upon the board. Service may be personal or by registered or certified mail. Not more than five working days after the findings and recommendations have been sent, the parties shall notify the board and each other whether or not they accept the recommendations of the fact finder. If the parties do not accept them, the board, five days after receiving notice that one or both of the parties do not accept the findings, shall publicize the fact finder’s findings of facts and recommendations.

      (4) The parties may voluntarily agree at any time during or after fact-finding to submit any or all of the issues in dispute to final and binding arbitration, and if such agreement is reached prior to the publication of the fact finder’s findings of facts and recommendations, the board shall not publicize such findings and recommendations.

      (5) The cost of fact-finding shall be borne equally by the parties involved in the dispute.

      (6) Fact finders shall base their findings and opinions on the matters prescribed in this subsection in accordance with the criteria set out in ORS 243.746 (4)(a) to (h). [1973 c.536 §14; 1995 c.286 §7]

 

(Strikes)

 

      243.726 Public employee strikes; equitable relief against certain strikes; effect of unfair labor practice charge on prohibited strike. (1) Participation in a strike shall be unlawful for any public employee who is not included in an appropriate bargaining unit for which an exclusive representative has been certified by the Employment Relations Board or recognized by the employer; or is included in an appropriate bargaining unit that provides for resolution of a labor dispute by petition to final and binding arbitration; or when the strike is not made lawful under ORS 240.060, 240.065, 240.080, 240.123, 243.650 to 243.806 and 341.290.

      (2) It shall be lawful for a public employee who is not prohibited from striking under subsection (1) of this section and who is in the appropriate bargaining unit involved in a labor dispute to participate in a strike over mandatory subjects of bargaining provided:

      (a) The requirements of ORS 243.712 and 243.722 relating to the resolution of labor disputes have been complied with in good faith;

      (b) Thirty days have elapsed since the board has made public the fact finder’s findings of fact and recommendations or the mediator has made public the parties’ final offers;

      (c) The exclusive representative has given 10 days’ notice by certified mail of its intent to strike and stating the reasons for its intent to strike to the board and the public employer;

      (d) The collective bargaining agreement has expired, or the labor dispute arises pursuant to a reopener provision in a collective bargaining agreement or renegotiation under ORS 243.702 (1) or renegotiation under ORS 243.698; and

      (e) The union’s strike does not include unconventional strike activity not protected under the National Labor Relations Act on June 6, 1995, and does not constitute an unfair labor practice under ORS 243.672 (3).

      (3)(a) Where the strike occurring or is about to occur creates a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, the public employer concerned may petition the circuit court of the county in which the strike has taken place or is to take place for equitable relief including but not limited to appropriate injunctive relief.

      (b) If the strike is a strike of state employees the petition shall be filed in the Circuit Court of Marion County.

      (c) If, after hearing, the court finds that the strike creates a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, it shall grant appropriate relief. Such relief shall include an order that the labor dispute be submitted to final and binding arbitration within 10 days of the court’s order pursuant to procedures in ORS 243.746.

      (4)(a) A labor organization may not declare or authorize a strike of public employees that is or would be in violation of this section. When it is alleged in good faith by the public employer that a labor organization has declared or authorized a strike of public employees that is or would be in violation of this section, the employer may petition the board for a declaration that the strike is or would be unlawful. The board, after conducting an investigation and hearing, may make such declaration if it finds that such declaration or authorization of a strike is or would be unlawful.

      (b) When a labor organization or individual disobeys an order of the appropriate circuit court issued pursuant to enforcing an order of the board involving this section and ORS 243.736 or 243.738, they shall be punished according to the provisions of ORS 33.015 to 33.155, except that the amount of the fine shall be at the discretion of the court.

      (5) An unfair labor practice by a public employer shall not be a defense to a prohibited strike. The board upon the filing of an unfair labor charge alleging that a public employer has committed an unfair labor practice during or arising out of the collective bargaining procedures set forth in ORS 243.712 and 243.722, shall take immediate action on such charge and if required, petition the court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate relief or a restraining order.

      (6) As used in this section, “danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public” does not include an economic or financial inconvenience to the public or to the public employer that is normally incident to a strike by public employees. [1973 c.536 §16; 1979 c.257 §1; 1989 c.1089 §1; 1991 c.724 §28; 1995 c.286 §8; 2017 c.496 §5; 2019 c.429 §13; 2019 c.439 §3]

(Arbitration)

 

      243.742 Binding arbitration when strike prohibited. (1) It is the public policy of the State of Oregon that where the right of employees to strike is by law prohibited, it is requisite to the high morale of such employees and the efficient operation of such departments to afford an alternate, expeditious, effective and binding procedure for the resolution of labor disputes and to that end the provisions of ORS 240.060, 240.065, 240.080, 240.123, 243.650 to 243.806 and 341.290, providing for compulsory arbitration, shall be liberally construed.

      (2) When the procedures set forth in ORS 243.712 and 243.722, relating to mediation of a labor dispute, have not culminated in a signed agreement between the parties who are prohibited from striking, the public employer and exclusive representative of its employees shall include with the final offer filed with the mediator a petition to the Employment Relations Board in writing that initiates binding arbitration for bargaining units with employees referred to in ORS 243.736 or 243.738. Arbitration shall be scheduled by mutual agreement not earlier than 30 days following the submission of the final offer packages to the mediator. Arbitration shall be scheduled in accordance with the procedures prescribed in ORS 243.746. [1973 c.536 §18; 1995 c.286 §9; 2017 c.496 §6; 2019 c.429 §14]

 

      243.745 [1969 c.671 §6; repealed by 1973 c.536 §39]

 

      243.746 Selection of arbitrator; arbitration procedure; last best offers; bases for findings and opinions; sharing arbitration costs. (1) In carrying out the arbitration procedures authorized in ORS 243.712, 243.726 (3)(c) and 243.742, the public employer and the exclusive representative may select their own arbitrator.

      (2) Where the parties have not selected their own arbitrator within five days after notification by the Employment Relations Board that arbitration is to be initiated, the board shall submit to the parties a list of seven qualified, disinterested, unbiased persons. A list of Oregon interest arbitrations and fact-findings for which each person has issued an award shall be included. Each party shall alternately strike three names from the list. The order of striking shall be determined by lot. The remaining individual shall be designated the “arbitrator”:

      (a) When the parties have not designated the arbitrator and notified the board of their choice within five days after receipt of the list, the board shall appoint the arbitrator from the list. However, if one of the parties strikes the names as prescribed in this subsection and the other party fails to do so, the board shall appoint the arbitrator only from the names remaining on the list.

      (b) The concerns regarding the bias and qualifications of the person designated by lot or by appointment may be challenged by a petition filed directly with the board. A hearing shall be held by the board within 10 days of filing of the petition and the board shall issue a final and binding decision regarding the person’s neutrality within 10 days of the hearing.

      (3) The arbitrator shall establish dates and places of hearings. Upon the request of either party or the arbitrator, the board shall issue subpoenas. Not less than 14 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing, each party shall submit to the other party a written last best offer package on all unresolved mandatory subjects, and neither party may change the last best offer package unless pursuant to stipulation of the parties or as otherwise provided in this subsection. The date set for the hearing may thereafter be changed only for compelling reasons or by mutual consent of the parties.

As used in this paragraph, “comparable” is limited to communities of the same or nearest population range within Oregon. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the following additional definitions of “comparable” apply in the situations described as follows:

      (A) For any city with a population of more than 325,000, “comparable” includes comparison to out-of-state cities of the same or similar size;

      (g) The stipulations of the parties.

      (h) Such other factors, consistent with paragraphs (a) to (g) of this subsection as are traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. However, the arbitrator shall not use such other factors, if in the judgment of the arbitrator, the factors in paragraphs (a) to (g) of this subsection provide sufficient evidence for an award.

      (5) Not more than 30 days after the conclusion of the hearings or such further additional periods to which the parties may agree, the arbitrator shall select only one of the last best offer packages submitted by the parties and shall promulgate written findings along with an opinion and order. The opinion and order shall be served on the parties and the board. Service may be personal or by registered or certified mail. The findings, opinions and order shall be based on the criteria prescribed in subsection (4) of this section.

      (6) The cost of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties involved in the dispute. [1973 c.536 §19; 1995 c.286 §10; 2001 c.104 §76; 2009 c.878 §1; 2015 c.769 §1; 2017 c.119 §2]

      243.864 Duties; rules; contracts; personnel. (1) The Oregon Educators Benefit Board:

      (a) Shall adopt rules for the conduct of its business and for carrying out ORS 243.879; and

      (b) May adopt rules not inconsistent with ORS 243.860 to 243.886 to determine the terms and conditions of eligible employee participation in and coverage under benefit plans.

      (2) The board shall study all matters connected with the provision of adequate benefit plan coverage for eligible employees on the best basis possible with regard to the welfare of the employees and affordability for the districts and local governments. The board shall design benefits, prepare specifications, analyze carrier responses to advertisements for bids and award contracts. Contracts shall be signed by the chairperson on behalf of the board.

      (3) In carrying out its duties under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the goal of the board is to provide high-quality health, dental and other benefit plans for eligible employees at a cost affordable to the districts and local governments, the employees and the taxpayers of Oregon.

      (4)(a) The board shall prepare specifications, invite bids and take actions necessary to award contracts for health and dental benefit plan coverage of eligible employees in accordance with the criteria set forth in ORS 243.866 (1).

      (b) Premium rates established by the board for a self-insured health benefit plan and premium rates negotiated by the board with a carrier that offers a health benefit plan to eligible employees must take into account any reduction in the cost of hospital services and supplies anticipated to result from the application of ORS 243.879.

      (c) The Public Contracting Code does not apply to contracts for benefit plans provided under ORS 243.860 to 243.886. The board may not exclude from competition to contract for a benefit plan an Oregon carrier solely because the carrier does not serve all counties in Oregon.

      (5) The board may retain consultants, brokers or other advisory personnel when necessary and shall employ such personnel as are required to perform the functions of the board. If the board contracts for actuarial or technical support to manage the functions of the board, the board shall, no less than every three years, solicit invitations to bid and the proposals must include all of the following:

      (a) An explanation of how the bidder has assisted other clients in creating incentives to improve the quality of care provided to enrollees;

      (b) An explanation of how the bidder will support the board’s efforts to maximize provider efficiencies and achieve more organized systems of care; and

      (c) A description of the bidder’s experience in assisting other clients in structuring contracts that use risk-based networks of providers and alternative provider reimbursement methodologies. [2007 c.7 §3; 2011 c.418 §11; 2013 c.731 §17; 2017 c.746 §32]

      (e) Quality customer service;

      (f) Creativity and innovation;

      (7) An eligible employee who is retired is not required to participate in a health benefit plan offered under this section in order to obtain dental benefit plan coverage. The board shall establish by rule standards of eligibility for retired employees to participate in a dental benefit plan.

      (12) No later than February 1 of each year, the board shall report to the Legislative Assembly on the board’s progress toward achieving the target of spending at least 12 percent of total medical expenditures on payments for primary care.
