GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      244.010 Policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly declares that service as a public official is a public trust and that, as one safeguard for that trust, the people require all public officials to comply with the applicable provisions of this chapter.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly recognizes and values the work of all public officials, whether elected or appointed.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that many public officials are volunteers and serve without compensation.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that it is the policy of the state to have serving on many state and local boards and commissions state and local officials who may have potentially conflicting public responsibilities by virtue of their positions as public officials and also as members of the boards and commissions, and declares it to be the policy of the state that the holding of such offices does not constitute the holding of incompatible offices unless expressly stated in the enabling legislation.

      (5) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that public officials should put loyalty to the highest ethical standards above loyalty to government, persons, political party or private enterprise.

      (6) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that public officials should not make private promises that are binding upon the duties of a public official, because a public official has no private word that can be binding on public duty.

      (7) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that public officials should expose corruption wherever discovered.

      (8) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that public officials should uphold the principles described in this section, ever conscious of the public’s trust. [1974 c.72 §§1,1a; 1987 c.566 §7; 2005 c.22 §185; 2007 c.865 §28; 2009 c.68 §1]

      (a) The Governor shall appoint eight members from among persons recommended, two each by the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties in each house of the Legislative Assembly.

      (b) The Governor shall appoint one member without leadership recommendation.

      (2) A person who holds any public office listed in ORS 244.050 (1) except as a member of the commission may not be appointed to the commission. No more than three members may be members of the same political party.

      (a) Would create or tend to create a conflict of interest; and

      (b) Is not subject to ORS 180.230 or 180.235.

      (b) The commission shall set the charge for local governments, local service districts and special government bodies that are subject to the Municipal Audit Law so that each local government, local service district or special government body described in this paragraph pays an amount of the total expenses for the group that bears the same proportion to the total expenses that the amount charged to the local government, local service district or special government body for the municipal audit fee under ORS 297.485 bears to the total amount assessed for the municipal audit fee.

      (3) Each public body shall pay to the credit of the commission the charge described in this section as an administrative expense from funds or appropriations available to the public body in the same manner as other claims against the public body are paid.

      (d) “Special government body” has the meaning given that term in ORS 174.117.

      (e) “State government” has the meaning given that term in ORS 174.111. [2007 c.877 §2; 2009 c.68 §11; 2015 c.620 §7]

 

      244.260 Complaint and adjudicatory process; confidentiality; Preliminary Review Phase; presentation of statement of facts and recommendations; Investigatory Phase; possible actions by order; report of findings; contested case procedure; limitation on commission action. (1)(a) Any person may file with the Oregon Government Ethics Commission a signed written complaint alleging that there has been a violation of any provision of this chapter or of any rule adopted by the commission under this chapter. The complaint shall state the person’s reason for believing that a violation occurred and include any evidence relating to the alleged violation.

      (b) If at any time the commission has reason to believe that there has been a violation of a provision of this chapter or of a rule adopted by the commission under this chapter, the commission may proceed under this section on its own motion as if the commission had received a complaint.

The executive director of the commission and the commission members and staff may not make any public comment or publicly disclose any materials relating to the motion pending the commission’s approval to proceed. A person who intentionally violates this paragraph is subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Any person aggrieved as a result of a violation of this paragraph by the executive director or a member of the commission or its staff may file a petition in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the petitioner resides in order to enforce the civil penalty provided in this paragraph.

      (3) After the commission receives a complaint or decides to proceed on its own motion, the executive director of the commission shall undertake action in the Preliminary Review Phase to determine whether there is cause to undertake an investigation. If the person who is the subject of the action is a member of the Legislative Assembly, the executive director shall determine whether the alleged violation involves conduct protected by Article IV, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.

      (4)(a) The Preliminary Review Phase begins on the date the complaint is filed or the date the commission decides to proceed on its own motion and ends on the date the executive director completes the statement of the facts determined during the phase under paragraph (d) of this subsection. The Preliminary Review Phase may not exceed 30 days unless a complaint is filed under this section with respect to a person who is a candidate for elective public office, the complaint is filed within 61 days before the date of an election at which the person is a candidate for nomination or election and a delay is requested in writing by the candidate. If the candidate makes a request under this paragraph, the Preliminary Review Phase must be completed not later than 30 days after the date of the election.

      (b) During the Preliminary Review Phase, the executive director of the commission may seek, solicit or otherwise obtain any books, papers, records, memoranda or other additional information, administer oaths and take depositions necessary to determine whether there is cause to undertake an investigation or whether the alleged violation involves conduct protected by Article IV, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.

      (c) The Preliminary Review Phase is confidential.

A person who intentionally violates this paragraph is subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Any person aggrieved as a result of a violation of this paragraph by the executive director or a member of the commission or its staff may file a petition in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the petitioner resides in order to enforce the civil penalty provided in this paragraph.

      (d)(A) At the end of the Preliminary Review Phase, the executive director of the commission shall prepare a statement of the facts determined during the phase, including appropriate legal citations and relevant authorities. Before presentation to the commission, the executive director’s statement shall be reviewed by legal counsel to the commission.

      (B) Following the conclusion of the Preliminary Review Phase, the executive director of the commission shall attend an executive session of the commission where the executive director shall present the statement of the facts and summarize the results of the Preliminary Review Phase to the commission and recommend to the commission whether there is cause to undertake an investigation or whether the commission should instead dismiss the complaint or rescind its motion.

      (C) At the executive session, the commission shall consider the recommendation of the executive director and make the final determination as to whether there is cause to undertake an investigation or whether the commission should instead dismiss the complaint or rescind its motion.

      (D) All case related materials and proceedings shall be open to the public after the commission makes a finding of cause to undertake an investigation, dismisses a complaint or rescinds a motion.

      (e) The time limit imposed in this subsection and the commission’s inquiry are suspended if a court has enjoined the executive director or the commission from continuing the inquiry.

      (5)(a) If the commission determines that there is not cause to undertake an investigation or that the alleged violation of this chapter involves conduct protected by Article IV, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, the commission shall dismiss the complaint or rescind its motion and formally enter the dismissal or rescission in its records. If the commission considers the recommendation of the executive director in an executive session but the commission does not affirmatively vote to undertake an investigation, dismiss the complaint or rescind its motion, the nonaction taken by the commission shall be considered a dismissal of the complaint or a rescission of its motion. The commission shall notify the person who is the subject of action under this section of the dismissal or rescission. After dismissal or rescission, the commission may not take further action involving the person unless a new and different complaint is filed or action on the commission’s own motion is undertaken based on different conduct.

      (b) If the commission makes a finding of cause to undertake an investigation, the commission shall undertake action in the Investigatory Phase. The commission shall notify the person who is the subject of the investigation, identify the issues to be examined and confine the investigation to those issues. If the commission finds reason to expand the investigation, the commission shall move to do so, record in its minutes the issues to be examined before expanding the scope of its investigation and formally notify the complainant, if any, and the person who is the subject of the investigation of the expansion and the scope of the investigation.

      (6)(a) The Investigatory Phase begins on the date the commission makes a finding of cause to undertake an investigation and ends on the date the commission dismisses the complaint, rescinds its own motion, issues a settlement order, moves to commence a contested case proceeding or takes other action justified by the findings. Except as provided in this subsection, the Investigatory Phase may not exceed 180 days unless a delay is stipulated to by both the person who is the subject of action under this section and the commission with the commission reserving a portion of the delay period to complete its actions.

      (b) During the Investigatory Phase, the commission may seek any additional information, administer oaths, take depositions and issue subpoenas to compel attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records, memoranda or other information necessary to complete the investigation. If any person fails to comply with any subpoena issued under this paragraph or refuses to testify on any matters on which the person may be lawfully interrogated, the commission shall follow the procedure described in ORS 183.440 to compel compliance.

      (c) The time limit imposed in this subsection and the commission’s investigation:

      (A) May be suspended if there is a pending criminal investigation that relates to the issues arising out of the underlying facts or conduct at issue in the matter before the commission and the commission determines that it cannot adequately complete its investigation until the pending criminal investigation is complete; or

      (B) Are suspended if a court has enjoined the commission from continuing its investigation.

      (a) Conduct the inquiry or investigation in an impartial and objective manner; and

The commission shall enter an order based on the stipulation and consent.

      (12) At any time during proceedings conducted under this section, the commission may enter into a negotiated settlement with the person who is the subject of action under this section.

      (13) As used in this section:

      (b) “Pending” means that a prosecuting attorney is either actively investigating the factual basis of the alleged criminal conduct, is preparing to seek or is seeking an accusatory instrument, has obtained an accusatory instrument and is proceeding to trial or is in trial or in the process of negotiating a plea.
