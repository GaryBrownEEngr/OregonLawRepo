      250.035 Form of ballot titles for state and local measures. (1) The ballot title of any measure, other than a state measure, to be initiated or referred shall consist of:

      (a) A caption of not more than 10 words which reasonably identifies the subject of the measure;

      (b) A question of not more than 20 words which plainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure; and

      (4) The statement required by subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be written so that an affirmative response to the statement corresponds to an affirmative vote on the state measure.

      (5) The statement required by subsection (2)(c) of this section shall be written so that an affirmative response to the statement corresponds to a negative vote on the state measure.

      (6) In the statements required by subsection (2)(b), (c) and (d) of this section, reasonable discretion shall be allowed in the use of articles and conjunctions, but the statements shall not omit articles and conjunctions that are necessary to avoid confusion to or misunderstanding by an average elector.

      250.105 Petition filing requirements; monthly filing; signature verification; rules.

      (c) When filing an initiative or referendum petition, the signature sheets must be sorted on the basis of the name of the person who obtained the signatures on the sheet.

      (d) The secretary shall adopt rules establishing procedures for verifying signatures on an initiative or referendum petition.

      (e) A filed initiative or referendum petition must contain only original signatures. The secretary or county clerk shall verify each petition in the order in which the petitions are filed with the secretary.

      (2)(a) Once every month, the chief petitioner, or agent on behalf of the chief petitioner, of an initiative petition relating to a state measure shall file with the secretary all signature sheets containing signatures of electors obtained by a person being paid to obtain signatures on the petition since the previous monthly filing. The secretary shall hold all signature sheets filed under this subsection unless the chief petitioner withdraws the petition.

      (b) The secretary shall adopt rules prescribing the dates by which signature sheets must be filed each month. The secretary may not accept signature sheets containing signatures of electors obtained by a person being paid to obtain signatures on the petition before the previous monthly filing deadline prescribed under this paragraph for purposes of determining whether an initiative petition relating to a state measure contains the required number of signatures of electors under this section.

      (3) The secretary may not accept a referendum petition relating to a state measure for filing if the petition contains less than 100 percent of the required number of signatures.

      (5) The secretary by rule shall designate a statistical sampling technique to verify whether a petition contains the required number of signatures of electors. A petition may not be rejected for the reason that it contains less than the required number of signatures unless two separate sampling processes both establish that the petition lacks the required number of signatures. The second sampling must contain a larger number of signatures than the first sampling. If two samplings are required under this subsection, the total number of signatures verified on the petition shall be not less than five percent of the total number of signatures on the petition.

      (6) For purposes of estimating the number of duplicate signatures contained in a petition, the secretary shall apply at least an eight percent duplication rate in the first sampling of signatures on all petitions. If a second sampling of signatures is required under subsection (5) of this section, the secretary shall calculate an estimated signature duplication rate for each petition for which a second sampling is required. The calculation shall be based on the number of electors the secretary determines have signed a specific petition more than once.

      (4) For a state measure for which an estimate is required to be prepared under subsection (1) of this section, the financial estimate committee shall consult with the Legislative Revenue Officer to determine if the measure has potentially significant indirect economic or fiscal effects.

The statement shall be printed in the voters’ pamphlet and on the ballot.

      (7) If the financial estimate committee determines that the measure will have a financial effect on state, local or tribal government expenditures in excess of $100,000 and that the measure does not include a dedicated funding source to pay for the new expenditures required, the committee shall prepare and file with the Secretary of State the statement “MEASURE SPENDS MONEY WITHOUT IDENTIFYING A FUNDING SOURCE.” A statement prepared under this subsection shall be printed in bold in the voters’ pamphlet immediately following the printing of the estimates described in subsections (1) to (3) of this section.

      (8) In addition to the estimates described in subsections (1) to (3) of this section, if the financial estimate committee considers it necessary, the committee may prepare and file with the Secretary of State an impartial, simple and understandable statement explaining the financial effects of the measure.
