      (2) As used in subsection (1) of this section, “cause” does not include the broadcast of an advertisement by a radio or television station or cable television company unless the advertisement is for:

      (a) The candidacy of the owner, licensee or operator of the station or company; or

      (b) A ballot measure of which a chief petitioner is the owner, licensee or operator of the station or company.

      (3) A candidate who knows of and consents to a publication or advertisement prohibited by this section with knowledge or with reckless disregard that it contains a false statement of material fact, violates this section regardless of whether the candidate has participated directly in the publication or advertisement.

To prevail in such an action, the plaintiff must show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant violated subsection (1) of this section.

      (6) A plaintiff who prevails in an action provided by subsection (5) of this section may recover economic and noneconomic damages, as defined in ORS 31.710, or $2,500, whichever is greater.

      (8) If a judgment is rendered in an action under this section against a defendant who has been nominated to public office or elected to a public office other than state Senator or state Representative, and it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the false statement was deliberately made or caused to be made by the defendant, the finder of fact shall determine whether the false statement reversed the outcome of the election. If the finder of fact finds by clear and convincing evidence that the false statement reversed the outcome of the election, the defendant shall be deprived of the nomination or election and the nomination or office shall be declared vacant.

      (9) An action under this section must be filed not later than the 30th day after the election relating to which a publication or advertisement in violation of this section was made. Proceedings on a complaint filed under this section shall have precedence over all other business on the docket. The courts shall proceed in a manner which will ensure that:

      (a) Final judgment on a complaint which relates to a primary election or nominating election is rendered before the 30th day before the general election; and

      (b) Final judgment on a complaint which relates to an election to an office is rendered before the term of that office begins.
