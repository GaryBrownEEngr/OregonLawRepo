      261.007 Policy. The purpose of this chapter is to implement the intent and purpose of section 12, Article XI, of the Oregon Constitution including authorization for the establishment of people’s utility districts to develop the water and energy resources of this state for the benefit of the people of this state and to supply public utility service, including water, water power and electric energy for all uses and users. [1979 c.588 §2]

 

      261.010 Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless otherwise required by the context:

      (1) “Affected territory” means that territory proposed to be formed into, annexed to or consolidated with a district.

      (2) “Board of directors,” “directors” or “board” means the governing body of a people’s utility district, elected and functioning under the provisions of this chapter.

      (3) “County governing body” means either the county court or board of county commissioners and, if the affected territory is composed of portions of two or more counties, the governing body of that county having the greatest portion of the assessed value of all taxable property within the affected territory, as shown by the most recent assessment roll of the counties.

      (4) “Electors’ petition” means a petition addressed to the county governing body and filed with the county clerk, containing the signatures of electors registered in the affected territory, equal to not less than three percent of the total number of votes cast for all candidates for Governor within the affected territory at the most recent election at which a candidate for Governor was elected to a full term, setting forth and particularly describing the boundaries of the parcel of territory, separate parcels of territory, city and district, or any of them, referred to therein, and requesting the county governing body to call an election to be held within the boundaries of the parcel of territory, separate parcels of territory, city and district, or any of them, for the formation of a district, the annexation of a parcel of territory or a city to a district, or the consolidation of two or more districts.

      (5) “Electric cooperative” means a cooperative corporation owning and operating an electric distribution system.

      (6) “Initial utility system” means a complete operating utility system, including energy efficiency measures and installations within the district or proposed district, capable of supplying the consumers required to be served by the district at the time of acquisition or construction with all of their existing water or electrical energy needs.

      (7) “Parcel of territory” means a portion of unincorporated territory, or an area in a city comprised of less than the entire city.

      (8) “People’s utility district” or “district” means an incorporated people’s utility district, created under the provisions of this chapter.

      (9) “Replacement value of unreimbursed investment” means original cost new less depreciation of capitalized energy efficiency measures and installations in the premises of customers of an investor owned utility.

      (10) “Separate parcel of territory” means unincorporated territory that is not contiguous to other territory that is a part of a district or that is described in a petition filed with the county clerk in pursuance of the provisions of this chapter, but when a proposed district includes territory in more than one county, the contiguous territory in each such county shall be considered as a separate parcel of territory. When a proposed district includes any area in a city comprised of less than the entire city, that area shall be considered as a separate parcel of territory.

      (11) “Utility” means a plant, works or other property used for development, generation, storage, distribution or transmission of electricity, or development or transmission of water for domestic or municipal purposes, but transmission of water shall not include water for irrigation or reclamation purposes, except as secondary to and when used in conjunction with a hydroelectric plant.

      (2) If a people’s utility district owns property jointly with a tax-exempt governmental or municipal entity, only the portion of the property used, operated or controlled by the people’s utility district shall be assessed and taxed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. [Amended by 2007 c.301 §32; 2007 c.895 §3a]

      261.705 Authority to dissolve district; vote authorizing dissolution. Any people’s utility district which has not received voter authorization within five years of its formation election to issue bonds in an amount sufficient to acquire or build a system to provide service within its district may be dissolved whenever a majority vote of the electors of the district voting at an election for such purpose favors the dissolution. [Amended by 1987 c.824 §1]

 

      261.710 Call of election; effect of favorable vote. (1) The dissolution election may be called by the board of directors on their own motion or by a petition filed with the directors of the district, signed by electors of the district equal in number to not less than three percent of the total number of votes cast for all candidates for Governor in the district at the most recent election at which a candidate for Governor was elected to a full term, requesting the directors of the district to submit to the electors of the district the proposition of dissolving the district and settling its affairs.

      (2) The petition shall be referred to the county clerk of each county wherein the district or any part thereof is located. The county clerk of each of such counties shall examine the purported signatures on the petition of electors of the county and shall certify as to the regularity and sufficiency thereof. Where the district is located in more than one county, the certificate of the county clerk of each county as to the regularity of the signatures on the petition shall be filed with the Secretary of State, who shall accept the certificates by the county clerks as to the regularity of the signatures, and based thereon, shall certify as to the sufficiency of all signatures on the petition. Whenever a dissolution petition has been certified as sufficient, the certificate of sufficiency with copy of the petition shall be transmitted to the directors of the district, who shall immediately call an election to be held concurrently with a primary election or general election.

      (3) If a majority of the electors of the district, voting at the election, votes in favor of dissolution, the directors shall issue their proclamation dissolving the district and shall file the proclamation in the office of the county clerk of the county wherein the district is located.

      (4) The district shall thereafter continue to exist solely for the purpose of settling its affairs as provided in ORS 261.715 to 261.730. [Amended by 1973 c.796 §18; 1983 c.83 §37; 1989 c.174 §4; 1995 c.712 §99; 2003 c.14 §130]

 

      261.715 Directors as trustees.

      261.720 Inventory and sale of district property.

      261.725 Disposal of sale proceeds. (1) The proceeds derived from the sale shall be used to pay the indebtedness of the district.

      (2) If, after payment of all debts of the district, there remain any surplus funds to the credit of the district, such funds shall be turned over to the county treasurer of each county in which the district may be located, to become a part of the general fund of the county in the proportion that the assessed value of the property within the boundaries of the district in such county bears to the total assessed value of all property within the boundaries of the district as determined by the last assessment rolls.

 

      261.730 Disposal of district books and records; termination of corporate existence. After the affairs of the district have been fully settled, all books and records of the district shall be deposited by the trustees in the office of the county clerk of the county wherein the district or its principal part in area thereof is located, and the corporate existence of the district without further action is dissolved and terminated for all purposes.
