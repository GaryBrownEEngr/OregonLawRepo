Revenue bonds shall not be subject to the limitation provided by ORS 266.512 applicable to general obligation bonds and shall not be a lien upon any of the taxable property within the limits of the district. Revenue bonds shall be payable solely from such part of the revenue of the district as remains after payment of obligations having a priority and of all expenses of operation and maintenance of the district, including any taxes levied against it. All revenue bonds shall contain a clause reciting that both the principal and interest are payable solely from operating revenues of the district remaining after paying such obligations and expenses.

      (4) When any bonds are so redeemed or paid, the county treasurer shall cause them to be canceled and write across the face thereof “redeemed” and the date of redemption, and shall deliver them to the district board, taking its receipt therefor. [Amended by 1969 c.668 §30]
