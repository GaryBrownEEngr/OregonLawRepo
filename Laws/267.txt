MASS TRANSIT DISTRICTS

 

(Generally)

 

      267.010 Definitions for ORS 267.010 to 267.390. As used in ORS 267.010 to 267.390, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “District” means a mass transit district established under ORS 267.010 to 267.390.

      (2) “District board” or “board” means the board of directors of a district.

      (3) “Mass transit system” or “transit system” means the property, equipment and improvements of whatever nature owned, used, constructed, maintained, controlled or operated to provide mass transportation for passengers or to provide for the movement of people, including park-and-ride stations, transfer stations, parking lots, malls and skyways, provided that nothing contained herein shall limit the power of a city to exercise its general powers over or provide such stations, lots, malls or skyways.

      (4) “Metropolitan statistical area” means an area designated by the United States Office of Management and Budget as a metropolitan statistical area. [1969 c.643 §1; 1973 c.116 §1; 2009 c.11 §26]

 

      267.020 Transfer of transit system to metropolitan service district; effect of transfer order. When a metropolitan service district organized under ORS chapter 268 functions in a mass transit district organized under ORS 267.010 to 267.390, the governing body of the metropolitan district may at any time order transfer of the transit system of the transit district to the metropolitan district, whereupon:

      (1) The governing body of the transit district shall transfer title to, and possession of, the transit system and of all books, records, files, documents, and other property of the transit district to the metropolitan district.

      (2) The metropolitan district shall be responsible for all the liabilities and obligations imposed upon or assumed by the transit district.

      (3) For purposes of mass transit the metropolitan district shall have all the rights, powers, privileges and immunities, and be subject to all the duties and obligations, of a mass transit district under ORS 267.010 to 267.390, insofar as they are consistent with ORS chapter 268.

      (4) The boundaries of the metropolitan district shall, for purposes of mass transit, be extended to encompass all the territory of the transit district.

      (5) The transit district shall be dissolved and the offices of its directors terminated. [1969 c.643 §40; 1997 c.833 §26]

 

      267.030 Use of alternative fuels for certain district vehicles; exceptions; annual report; application to all district vehicles. (1) To the maximum extent possible, motor vehicles subject to the control of a district shall use alternative fuel for operation.

      (2) To the extent that it is economically and technologically possible, all motor vehicles purchased or leased by the board of the district shall be capable of using alternative fuel. However, this subsection does not apply if the vehicle will be primarily used in an area that does not have and cannot reasonably be expected to establish an alternative fuel refueling station or if the district is unable to secure financing sufficient to cover additional costs resulting from the requirement of this subsection.

      (3) Prior to July 1 of each year, the board of the district shall submit an annual report to the Department of Environmental Quality and the State Department of Energy. The report shall contain at a minimum:

      (c) The quantity of each type of alternative fuel used; and

      (d) Any other information required by the Department of Environmental Quality and the State Department of Energy to carry out their functions under subsection (4) of this section.

      (5) The board of the district shall comply with all safety standards established by the United States Department of Transportation in the conversion, operation and maintenance of vehicles using alternative fuel.

      (6) As used in this section, “alternative fuel” means any fuel determined by the Department of Environmental Quality to be less polluting than conventional gasoline, including but not necessarily limited to reformulated gasoline, low sulfur diesel fuel, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, ethanol, any fuel mixture containing at least 85 percent methanol or ethanol and electricity.

      (2) The board of directors of a mass transit district shall consist of seven members. One director shall be appointed from each of seven subdistricts. The Governor shall appoint as one of the directors a person who regularly uses the services provided by a mass transit system. Directors shall reside in the subdistrict from which they are respectively appointed. The subdistricts shall be as nearly equal in population as possible based on the latest federal census and shall be designed to ensure representation of the most populous city, other cities and unincorporated territory in the proposed district proportionate to their respective populations provided that if less than the entire district is taxed by the district, the subdistricts shall be wholly within the taxed area. The district or, if the taxed area is less than the entire district, the taxed area shall be divided into subdistricts initially, and after each succeeding federal census, by the Secretary of State.

      (3) The term of office of a director is four years, but each director shall serve at the pleasure of the Governor. Before the expiration of the term of a director, the director’s successor shall be appointed. A director is eligible for reappointment. In case of a vacancy for any cause, the Governor shall appoint a person to serve for the unexpired term. A director whose term has expired shall continue to serve until the appointment of a successor unless discharged by the Governor.

      (4) All appointments of members of the board by the Governor are subject to confirmation by the Senate pursuant to section 4, Article III of the Oregon Constitution. [Formerly 267.110; 2007 c.71 §80]

Before appointing a director to the board of a district situated in a metropolitan statistical area with a population exceeding 400,000, the Governor shall solicit from each city and county located wholly or partly within the subdistrict for which the appointment will be made recommendations of qualified individuals for the position. [1985 c.678 §2; 2009 c.11 §29]

      (a) Be considered at a public hearing only after notice as required for regular consideration of other resolutions by city charter or ordinance;

      (b) Include findings of the need for creation of a mass transit district in the affected area;

      (c) Describe the boundaries of the proposed district, which may be limited to a proposed service area but which may not extend beyond the limits of the city’s urban growth boundary; and

      (d) If approved, be addressed to and filed with the governing body of the county in which the proposed district is principally situated.

      (3) Upon receipt of the resolution under subsection (2) of this section, the county governing body shall commence district formation proceedings as provided in ORS 198.705 to 198.955 and 267.108. [1977 c.347 §2; 1979 c.585 §1; 1999 c.454 §3; 2009 c.11 §30]

 

      267.108 Director election and district formation election under ORS 267.107 held at same time; designation of subdistricts.

      (2) In addition to the requirements of ORS 198.815 (2), the order calling an election for creation of a district initiated under ORS 267.107 shall describe the boundaries of the seven subdistricts of the proposed district from each of which a director is to be elected. The subdistricts shall be as nearly equal in population as possible based on the latest federal decennial census, shall, where practicable, follow election precinct boundaries and shall together encompass the entire area of the proposed district. [1979 c.585 §5; 1985 c.678 §4; 2005 c.747 §5]

 

      267.109 Costs of election under ORS 267.107. The expenses incurred for the election held under ORS 267.080, 267.107, 267.112 and this section shall be paid by:

      (1) The district, if the resolution is approved by the people.

      (2) Each county participating in the election in the proportion of the number of precincts in the county voting on the resolution to the total number of precincts voting on the resolution, if the resolution is rejected by the people. [1977 c.347 §5]

A director shall reside in the subdistrict from which the director is nominated and elected.

      (2) The board of directors of the district shall consist of the seven directors elected from subdistricts under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) After the initial formation of a district, the Secretary of State, after each decennial federal census, shall modify the boundaries of the subdistricts so that the subdistricts remain as nearly equal in population as possible based on the latest federal census.

      (4) The term of office of a director shall be four years, provided, however, that three of the first elected directors shall initially have a term of office expiring June 30 of the next odd-numbered year following district formation and four of the first elected directors shall initially have a term of office expiring June 30 of the next odd-numbered year not less than two years following district formation. The first elected directors of the district, upon taking office, shall by lot, supervised by the board, determine which three directors shall have the shorter initial terms and which four shall have the longer initial terms. When a vacancy occurs in the office of a director, the remaining members of the board shall appoint a resident of the affected subdistrict to serve until June 30 of the next odd-numbered year, in which year a director shall be elected to serve the remainder of the unexpired term. A director whose term has expired shall continue to serve until the election of a successor.

      (5) Directors shall not be entitled to compensation for their services but shall be entitled to reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses incurred or paid in the performance of their duties as members of the board. [1975 c.632 §2; 1977 c.347 §4; 1977 c.728 §2a; 1979 c.585 §2; 1985 c.678 §5]

      (2) Subject to restrictions in the Oregon Constitution, any of the methods of financing authorized under ORS 267.300 may, in the discretion of the board, be imposed in the service area rather than in the entire district. [1969 c.643 §24]

 

      267.207 Change of district boundaries; elector approval; withdrawal of service from area; territorial jurisdiction of district; boundary commission exemption. (1) The board of directors of a mass transit district may alter the territorial boundaries of the district by a nonemergency ordinance adopted at any regular meeting.

      (3)(a) The board of directors of a mass transit district, as a result of the continuing comprehensive transportation planning process required by the Federal Transit Administration, shall determine annually the territory in the district within which the transit system of the district will operate. When the board determines during such planning process for any fiscal year that it will not provide transit service during that fiscal year to an area presently within the district, the board shall by ordinance withdraw from that area on the date specified in the ordinance, and that area shall no longer be part of the district. The board shall by ordinance set forth the criteria to be used in making the determinations described in this subsection.

      (3) For the purposes of ORS 308.225 only, the effective date of an alteration of district boundaries shall be the date on which the board adopts the ordinance altering the boundaries or, if such an ordinance is initiated or referred, the date on which the ordinance is approved by the electors as provided in ORS 267.207.

      (4) For purposes of ad valorem taxation, a boundary change must be filed in final approved form with the county assessor and the Department of Revenue as provided in ORS 308.225. [1985 c.808 §77; 1987 c.799 §9; 1989 c.923 §26; 1995 c.712 §100; 2001 c.138 §11]

The plan shall be prepared in cooperation with the Department of Transportation and cities and counties located within and adjacent to the district.

      (2) The plan shall show existing and proposed transit systems of the district and of other public and private agencies relating to mass transit. It shall demonstrate a basis for the coordination and planning of future construction, improvement and equipment acquisition of the district, governmental agencies and private interests to assure maximum efficiency and use of mass transit in the district. The plans shall be based on the needs of the district and take into consideration the plans and programs, if any, developed by the Department of Transportation and cities and counties located within the district. The district may have access to all information, statistics, plans and data in the possession of or available to any state agency or public corporation which is pertinent to the preparation of the plan and may reimburse the agency or corporation for any expense incurred in cooperating with the board.

      (3) The district board shall revise the plan as necessary for the proper control, utilization, development and improvement of the district transit system. [1969 c.643 §20; 1973 c.116 §4]

      (2) For the purpose of providing a mass transit system, a district may commence a condemnation proceeding to acquire land or an interest in land for right of way for the system over any public right of way already located, condemned or occupied or that may be located, condemned or occupied by some other public agency for the purpose of travel by the public. The proceeding shall be conducted as provided by the laws of this state for the condemnation of land or an interest in land for right of way for highway purposes. At the time of rendering judgment for compensation or damages, the court shall enter a judgment authorizing the district to occupy and use the right of way, if necessary, in common with the public agency already occupying or owning the right of way, and defining the terms and conditions upon which the right of way shall be so occupied and used in common. [1969 c.643 §12; 2003 c.576 §410; 2003 c.802 §93]

 

      267.227 Relationship with Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority. A mass transit district may enter into contracts, leases, subleases and agreements with the Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority.

However, upon written request from the district and the public authority with jurisdiction over the highway at such a grade crossing, the department shall adjudicate any dispute that arises between the district and the public authority with regard to the grade crossing. [1969 c.643 §11; 1973 c.116 §5; 1977 c.420 §1; 1985 c.678 §7; 1995 c.733 §92; 2001 c.522 §10]

 

      267.235 Protection of employees’ rights when an operating transportation system is acquired.

      267.237 Criminal records check; authority of district to require fingerprints; fitness determinations; rules regarding dissemination. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “District” means a mass transit district organized under ORS 267.010 to 267.390 or a transportation district organized under ORS 267.510 to 267.650.

      (b) “Qualified entity” means an individual or business or organization, whether public, private, for-profit, nonprofit or voluntary, that, under contract with a district, provides individuals to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district.

      (c) “Subject individual” means a person subject to a criminal records check as specified by resolution of a mass transit district or a transportation district.

      (2) A mass transit district or a transportation district shall request the Department of State Police to conduct criminal records checks of subject individuals if the checks are required in order to protect vulnerable Oregonians:

      (a) To implement a federal or state statute, executive order or rule that expressly refers to criminal conduct and contains requirements or exclusions expressly based on such conduct;

      (b) For district employment purposes when hiring individuals to operate motor vehicles of the district; or

      (c) For the purposes of employment decisions made by a district for qualified entities that, under contracts with the district, employ individuals to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district.

      (3) A mass transit district that has a population of more than 500,000 may request the Department of State Police to conduct a criminal records check of a subject individual who is:

      (a) Seeking employment by the district in a position that provides the individual with access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information; or

      (b) Seeking to provide services to the district that will result in the individual’s having access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information.

      (4) In order to determine the suitability of the subject individual, a district shall require the subject individual to furnish to the district a full set of fingerprints to enable a criminal records check to be conducted. The district shall submit the completed fingerprint cards to the Department of State Police along with the applicable Oregon and Federal Bureau of Investigation processing fees. If no disqualifying record is identified at the state level, the Department of State Police shall forward the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal records check.

      (5) The Federal Bureau of Investigation shall either return or destroy the fingerprint cards used to conduct the criminal records check and shall not keep any record of the fingerprints, except that the Federal Bureau of Investigation may retain the fingerprint cards and records of the fingerprints for purposes described in ORS 181A.205. However, if the federal bureau policy authorizing return or destruction of the fingerprint cards is changed, a district shall cease to cause the cards to be sent to the federal bureau but shall continue to process the information through other available resources.

      (6) If the Federal Bureau of Investigation returns the fingerprint cards to the Department of State Police, the Department of State Police shall destroy the fingerprint cards and may not retain facsimiles or other material from which a fingerprint can be reproduced, except that the Department of State Police may retain the fingerprint cards or create facsimiles for the purpose of providing information under ORS 181A.205.

      (7) If only a state criminal records check is conducted, after the criminal records check is completed, the Department of State Police shall destroy the fingerprint cards and the results of the criminal records check provided to the district and may not retain facsimiles or other material from which a fingerprint can be reproduced, except that the Department of State Police may retain the fingerprint cards and results or create facsimiles for the purpose of providing information under ORS 181A.205.

      (8) The district and the Department of State Police shall permit a subject individual to inspect the individual’s own Oregon and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal offender records after positive fingerprint identification has been made.

      (9)(a) A district, subject to rules adopted by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services under ORS 181A.215, shall determine whether a subject individual is fit to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district or to hold a position or provide services that provide the individual with access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information. If a subject individual is determined to be unfit, then that person shall not be allowed to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district or to hold the position or provide services that provide the individual with access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information.

      (b) In making the fitness determination, the district shall consider:

      (A) The nature of the crime;

      (B) The facts that support the conviction or pending indictment or indicate the making of a false statement;

      (C) The relevancy, if any, of the crime or the false statement to the specific requirements of the subject individual’s present or proposed position or employment; and

      (D) Intervening circumstances relevant to the responsibilities and circumstances of the position or employment, such as:

      (i) The passage of time since the commission of the crime;

      (ii) The age of the person at the time of the crime;

      (iii) The likelihood of a repetition of offenses; and

      (iv) The subsequent commission of another relevant crime and the recommendation of an employer.

      (10) A district shall develop a system that maintains information regarding criminal records checks in order to minimize the administrative burden that criminal records check requirements impose upon subject individuals and providers. Records maintained under this subsection for subject individuals are confidential and may not be disseminated except for the purposes of this section and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the district. Nothing in this subsection permits a district to retain fingerprint cards of subject individuals.

      (11) A district, in consultation with the Department of State Police and affected provider groups, shall adopt resolutions to implement this section and other statutes relating to criminal offender information. The resolutions may include but need not be limited to:

      (a) Specifying which employees are authorized to make criminal record inquiries;

      (b) Identifying applicable categories of subject individuals as specified by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services under ORS 181A.215 who are subject to criminal records checks by the district;

      (c) Identifying applicable information that may be required from a subject individual to permit a criminal records check as specified by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services under ORS 181A.215;

      (d) Specifying which services or qualified entities are subject to this section;

      (e) Specifying when a district, in lieu of conducting a completely new criminal records check, may proceed to make a fitness determination under this section using the information maintained by the district under subsection (10) of this section; and

      (f) Determining when a subject individual may be hired on a probationary basis pending a criminal records check, provided that if there is any indication of criminal behavior by the subject individual, the resolution must require that, if the individual is hired, the individual can be hired only on a probationary basis and must be actively supervised at all times when the individual is in contact with children, the elderly or persons with disabilities.

      (12) Criminal offender information is confidential. The Department of State Police shall adopt rules to restrict dissemination of information received under this section to persons with a demonstrated and legitimate need to know the information. Any district receiving information pursuant to this section is bound by the rules of disclosure adopted by the department.

      (13) If a subject individual refuses to consent to the criminal records check or refuses to be fingerprinted, the district or qualified entity shall deny or terminate the employment of the individual, or revoke or deny any applicable position, authority to provide services or employment.

      (14) A district shall define by resolution the conditions under which subject individuals may participate in training, orientation and work activities pending completion of a criminal records check through the Law Enforcement Data System or nationwide criminal records check. At a minimum, subject individuals shall be actively supervised at all times that they are in contact with children, the elderly and persons with disabilities during such periods of training, orientation and work.

Any such determination and adoption shall be final and conclusive unless it is shown to be arbitrary and capricious.

      (6) If a district adopts an ordinance that increases the rate of an excise tax described in ORS 267.385, the increase shall be adjusted as prescribed in subsection (3) of this section to take into account the withdrawal of an affected area that occurred or occurs at any time after the date the district first imposed any taxes pursuant to ORS 267.385.

      (a) If issued in anticipation of taxes, shall not be issued prior to, and shall mature not later than the end of, the fiscal year in which the taxes are expected to be received;

      (b) If issued in anticipation of other revenues, including grants for operating purposes from the state or federal government, shall not be issued more than one year prior to the time at which the district expects to receive the last installment of the revenues or grants in anticipation of which the obligations are issued, and shall mature not more than one year after the date of issue;

      (c) If issued in anticipation of capital improvement grants from the state or federal government, shall not be issued more than 30 months prior to the time at which the district expects to receive the last installment of the capital improvement grant in anticipation of which the obligations are issued, and shall mature no later than 30 months after the date of issue or six months after the time at which the district expects to receive the last installment of the capital improvement grant in anticipation of which the obligations are issued, whichever is earlier;

      (d) If issued in anticipation of taxes or revenues other than grants from the state or federal government, shall not be issued in an amount greater than 80 percent of the amount of taxes or such other revenues budgeted to be received by the district and in anticipation of which such obligations are issued; and

A district may issue and sell as part of a single offering obligations in anticipation of two or more grants from the state or federal government, in which event the obligations constituting a part of the offering shall be issued as separate series with one series corresponding to each grant in anticipation of which the obligations are issued. A district may only pledge as primary security for a series of obligations constituting part of a single offering the grant in anticipation of which such series is issued. For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, each series of obligations constituting part of a single offering shall be a separate issue of obligations.

      (5) When the taxes or other revenues, including grants from the state or federal government, in anticipation of which the obligations authorized by this section are issued are not received by the district at such time or in such amounts as will enable the district to pay the obligations at maturity, the district shall, to the extent available, first apply to the payment of the obligations the taxes or other revenues in anticipation of which such obligations were issued, and the district may pay the balance owing under such obligations out of any other taxes or revenues available for such purpose.

The lien of any pledge made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall be valid and binding against all persons having claims of any kind against the district whether in tort, contract or otherwise, irrespective of whether such persons have notice thereof.

      (9) The district shall deposit, when received, a portion of the taxes or other revenues in anticipation of which the obligations authorized by this section are issued in a separate account. Deposits to the account shall be made according to a schedule which requires that not less than 100 percent of such taxes or other revenues received by the district after the estimated date of the district’s maximum cumulative cash flow deficit be placed in the account until sufficient amounts are in the account to pay principal and interest due on the obligations at maturity. The schedule shall be established by the district in its proceedings to issue the obligations. Moneys in the account shall be used only to pay principal and interest on the obligations, and may be pledged by the district for such purpose. [1983 c.323 §4; 1985 c.433 §1; 2007 c.783 §85]

      267.620 Power to levy taxes. (1) A district may levy annually an ad valorem tax on all taxable property within its boundaries not to exceed in any one year one-half percent (0.005) of the real market value of all taxable property within the boundaries of such district, computed in accordance with ORS 308.207. The district may also annually assess, levy and collect a special tax upon all such property in an amount sufficient to pay the yearly interest on bonds previously issued by the district and then outstanding, together with any portion of the principal of such bonds maturing within the year. The special tax shall be applied only in payment of the interest and principal of bonds issued by the corporation, but the corporation may apply any funds it may have toward the payment of principal and interest of any such bonds.

      (2) Such taxes shall be levied in each year and returned to the county officer whose duty it is to extend the tax levy by the time required by law for city taxes to be levied and returned. All taxes levied by the district shall become payable at the same time and be collected by the same officer who collects county taxes and shall be turned over to the district according to law. The county officer whose duty it is to extend the county levy shall extend the levy of the district in the same manner as city taxes are extended. Property shall be subject to sale for nonpayment of taxes levied by the corporation in like manner and with like effect as in the case of county and state taxes.

      (3) In taxation a district may classify property on the basis of services received from the district and prescribe different tax rates for the different classes of property. [1974 c.9 §12; 1991 c.459 §366]

 

      267.622 Filing boundary change with county assessor and Department of Revenue. For purposes of ad valorem taxation, a boundary change must be filed in final approved form with the county assessor and the Department of Revenue as provided in ORS 308.225. [2001 c.138 §13]

 

      267.630 Issuance and sale of bonds. (1) For the purpose of performing any service that the district has power to perform, the district, when authorized at any properly called election held for such purpose, shall have the power to borrow money by the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds. Such bonds shall never exceed in the aggregate 10 percent of the real market value of all taxable property within the district computed in accordance with ORS 308.207. The bonds shall be so conditioned that the district shall promise and agree therein to pay the bearer at a place named therein payable semiannually in accordance with the tenor and terms of the interest coupons attached. The bonds shall mature serially not to exceed 30 years from the date of issue.

      (2) For the purpose of performing any of the powers conferred by ORS 267.510 to 267.650 a district, when authorized at any properly called election held for such purpose, shall have the power to borrow money by the issuance and sale also of revenue bonds and to pledge as security therefor, all or any part of the unobligated net income or revenue of the district. The revenue bonds shall be issued in the same manner and form as are general obligation bonds of the district but they shall be payable both as to principal and interest from revenues only. The revenue bonds shall not be subject to the percentage limitation applicable to general obligation bonds and shall not be a lien on any of the taxable property within the corporate limits of the district and shall be payable solely from such part of revenues of the corporation as remains after the payment of obligations having a priority and of all expenses of operation and maintenance of the corporation. All revenue bonds shall contain a provision that both the principal and interest are payable solely from the operating revenues of the district remaining after paying such obligations and expenses.

      (3) All general obligation bonds and revenue bonds shall be issued as prescribed in ORS chapter 287A. [1974 c.9 §13; 1983 c.347 §20; 1991 c.459 §367; 2007 c.783 §86]

 

      267.640 Refunding bonds. Refunding bonds of the same character and tenor as those replaced thereby may be issued pursuant to a resolution adopted by the district governing body without submitting to the electors the question of authorizing the issuance of the bonds. [1974 c.9 §14]
