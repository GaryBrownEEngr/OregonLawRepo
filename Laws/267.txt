      (3) “Mass transit system” or “transit system” means the property, equipment and improvements of whatever nature owned, used, constructed, maintained, controlled or operated to provide mass transportation for passengers or to provide for the movement of people, including park-and-ride stations, transfer stations, parking lots, malls and skyways, provided that nothing contained herein shall limit the power of a city to exercise its general powers over or provide such stations, lots, malls or skyways.

      (4) “Metropolitan statistical area” means an area designated by the United States Office of Management and Budget as a metropolitan statistical area. [1969 c.643 §1; 1973 c.116 §1; 2009 c.11 §26]

      (2) Subject to restrictions in the Oregon Constitution, any of the methods of financing authorized under ORS 267.300 may, in the discretion of the board, be imposed in the service area rather than in the entire district. [1969 c.643 §24]

 

      267.207 Change of district boundaries; elector approval; withdrawal of service from area; territorial jurisdiction of district; boundary commission exemption. (1) The board of directors of a mass transit district may alter the territorial boundaries of the district by a nonemergency ordinance adopted at any regular meeting.

      (3)(a) The board of directors of a mass transit district, as a result of the continuing comprehensive transportation planning process required by the Federal Transit Administration, shall determine annually the territory in the district within which the transit system of the district will operate. When the board determines during such planning process for any fiscal year that it will not provide transit service during that fiscal year to an area presently within the district, the board shall by ordinance withdraw from that area on the date specified in the ordinance, and that area shall no longer be part of the district. The board shall by ordinance set forth the criteria to be used in making the determinations described in this subsection.

      (3) For the purposes of ORS 308.225 only, the effective date of an alteration of district boundaries shall be the date on which the board adopts the ordinance altering the boundaries or, if such an ordinance is initiated or referred, the date on which the ordinance is approved by the electors as provided in ORS 267.207.

      (4) For purposes of ad valorem taxation, a boundary change must be filed in final approved form with the county assessor and the Department of Revenue as provided in ORS 308.225. [1985 c.808 §77; 1987 c.799 §9; 1989 c.923 §26; 1995 c.712 §100; 2001 c.138 §11]

(1) A district shall, within a reasonable time after formation, prepare a broad, general plan for a mass transit system for the district. The plan shall be prepared in cooperation with the Department of Transportation and cities and counties located within and adjacent to the district.

      (2) The plan shall show existing and proposed transit systems of the district and of other public and private agencies relating to mass transit. It shall demonstrate a basis for the coordination and planning of future construction, improvement and equipment acquisition of the district, governmental agencies and private interests to assure maximum efficiency and use of mass transit in the district. The plans shall be based on the needs of the district and take into consideration the plans and programs, if any, developed by the Department of Transportation and cities and counties located within the district. The district may have access to all information, statistics, plans and data in the possession of or available to any state agency or public corporation which is pertinent to the preparation of the plan and may reimburse the agency or corporation for any expense incurred in cooperating with the board.

      (3) The district board shall revise the plan as necessary for the proper control, utilization, development and improvement of the district transit system. [1969 c.643 §20; 1973 c.116 §4]

 

      267.215 [1969 c.643 §§9,21; repealed by 1975 c.771 §33]

 

      267.218 Feasibility reports and public bidding not required for construction and improvement projects costing less than $50,000.

      (2) For the purpose of providing a mass transit system, a district may commence a condemnation proceeding to acquire land or an interest in land for right of way for the system over any public right of way already located, condemned or occupied or that may be located, condemned or occupied by some other public agency for the purpose of travel by the public. The proceeding shall be conducted as provided by the laws of this state for the condemnation of land or an interest in land for right of way for highway purposes. At the time of rendering judgment for compensation or damages, the court shall enter a judgment authorizing the district to occupy and use the right of way, if necessary, in common with the public agency already occupying or owning the right of way, and defining the terms and conditions upon which the right of way shall be so occupied and used in common. [1969 c.643 §12; 2003 c.576 §410; 2003 c.802 §93]

 

      267.227 Relationship with Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority. A mass transit district may enter into contracts, leases, subleases and agreements with the Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority. The obligation of a district to pay rentals to the Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority shall not be considered to be the incurring of bonded indebtedness by a district. A district shall reimburse the Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority for all expenses incurred by the authority in connection with any application by such district for financial assistance under the Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Act. [1977 c.662 §18]

      (2) ORS 824.200 to 824.256 apply to the transit system operated by a district except for control and regulation of any crossing at which the light rail transit vehicles of a district’s transit system cross a highway at separated grades or any grade crossing at which the light rail transit vehicles operate within and parallel to the right of way of a highway and where all conflicting vehicle movements are controlled by standard highway traffic devices. However, upon written request from the district and the public authority with jurisdiction over the highway at such a grade crossing, the department shall adjudicate any dispute that arises between the district and the public authority with regard to the grade crossing. [1969 c.643 §11; 1973 c.116 §5; 1977 c.420 §1; 1985 c.678 §7; 1995 c.733 §92; 2001 c.522 §10]

 

      267.235 Protection of employees’ rights when an operating transportation system is acquired.

      (4) Assurance of employment to persons employed by the mass transportation system acquired and priority of reemployment to persons previously employed. [1969 c.643 §10]

 

      267.237 Criminal records check; authority of district to require fingerprints; fitness determinations; rules regarding dissemination. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “District” means a mass transit district organized under ORS 267.010 to 267.394 or a transportation district organized under ORS 267.510 to 267.650.

      (b) “Qualified entity” means an individual or business or organization, whether public, private, for-profit, nonprofit or voluntary, that, under contract with a district, provides individuals to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district.

      (c) “Subject individual” means a person subject to a criminal records check as specified by resolution of a mass transit district or a transportation district.

      (2) A mass transit district or a transportation district shall request the Department of State Police to conduct criminal records checks of subject individuals if the checks are required in order to protect vulnerable Oregonians:

      (a) To implement a federal or state statute, executive order or rule that expressly refers to criminal conduct and contains requirements or exclusions expressly based on such conduct;

      (b) For district employment purposes when hiring individuals to operate motor vehicles of the district; or

      (c) For the purposes of employment decisions made by a district for qualified entities that, under contracts with the district, employ individuals to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district.

      (3) A mass transit district that has a population of more than 500,000 may request the Department of State Police to conduct a criminal records check of a subject individual who is:

      (a) Seeking employment by the district in a position that provides the individual with access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information; or

      (b) Seeking to provide services to the district that will result in the individual’s having access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information.

      (4) In order to determine the suitability of the subject individual, a district shall require the subject individual to furnish to the district a full set of fingerprints to enable a criminal records check to be conducted. The district shall submit the completed fingerprint cards to the Department of State Police along with the applicable Oregon and Federal Bureau of Investigation processing fees. If no disqualifying record is identified at the state level, the Department of State Police shall forward the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal records check.

      (5) The Federal Bureau of Investigation shall either return or destroy the fingerprint cards used to conduct the criminal records check and shall not keep any record of the fingerprints, except that the Federal Bureau of Investigation may retain the fingerprint cards and records of the fingerprints for purposes described in ORS 181A.205. However, if the federal bureau policy authorizing return or destruction of the fingerprint cards is changed, a district shall cease to cause the cards to be sent to the federal bureau but shall continue to process the information through other available resources.

      (6) If the Federal Bureau of Investigation returns the fingerprint cards to the Department of State Police, the Department of State Police shall destroy the fingerprint cards and may not retain facsimiles or other material from which a fingerprint can be reproduced, except that the Department of State Police may retain the fingerprint cards or create facsimiles for the purpose of providing information under ORS 181A.205.

      (7) If only a state criminal records check is conducted, after the criminal records check is completed, the Department of State Police shall destroy the fingerprint cards and the results of the criminal records check provided to the district and may not retain facsimiles or other material from which a fingerprint can be reproduced, except that the Department of State Police may retain the fingerprint cards and results or create facsimiles for the purpose of providing information under ORS 181A.205.

      (8) The district and the Department of State Police shall permit a subject individual to inspect the individual’s own Oregon and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal offender records after positive fingerprint identification has been made.

      (9)(a) A district, subject to rules adopted by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services under ORS 181A.215, shall determine whether a subject individual is fit to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district or to hold a position or provide services that provide the individual with access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information. If a subject individual is determined to be unfit, then that person shall not be allowed to operate motor vehicles for the transportation of passengers in the public transportation system of the district or to hold the position or provide services that provide the individual with access to critical infrastructure or security sensitive facilities or information.

      (b) In making the fitness determination, the district shall consider:

      (A) The nature of the crime;

      (B) The facts that support the conviction or pending indictment or indicate the making of a false statement;

      (C) The relevancy, if any, of the crime or the false statement to the specific requirements of the subject individual’s present or proposed position or employment; and

      (D) Intervening circumstances relevant to the responsibilities and circumstances of the position or employment, such as:

      (i) The passage of time since the commission of the crime;

      (ii) The age of the person at the time of the crime;

      (iii) The likelihood of a repetition of offenses; and

      (iv) The subsequent commission of another relevant crime and the recommendation of an employer.

      (10) A district shall develop a system that maintains information regarding criminal records checks in order to minimize the administrative burden that criminal records check requirements impose upon subject individuals and providers. Records maintained under this subsection for subject individuals are confidential and may not be disseminated except for the purposes of this section and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the district. Nothing in this subsection permits a district to retain fingerprint cards of subject individuals.

      (11) A district, in consultation with the Department of State Police and affected provider groups, shall adopt resolutions to implement this section and other statutes relating to criminal offender information. The resolutions may include but need not be limited to:

      (a) Specifying which employees are authorized to make criminal record inquiries;

      (b) Identifying applicable categories of subject individuals as specified by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services under ORS 181A.215 who are subject to criminal records checks by the district;

      (c) Identifying applicable information that may be required from a subject individual to permit a criminal records check as specified by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services under ORS 181A.215;

      (d) Specifying which services or qualified entities are subject to this section;

      (e) Specifying when a district, in lieu of conducting a completely new criminal records check, may proceed to make a fitness determination under this section using the information maintained by the district under subsection (10) of this section; and

      (f) Determining when a subject individual may be hired on a probationary basis pending a criminal records check, provided that if there is any indication of criminal behavior by the subject individual, the resolution must require that, if the individual is hired, the individual can be hired only on a probationary basis and must be actively supervised at all times when the individual is in contact with children, the elderly or persons with disabilities.

      (12) Criminal offender information is confidential. The Department of State Police shall adopt rules to restrict dissemination of information received under this section to persons with a demonstrated and legitimate need to know the information. Any district receiving information pursuant to this section is bound by the rules of disclosure adopted by the department.

      (13) If a subject individual refuses to consent to the criminal records check or refuses to be fingerprinted, the district or qualified entity shall deny or terminate the employment of the individual, or revoke or deny any applicable position, authority to provide services or employment.

      (14) A district shall define by resolution the conditions under which subject individuals may participate in training, orientation and work activities pending completion of a criminal records check through the Law Enforcement Data System or nationwide criminal records check. At a minimum, subject individuals shall be actively supervised at all times that they are in contact with children, the elderly and persons with disabilities during such periods of training, orientation and work. Subject individuals may continue probationary employment while awaiting the nationwide criminal records check as long as the individual’s criminal records check through the Law Enforcement Data System did not result in disqualification and there are no other indications of criminal behavior.

      (15) If a district or a qualified entity requires a criminal records check of employees or other persons, the application forms of the district or qualified entity must contain a notice that employment is subject to fingerprinting and a criminal records check as required by this section.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 267.207 (3)(b), the district board shall approve withdrawal if:

      (5) Any decision of the district board relating to withdrawal of an affected area under ORS 267.250 to 267.263 may be reviewed by a circuit court under ORS 34.010 to 34.100. [1987 c.799 §5]

 

      267.260 Withdrawal ordinance; effective date; adjustment in district tax rate as result of withdrawal. (1) As used in this section, “withdrawal date” means the effective date of an ordinance approving withdrawal of an affected area under ORS 267.250 to 267.263.

      (2) An ordinance approving the withdrawal of an affected area under ORS 267.250 to 267.263 shall take effect on the first day of January next following the date which is 30 days after the adoption of the ordinance.

      (3) Commencing immediately upon the withdrawal date and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the rate of each tax imposed by the district shall automatically be increased to a rate equal to the rate determined by dividing the rate at which such tax was levied immediately prior to the withdrawal date by a fraction, not more than one, which is equal to the total revenue derived from such tax by the district for the calendar year preceding the year in which the withdrawal ordinance is adopted attributable to the area of the district other than the withdrawn affected area divided by the total revenue derived from such tax by the district for the same period.

      (4) If the tax rates required under subsection (3) of this section do not produce tax revenues sufficient to enable the district to make the annual or semiannual payments, when due, and otherwise satisfy the requirements of the bonded or other indebtedness of the district incurred prior to the withdrawal, the district may increase the rate of each tax to a rate that produces revenues sufficient to enable the district to make the annual or semiannual payments, when due, and otherwise satisfy the requirements of such indebtedness.

      (5) The district board shall determine rates in accordance with the formula prescribed by subsection (3) of this section and adopt the rates as part of the ordinance approving the withdrawal of the affected area. Any such determination and adoption shall be final and conclusive unless it is shown to be arbitrary and capricious.

      (6) If a district adopts an ordinance that increases the rate of an excise tax described in ORS 267.385, the increase shall be adjusted as prescribed in subsection (3) of this section to take into account the withdrawal of an affected area that occurred or occurs at any time after the date the district first imposed any taxes pursuant to ORS 267.385. [1987 c.799 §6; 2003 c.739 §10]

 

      267.263 Withdrawal of territory not subject to boundary commission review. The alteration of the boundaries of a district under ORS 267.250 to 267.263 is not subject to the jurisdiction or review of a local government boundary commission. [1987 c.799 §7; 2007 c.239 §14]

 

      267.265 Use of moneys derived from withdrawal of territory from district. The savings derived from the cessation of service under an ordinance adopted under ORS 267.257 shall be used to improve service in the remaining portions of the district. Nothing in this section shall prevent the district from exercising its normal budgetary authority to adjust service levels. [1987 c.799 §8]

 

      Note: 267.265 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 267 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

However, for an indebtedness to the federal government or this state, the district may issue one or more bonds of the denominations agreed upon. Bonds shall bear interest at a rate, payable semiannually, as the board shall determine. The bonds shall be so conditioned that the district shall promise and agree therein to pay to the bearer at a place named therein, the principal sum, with interest at the rate named therein, payable semiannually, in accordance with the tenor and terms of the interest coupons attached.

      (4) At any time an employer or individual fails to remit the amount of taxes when due under an ordinance of the district board imposing a tax under this section, the Department of Revenue may enforce collection by the issuance of a distraint warrant for the collection of the delinquent amount and all penalties, interest and collection charges accrued thereon. Such warrant shall be issued and may be enforced in the same manner and have the same force and effect as prescribed with respect to warrants for the collection of delinquent state income taxes.

      (5) Any ordinance adopted under subsection (1) of this section shall require an individual having net earnings from self-employment from activity both within and without the district taxable by the State of Oregon to allocate and apportion such net earnings to the district in the manner required for allocation and apportionment of income under ORS 314.280 and 314.605 to 314.675.

      (5) When the taxes or other revenues, including grants from the state or federal government, in anticipation of which the obligations authorized by this section are issued are not received by the district at such time or in such amounts as will enable the district to pay the obligations at maturity, the district shall, to the extent available, first apply to the payment of the obligations the taxes or other revenues in anticipation of which such obligations were issued, and the district may pay the balance owing under such obligations out of any other taxes or revenues available for such purpose.

      (9) The district shall deposit, when received, a portion of the taxes or other revenues in anticipation of which the obligations authorized by this section are issued in a separate account. Deposits to the account shall be made according to a schedule which requires that not less than 100 percent of such taxes or other revenues received by the district after the estimated date of the district’s maximum cumulative cash flow deficit be placed in the account until sufficient amounts are in the account to pay principal and interest due on the obligations at maturity.

      267.620 Power to levy taxes. (1) A district may levy annually an ad valorem tax on all taxable property within its boundaries not to exceed in any one year one-half percent (0.005) of the real market value of all taxable property within the boundaries of such district, computed in accordance with ORS 308.207. The district may also annually assess, levy and collect a special tax upon all such property in an amount sufficient to pay the yearly interest on bonds previously issued by the district and then outstanding, together with any portion of the principal of such bonds maturing within the year. The special tax shall be applied only in payment of the interest and principal of bonds issued by the corporation, but the corporation may apply any funds it may have toward the payment of principal and interest of any such bonds.

      (2) Such taxes shall be levied in each year and returned to the county officer whose duty it is to extend the tax levy by the time required by law for city taxes to be levied and returned. All taxes levied by the district shall become payable at the same time and be collected by the same officer who collects county taxes and shall be turned over to the district according to law. The county officer whose duty it is to extend the county levy shall extend the levy of the district in the same manner as city taxes are extended. Property shall be subject to sale for nonpayment of taxes levied by the corporation in like manner and with like effect as in the case of county and state taxes.

      (3) In taxation a district may classify property on the basis of services received from the district and prescribe different tax rates for the different classes of property. [1974 c.9 §12; 1991 c.459 §366]

 

      267.622 Filing boundary change with county assessor and Department of Revenue. For purposes of ad valorem taxation, a boundary change must be filed in final approved form with the county assessor and the Department of Revenue as provided in ORS 308.225. [2001 c.138 §13]

 

      267.630 Issuance and sale of bonds. (1) For the purpose of performing any service that the district has power to perform, the district, when authorized at any properly called election held for such purpose, shall have the power to borrow money by the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds. Such bonds shall never exceed in the aggregate 10 percent of the real market value of all taxable property within the district computed in accordance with ORS 308.207. The bonds shall be so conditioned that the district shall promise and agree therein to pay the bearer at a place named therein payable semiannually in accordance with the tenor and terms of the interest coupons attached. The bonds shall mature serially not to exceed 30 years from the date of issue.

      (2) For the purpose of performing any of the powers conferred by ORS 267.510 to 267.650 a district, when authorized at any properly called election held for such purpose, shall have the power to borrow money by the issuance and sale also of revenue bonds and to pledge as security therefor, all or any part of the unobligated net income or revenue of the district. The revenue bonds shall be issued in the same manner and form as are general obligation bonds of the district but they shall be payable both as to principal and interest from revenues only. The revenue bonds shall not be subject to the percentage limitation applicable to general obligation bonds and shall not be a lien on any of the taxable property within the corporate limits of the district and shall be payable solely from such part of revenues of the corporation as remains after the payment of obligations having a priority and of all expenses of operation and maintenance of the corporation. All revenue bonds shall contain a provision that both the principal and interest are payable solely from the operating revenues of the district remaining after paying such obligations and expenses.

      (3) All general obligation bonds and revenue bonds shall be issued as prescribed in ORS chapter 287A. [1974 c.9 §13; 1983 c.347 §20; 1991 c.459 §367; 2007 c.783 §86]

 

      267.640 Refunding bonds. Refunding bonds of the same character and tenor as those replaced thereby may be issued pursuant to a resolution adopted by the district governing body without submitting to the electors the question of authorizing the issuance of the bonds. [1974 c.9 §14]
