      (3) A district may enter into a credit enhancement agreement with a credit enhancement provider setting forth the respective rights, duties and obligations of the district and the credit enhancement provider under or with respect to such credit enhancement device, which agreement may contain such terms, covenants and conditions as shall be approved by the governing body of the district and which are not inconsistent with the provisions of ORS 268.600 to 268.660.

      (4) The obligations of the district under or with respect to any credit enhancement device or credit enhancement agreement shall not in any manner or to any extent be general obligations of the district nor a charge upon any other revenues or property of the district not specifically pledged thereto.

      (5) In the ordinance authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or bond anticipation notes under ORS 268.600 to 268.660, the governing body may pledge as security for the payment or performance of the district’s obligations under or with respect to the related credit enhancement device or credit enhancement agreement all or any portion of the district’s revenues, regardless of the source from which derived, then existing or which thereafter come into existence. In addition, in such ordinance the governing body may pledge or mortgage as security for the payment or performance of its obligations under or with respect to such credit enhancement device or credit enhancement agreement any property of the district. Any such pledge or mortgage of revenues or other property may be on such terms as the governing body shall determine, including but not limited to a pledge or mortgage on a parity basis with the pledge or mortgage of such revenues or other property as security for revenue bonds or bond anticipation notes issued under ORS 268.600 to 268.660 or on a subordinated basis. In the ordinance creating such pledge or mortgage, the district may reserve the right to pledge or mortgage from time to time on a parity or subordinated basis all or any part of such pledged or mortgaged revenues or other property as security for the payment or performance of the district’s obligations under or with respect to any one or more series of revenue bonds or bond anticipation notes or credit enhancement device or credit enhancement agreement thereafter issued, given, provided or entered into by the district. [1987 c.623 §7]

      268.600 Issuance of revenue bonds; use of proceeds; status of bonds. For the purpose of carrying into effect all or any of the powers granted to metropolitan service districts, a district may from time to time issue and sell revenue bonds without the necessity of the electors of a district authorizing the bonds. Proceeds from the sale of such bonds may be used to cover the costs incurred in issuing such bonds, and preliminary work incident to carrying out such purposes and powers, including but not limited to planning, engineering, inspection, accounting, fiscal, legal and trustee expenses, the costs of issuance of bonds, engraving, printing, advertising and other similar expenses, and to pay interest on the outstanding bonds issued for any project during the period of actual construction and for such period thereafter as a district may determine, and to establish, maintain or increase any reserves for debt service on the bonds. Such revenue bonds shall not in any manner or to any extent be a general obligation of a district nor a charge upon any other revenues or property of a district not specifically pledged thereto. A district may issue revenue bonds pursuant to ORS 268.600 to 268.660 for the purpose of financing landfills, transfer facilities, resource recovery facilities and other improvements, facilities and equipment necessary or desirable for the solid and liquid waste disposal system of the district regardless of whether such improvements, facilities or equipment are to be owned by the district or any other public or private agency or person and regardless of whether such improvements, facilities or equipment are to be located within or without the district. In connection with the issuance of revenue bonds to finance any such improvements, facilities or equipment which are to be owned by any other public or private agency or person, the district shall enter into a lease-purchase, installment sale or loan agreement with such public or private agency or person providing for lease-purchase, installment sale or loan payments which, together with other revenues pledged for the payment of such revenue bonds as provided in ORS 268.610, shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such revenue bonds. [1977 c.95 §9; 1987 c.623 §1]

 

      268.610 Ordinance authorizing revenue bonds; content; special trust funds; trustees; enforcement. (1) Revenue bonds issued under ORS 268.600 to 268.660 shall be authorized at a meeting by ordinance of the governing body. The ordinance may provide for the creation of special trust funds and may authorize the appointment of a trustee to administer the funds, and may obligate a district to set aside and pay into a special trust fund for the purpose of securing revenue bonds, all or any portion of its revenues, regardless of the source from which derived, then existing or which thereafter come into existence. The governing body may, in addition thereto, pledge or mortgage for the payment of the principal of and interest on and premium, if any, of any issue of such bonds any property of a district. Notice that action upon the bond ordinance will be taken at the designated meeting of the governing body, shall be given for a period of not less than two consecutive weeks, prior to such meeting, by publication thereof once each week in a newspaper of general circulation, published within the corporate boundaries of the district or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting such notice for a period of not less than two weeks in three public places in the district.

      (2) The money in a special trust fund created by an ordinance authorizing an issue of revenue bonds shall be used solely for the purposes provided therefor by the ordinance.

      (3) The ordinance may obligate the district, and the district shall have power to fix, levy and collect such rates, rentals, fees and other charges for the use and services of all or any of its facilities, which revenues may be pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on and premium, if any, of the revenue bonds or any of them and if so pledged shall be sufficient to produce revenues, along with other lawfully available funds, adequate to pay the costs of the operation, maintenance and repair of any or all district properties; to pay or provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on, and premium, if any, of such revenue bonds or any of them, including any reserves for such payment; and to produce such additional amount of revenues therefrom as the district may covenant with the holders of such revenue bonds.

      (4) The ordinance may provide that in the event the money in a special trust fund is insufficient to pay the revenue bonds to be paid out of the fund, such revenue bonds shall be payable out of any part or all of other nonpledged revenues of the district. Whenever all bonds and expenses thereof have been paid so that no charge remains upon such special fund, the governing body may, by ordinance, transfer any balance remaining in such fund to its general fund, discharge the trustee, if any, and dissolve the special fund. Any trustee authorized to administer the fund may, subject to approval of the governing body, invest and reinvest moneys in the special fund in any security or securities in which the State of Oregon may by law invest.

      (5) If the governing body fails to set aside and pay revenues into a special trust fund as required by the ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of the bonds secured by the fund, a holder of any of such bonds may bring suit against the district to compel compliance with the provisions of the ordinance in the circuit court of the county in which the district has its principal office.

      (6) In the ordinance authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds under ORS 268.600 to 268.660 and pledging all or any portion of the district’s revenues to the payment of such revenue bonds:

      (a) The district may reserve the right to pledge from time to time on a parity basis all or any part of such pledged revenues as security for any one or more series of revenue bonds thereafter issued by the district, and in the event the right so reserved by the district is exercised all revenue bonds secured by such pledged revenues shall be equally and ratably secured thereby without preference or priority of any kind of any bond or series of bonds secured thereby over any other bond or series of bonds secured thereby; and

      (b) The district may reserve the right to pledge from time to time on a subordinated basis all or any part of such pledged revenues as security for any one or more series of revenue bonds thereafter issued by the district.

      (7) Any pledge of revenues by a district made pursuant to this section or ORS 268.590 shall be valid, binding and fully perfected from and after the date of issuance of the revenue bonds secured thereby and the revenues pledged shall be immediately subject to the lien of such pledge without the physical delivery thereof, the filing of any notice or any further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid, binding and fully perfected against all persons having claims of any kind against the district whether in tort, contract or otherwise, irrespective of whether such persons have notice thereof. [1977 c.95 §10; 1987 c.623 §2]

 

      268.620 Form and content of bonds. The revenue bonds authorized by ORS 268.600 to 268.660 shall be issued as prescribed in ORS chapter 287A. [1977 c.95 §11; 1987 c.623 §3; 1997 c.171 §6; 2007 c.783 §88]

 

      268.630 Borrowing in anticipation of bond sale; bond anticipation notes; content; sale of notes. (1) A district shall have the power, at any time and from time to time after the issuance of bonds under ORS 268.600 to 268.660 have been authorized, to borrow money for the purposes for which such bonds are to be issued in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of the sale of such bonds and within the authorized maximum amount of such bond issue.

      (2) Bond anticipation notes shall be issued for all moneys so borrowed under the provisions of this section. Such notes may be issued for a period not to exceed three years and may be renewed or refunded from time to time for periods of not exceeding three years, but each such note, including renewals, shall mature and be paid not later than the fifth anniversary of the date the original note was issued. Such notes shall be authorized by ordinance of the governing body and shall be in such denomination or denominations, shall bear interest at such rate or rates approved by the governing body, shall be in such form and shall be executed in such manner, all as the governing body shall prescribe. Such notes may be sold at public or private sale in the manner and at such price or prices as the governing body shall determine, provided that if such notes be renewal notes, they may be exchanged for notes then outstanding on such terms as the governing body shall determine. [1977 c.95 §12; 1987 c.623 §4]

 

      268.640 Sale of revenue bonds. The governing body may from time to time sell revenue bonds authorized to be issued and sold pursuant to ORS 268.600 to 268.660 at public or private sale, in the manner and at such price or prices as it shall determine. [1977 c.95 §13]

 

      268.650 Bonds as obligation of a political subdivision. Revenue bonds, including refunding revenue bonds and bond anticipation notes issued under ORS 268.600 to 268.660, shall be considered to be bonds or obligations of a political subdivision of the State of Oregon for the purposes of all laws of the state. [1977 c.95 §14; 1987 c.623 §5]

 

      268.660 Effect of ORS 268.600 to 268.660. ORS 268.600 to 268.660 are additional, alternative and supplemental authority for a district and shall not abrogate any power, right or authority otherwise granted by law to a district. [1977 c.95 §15]

      268.700 [1969 c.700 §29; repealed by 1971 c.727 §203]

 

DISTRICT CHARTER

 

      268.710 Electors of county may adopt, amend, revise or repeal district charter; limitation on certain actions. (1) The electors of any metropolitan service district, by majority vote of such electors voting thereon at any legally called election, may adopt, amend, revise or repeal a charter for the district. The charter, or legislation passed by the district pursuant thereto, shall provide a method whereby the electors of the district, by majority vote of such electors voting thereon at any legally called election, may amend, revise or repeal the charter.

      (2) Provisions of a district charter and district legislation that relate to the amendment, revision or repeal of a district charter are matters of metropolitan concern and shall prevail over conflicting provisions of state law that are first effective after January 1, 1999, unless such law specifically provides otherwise. After January 1, 1997, no person may commence or maintain an action to challenge the validity of a district charter existing and effective on January 1, 1997, on the basis of inconsistency or conflict between the district charter and ORS 268.030, 268.300, 268.310, 268.317, 268.318, 268.320, 268.330, 268.340, 268.345, 268.357, 268.360, 268.370, 268.500, 268.505, 268.507, 268.520, 268.525, 268.530, 268.590, 268.600 to 268.660 and 268.990. To the extent that provisions of a district charter limit the exercise of a power granted by the statutes listed in this subsection, the provisions of the district charter shall be given full force and effect. In addition to any authority expressly granted to a metropolitan service district by the Legislative Assembly, a district charter is an independent grant of authority by the affected electorate pursuant to section 1 (5), Article IV and section 2, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (3) A charter of a metropolitan service district shall prescribe the organization of the district government and shall provide directly, or by its authority, for the number, election or appointment, qualifications, tenure, compensation, powers and duties of such officers as the district considers necessary. Such officers shall among them exercise all the powers and perform all the duties, as granted to, imposed upon or distributed among district officers by the Constitution or laws of this state, by the district charter or by its authority.

      (4) Any reference to the executive officer of a metropolitan service district in statutes of this state relating to elections or government ethics shall be construed to include any district officer who serves in an elective office and performs executive functions. Any reference in a district charter to a district court judge may be construed as referring to a judge of the circuit court.

      (5) As used in this section, “legally called election” means an election held on the same date as a primary election or general election held throughout this state.

      (6) Consistent with ORS 197.013, the land use planning authority granted to a district under ORS chapter 268 is a matter of statewide concern. Provisions of a district charter and implementing ordinances adopted and effective on January 1, 1997, that establish procedural requirements relating to the exercise of land use planning authority of the district, including but not limited to requirements for local government advisory committees, are supplementary to ORS 268.380, 268.385, 268.390 and ORS chapter 197. After January 1, 1997, no person may commence or maintain an action to challenge the validity of such district charter provisions or implementing ordinances on the basis of inconsistency or conflict with the procedural requirements of ORS 268.380, 268.385 or 268.390 or the procedural requirements of ORS chapter 197 existing on January 1, 1997.

      (7) If a district charter is repealed, the provisions of the charter providing for district officers, their powers and duties and the election of such officers shall continue in effect until the Legislative Assembly provides by law for the restructuring or dissolution of the district. [1991 c.72 §1; 1995 c.712 §102; 1997 c.833 §19]

 

      Note: 268.710 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 268 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
