      (1) “Department” means the Oregon Department of Administrative Services.

      (2) “Improvements” means any and all structures on or attachments to state-owned real property, but excluding public improvements as defined in ORS 279A.010.

      (3) “Real property” means all real property together with any and all improvements thereon.

      (8) “Urban unincorporated community” has the meaning given that term in ORS 197.015. [1991 c.816 §3; 1993 c.500 §11; 1997 c.685 §5; 1999 c.314 §79; 2003 c.794 §224; 2015 c.572 §2]

 

      270.010 Policy. (1) It shall be the policy of the State of Oregon to hold in state ownership no more state-owned real property than is necessary to conduct official business, with allowance for reasonably foreseeable demands of the future. The acquisition, sale, exchange, lease, retention and management of state-owned real property shall be subject to a statewide plan that will encourage the transfer through sale or lease of state-owned real property already in state ownership to private ownership and use so as to minimize state investment in such land and place such land on the tax rolls.

      (2) In transferring state-owned real property through sale or lease, to the extent consistent with applicable trust responsibilities, the state policy shall be to give right of first refusal to purchase in the following order:

      (a) To the lessee of the land.

      (b) Where the intended activity or use is similar to that of adjacent properties within the region:

      (A) To adjacent landowners.

      (B) To residents within the region.

      (C) To persons outside the region. [1991 c.816 §2; 1995 c.589 §1]

      (2) In carrying out the provisions of ORS 184.634, 270.005 to 270.015, 270.100 to 270.190, 273.416, 273.426 to 273.436 and 273.551, the state shall act by and through its duly constituted board, commission or agency. The state by statute or through its respective board, commission or agency may provide rules necessary in carrying out the provisions of ORS 184.634, 270.005 to 270.015, 270.100 to 270.190, 273.416, 273.426 to 273.436 and 273.551.

The State of Oregon may enter into agreements with the United States or any agency thereof, relative to the conditions for and places where electrical and other transmission lines may be placed and maintained across any property owned or controlled by the state, which agreements may be in perpetuity or for such length of time as may be specified. However, no such agreement shall affect the constitutional rights of any owners of private property who do not join therein. [Formerly 273.461]

 

TRANSFER PROCEDURES

 

      270.100 Notice to department before sale of real property; rules; procedures; restrictions on final disposition. (1)(a) Before offering for sale any real property or equitable interest in real property that the state owns, the state agency acting for the state in the sales transaction shall report to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that the state agency intends to sell or transfer the real property or the equitable interest. The department, or an agency the department specifically designates, shall notify other state agencies authorized to own real property of the intended sale or transfer to determine whether acquiring the real property or interest in the real property would be advantageous to another state agency.

      (b)(A) The department shall give the first opportunity after other state agencies to acquire, purchase, exchange or lease real property or an interest in real property that the State of Oregon disposes of or sells to:

      (i) The following entities, on the condition that the entities will develop housing on the real property that will be occupied by families and individuals with an income no greater than 80 percent of the median family income for the county in which the real property is located:

      (I) Nonprofit organizations; and

      (II) Indian tribes, as defined in ORS 97.740; and

      (ii) Political subdivisions, as defined in ORS 271.005.

      (B) The state agency responsible for selling or transferring the property or the equitable interest may require at the time of the sale or transfer that a political subdivision must use state real property or an equitable interest in real property sold or transferred to the political subdivision for a public purpose or benefit, and that the political subdivision may not resell the real property or the equitable interest to a private purchaser.

      (c) If a state agency that intends to sell or transfer real property or an equitable interest in real property has not disposed of the real property or the equitable interest under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, the state agency shall cause the real property to be appraised by one or more competent and experienced appraisers in accordance with rules the department adopts. Except as provided in ORS 273.825, if the property has an appraised value exceeding $5,000, the property or an equitable interest in the property may not be sold to any private person except after notice calling for such proposals as set forth in ORS 270.130.

      (d) The department shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section.

      (2) Before a state agency acquires any real property or interest in real property, except for highway right of way that the Department of Transportation acquires, park properties that the State Parks and Recreation Department acquires and property within the approved projected campus boundaries for public universities listed in ORS 352.002, the state agency shall report to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that the state agency intends to acquire the real property or the interest in real property. The department shall notify other state agencies that own land that the state agency intends to acquire real property or an interest in real property to determine whether another state agency desires to sell or transfer property that would meet the needs of the acquiring agency. In accordance with rules the Oregon Department of Administrative Services adopts, if no other state agency desires to sell or transfer property that would meet the needs of the agency that intends to acquire real property or an interest in real property, the agency may acquire the real property or interest in real property, consistent with applicable provisions of law.

      (3) Before any terminal disposition of real property or an interest in real property, the state agency acting for the state in the transaction must secure approval of the transaction from the Oregon Department of Administrative Services.

      (4) Subsection (3) of this section does not apply to terminal disposition of the following real property:

      (a) Property that the State Department of Fish and Wildlife controls;

      (f) Property that the legislative branch of state government controls;

      (g) Property that the judicial branch of state government controls; and

      (h) Property that the State Parks and Recreation Department controls.

      (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, prior approval by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services is required for the terminal disposition of public land for less than the fair market value of the public land.

      (6) The provisions of ORS 184.634, 270.005 to 270.015, 270.100 to 270.190, 273.416, 273.426 to 273.436, 273.551 and 308A.709 (1)(a) to (d) do not apply to:

      270.105 Procedures before terminal disposition of real property. Before a state agency terminally disposes of real property to other than another state agency, the disposing agency shall:

      (1) If the value of the real property is $100,000 or less, consider all the values of the property to the people of this state, including values for fish and wildlife habitat and public access to other real property; or

      (2) If the value of the real property is greater than $100,000, invite public comment on and consider all the values of the property to the people of this state, including values for fish and wildlife habitat and public access to other property. [1991 c.816 §21]

 

      270.110 Disposition of property not needed for public use; lease approval by department. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section:

Except where the state is exchanging real property, the consideration for the transfer or lease may be cash or real property, or both.

      (b) The state or any agency thereof shall offer for sale any real property in its possession or control if the property:

      (C) Is not needed for public use within five years of the last date the property was used for public purposes.

      (c) Paragraph (b) of this subsection does not apply to the Department of Transportation or to the Department of State Lands.

      (d) Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the state to relinquish title to property pursuant to ORS 458.445.

      (2) If the ownership, right or title of the state to any real property set apart by deed, will or otherwise for a burial ground or cemetery, or for the purpose of interring the remains of deceased persons, is limited or qualified or the use of such real property is restricted, whether by dedication or otherwise, the state or its agency may, after first declaring by resolution that such real property is not needed for public use, or that the sale, exchange, conveyance or lease thereof will further the public interest, file a complaint in the circuit court for the county in which such real property is located against all persons claiming any right, title or interest in such real property, whether the interest be contingent, conditional or otherwise, for authority to sell, exchange, convey or lease all or any part of such real property. The resolution is prima facie evidence that such real property is not needed for public use, or that the sale, exchange, conveyance or lease will further the public interest.

Neither costs nor disbursements may be recovered against any defendant.

      (3) The authority to lease property granted by this section includes authority to lease property not owned or controlled by the state at the time of entering into the lease. Such lease shall be conditioned upon the subsequent acquisition of the interest covered by the lease.
