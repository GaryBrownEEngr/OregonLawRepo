VACATION

 

      271.080 Vacation in incorporated cities; petition; consent of property owners. (1) Whenever any person interested in any real property in an incorporated city in this state desires to vacate all or part of any street, avenue, boulevard, alley, plat, public square or other public place, such person may file a petition therefor setting forth a description of the ground proposed to be vacated, the purpose for which the ground is proposed to be used and the reason for such vacation.

      (2) There shall be appended to such petition, as a part thereof and as a basis for granting the same, the consent of the owners of all abutting property and of not less than two-thirds in area of the real property affected thereby. The real property affected thereby shall be deemed to be the land lying on either side of the street or portion thereof proposed to be vacated and extending laterally to the next street that serves as a parallel street, but in any case not to exceed 200 feet, and the land for a like lateral distance on either side of the street for 400 feet along its course beyond each terminus of the part proposed to be vacated. Where a street is proposed to be vacated to its termini, the land embraced in an extension of the street for a distance of 400 feet beyond each terminus shall also be counted. In the vacation of any plat or part thereof the consent of the owner or owners of two-thirds in area of the property embraced within such plat or part thereof proposed to be vacated shall be sufficient, except where such vacation embraces street area, when, as to such street area the above requirements shall also apply. The consent of the owners of the required amount of property shall be in writing. [Amended by 1999 c.866 §2]

 

      271.090 Filing of petition; notice. The petition shall be presented to the city recorder or other recording officer of the city. If found by the recorder to be sufficient, the recorder shall file it and inform at least one of the petitioners when the petition will come before the city governing body. A failure to give such information shall not be in any respect a lack of jurisdiction for the governing body to proceed on the petition.

 

      271.100 Action by city governing body. The city governing body may deny the petition after notice to the petitioners of such proposed action, but if there appears to be no reason why the petition should not be allowed in whole or in part, the governing body shall fix a time for a formal hearing upon the petition.

 

      271.110 Notice of hearing. (1) The city recorder or other recording officer of the city shall give notice of the petition and hearing by publishing a notice in the city official newspaper once each week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing. If no newspaper is published in such city, written notice of the petition and hearing shall be posted in three of the most public places in the city. The notices shall describe the ground covered by the petition, give the date it was filed, the name of at least one of the petitioners and the date when the petition, and any objection or remonstrance, which may be made in writing and filed with the recording officer of the city prior to the time of hearing, will be heard and considered.

      (2) Within five days after the first day of publication of the notice, the city recording officer shall cause to be posted at or near each end of the proposed vacation a copy of the notice, which shall be headed, “Notice of Street Vacation,” “Notice of Plat Vacation” or “Notice of Plat and Street Vacation,” as the case may be. The notice shall be posted in at least two conspicuous places in the proposed vacation area. The posting and first day of publication of such notice shall be at least 14 days before the hearing.

      (3) The city recording officer shall, before publishing such notice, obtain from the petitioners a sum sufficient to cover the cost of publication, posting and other anticipated expenses. The city recording officer shall hold the sum so obtained until the actual cost has been ascertained, when the amount of the cost shall be paid into the city treasury and any surplus refunded to the depositor. [Amended by 1991 c.629 §1; 2005 c.22 §196]

 

      271.120 Hearing; determination. At the time fixed by the governing body for hearing the petition and any objections filed thereto or at any postponement or continuance of such matter, the governing body shall hear the petition and objections and shall determine whether the consent of the owners of the requisite area has been obtained, whether notice has been duly given and whether the public interest will be prejudiced by the vacation of such plat or street or parts thereof. If such matters are determined in favor of the petition the governing body shall by ordinance make such determination a matter of record and vacate such plat or street; otherwise it shall deny the petition. The governing body may, upon hearing, grant the petition in part and deny it in part, and make such reservations, or either, as appear to be for the public interest.

 

      271.130 Vacation on city governing body’s own motion; appeal. (1) The city governing body may initiate vacation proceedings authorized by ORS 271.080 and make such vacation without a petition or consent of property owners. Notice shall be given as provided by ORS 271.110, but such vacation shall not be made before the date set for hearing, nor if the owners of a majority of the area affected, computed on the basis provided in ORS 271.080, object in writing thereto, nor shall any street area be vacated without the consent of the owners of the abutting property if the vacation will substantially affect the market value of such property, unless the city governing body provides for paying damages. Provision for paying such damages may be made by a local assessment, or in such other manner as the city charter may provide.

      (2) Two or more streets, alleys, avenues and boulevards, or parts thereof, may be joined in one proceeding, provided they intersect or are adjacent and parallel to each other.

      (3) No ordinance for the vacation of all or part of a plat shall be passed by the governing body until the city recording officer has filed in the office of the city recording officer or indorsed on the petition for such vacation a certificate showing that all city liens and all taxes have been paid on the lands covered by the plat or portion thereof to be vacated.

      (4) Any property owner affected by the order of vacation or the order awarding damages or benefits in such vacation proceedings may appeal to the circuit court of the county where such city is situated in the manner provided by the city charter. If the charter does not provide for such appeal, the appeal shall be taken within the time and in substantially the manner provided for taking an appeal from justice court in civil cases. [Amended by 1995 c.658 §101]

 

      271.140 Title to vacated areas. The title to the street or other public area vacated shall attach to the lands bordering on such area in equal portions; except that where the area has been originally dedicated by different persons and the fee title to such area has not been otherwise disposed of, original boundary lines shall be adhered to and the street area which lies on each side of such boundary line shall attach to the abutting property on such side. If a public square is vacated the title thereto shall vest in the city. [Amended by 1981 c.153 §58]

 

      271.150 Vacation records to be filed; costs. A certified copy of the ordinance vacating any street or plat area and any map, plat or other record in regard thereto which may be required or provided for by law, shall be filed for record with the county clerk. The petitioner for such vacation shall bear the recording cost and the cost of preparing and filing the certified copy of the ordinance and map. A certified copy of any such ordinance shall be filed with the county assessor and county surveyor.

 

      271.160 Vacations for purposes of rededication. No street shall be vacated upon the petition of any person when it is proposed to replat or rededicate all or part of any street in lieu of the original unless such petition is accompanied by a plat showing the proposed manner of replatting or rededicating. If the proposed manner of replatting or rededicating or any modification thereof which may subsequently be made meets with the approval of the city governing body, it shall require a suitable guarantee to be given for the carrying out of such replatting or rededication or may make any vacation conditional or to take effect only upon the consummation of such replatting or rededication.

 

      271.170 Nature and operation of statutes. The provisions of ORS 271.080 to 271.160 are alternative to the provisions of the charter of any incorporated city and nothing contained in those statutes shall in anywise affect or impair the charter or other provisions of such cities for the preservation of public access to and from transportation terminals and navigable waters.

 

      271.180 Vacations in municipalities included in port districts; petition; power of common council; vacating street along railroad easement. To the end that adequate facilities for terminal trackage, structures and the instrumentalities of commerce and transportation may be provided in cities and towns located within or forming a part of any port district organized as a municipal corporation in this state, the governing body of such cities and towns, upon the petition of any such port, or corporation empowered to own or operate a railroad, steamship or other transportation terminal, or railroad company entering or operating within such city or town, or owner of property abutting any such terminal, may:

      (1) Authorize any port commission, dock commission, common carrier, railroad company or terminal company to occupy, by any structure, trackage or machinery facilitating or necessary to travel, transportation or distribution, any street or public property, or parts thereof, within such city or town, upon such reasonable terms and conditions as the city or town may impose.

      (2) Vacate the whole or any part of any street, alley, common or public place, with such restrictions and upon such conditions as the city governing body may deem reasonable and for the public good.

      (3) If any railroad company owns or has an exclusive easement upon a definite strip within or along any public street, alley, common or public place, and if the city governing body determines such action to be to the advantage of the public, vacate the street area between the strip so occupied by the railroad company and one property line opposite thereto, condition that the railroad company dedicates for street purposes such portion of such exclusive strip occupied by it as the city governing body may determine upon, and moves its tracks and facilities therefrom onto the street area so vacated. The right and title of the railroad company in the vacated area shall be of the same character as previously owned by it in the exclusive strip which it is required by the city governing body to surrender and dedicate to street purposes.

 

      271.190 Consent of owners of adjoining property; other required approval. No vacation of all or part of a street, alley, common or public place shall take place under ORS 271.180 unless the consent of the persons owning the property immediately adjoining that part of the street or alley to be vacated is obtained thereto in writing and filed with the auditor or clerk of the city or town. No vacation shall be made of any street, alley, public place or part thereof, if within 5,000 feet of the harbor or pierhead line of the port, unless the port commission, or other bodies having jurisdiction over docks and wharves in the port district involved, approves the proposed vacation in writing.

 

      271.200 Petition; notice. (1) Before any street, alley, common or public place or any part thereof is vacated, or other right granted by any city governing body under ORS 271.180 to 271.210 the applicant must petition the governing body of the city or town involved, setting forth the particular circumstances of the case, giving a definite description of the property sought to be vacated, or of the right, use or occupancy sought to be obtained, and the names of the persons to be particularly affected thereby. The petition shall be filed with the auditor or clerk of the city or town involved 30 days previous to the taking of any action thereon by the city governing body.

      (2) Notice of the pendency of the petition, containing a description of the area sought to be vacated or right, use or occupancy sought to be obtained, shall be published at least once each week for three successive weeks prior to expiration of such 30-day period in a newspaper of general circulation in the county wherein the city or town is located.

 

      271.210 Hearing; grant of petition. Hearing upon the petition shall be had by the city governing body at its next regular meeting following the expiration of 30 days from the filing of the petition. At that time objections to the granting of the whole or any part of the petition shall be duly heard and considered by the governing body, which shall thereupon, or at any later time to which the hearing is postponed or adjourned, pass by a majority vote an ordinance setting forth the property to be vacated, or other rights, occupancy or use to be thereby granted. Upon the expiration of 30 days from the passage of the ordinance and the approval thereof by the mayor of the city or town, the ordinance shall be in full force and effect.

 

      271.220 Filing of objections; waiver. All objections to the petition shall be filed with the clerk or auditor of the city or town within 30 days from the filing of the petition, and if not so filed shall be conclusively presumed to have been waived. The regularity, validity and correctness of the proceedings of the city governing body pursuant to ORS 271.180 to 271.210, shall be conclusive in all things on all parties, and cannot in any manner be contested in any proceeding whatsoever by any person not filing written objections within the time provided in this section.

 

      271.230 Records of vacations; fees. (1) If any town or plat of any city or town is vacated by a county court or municipal authority of any city or town, the vacation order or ordinance shall be recorded in the deed records of the county. Whenever a vacation order or ordinance is so recorded, the county surveyor of such county shall, upon a copy of the plat that is certified by the county clerk, trace or shade with permanent ink in such manner as to denote that portion so vacated, and shall make the notation “Vacated” upon such copy of the plat, giving the book and page of the deed record in which the order or ordinance is recorded. Corrections or changes shall not be allowed on the original plat once it is recorded with the county clerk.

      (2) For recording in the county deed records, the county clerk shall collect the same fee as for recording a deed. For the services of the county surveyor for marking the record upon the copy of the plat, the county clerk shall collect a fee as set by ordinance of the county governing body to be paid by the county clerk to the county surveyor. [Amended by 1971 c.621 §31; 1975 c.607 §31; 1977 c.488 §2; 1979 c.833 §30; 1999 c.710 §12; 2001 c.173 §5]

TRANSFER, LEASE, DONATION OR USE OF PUBLIC LANDS

 

      271.300 Application and administration of ORS 271.300 to 271.360; rules. (1) The power granted by ORS 271.300 to 271.360 is vested in each political subdivision of the State of Oregon. The power is self-operating, without the necessity of further legislation.

      (2) In carrying ORS 271.300 to 271.360 into effect, a political subdivision shall act through its duly constituted governing body. Each political subdivision through its governing body may provide rules necessary in carrying out ORS 271.300 to 271.360. [Amended by 1981 c.787 §26; 1985 c.443 §4]

 

      271.310 Transfer or lease of real property owned or controlled by political subdivision; procedure in case of qualified title; notice; rules. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section and subject to subsection (3) of this section, whenever any political subdivision possesses or controls real property not needed for public use, or whenever the public interest may be furthered, a political subdivision may sell, exchange, convey or lease for any period not exceeding 99 years all or any part of the political subdivision’s interest in the property to a governmental body or private individual or corporation. The consideration for the transfer or lease may be cash or real property, or both.

      (2) If the ownership, right or title of the political subdivision to any real property set apart by deed, will or otherwise for a burial ground or cemetery, or for the purpose of interring the remains of deceased persons, is limited or qualified or the use of the real property is restricted, whether by dedication or otherwise, the political subdivision may, after the county court or governing body thereof has first declared by resolution that the real property is not needed for public use, or that the sale, exchange, conveyance or lease of the real property will further the public interest, file a complaint in the circuit court for the county in which the real property is located against all persons claiming any right, title or interest in the real property, whether the interest be contingent, conditional or otherwise, for authority to sell, exchange, convey or lease all or any part of the real property. The resolution is prima facie evidence that the real property is not needed for public use, or that the sale, exchange, conveyance or lease will further the public interest. The action shall be commenced and prosecuted to final determination in the same manner as an action not triable by right to a jury. The complaint shall contain a description of the real property, a statement of the nature of the restriction, qualification or limitations, and a statement that the defendants claim some interest therein. The court shall make such judgment as it shall deem proper, taking into consideration the limitation, qualifications or restrictions, the resolution, and all other matters pertinent thereto. Neither costs nor disbursements may be recovered against any defendant.

      (3)(a) At least 30 days before listing or placing real property for sale, exchange or conveyance, a political subdivision shall notify the Department of Transportation of its intent to sell, exchange or convey the real property if the real property is within 100 feet of a railroad right of way or is within 500 feet of an at-grade rail crossing.

      (b) The department shall share the advance notice with private providers of rail service that might be interested in obtaining the real property to facilitate the current delivery or future expansion of rail service. Notwithstanding the benefit of receiving advance notice, a private provider of rail service may not obtain or enter into negotiations to obtain the real property until the political subdivision offers the real property for sale, exchange, conveyance or lease to the general public. As used in this paragraph, “general public” includes private providers of rail service.

      (c) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply:

      (A) To light rail corridors and any other rail corridors excluded by rule of the department;

      (B) If the proposed sale, exchange or conveyance of the real property is to a provider of rail service; or

      (C) To the proposed sale, exchange or conveyance of easements.

      (d) The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. The rules may include provisions that:

      (A) Identify rail corridors within which a political subdivision is not required to provide notice of intention to sell, exchange or convey real property within 100 feet of a railroad right of way or within 500 feet of an at-grade rail crossing.

      (B) Establish a process for providing advance notice to private providers of rail service.

      (4) Unless the governing body of a political subdivision determines under subsection (1) of this section that the public interest may be furthered, real property needed for public use by any political subdivision owning or controlling the property may not be sold, exchanged, conveyed or leased under the authority of ORS 271.300 to 271.360, except that it may be exchanged for property that is of equal or superior useful value for public use. Any such property not immediately needed for public use may be leased if, in the discretion of the governing body having control of the property, the property will not be needed for public use within the period of the lease.

      (5) The authority to lease property granted by this section includes authority to lease property not owned or controlled by the political subdivision at the time of entering into the lease. A lease under this subsection shall be conditioned upon the subsequent acquisition of the interest covered by the lease. [Amended by 1955 c.755 §1; 1961 c.136 §1; 1979 c.284 §127; 1981 c.787 §27; 1985 c.443 §5; 1999 c.559 §2; 2011 c.446 §1; 2013 c.781 §32]

 

      271.320 Exchange of trust fund assets. If any property owned by a political subdivision is held as an asset of any special trust fund securing the payment of bonds, it may be exchanged, under the authority granted in ORS 271.310, for other property of equal or superior value, and property so received in exchange shall be an asset of the fund in lieu of the property previously held. [Amended by 1981 c.787 §28]

 

      271.330 Relinquishing title of property not needed for public use. (1) Any political subdivision is granted express power to relinquish the title to any of the political subdivision’s property not needed for public use to any governmental body, providing the property is used for not less than 20 years for a public purpose by the governmental body in the State of Oregon. These transfers for public purposes may include transfers without consideration of property held by counties as a result of tax foreclosures.

      (2)(a) Any political subdivision is granted express power to relinquish the title to any of the political subdivision’s property to a qualifying nonprofit corporation or a municipal corporation for the purpose of providing any of the following:

      (A) Low income housing;

      (B) Social services; or

      (C) Child care services.

      (b) As used in this subsection:

      (A) “Qualifying nonprofit corporation” means a corporation that is a public benefit corporation as defined in ORS 65.001 and that has obtained a ruling from the federal Internal Revenue Service providing that the corporation is exempt from federal income taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (B) “Social services” and “child care services” include but are not limited to education, training, counseling, health and mental health services and the provision of facilities and administrative services to support social services and child care services.

      (3) Any political subdivision is granted express power to convey real property to a nonprofit or municipal corporation to be used by the nonprofit or municipal corporation for the creation of open space, parks or natural areas for perpetual public use. The instrument conveying the real property must include a restriction on the use of the property that limits the uses of the property to those uses described in this subsection. The instrument conveying the property must also contain a provision for the reversion of the property to the political subdivision if the property is not used in conformance with the restriction. Real property conveyed under this subsection may include real property held by a political subdivision as a result of tax foreclosures.

      (4) Any political subdivision is granted express power to convey real property to a nonprofit, municipal or private corporation for the purpose of providing broadband service. The instrument conveying the real property shall include a restriction on the use of the property that requires the property to be used to provide broadband service. The instrument conveying the property shall also contain a provision for the reversion of the property to the political subdivision if the property is not used in conformance with the restriction.

      (5) Transfers under this section may include transfers without consideration of property held by counties as a result of tax foreclosures.

      (6) Before any county court or board of county commissioners may transfer, under subsection (1) of this section, any tax foreclosed lands in which the state or a political subdivision has represented delinquent and uncollected taxes, liens or assessments, the county court or board of county commissioners shall advertise in a newspaper of general circulation in the county for two successive weeks the court’s or the board’s intention to so transfer the property. The notice must state when the county court will hear objections to the transfer and must specifically describe the property intended to be transferred. After the hearing set in the notice is held and objections are heard, the court may, in the court’s sound discretion, proceed with the transfer. Except in the case of a transfer for low income housing, real property must be conveyed by deed, subject to a reversionary interest retained by the granting political subdivision in the event that the property is used for a purpose that is inconsistent with the grant. The granting political subdivision may waive the subdivision’s right to a reversionary interest at the time the property is conveyed. After the transfer the interests of the state or any political subdivision in the land on account of uncollected taxes, liens or assessments are extinguished, and the county is relieved of the necessity to account for uncollected taxes, liens or assessments.
