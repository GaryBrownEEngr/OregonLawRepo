      (1) Refund to such grantee the purchase price paid to the state for such land, with interest at the rate of six percent per annum from the time payment was made; and

      (2) Pay to the grantee an amount equal to all ad valorem taxes paid by such grantee with respect to such land before June 19, 1967, without interest. [1967 c.422 §2; 1973 c.685 §1]

 

      273.365 When refunds not available; source of refunds. (1) A refund is not available under ORS 273.356 to 273.375 to any grantee who received from the State Land Board a refund or other settlement with respect to such lands before June 19, 1967, or who may be holding title originally procured or subsequently conveyed by false swearing or fraudulent representation.

      (2) Each refund under ORS 273.360 shall be paid to the grantee out of the revenues of the Common School Fund. [1967 c.422 §§3,4]

 

      273.370 Alternative to refund. If the Department of State Lands finds that the property erroneously conveyed has been identified generally as private property, as evidenced by the inclusion of the property on the assessment rolls of the county in which it is located for a period of 20 years or more immediately preceding, the department may refund to the grantee an amount not to exceed any of the following values:

      (1) The current fair market value of the property erroneously conveyed;

      (2) The amount of the most recently issued title insurance policy carried on the property, if such a title insurance policy has been issued regularly; or

The price of any such purchase or acquisition shall be paid to such applicant out of the revenues of the Common School Fund, and shall not exceed the market value of the land that otherwise would have been available to the applicant under ORS 273.620 (1965 Replacement Part).

      273.566 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that many valuable natural heritage resources are represented in natural areas that can be protected through the voluntary cooperation of private landowners and public land managers. These areas will comprise a discrete and limited system of natural areas that are selected to represent the full range of Oregon’s natural heritage resources. These areas shall have substantially retained their natural character, or, if altered in character, shall in addition to their natural heritage resource values be valuable as habitat for plant and animal species or for the study and appreciation of the natural features. As such they will be living museums for scientific research, educational purposes and nature interpretation.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly also finds that it is necessary to establish a process and means for public and private sector cooperation in the development of this system of state natural areas. Private landowners and public land managers should be encouraged to voluntarily participate in the program through conservation activities that benefit all Oregonians.

      (3) In order to ensure that activities related to natural heritage resources cause the minimum of conflict with other resource uses and that they are cost effective, the Legislative Assembly finds that the State Parks and Recreation Department should provide a specific framework for decision making related to natural heritage resources through a classification and planning process known as the Natural Areas Program. Future state natural areas should avoid unnecessary duplication of already protected natural heritage resources. Each decision should address alternative methods of accomplishing the same purpose and should consider cost effectiveness.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that there is a need for systematic, accessible information concerning the locations of the resources of Oregon’s natural areas, including special plant and animal species, native terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems and geologic features, and especially including the natural areas already protected that contain these resources.

ORS 273.805 to 273.825 and 327.430 are not the result of a legislative intent or belief that the department is without authority to acquire, lease, manage, protect or control common school grazing lands. [1963 c.517 §§1,5; 1967 c.421 §84]

 

      273.810 [1963 c.517 §2; repealed by 1967 c.421 §206]

      (a) The initial term of a lease shall be not less than 20 years, and at the end of the initial term the lease shall be renewed by the department for an additional term of 20 years.

      (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the department shall not terminate a common school grazing lands lease without the consent of the lessee. If the consent of the lessee cannot be obtained, the department may terminate a common school grazing lands lease only by contemporaneously agreeing to pay to the lessee compensation as provided by law for all damages caused by the termination of the lease, including any depreciation or loss of value to the remaining lands or businesses of the lessee. [1963 c.517 §3; 1967 c.421 §85; 1995 c.813 §1]

 

      273.820 Exchange of lands. The Department of State Lands may exchange common school grazing lands for land of approximately equal aggregate value, when such exchange is in furtherance of the purposes of ORS 273.805 to 273.825.

For purposes of this section, lands are considered to be adjacent if their boundaries are common or intersect at a common point.

      (2) Application to purchase common school grazing land under subsection (1) of this section must be made in a manner prescribed by the rules of the department. Upon receiving an application, the department shall determine whether the applicant qualifies under subsection (1) of this section.

ORS 270.020, 273.225 to 273.241 and 273.275 do not apply to the sale of land under this subsection. The applicant shall pay not less than 10 percent of the purchase price at the time of purchase, and shall pay the remainder in 10 equal installments, at least one installment to be paid each year, over a period not to exceed 10 years from the time of purchase, with interest at the rate fixed by the department for purposes of ORS 327.425.

      (3) If application to purchase common school grazing land is made by a person other than the lessee of such land, the department promptly shall notify the lessee by registered or certified mail. Not later than the 90th day after notice was mailed to the lessee, the lessee may make written application in a manner prescribed by the rules of the department to purchase such land.

Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition not later than the 60th day after the date on which the findings of the county board became final. The petition shall state the nature of the petitioner’s interest, the facts showing how the petitioner is aggrieved by the county board’s decision, and the grounds on which the petitioner contends that the decision should be reversed or set aside. True copies of the petition shall be served by registered or certified mail on the county board and all other parties of record in the proceeding. No responsive pleading is required of the county board. In its discretion the court may permit other interested persons to intervene.

Any party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when deemed desirable.

      (3) If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence to the issues in the case, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good and substantial reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the county board, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the county board on such conditions as the court deems proper. The county board may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and, within a time to be fixed by the court, shall file with the reviewing court, to become a part of the record, the additional evidence, together with any modifications or new findings or decision, or its certificate that it elects to stand on its original findings and decision, as the case may be.

      (4) The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury as a suit in equity and shall be confined to the record, except that, in cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the county board, not shown in the record, testimony thereon may be taken in the court. The court, on request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.

      (5) The court may adopt the county board’s findings of fact and affirm the decision of the county board; or it may reverse and set aside the county board’s decision, or reverse and remand for further proceedings, after review of all the facts disclosed by the record, and any additional facts established under subsection (4) of this section. The court thereupon shall enter a judgment. In the case of reversal the court shall make special findings of fact based on evidence in the record and conclusions of law indicating clearly all respects in which the county board’s decision is erroneous.

      (6) Any party to the proceedings before the circuit court may appeal from the judgment of that court to the Court of Appeals. Such appeal shall be taken in the manner provided by law for appeals from the circuit courts in suits in equity. [1969 c.495 §13; 1979 c.562 §10; 2003 c.576 §411]
