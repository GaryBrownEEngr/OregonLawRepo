      274.036 Status of channel of Willamette River; approval of dam; state maintenance of river location. The Willamette River at mile 176.5 has been returned to its pre-1971 channel. The Legislative Assembly finds that in the interests of the state’s ownership in the bed of the Willamette River and protecting the public rights of navigation, fisheries, recreation and wildlife habitat, the river at that point should be allowed to remain at its present location. The Legislative Assembly further finds that the construction of the dike at river mile 176.5 which returned the river to its pre-1971 channel is hereby approved as being in accordance with the intent and purposes of ORS 780.010. Nothing in this section is intended to imply a continuing obligation by the state to maintain the river in any location or waive the requirements of ORS 196.600 to 196.905. [1975 c.412 §2]

 

SALE, LEASE OR USE WITHOUT CHARGE

 

      274.040 Sale or lease of submersible lands; easements; occupation of submerged and submersible lands for water works. (1) Except as provided in ORS 274.043, in ORS 274.085 for leases of submersible lands acquired as an investment for the Common School Fund, in ORS 274.530 (1) for leases of submersible lands of less than one year’s duration, in ORS 274.530 (3) for licenses of less than three years’ duration, in ORS 274.873 for proprietary authorizations within Oregon’s territorial sea as defined in ORS 196.405 and in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, submersible lands owned by the State of Oregon may be leased only to the highest bidder, bidding at least the minimum amount designated by the Department of State Lands under subsection (6) of this section for the lease of any such lands, after being advertised not less than once each week for two successive weeks in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county in which the lands are situated. However, any owner of lands abutting or fronting on such submersible lands shall have the preference right to lease the lands unless the submersible lands are occupied by a person claiming the right of occupancy under a conveyance recorded before January 1, 1981, from the present owner or predecessor in interest of lands abutting or fronting the submersible lands. If so, the occupant of the submersible lands shall have the preference right to lease the lands. An easement or license related to utility service on the submersible lands does not establish a preference right under this subsection. The lands shall be leased for the amount designated by the department under subsection (6) of this section as the minimum amount for the lease of any such lands. The preferences provided in this subsection apply to any lease of submersible land for one year or more offered or issued under ORS 274.530. The preferences provided in this subsection do not apply to any lease offered or issued by the department under ORS 274.705 to 274.860. The preference for the owner of lands provided in this subsection does not apply to the renewal of an existing lease where the lessee is in compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease.

      (2) Submersible lands owned by the State of Oregon that are determined by the State Land Board to be available for sale may be sold only to the highest bidder, after being advertised not less than once each week for two successive weeks in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county in which the lands are situated. However:

      (a) No such lands shall be sold for less than for a fair appraised value as determined by an appraiser appointed by the department.

      (b) All sales of such submersible lands shall be approved by the State Land Board.

      (c) Any owner of lands abutting or fronting on such submersible lands shall have the preference right to purchase such lands for the fair appraised value provided that the sale of such lands be approved by the State Land Board.

      (3)(a) The department may grant, to any person holding a permit from the Water Resources Director authorizing the impoundment for beneficial use of the waters of any lake or stream, easements over submerged and submersible lands for flowage and storage of waters, and for the construction, maintenance and operation of any structures or facilities necessary for the use of the water under the terms of the permit upon payment of just compensation by the grantee.

      (b) In addition to the authority of the department under paragraph (a) of this subsection to grant easements over submerged and submersible lands, a person holding a water right permit, water right certificate, proposed or final order approving a water right permit or court decree evidencing a water right may occupy state-owned submerged and submersible lands for the construction, maintenance and operation of any structure or facility necessary for the use of water if the proposed use under the permit, certificate, order or decree is for irrigation or domestic use. The department may not charge for the occupation of state-owned submerged and submersible lands pursuant to this paragraph, nor may the department require that a person obtain written documentation to substantiate the permission granted under this paragraph. Upon request by the Department of State Lands, the Water Resources Department shall provide information to the Department of State Lands regarding any change of use of the water right. A person may continue to occupy state-owned submerged and submersible lands pursuant to this paragraph until:

      (A) The water right permit is canceled pursuant to ORS 537.260;

      (B) The water right is canceled pursuant to ORS 540.641; or

      (C) The water is no longer being applied to irrigation or domestic use.

      (c) An easement or the permission granted under this subsection may not be construed to be a sale or lease of the submerged and submersible lands within the meaning of subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

      (d) A person granted an easement or permission to use or occupy state-owned submerged and submersible lands under this subsection shall indemnify and hold harmless the state from all liability and claims arising from or attributable to the use or occupation.

      (4) All easements or the permission granted pursuant to subsection (3) of this section shall be subject to conditions that will ensure the safety of the public and the preservation of economic, scenic and recreational values and to lawful rules promulgated by state agencies affected by the activities of the grantee.

      (5) Nothing in this section affects the provisions of ORS 509.505, 509.510, 511.606 to 511.806, 622.270 or 622.320 to 622.350.

      (6) The Department of State Lands shall designate the minimum acceptable amount for the lease of any submerged and submersible lands otherwise authorized by law, other than any lease offered or issued by the department under ORS 274.705 to 274.860.

      (7) For the purpose of sale, the value of state-owned submerged and submersible lands shall be determined by an appraiser appointed by the department.

      (8) The act of any person entering into an agreement with the department under this section or ORS 274.530 for the lease of submerged and submersible lands shall not be considered a waiver by such person of any claim of ownership in the submerged and submersible lands described in the agreement.

      (d) Voluntary habitat restoration work on state-owned submerged and submersible lands. For purposes of this paragraph, voluntary habitat restoration work does not include:

      (A) Activities undertaken to satisfy any actual or potential legal obligation, or for which the entity completing the habitat restoration work receives compensation of any kind.

      (B) Habitat restoration work completed by an entity to satisfy an environmental mitigation obligation, or to generate, sell or obtain credit as an offset against actual or potential natural resource damages liability.

      (6) The department is entitled to charge, in accordance with rules adopted by the department, for the use of state-owned submerged and submersible lands for any environmental mitigation credit, or settlement of or credit obtained as an offset against natural resource damages liability, acquired by any party for habitat restoration work on state-owned land.

      (7) The uses described in subsections (5) and (6) of this section must be registered in accordance with rules adopted by the department. Any person issued a registration to use or occupy state-owned submerged and submersible lands under subsections (5) and (6) of this section shall indemnify and hold harmless the state from all liability and claims arising from or attributable to the use or occupation.

      Sec. 10. (1) For the biennium beginning July 1, 2017, at the request of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, after the department consults with the Department of State Lands, the State Treasurer is authorized to issue lottery bonds pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585 in an amount that produces $3 million in net proceeds and interest earnings for the purposes described in subsection (2) of this section, plus an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs.

      (2) Net proceeds of lottery bonds issued under this section in an amount sufficient to provide $3 million in net proceeds and interest earnings must be transferred to the Department of State Lands for deposit in the Portland Harbor Cleanup Fund, established in section 11 of this 2017 Act [274.064], to provide financial assistance to the department for coordination and participation in any contracts or agreements relating to or arising out of the Portland Harbor Superfund Site.

COMMON SCHOOL FUND INVESTMENTS

 

      274.085 Acquisition for Common School Fund investment; lease of lands. Whenever it appears to the State Land Board to be prudent and to the financial benefit of the Common School Fund, the State Land Board may acquire as an investment for the Common School Fund any parcel of land, whether or not submerged, and submersible lands or formerly submerged and submersible lands. The consideration for such acquisition may be an exchange of other lands under the jurisdiction of the State Land Board including submerged and submersible lands or formerly submerged and submersible lands or cash or a combination of such lands and cash. In leasing any lands acquired as an investment for the Common School Fund, the board may use negotiation, competitive bidding, solicitation of proposals or whatever procedure or combination of procedures the board determines will maximize the financial benefit to the Common School Fund. The board may determine on a case-by-case basis what notice, publication or bidding procedures, if any, it wishes to use in implementing its authority under this section. [1979 c.546 §1; 1981 c.158 §2]

      (2) Upon drainage of meandered lakes, the title of owners of land riparian to such lakes drained under any law shall extend to so much of the submersible and submerged lands reclaimed by such drainage as is required to fill out the least fractional subdivision or subdivisions of any section owned by such riparian owners and which is rendered fractional by the meander line of such lake; and the title of such owners shall be so limited when the receding lake waters, because of such drainage, uncover the submersible and submerged lands. Where by reason of natural accretion or reliction such fractional subdivision or subdivisions of such upland owners were filled out thereby prior to May 25, 1921, such upland owners shall hold to the line of such lands as extended by the natural accretion or reliction.

      (3) Submersible and submerged lands covered at ordinary high water at ordinarily recurring seasons by the waters of meandered lakes, or from which the waters of any such lakes have not at ordinarily high water permanently receded, are not considered to be accreted or relicted lands, but the same and all accretions and relictions occurring or formed over any of the lands of the State of Oregon, as provided by ORS 274.430, are the property of the State of Oregon, and may be by it leased, sold or managed in the manner provided by law. [Amended by 1967 c.421 §133]

 

      274.450 Acquisition of riparian rights by department.

If the successful bidder fails to pay the balance of the cash bonus bid and the annual rental for the first year not later than the 15th day after the award of the lease, or fails to post any bond required by the lease or the rules in effect at the date of the invitation for bids within the time prescribed, the amount of the deposit shall be forfeited to the state.

      (3) At the time and place specified in the notice the department shall publicly open the sealed bids and shall award the lease for each parcel to the bidder who, in addition to complying with all of the conditions for bidding, offers the highest cash bonus. The department may, however, reject any or all bids for cause.

      (4) Following the award of the lease, the payment by the successful bidder of the balance of the cash bonus, the annual rental for the first year, and the fee specified in this section, and the posting of any required bonds, the department shall execute the lease in duplicate on behalf of the state and transmit one counterpart thereof to the lessee. The lease shall become effective as of the date of such execution.

      (5) The department shall prescribe a reasonable fee to cover the procedures under this section, which shall be paid by the successful bidder. [1961 c.619 §27; 1967 c.421 §167]

      274.920 Creation of new lands upon submersible or submerged lands. No one other than the United States, while engaged in the promotion of navigation, shall artificially create new lands by fill or deposit upon submersible or submerged lands without the approval of the owner of such lands and the owner of the adjoining or opposite upland on the same side of the body of water. [1963 c.376 §4; 1973 c.203 §7]

 

      274.925 Right of public riparian owner to purchase new lands; price determination. (1) Whenever the United States, while engaged in the promotion of navigation, creates new lands upon submersible or submerged lands owned by the state and the adjoining or opposite upland or riparian land on the same side of the body of water is owned by a public body, the public body has the right to purchase the new lands as provided in this section. The public body shall pay to the Department of State Lands for the new lands a sum equal to the difference between the value of the tract, consisting of the new lands and the adjoining or opposite upland on the same side of the body of water, and the value of the adjoining or opposite upland before the creation of the new lands and an amount prescribed by the department to pay its administrative costs incurred with respect to the new lands. Such payment shall be made by the public body within one year after the date of the receipt by it of actual notice by the department of the creation of the new lands, the sum equal to the difference between the value of the tract, consisting of the new lands and the adjoining or opposite upland on the same side of the body of water, and the value of the adjoining or opposite upland before the creation of the new lands and the administrative costs incurred by the department with respect to new lands. If the public body fails to make payment for the new lands as provided in this subsection within one year after the date of such notice, the department may dispose of the new lands as provided in ORS 274.915.

      (2) If a public body and the department cannot agree on the sum to be paid under subsection (1) of this section, the sum to be paid shall be determined by three appraisers, one appointed by the public body, one by the department, and the third by the first two, and their determination shall be final.

      274.929 Right of nonpublic riparian owner to purchase certain new lands; price determination.

      (2) A nonpublic riparian owner entitled to purchase the new lands under subsection (1) of this section shall pay to the Department of State Lands for the new lands a sum equal to the difference between the value of the tract, consisting of the new lands and the adjoining or opposite upland on the same side of the body of water, and the value of the adjoining or opposite upland before the creation of the new lands and an amount prescribed by the department to pay its administrative costs incurred with respect to the new lands. Such payment shall be made by the nonpublic riparian owner within six months after the date of the receipt by the nonpublic riparian owner of actual official notice by the department of the creation of the new lands, the sum equal to the difference between the value of the tract, consisting of the new lands and the adjoining or opposite upland on the same side of the body of water, and the value of the adjoining or opposite upland before the creation of the new lands and administrative costs incurred by the department with respect to the new lands. If the nonpublic riparian owner fails to make payment for the new lands as provided in this subsection, the department, after the expiration of the six-month period, may dispose of the new lands as provided in ORS 274.915.

      (3) If a nonpublic riparian owner and the department cannot agree on the sum to be paid under subsection (2) of this section, the sum to be paid shall be determined by three appraisers, one appointed by the nonpublic riparian owner, one by the department, and the third by the first two, and their determination shall be final. The cost of the third appraiser shall be borne equally by the nonpublic riparian owner and the department.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 274.905 (2), this section applies only to new lands created on or after October 5, 1973. [1973 c.203 §2; 2015 c.804 §4]

The individual shall also pay to the department for the new lands the administrative costs incurred by the department with respect to the new lands. If the individual fails to make payment for the new lands as provided in this subsection within six months after the date of the notice by the department, the department may dispose of the new lands as provided in ORS 274.915.

      (2) If an individual and the department cannot agree on the sum to be paid for new lands under subsection (1) of this section, the sum to be paid shall be determined by three appraisers, one appointed by the individual, one appointed by the department and the third appointed by the first two.
