PARKING FACILITIES; CAR POOLS

 

      276.591 Parking policy. It shall be the state policy in regard to state controlled grounds and facilities used for parking:

      (1) That each state agency that owns or controls through direct lease, lease purchase or installment purchase agreement grounds or facilities used for parking shall regulate their use and impose on users, whether or not state employees, equitable charges consistent with the state policy for such parking.

      (2) That use of alternative modes of transportation be encouraged.

      (3) That traffic congestion and energy waste be minimized.

      (4) That charges for use of grounds and facilities used for parking be established in a manner which recognizes the agency’s cost to provide such facilities, local market conditions for commercial or other paid parking and community standards; and does not cause community hardship or eliminate the demand for state provided parking. However, the charges imposed shall not produce revenues in excess of amounts required to operate, maintain and improve the grounds and facilities, to cover required depreciation and debt service expenditures, to offset any revenues lost through the provision of car or van pool incentive rates under ORS 276.601, and to provide reasonable funds for alternative modes of transportation and capital development. Pricing policy should also discourage the use of single occupant vehicles and recognize the desirability and degree of quality of the parking. [1981 c.591 §1; 1989 c.990 §1]

 

      276.592 Taxation of parking facilities used by private individuals. Any portion of the facilities used during the tax year for parking on a rental or fee basis to private individuals shall be subject to ad valorem taxation computed by determining that percentage that private use bears to the total use of the facilities. [Formerly 276.564; 1981 c.591 §5]

 

      276.594 Management of grounds and parking structures or facilities in capitol area; exemptions and limitations; fees; rules. (1) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall:

      (a) Manage those grounds and parking structures or facilities located in the capitol area of the City of Salem that the state owns or that any state agency leases or is acquiring through lease purchase or installment purchase agreement; and

      (b) Determine the conditions under which such grounds and parking structures or facilities may be used.

      (2) The grounds and parking structures or facilities described in subsection (1) of this section include those located either adjacent to, on or in close proximity to, though not necessarily contiguous to, leased office quarters defined in ORS 276.420, the Supreme Court Building, the buildings, properties or parking structures described in ORS 276.004 and those grounds the state owns by and through the department that are adjacent to the installations and facilities located in the area described in ORS 276.054.

      (3) This section does not apply to the State Capitol, to the parking facilities located in the garage of the State Capitol, to the area immediately north of the State Capitol but south of and separated from Court Street by a traffic island, painted markings or other traffic control devices or to the area immediately south of the State Capitol but north of and separated from State Street by a traffic island, painted markings or other traffic control devices.

      (4) The department may not exercise the authority described in this section over grounds and parking structures or facilities located outside the capitol area in the City of Salem that the state owns or that another state agency leases or is acquiring through lease purchase or installment purchase.

      (5) Based upon its findings, the department shall adopt rules for parking motor vehicles or for other transportation uses of the grounds and parking structures or facilities described in subsection (1) of this section. Notice of the rules shall be given by appropriate signs posted on the grounds and in the parking structures or facilities. In adopting the rules, the department shall consider the state policy stated in ORS 276.591.

      (6) The department may lease portions of the grounds and parking structures or facilities described in subsection (1) of this section for parking motor vehicles and for other transportation uses as it determines are appropriate. However, in such leasing, priority shall first be given to the needs of state officers and employees.

      (7) The department shall furnish a space without charge to each statewide elective officer, except those with offices in the State Capitol, and shall designate certain spaces, either free or metered, for use by persons transacting business in state offices. The department may also provide free parking for employees with disabilities who have been issued a disabled person parking permit by the Department of Transportation and who require the use of their vehicle in traveling to and from work. Any spaces not required for leasing to state officers and employees, or for other authorized purposes, may be leased to other persons.

      (8) The department shall retain receipts obtained under this section, except that the department may return to the appropriate agency any net receipts obtained from any parking structures or facilities that are located in the capitol area in the City of Salem and that the state owns or that any agency other than the department leases or is acquiring through lease purchase or installment purchase agreement.

      (9) As used in this section, “capitol area” has the meaning given that term in ORS 276.010. [1977 c.598 §25; 1981 c.591 §2; 1989 c.224 §38; 1991 c.67 §67; 2005 c.217 §22; 2007 c.70 §60; 2007 c.175 §2]

      (2) Based upon its findings, the state agency shall adopt rules for parking of motor vehicles or other transportation uses of such grounds and facilities for which it is responsible under subsection (1) of this section. Notice of the rules shall be given by appropriate signs posted on the grounds and in the facilities. In adopting the rules, the state agency shall consider the state policy stated in ORS 276.591.

      (3) The state agency may lease portions of the facilities and grounds described in subsection (1) of this section for the parking of motor vehicles and other transportation uses as it determines is appropriate. However, in such leasing, priority shall first be given to the needs of state officers and employees. The agency shall designate certain spaces, either free or metered, for use by persons transacting business in state offices. The state agency may also provide free parking for employees with disabilities who have been issued a disabled person parking permit by the Department of Transportation and who require the use of their vehicle in traveling to and from work. Any spaces not required for leasing to state officers and employees, or for other authorized purposes, may be leased to other persons.

      276.598 Car or van pools; rules. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 283.395, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services may establish car pool or van pool programs in which state-owned vehicles are used by state employees as commute vehicles, provided that a daily, weekly or monthly fee is charged that is adequate to reimburse the state for the cost of providing such vehicles for such purposes.

      (2) The department shall prescribe rules which:

      (a) Define the use of state-owned motor vehicles which constitute use in the conduct of state business and distinguish such use from misappropriation for private use;

      (b) Identify procedures for determining and collecting the appropriate charges from employees for the use of commute vehicles; and

      (c) Identify procedures to be used in the operation of state-owned vehicles as commute vehicles in the state car pool or van pool programs authorized in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The department may authorize other state agencies to use state-owned vehicles under the control of such agencies for the purposes set forth in subsection (1) of this section. [1977 c.598 §25b; 1981 c.490 §5]

 

      276.601 Base rate set by agencies; reductions and special fees; disposition of receipts. Consistent with the policies stated in ORS 276.591:

      (1) The base rate for leasing parking spaces described in ORS 276.594 and 276.595 shall be set by the agency responsible for leasing the space. However, the agency may apply a reduction schedule to the base rate, based upon the number of participating riders, to encourage the use of car pools or van pools.

      (2) In order to qualify for the reduced fees authorized under subsection (1) of this section, car pool or van pool participants must register and have validated participation in a car pool or van pool.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the agency responsible for leasing the space to users may:

      (a) Furnish parking spaces free or at reduced rates in designated areas for those employees participating in a program which encourages the use of parking spaces in noncongested areas or where conditions show no or a reduced market for paid parking;

      (b) Establish fees in excess of the base rate where reserved parking is provided, space is leased to other than state employees and officers or for other than state purposes, or where debt service payments or the cost to provide the parking require a higher rate schedule;

      (c) Establish fees less than the base rate where the agency determines that community hardship or significant reduction in demand for the parking is deemed likely to occur; and

      (d) Establish special fees for the parking of motorcycles, bicycles and similar vehicles in state-controlled parking facilities.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided by state or federal law, the receipts obtained under this section shall be retained by the state agency which owns, or controls through direct lease, lease purchase or installment purchase agreement, the grounds or facilities for which such receipts were collected.

STATE AGENCY FACILITY ENERGY DESIGN

 

      276.900 Policy. It is the policy of the State of Oregon that facilities to be constructed or purchased by authorized state agencies be designed, constructed, renovated and operated so as to minimize the use of energy resources and to serve as models of energy efficiency. [1979 c.734 §1; 1989 c.556 §1; 2001 c.683 §1; 2008 c.26 §1]

 

      Note: 276.900 to 276.915 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 276 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      276.905 Definitions for ORS 276.900 to 276.915. As used in ORS 276.900 to 276.915, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Alternative energy system” means an environmentally sound energy system that uses power derived from renewable resources including, but not limited to, the sun, wind, geothermal sources and heat recovery.

      (2) “Authorized state agency” means a state agency, board, commission, department or division that is authorized to finance the construction, purchase or renovation of a facility that is or will be used by the State of Oregon.

      (3) “Cost-effective” means that an energy resource, facility or conservation measure during its life cycle results in delivered power costs to the ultimate consumer no greater than the comparable incremental cost of the least cost alternative new energy resource, facility or conservation measure. Cost comparison shall include, but need not be limited to:

      (a) Cost escalations and future availability of fuels;

      (b) Waste disposal and decommissioning costs;

      (5) “Energy consumption analysis” means the evaluation of all energy systems and components by demand and type of energy including the internal energy load imposed on a major facility by its occupants, equipment and components and the external energy load imposed on a major facility by the climatic conditions of its location. “Energy consumption analysis” includes, but is not limited to:

      (a) The comparison of a range of alternatives that is likely to include all reasonable, cost-effective energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems;

      (b) The simulation of each system over the entire range of operation of a major facility for a year’s operating period;

      (c) The evaluation of energy consumption of component equipment in each system considering the operation of such components at other than full or rated outputs; and

      (d) The consideration of alternative energy systems.

      (6) “Energy savings performance contract” has the meaning given that term in ORS 279A.010.

      (7) “Energy systems” means all utilities, including but not limited to heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and the supply of domestic hot water.

      (8) “Facility” means a building or other structure owned or controlled by an authorized state agency that is used or occupied by employees of the authorized state agency or that is used for conducting public business.

      (9) “Major facility” means a facility that has 10,000 square feet or more of usable floor space.

      (10) “Renovation” means an addition to, alteration of or repair of a facility that adds to or alters the facility’s energy systems, provided that the affected energy systems account for 50 percent or more of the facility’s total energy use.

      276.910 Use of fuel cell power systems in state agency facilities; rules. (1) Before constructing or renovating a major facility, an authorized state agency shall, after comparing various equipment options and to the greatest extent practicable, use fuel cell power systems for emergency backup power applications and for critical power applications in lieu of other equipment options.

      (2)(a) The State Department of Energy shall, in consultation with the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, adopt rules establishing criteria for the comparison of fuel cell power systems and other equipment options required by subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) Criteria to be established under this subsection must address:

      (A) The impact of emissions, including but not limited to nitrous oxide, sulfur oxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and particulates, from various equipment options, on the environment, regardless of whether the equipment is installed indoors or installed outdoors;

      (B) Life cycle costs, including but not limited to acquisition costs, installation and commissioning costs, siting and permitting costs, maintenance costs and fueling and decommissioning costs; and

      (C) The complexity of equipment options and any ancillary equipment. [2009 c.748 §6]

 

      Note: 276.910 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 276 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      276.915 Energy design requirements; rules; fees; waiver. (1) An authorized state agency may construct or renovate a facility only if the authorized state agency determines that the design incorporates all reasonable cost-effective energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems. The determination by the authorized state agency shall include consideration of indoor air quality issues and operation and maintenance costs.

      (2) Whenever an authorized state agency determines that a major facility is to be constructed or renovated, the authorized state agency shall cause to be included in the design phase of the construction or renovation a provision that requires an energy consumption analysis to be prepared for the facility under the direction of a professional engineer or registered architect or under the direction of a person that is prequalified in accordance with this section. The authorized state agency and the State Department of Energy shall agree to the list of energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems that the energy consumption analysis will include. The energy consumption analysis and facility design shall be delivered to the State Department of Energy during the design development phase of the facility design. The State Department of Energy shall review the energy consumption analysis and forward its findings to the authorized state agency within 10 working days after receiving the energy consumption analysis, if practicable.

      (3) The State Department of Energy, in consultation with authorized state agencies, shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of ORS 276.900 to 276.915. These rules shall:

      (a) Include a simplified and usable method for determining which energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems are cost-effective. The method shall reflect the energy costs of the utility serving the facility.

      (b) Prescribe procedures for determining if a facility design incorporates all reasonable cost-effective energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems.

      (c) Establish fees through which an authorized state agency will reimburse the State Department of Energy for the department’s review of energy consumption analyses and facility designs and the department’s reporting tasks. The fees imposed may not exceed 0.2 percent of the capital construction cost of the facility and must be included in the energy consumption analysis required in subsection (2) of this section. The State Department of Energy may provide for a waiver of fees and reviews if the authorized state agency demonstrates that the facility will be designed and constructed in a manner that incorporates only cost-effective energy conservation measures or in a manner that exceeds the energy conservation provisions of the state building code by 20 percent or more.

      (d) Periodically define highly efficient facilities. A facility constructed or renovated after June 30, 2001, shall exceed the energy conservation provisions of the state building code by 20 percent or more, unless otherwise required by rules adopted under this section.

      (e) Establish guidelines for implementing subsection (4) of this section.

      (f) Establish guidelines for incorporating energy efficiency requirements into lease agreements of 10 or more years to be phased in as current lease agreements expire or as new lease agreements are entered into, allowing reasonable time for the owner to implement the requirements of this section.

      (g) Establish criteria by which the State Department of Energy determines that a person is prequalified to perform work in accordance with this section.

      (4) Before June 30, 2015, an authorized state agency shall reduce the total amount of energy the authorized state agency uses in the authorized state agency’s owned facilities by at least 20 percent from a baseline amount the State Department of Energy determines by rule based on usage in calendar year 2000.

      (5) An authorized state agency shall report annually to the State Department of Energy concerning energy use in the authorized state agency’s facilities. The State Department of Energy shall specify by rule the form and content of and deadlines for the reports.

      (6) An authorized state agency that fails to achieve and maintain a 20 percent reduction in energy use on and after June 30, 2015, shall submit biennial energy conservation plans to the State Department of Energy. The State Department of Energy shall specify by rule the form and content of and deadlines for the energy conservation plans.

      (7) The State Department of Energy by rule may require mandatory prequalification as a condition for a person to submit a bid or proposal to perform the following work for an authorized state agency:

      (a) Direct an energy consumption analysis for an authorized state agency under subsection (2) of this section, unless the person is a professional engineer or a registered architect;

      (b) Enter into an energy savings performance contract; or

      (c) Perform energy audits, building commissioning, monitoring and verification services and other services related to the operation and management of a facility’s energy systems, except for architectural, engineering, photogrammetric mapping, transportation planning or land surveying services as defined in ORS 279C.100.

      (8) The State Department of Energy may recover from authorized state agencies the costs associated with administering the provisions of this section, including costs associated with adopting rules, maintaining a state energy use database and prequalifying a person under this section.

      (9) The State Department of Energy and the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall jointly prepare a biennial report summarizing the progress toward achieving the goals of this section. The biennial report shall be made available to the public.
