      279.850 Procurement of product or service; agreements for procurement; exceptions; preferences. (1)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection and subject to paragraph (c) of this subsection, a public agency that intends to procure a product or service on the procurement list that the Oregon Department of Administrative Services established under ORS 279.845 shall, in accordance with the department’s rules, procure the product or service at the price the department establishes from a qualified nonprofit agency for individuals with disabilities, provided that the product or service is of the appropriate specifications and is available within the period the public agency requires.

      (b) A public agency may procure a product or service that is on the procurement list described in paragraph (a) of this subsection from a person other than a qualified nonprofit agency for individuals with disabilities if:

      (A) All of the qualified nonprofit agencies for individuals with disabilities on the procurement list that applies to the public agency have a record in the previous three years of repeatedly violating, or are not now in compliance with, applicable local ordinances or resolutions that govern labor standards; and

      (B) The person, for a period of 90 days after the person enters into an agreement with the public agency, offers to employ the employees of a qualified nonprofit agency for individuals with disabilities from which the public agency would have procured the product or service but for the failure of the qualified nonprofit agency for individuals with disabilities to comply with an applicable local ordinance or resolution that governs labor standards.

      (c) If a public agency may choose to procure a product or service from more than one qualified nonprofit agency for individuals with disabilities, the public agency may give a preference to the qualified nonprofit agency for individuals with disabilities that best demonstrates that the qualified nonprofit agency for individuals with disabilities:

      (A) Complies with all applicable local ordinances and resolutions that govern labor standards; and
