      279A.015 Policy. It is the policy of the State of Oregon, in enacting the Public Contracting Code, that a sound and responsive public contracting system should:

      (1) Simplify, clarify and modernize procurement practices so that they reflect the marketplace and industry standards.

      (2) Instill public confidence through ethical and fair dealing, honesty and good faith on the part of government officials and those who do business with the government.

      (3) Promote efficient use of state and local government resources, maximizing the economic investment in public contracting within this state.

      (4) Clearly identify rules and policies that implement each of the legislatively mandated socioeconomic programs that overlay public contracting and accompany the expenditure of public funds.

      (5) Allow impartial and open competition, protecting both the integrity of the public contracting process and the competitive nature of public procurement. In public procurement, as set out in ORS chapter 279B, meaningful competition may be obtained by evaluation of performance factors and other aspects of service and product quality, as well as pricing, in arriving at best value.

      (6) Provide a public contracting structure that can take full advantage of evolving procurement methods as they emerge within various industries, while preserving competitive bidding as the standard for public improvement contracts unless otherwise exempted. [2003 c.794 §3]

 

      279A.020 Organization of Public Contracting Code. (1) Except as otherwise provided in the Public Contracting Code, all public contracting by a contracting agency is subject to this chapter.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 279C.320, public contracting involving public improvements and other construction services is subject to this chapter and ORS chapter 279C, but not ORS chapter 279B.

      (3) Public contracting involving architects, engineers, photogrammetrists, transportation planners, land surveyors and related services is subject to this chapter and ORS chapter 279C, but not ORS chapter 279B.

      (4) Except as provided in ORS 279C.320, all other public contracting is subject to this chapter and ORS chapter 279B, but not ORS chapter 279C. [2003 c.794 §4; 2005 c.103 §2; 2011 c.458 §9]

 

      279A.025 Application of Public Contracting Code. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) to (4) of this section, the Public Contracting Code applies to all public contracting.

The authority described in this subsection may be delegated in whole or in part in accordance with ORS 279A.075.

      (2) The following requirements and procedures apply to all contracts of state agencies:

      (c) Unless otherwise provided by law, the department or a state agency may enter into a public contract for any period of time, provided that the term of the contract and conditions of renewal or extension are included in the solicitation. Contracting agencies may stipulate in contracts for goods or services that any payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods are subject to the availability and appropriation of funds for the obligations. A contract for goods or services subject to this section may not be construed as violating any applicable debt limitation or limitation on a contracting agency’s expenditure authority.

      (d) When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support continuation of the department’s or a state agency’s performance of a contract in a subsequent fiscal period, the department or state agency may cancel the contract and reimburse the contractor for the reasonable value of any nonrecurring costs incurred but not amortized in the price of the goods or services delivered under the contract. The department or state agency may pay the reimbursement only from any appropriations or funds then lawfully available for such purposes.

Administrative costs incurred in the operation of the fund may be paid from the fund and the amount of such costs shall be added to the cost of the goods, services and personal services as charged to the state agencies.

      (h) The department shall adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection, including but not limited to rules establishing:

      (A) A reporting system for personal service contracts, including architectural, engineering, photogrammetric mapping, transportation planning or land surveying services contracts and related services contracts, that includes the following:

      (i) A state agency shall submit to the department personal services contract information as directed by the department. A state agency shall file with the department a copy of each personal services contract entered into by the state agency, including appropriate documentation as required by the department. Whenever a state agency pays more in a calendar year under a personal services contract for services historically performed by state employees than the agency would have paid to the agency’s employees performing the same work, the agency shall so report to the department and include in the report a statement of justification for the greater costs.

      (ii) The department shall keep the copy of the contract and the department’s documentation on file for three years, after which the department may destroy the file. The department shall maintain a system for filing copies of personal services contracts and documentation submitted to the department under this paragraph. The department shall submit a biennial report to the Legislative Assembly concerning the use of personal services contracts by state agencies. The report must specify the name of each state agency, the amount paid under each personal services contract entered into by the agency, the name of the contractor, the duration of the contract and the contract’s basic purpose.

      279A.142 Limitation of competition. A contracting agency may, by appropriate ordinance, resolution or rule, limit competition for a public contract to emerging small businesses certified under ORS 200.055 if the contract price is estimated at $100,000 or less and is funded by the Emerging Small Business Account established under ORS 200.180. [2007 c.344 §2; 2015 c.565 §14]

 

      279A.145 Recycled product purchasing information. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall include recycled product purchasing information within publications and training programs provided to local governments requesting state government purchasing assistance.

A state contracting agency, in accordance with the Public Contracting Code, may negotiate the terms and conditions set forth in a contract form or contract template but may not vary the terms and conditions without the advice of the Attorney General or legal counsel that the Attorney General approves if the state contracting agency anticipates that the contract form or contract template will be the basis for a public contract with a contract price that exceeds $150,000.

      (A) The state contracting agency receives approval from the Attorney General or, if the state contracting agency is subject to ORS 279A.140, from the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, unless the state contracting agency determines that the contract price for the public contract is unlikely to exceed $150,000;

      (B) The nature of the procurement is unique and the public contract requires specific terms and conditions to accommodate the unique nature of the procurement or the state contracting agency, in accordance with provisions in the solicitation documents for the procurement, negotiated terms and conditions for the public contract that differ from the terms and conditions in a contract form or contract template;

      (C) The state contracting agency consults the Attorney General, or legal counsel that the Attorney General approves, to develop appropriate terms and conditions for the public contract and for legal advice during all phases of the procurement for which the Attorney General determines that legal advice is necessary and relevant; and

      (D) The state contracting agency submits the public contract to the Attorney General for approval for legal sufficiency, if the provisions of ORS 291.047 require the submission.

      (d) This subsection does not apply to a procurement that a state contracting agency conducts under ORS 279B.065, 279B.080 or 279C.110 (11).

The Secretary of State and the State Treasurer may elect to use solicitation templates, contract forms or contract templates that the Attorney General and the department develop.

      (4) The Attorney General and the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall cooperate to:

      (a) Develop and make available solicitation templates, contract forms and contract templates for procurements or classes of procurements that state contracting agencies require; and
