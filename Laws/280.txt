TAXATION FOR LOCAL PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS

 

      280.040 Definitions for ORS 280.040 to 280.145; use of certain tax revenues. (1) As used in ORS 280.040 to 280.145:

      (a) “Local option tax” means a tax described under section 11 (4) or (7)(c), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (b) “Subdivision” includes only such counties, municipal corporations, quasi-municipal corporations and civil or political corporations or subdivisions as are empowered by law to levy ad valorem property taxes, except that “subdivision” does not include an education service district.

      (2) All ad valorem tax revenues that are received by any subdivision as a result of a levy under ORS 280.040 to 280.090 and that are derived from an ad valorem tax levied for purposes other than general operations shall be:

      (a) Kept by the treasurer or other financial officer in a fund that is separate and distinct from other funds of the subdivision.

      (b) Expended only for the purpose for which the taxes were imposed. [Amended by 1997 c.541 §302; 1999 c.632 §21; 1999 c.1094 §1]

 

      280.050 Providing funds for financing cost of services, projects, property and equipment. Funds may be obtained as prescribed in ORS 280.040 to 280.145 for the purpose of financing the cost of any service, project, property or equipment which a subdivision has lawful power to perform, construct or acquire, and of repairs and improvements thereto and of maintenance and replacement thereof. [Amended by 1967 c.203 §4]

 

      280.055 Obtaining and advancing of funds to county service districts. Funds may be obtained by a county as prescribed by ORS 280.040 to 280.145 for the purpose of advancing funds to a district established under ORS 451.410 to 451.610 to finance the cost of any service facility which the district is authorized to construct, maintain and operate. [1969 c.646 §17]

 

      280.057 Local option taxes for community colleges; maximum amount. A local option tax levied by a community college district or community college service district may not exceed the amount of reduction in ad valorem property taxes caused under ORS 310.200 to 310.242. [1997 c.541 §308b]

 

      Note: 280.057 was added to and made a part of 280.040 to 280.145 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      280.060 Levy of local option taxes outside constitutional limitation; duration of levy; approval of levy as approval of bonds. (1) Upon approval of a majority of the electors of a subdivision in a manner that qualifies under section 11 (8), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, a subdivision may levy local option taxes outside the limitation imposed by section 11 (3), Article XI, Oregon Constitution, over the period of time that is authorized by the electors. The amount levied each year shall be:

      (a) Uniform, or substantially so, throughout the period during which the taxes are levied; or

      (b) Computed annually at the same dollar rate per thousand dollars assessed value in the subdivision, such rate to be declared in and made a part of the ballot measure to be submitted to the electorate.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a subdivision may certify for extension on the assessment and tax roll under ORS 310.060 a lesser amount of local option tax or a lesser rate of local option tax if the subdivision decides to collect less than the entire local option tax authorized by electors. The subdivision shall certify the lesser amount or rate in the written notice required to be made under ORS 310.060.

      (3)(a) The period of time authorized by the electors shall not exceed five years or, if the local option tax is for capital projects, the lesser of:

      (A) The expected useful life of the capital projects to be financed by the tax; or

      (B) Ten years.

      (b) A local option tax for capital projects does not exceed the expected useful life of the capital projects financed by the tax if the estimated weighted average life of the tax does not exceed the estimated dollar weighted average of the capital assets comprising the capital projects that are to be financed by the tax. The estimated dollar weighted average life of capital projects shall be calculated under rules of the Department of Revenue that ensure that a local option tax for capital projects is levied for no more than 10 years and no more than the useful life of the component of the capital projects financed by the tax that has the longest useful life.

      (4)(a) All local option taxes authorized by ORS 280.040 to 280.145 that are for capital projects and that have a term of more than five years shall be submitted to electors separately from local option taxes with a term of five years or less.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, “capital project” means the acquisition of land upon which to construct an improvement, the acquisition of a building, the acquisition or construction of improvements, the acquisition of an addition to a building which increases the square footage of the building, the construction of a building, the construction of an addition to an existing building which increases the square footage of the building or the acquisition of and installation of machinery and equipment which will become an integral part of a building or an addition to a building, the purchase of furnishings, equipment or other tangible property with an expected useful life of more than one year or a combination of those items.

      (5) If a ballot measure authorizing a local option tax states that the taxing district may issue bonds that are payable from that tax, voter approval of the tax shall constitute voter approval of the bonds, except that the approval shall not entitle the taxing district to collect a greater amount of tax than the taxing district would have been entitled to collect if the ballot measure only authorized local option taxes and did not authorize bonds. If the local option tax is approved by voters in a manner that qualifies under section 11 (8), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, then the taxing body may issue the bonds in a principal amount that, together with the estimated interest to be paid on the bonds while the bonds are outstanding, does not exceed the revenues estimated to be received from the local option tax levy. A taxing district may pledge the revenues received from the local option tax and the taxing district’s full faith and credit to pay bonds authorized under this subsection. [Amended by 1953 c.134 §2; 1977 c.730 §1; 1979 c.241 §24; 1981 c.804 §79; 1989 c.658 §1; 1997 c.541 §303; 1999 c.21 §6; 1999 c.559 §4; 1999 c.1094 §2]

 

      280.064 Period for use of revenues raised by local option tax. Subject to ORS 294.305 to 294.565 and the applicable provisions of a charter, ordinance or resolution of a subdivision, a subdivision may use revenues raised by a local option tax beyond the period of years during which the subdivision is authorized to levy the local option tax if the revenue is used for the purpose authorized by the electors. [2003 c.195 §6]

 

      Note: 280.064 was added to and made a part of 280.040 to 280.145 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (3) An election within a political subdivision other than a county or city for the purpose of approving a tax levy or tax rate under ORS 280.060 or under section 11 (3)(c), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, shall be called by the governing body of the subdivision and held on a date specified in ORS 255.345.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the ballot title for a measure authorizing the imposition of local option taxes shall contain the following additional statement:

      (5) As part of the question, the ballot title for a measure authorizing or renewing the authorization of the imposition of local option taxes shall state:

      (a) The length in years of the period during which the proposed local option tax will be imposed.

      280.075 Ballot statements for local option tax measures. (1) Notwithstanding any other law and when not inconsistent with or otherwise provided for in the Oregon Constitution, whenever a proposed local option tax is submitted to a vote of the people by any subdivision, the statement in the ballot title for the measure that explains the chief purpose of the measure and gives reasons for the measure shall state the total amount of money to be raised by the proposed local option tax, in dollars and cents. If the statement in the ballot title for the measure submitted includes an estimated tax impact, it shall be based on the most current estimate of assessed value from the county assessor. The measure shall bear the statement: “The estimated tax cost for this measure is an ESTIMATE ONLY based on the best information available from the county assessor at the time of estimate and may reflect the impact of early payment discounts, compression and the collection rate.”

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a local option tax described in ORS 280.060 (1)(b). For a levy described in ORS 280.060 (1)(b), an estimate of the total amount of money to be raised for each year of the proposed local option tax shall be stated in dollars and cents. If the levy described in ORS 280.060 (1)(b) raises more money than estimated, the excess collections above that estimate shall be considered a budget resource for the levy fund in the next fiscal year of the subdivision. This section does not apply to an election authorizing general obligation bonds or the tax levies to repay general obligation bonds.

(Cities)

 

      280.410 Definitions for ORS 280.410 to 280.485. As used in ORS 280.410 to 280.485 unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1)(a) “Economic development project” includes any properties, real or personal, used or useful in connection with a revenue producing enterprise.

      (b) “Economic development project” also includes multiple unit residential housing development, including low income single room occupancy housing, on land having an assessed valuation of $8 per square foot or more on September 13, 1975, land within a designated urban renewal or redevelopment area formed pursuant to ORS chapter 457, or projects which benefit low or moderate income tenants, or address slum and blight as defined by the 1974 Housing and Community Development Act.

      (c) “Economic development project” shall not include any facility or facilities designed primarily for the operation, transmission, sale or distribution of electrical energy.

      (2) “Eligible project” means an economic development project found by the city to meet standards adopted pursuant to ORS 280.410 to 280.485.

      (3) “City” means any city with a population of 70,000 or more.

      (4) “Cost” as applied to any project includes:

      (a) The cost of construction and reconstruction;

      (b) The cost of acquisition of property, including rights in land and other property, both real and personal and improved and unimproved and the cost of site improvements;

      (c) The cost of demolishing, removing or relocating any buildings or structures on lands so acquired, including the cost of acquiring any lands to which the buildings or structures may be moved or relocated;

      (d) The cost of eligible machinery and equipment and related financing charges;

      (e) The cost of engineering and architectural surveys, plans and specifications;

      (f) The cost of financing charges and interest prior to and during construction, and if deemed advisable by the city for a period not exceeding one year after completion of construction; and

      (g) The cost of consultant and legal services, other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of constructing a project, administrative and other expenses necessary or incident to the construction of the project, including, but not limited to, costs of relocation and moving expenses according to a project plan developed by the city, and the financing of the construction of the project thereof, including reimbursement to any state or other governmental agency or any lessee of such project for the expenditures made with the approval of the city that would be costs of the project under ORS 280.410 to 280.485 had they been made directly by the city.

      (5) “Low income” means an income not exceeding 80 percent of the prevailing median income, based on family size, within the city. [1977 c.772 §2; 1979 c.865 §1; 1981 c.368 §1; 1991 c.560 §1; 2003 c.286 §1]

 

      280.415 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Cities with a population of 70,000 or more should be granted the powers granted to the state by ORS 285B.320 to 285B.371 in order to reduce substantially within their boundaries the occurrence of economic conditions requiring more expensive remedial action. There exist in Oregon’s larger cities substantial adverse economic conditions requiring immediate remedial action. Such conditions include decreasing opportunities for gainful employment and lack of sites and facilities for orderly and necessary retail, commercial and industrial growth. Amelioration of these conditions is deemed a public purpose and the acquisition of property for such purpose is deemed a public use. To meet the needs of these cities it is necessary to grant them full authority to undertake and complete development and redevelopment projects, and to assist public and private organizations engaged in such projects, including the issuance of industrial or other nonrecourse revenue bonds. It is the purpose of ORS 280.410 to 280.485 to authorize the exercise of such powers by cities with a population of 70,000 in addition to and not in lieu of any other powers such cities may possess.

      (2) The lack of residential housing in the core and inner areas of Oregon’s larger cities also is a cause of adverse economic conditions. Development of housing in such areas can be a factor which contributes to orderly economic growth by providing decent housing for workers necessary to attract and promote desirable retail, commercial and industrial growth. Therefore it is also the purpose of ORS 280.410 to 280.485 to permit cities with a population of 70,000 or more authority to issue revenue bonds for housing purposes. The Legislative Assembly, in granting this authority, intends to increase Oregon’s available housing stock. In exercising options under that authority, preference should be given by cities to those projects which add housing units through new construction or rehabilitation of nonresidential buildings. For low income single room occupancy housing, however, cities may renovate existing single room housing, convert nonresidential buildings or construct new buildings.

      (3) Cities with a population of 70,000 or more suffer from a lack of available mortgage financing for the purchase of multiple unit homes in such cities. There is a need for a low-cost mortgage financing for multiple unit home purchasers in order to prevent urban decay and blight and to promote the economic well-being of those cities. [1977 c.772 §1; 1979 c.865 §2; 1981 c.368 §2; 2003 c.286 §2]

      280.420 Eligibility of projects for financing; standards; ordinance for applications. Prior to exercising any power granted by ORS 280.410 to 280.485 the governing body of a city shall:

      (1) Adopt by ordinance standards to determine the eligibility of economic development projects. In determining such standards, the governing body shall consider all relevant data without giving priority to one factor over others. The governing body may consider but is not limited to the following:

      (a) Density of use and potential impact in the area affected by the proposed project;

      (b) City’s ability to support other needed services resulting from economic development projects;

      (c) Effect of economic development projects on balanced economic development of the city;

      (d) Employment opportunities; and

      (e) Suitability of various areas in the city for particular types of economic development projects.

      (2) Adopt by ordinance procedures for the acceptance and processing of applications for consideration of the eligibility of economic development projects. The ordinance shall state what city officers shall receive such applications and shall provide for the content of any application form. [1977 c.772 §3]

 

      280.422 Exception to eligibility standards. Low income single room occupancy housing projects need not meet the standards of an eligible project and any city standards adopted pursuant to ORS 280.410 to 280.485. [1981 c.368 §6]

 

      280.424 Bond-financed single room occupancy rental housing to conform with federal law. Single room occupancy rental housing financed with bonds authorized by ORS 280.410, 280.415, 280.422 to 280.425 and 280.431 must conform to the requirements of the Federal Mortgage Subsidy Bond Tax Act of 1980.

      280.425 City powers concerning property. In carrying out the provisions of ORS 280.410 to 280.485, a city may:

      (1) Acquire by agreement, donation or exercise of eminent domain, construct and hold in whole or in part any lands, buildings, easements, water and air rights, improvements to lands and buildings and capital equipment to be located permanently or used exclusively on such lands or in such buildings, which are deemed necessary in connection with an eligible project to be situated within the city and construct, reconstruct, improve, better and extend such projects, and enter into contracts therefor.

      (2) Sell and convey all properties acquired in connection with eligible projects, including without limitation the sale and conveyance thereof subject to any mortgage and the sale and conveyance thereof under an option granted to the lessee of the eligible project, for such price, and at such time as the city may determine. However, no sale or conveyance of such properties shall ever be made in such manner as to impair the rights of interests of the holder, or holders, of any bonds issued under the authority of ORS 280.410 to 280.485.

      (3) Make or participate in the making of loans, including mortgage loans, to provide for the construction, substantial rehabilitation or permanent financing of eligible projects and undertake commitments to make such loans.

      (4) For mortgage loans under subsection (3) of this section and ORS 280.430 (5), purchase and sell those mortgage loans at public or private sale; modify or alter such mortgages; foreclose on any such mortgage or security interest or commence any action to protect or enforce any right conferred upon the city by any law, mortgage, security, agreement, contract or other agreement and bid for and purchase property that is subject to such mortgage or security interest at any foreclosure or other sale; acquire or take possession of any such property and complete, administer, pay the principal and interest on any obligations incurred in connection with such property and dispose of such property in such a manner as the city determines necessary to protect its interest under ORS 280.410 to 280.485. [1977 c.772 §5; 1979 c.865 §3; 1981 c.368 §3; 2003 c.286 §3]

      (b) Rents to be charged for the use of the projects shall be fixed, and revised from time to time as necessary, so as to produce income and revenue sufficient to provide for the prompt payment when due of principal of, and interest on, all bonds issued under ORS 280.410 to 280.485;

A city shall equitably allocate the origination and servicing of mortgages under this subsection to private lending institutions in accordance with standards adopted by the city;

      (6) Make all contracts, execute and deliver all instruments, including any loan agreements or notes, and do all things necessary or convenient in the exercise of the powers granted by this section, or in the performance of its covenants or duties, or in order to secure the payment of its bonds, including a contract entered into prior to the construction, acquisition and installation of the eligible project authorizing the borrower or lessee, subject to such terms and conditions as the city shall find necessary or desirable and proper, to provide for the construction, acquisition and installation of the buildings, improvements and equipment to be included in the project by any means available to the borrower or lessee and in the manner determined by the borrower or lessee, and without advertisement for bids as may be required for the construction, acquisition or installation of other public facilities;

      (7) Perform any other duties that the city considers necessary in carrying out ORS 280.410 to 280.485, including but not limited to, efforts to minimize the effects of displacement of residents resulting from projects financed under ORS 280.425 (3);

      (8) Enter into and perform such contracts and agreements with political subdivisions and state agencies as the respective governing bodies of the same may consider proper and feasible for or concerning the planning, construction, installation, lease, or other acquisition, and the financing of such facilities, which contracts and agreements may establish a board, commission or such other body as may be deemed proper for the supervision and general management of the facilities of the eligible project; and

      (9) Accept from any authorized agency of the federal government loans or grants for the planning, construction, acquisition, leasing, or other provision of any eligible project, and enter into agreements with such agency respecting such loans or grants. [1977 c.772 §4; 1979 c.865 §4; 2003 c.286 §4]

 

      280.431 Required condition of purchase for low income single room occupancy housing project.

This subsection shall not apply to housing projects occupied exclusively by households, the heads of which are 62 years of age or older.

      (4) Regardless of the ownership of property used for a multiple unit housing project financed under ORS 280.425 (3), a city shall, in financing the project, provide a plan for relocation of displaced persons.

      (5) A city shall not finance projects under ORS 280.425 (3) which result in the conversion of existing occupied residential rental units to cooperative or condominium projects. [1979 c.865 §2d]

 

      280.435 Limitation on city power. Except as provided in ORS 280.425 (2), the city shall not have power to operate any eligible project as a business or in any manner whatsoever, and nothing in ORS 280.410 to 280.485 authorizes the city to expend any funds on any eligible project, other than the revenues of such projects, or the proceeds of revenue bonds issued hereunder, or other funds granted to or appropriated by the city for the purposes of an eligible project.

In determining financial responsibility of the borrower, lessee or purchaser, consideration shall be given to the borrower’s, lessee’s or purchaser’s ratio of current assets to current liabilities, net worth, earning trends, coverage of all fixed charges, the nature of the industry or business involved, its inherent stability, any guarantee of the obligations by some other financially responsible corporation, firm or person, and other factors determinative of the capability of the borrower, lessee or purchaser, financially and otherwise, to fulfill its obligations consistently with the purposes of ORS 280.410 to 280.485.

      280.465 Validity of bonds.

The official action authorizing such bonds may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to ORS 280.410 to 280.485 and such recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.

      (a) Shall not be payable from nor charged upon any funds other than the revenue pledged to the payment thereof, except as provided in this section, nor shall the city be subject to any liability thereon. No holder or holders of such bonds shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the city to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon, nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of the city except those projects or portions thereof, mortgaged or otherwise encumbered under the provisions and for the purposes of ORS 280.410 to 280.485.

(Counties)

 

      280.500 County economic development plan; criteria. In addition to, and not in lieu of, any of the powers granted counties under the laws of this state, a county may develop and implement a program of economic development. To do so, a county shall have the power to:

When moneys are received by a county upon condition or with the intent of the receiving county that the moneys be used for a public purpose revolving loan fund, the county may dedicate the moneys for the purposes of the revolving loan fund and payment of the expenses of administering the fund by enacting an ordinance that:

      (1) Establishes a separate fund into which all moneys to be used for economic development revolving loans or grants may be deposited together with proceeds, including loan fees and interest, received from processing and repayment of such loans;

      (2) Specifies the public purpose and the scope and limitation of uses of moneys in the fund; and

      (3) Provides for distribution of fund assets if the governing body of the county determines, after a public hearing, that dissolution of the fund is in the best interests of the public. [1991 c.332 §1]
