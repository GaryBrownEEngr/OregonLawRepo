      (a) Control and manage all state printing.

      (b) Control all state printing purchases, including those outside of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services; and any printing conducted outside of the department on behalf of state government may be conducted only through authority of the director or the director’s designee.

      (2) Printing and binding that advertises or promotes products, agricultural or manufactured, shall not be considered state printing.

      (3) The director or the director’s designee may advertise for bids and award contracts for state printing, but the policy of the director or the director’s designee in deciding what work shall be let by contract shall be dictated by questions of good business and economy. [Amended by 1959 c.293 §1; 1975 c.605 §2; 1995 c.452 §11; 2001 c.539 §2]

      282.030 Submitting copy specifications for approval by director or designee. (1) Before being printed all copy specifications must be submitted to the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services or the director’s designee for review and approval as to format, style and quality in accordance with rules of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. The director or the director’s designee may in the interest of economy, revise the specifications but not in such a manner as to destroy the purpose or quantity of the copy.

The department further may require transfers of duplicating equipment between agencies where doing so would result in efficiency and economy.
