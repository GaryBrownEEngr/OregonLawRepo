      Note: See note under 283.085.

 

      283.089 Authority of Director of Oregon Department of Administrative Services regarding financing agreements. (1) The Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services may:

      (a) Enter into agreements with trustees to hold financing agreement proceeds, payments and reserves as security for lenders, and to issue certificates of participation in the right to receive payments due from the state under a financing agreement. The trustee shall invest amounts held by the trustee at the direction of the State Treasurer. Interest earned on any investments held by a trustee as security for a financing agreement, at the option of the director, may be credited to the accounts held by the trustee and applied in payment of sums due under a financing agreement.

      (b) Enter into credit enhancement agreements for financing agreements or certificates of participation, provided that amounts due under credit enhancement agreements are payable solely from available funds and amounts received from the exercise of property rights granted under the financing agreements.

      (c) Use the gross proceeds of financing agreements for the purposes described in ORS 283.085 (3) and to pay the costs of reserves, credit enhancements and other costs associated with issuing, administering and maintaining the financing.

      (d) Use a single financing agreement to finance property to be used by multiple state agencies.

      (e) Subject to ORS 283.087 (2)(b), grant leases of real property with a trustee or lender. The leases may be for a term that ends on the date on which all amounts due under a financing agreement have been paid or provision for payment has been made, or 10 years after the last scheduled payment under a financing agreement, whichever is later. The leases may grant the trustee or lender the right to evict the state and exclude it from possession of the real property for the term of the lease if the state fails to pay when due the amounts scheduled to be paid under a financing agreement or otherwise defaults under a financing agreement. Upon default, the trustee or lender may sublease the real property to third parties and apply any rentals toward payments scheduled to be made under a financing agreement.

      (f) Subject to ORS 283.087 (2)(b), grant security interests in personal property to trustees or lenders. The security interests attach and are perfected on the date the state takes possession of the personal property, or the date the lender advances money under a financing agreement, whichever is later. A security interest authorized by this section has priority over all other liens and claims. Upon default, the secured party has the rights and remedies available to a secured party under ORS chapter 79 for a first, perfected security interest in goods and fixtures. Within 10 days after a security interest authorized by this section attaches, the state shall cause a financing statement for the security interest to be filed with the Secretary of State in the same manner as financing statements are filed for goods. However, failure to file the statement does not affect the perfection of the security interest.

      (g) Pledge for the benefit of trustees and lenders any amounts that are deposited with a trustee in accordance with a financing agreement. The pledge is valid and binding from the time it is made. Amounts pledged are subject to the lien of the pledge immediately without filing, physical delivery or other act. The lien of the pledge is superior to all other claims and liens of any kind whatsoever.

      (h) Bill any state agency that benefits from a financing agreement for an appropriate share of the financing costs on a monthly or other periodic basis, and deposit payments received in connection with the billings with a trustee as security for a financing agreement. Any state agency receiving such a bill shall pay the amounts billed from the first amounts legally available to it. The director shall allocate in appropriate shares the financing costs of a financing agreement entered into for the purpose described in ORS 283.085 (3)(d) among all state agencies based on their payroll costs.

      (i) Purchase fire and extended coverage or other casualty insurance for property acquired or refinanced with proceeds of a financing agreement, assign the proceeds of the insurance to a lender or trustee to the extent of their interest and covenant to maintain the insurance while the financing agreement is unpaid, so long as available funds are sufficient to purchase the insurance.

      (2) As used in this section, “state agency” has the meaning given that term in ORS 286A.730. [1989 c.1032 §3; 2001 c.445 §170; 2003 c.746 §11; 2007 c.783 §95a; 2013 c.767 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 283.085.

 

      283.091 Governor’s budget to include amount needed to pay amounts due on unpaid financing agreements. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall include in the Governor’s budget for each fiscal period amounts sufficient to permit the payment of all amounts which will be due on unpaid financing agreements during that fiscal period. [1989 c.1032 §4; 2016 c.117 §46]

 

      Note: See note under 283.085.

 

      283.092 Effect of financing agreement on tax status. A lease or financing agreement authorized by ORS 283.085 to 283.092 shall not cause property to be subject to property taxation and shall be disregarded in determining whether property is exempt from taxation under ORS chapter 307. [1989 c.1032 §5; 2007 c.783 §96]

 

      Note: See note under 283.085.

 

      283.095 Authority for state agency to enter into financing agreement. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Financing agreement” has the meaning given that term in ORS 283.085.

      (b) “State agency” has the meaning given that term in ORS 283.089.

      (2) If authorized by a provision of law other than ORS 283.085 to 283.092, a state agency may enter into a financing agreement with a principal amount of $100,000 or less.

      (3) Notwithstanding any authority in a provision of law other than ORS 283.085 to 283.092, a state agency may not enter into a financing agreement in an amount that exceeds $100,000. [2013 c.767 §2; 2015 c.767 §83; 2015 c.828 §24]

 

      Note: 283.095 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 283 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (B) A statement of reasons why rental of a standard passenger vehicle, use of a vehicle owned by an authorized driver or borrowing a vehicle from another state agency or institution is not a satisfactory alternative to ownership or assignment of a standard passenger vehicle. [1997 c.848 §5]

 

      283.314 Replacement of state-owned vehicle when replacement mileage standard is exceeded. A standard passenger vehicle owned or assigned to the state agency or institution must be replaced after the number of miles the vehicle has been driven exceeds the replacement mileage standard defined under rules adopted under ORS 283.313.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the department shall, upon request of any state law enforcement agency or state parole or probation agency for which the department obtains vehicles, obtain for the agencies vehicles that are not marked as required by subsection (1) of this section and that have registration described in ORS 805.060. [Formerly 291.724; 1987 c.6 §3; 1993 c.741 §118]

 

      283.395 Driving state-owned vehicles for private purposes prohibited; rules. (1) No person shall drive, operate or use, or authorize or permit any person to drive, operate or use, any motor vehicle as defined in ORS 283.305 for any purpose except for official state business as defined in ORS 283.305 and by rule of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services.

      (2) The department shall adopt rules to distinguish private from public purposes. [Formerly 291.726; 1991 c.176 §5; 1993 c.335 §10]

 

      283.398 Findings and goals for zero-emission vehicles; purchasing requirements; rules. (1) As used in this section and ORS 283.401, “zero-emission vehicle” means a battery electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle or a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle or any type of vehicle defined by the State Department of Energy or the Environmental Quality Commission by rule as a “zero-emission vehicle” if the vehicle’s type and fuel are consistent with the goals set forth in this section.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Motor vehicle emissions contribute significantly to air pollution in this state.

      (b) In 2019, the Oregon transportation sector was responsible for approximately 40 percent of this state’s greenhouse gas emissions, and light-duty vehicles were responsible for more than half of the transportation sector’s emissions.

      (c) Motor vehicle emissions, especially greenhouse gases, are difficult to reduce and will rise over time if not limited by additional laws and regulations.

      (d) Absent significant changes in the types of motor vehicles used by people and businesses in Oregon, the state will not meet the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals set forth in ORS 468A.205.

      (e) In ORS 757.357, the Legislative Assembly found that transportation electrification is necessary to reduce petroleum use, achieve optimum levels of energy efficiency and carbon reduction, meet federal and state air quality standards, meet this state’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals set forth in ORS 468A.205 and improve the public health and safety.

      (f) Existing federal and state incentives and programs are insufficient to transform the motor vehicle market on a timeline that will protect Oregonians from the worst impacts of global climate change.

      (g) The purchase and ownership of zero-emission vehicles can reduce the overall energy costs paid by Oregon households and the specific costs associated with meeting transportation needs.

      (h) A robust and well-operating market for zero-emission vehicles is essential to meeting this state’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.

      (i) Certain residents and communities face greater barriers to purchasing or leasing zero-emission vehicles, and additional support and innovative solutions are necessary to ensure that all Oregon households benefit from transportation electrification.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares the following goals:

      (a) Transformation of the motor vehicle market must occur no later than 2035.

      (b) Programs and support must be provided to accelerate Oregonians’ purchase and use of zero-emission vehicles until greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles are declining at a rate consistent with this state’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals set forth in ORS 468A.205.

      (c) The adoption and use of zero-emission vehicles must be evaluated regularly to determine whether the rate of the adoption and use of zero-emission vehicles will put the state on course to meet its greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.

      (4) To promote acquisition and use of zero-emission vehicles, all entities of the executive department, as defined in ORS 174.112, shall lead by example by:

      (a) Purchasing or leasing light-duty or medium-duty zero-emission vehicles, consistent with ORS 283.327, when purchasing or leasing vehicles;

      (b) Adopting policies and rules that promote the goals set forth in this section; and

      (c) Considering recommendations submitted in the report required by ORS 283.401 that relate to zero-emission vehicles and adopting the recommendations when feasible. [2019 c.565 §1]

 

      Note: 283.398 and 283.401 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 283 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      283.400 [1979 c.230 §1; repealed by 1991 c.399 §6]

 

      283.401 Report concerning utilization of zero-emission vehicles within state; recommendations for legislation. (1) On or before September 15 of each odd-numbered year, the State Department of Energy shall submit to the Governor and an interim committee of the Legislative Assembly related to the environment a report on adoption of zero-emission vehicles in this state and the progress the state is making to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. The report shall provide:

      (a) A review, using existing studies, market reports, polling data or other publicly available information, of the market in this state for zero-emission vehicles and any barriers to adopting zero-emission vehicles in this state;

      (b) An assessment of the state’s progress in promoting the goals set forth in ORS 283.398; and

      (c) The date on which the state is predicted to meet the goals set forth in ORS 283.398.

      (2) The department may contract with third parties to assist in performing the duties described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The department shall assess the state’s progress under subsection (1)(b) of this section. The assessment must focus on commercially available, or near-commercially available, zero-emission vehicle technology, to the extent possible, and rely on existing studies, data and analysis. In the assessment, the department shall evaluate:

      (a) Whether the transportation sector is on course to reduce the share of greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, as defined in ORS 801.360, consistent with the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals set forth in ORS 468A.205.

      (b) The sales figures and numbers of zero-emission vehicles that are owned in Oregon, including forecasts as to whether:

      (A) By 2020, 50,000 registered motor vehicles will be zero-emission vehicles;

      (B) By 2025, at least 250,000 registered motor vehicles will be zero-emission vehicles;

      (C) By 2030, at least 25 percent of registered motor vehicles, and at least 50 percent of new motor vehicles sold annually, will be zero-emission vehicles; and

      (D) By 2035, at least 90 percent of new motor vehicles sold annually will be zero-emission vehicles.

      (c) The sales figures and numbers of zero-emission vehicles that are owned in Oregon, differentiated, to the extent feasible, by demographic factors, including whether persons that own zero-emission vehicles reside in urban or rural areas.

      (d) The availability and reliability of public and private electric vehicle charging infrastructure that is needed to support the targets for zero-emission vehicle sales and registration identified in paragraph (b) of this subsection. The department shall assess reliability under this paragraph only if the department requests and obtains information on reliability from providers of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

      (e) The incremental purchase cost difference, before and after federal and state incentives, between the purchase cost of a zero-emission vehicle and the purchase cost of a comparable vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine.

      (f) The zero-emission vehicles that are available for purchase in all market segments.

      (g) Oregonians’ awareness of motor vehicle options, the benefits of owning zero-emission vehicles and the true costs of motor vehicle ownership.

      (h) The carbon intensity of fuel consumed by the Oregon transportation sector as a whole.

      (i) The general progress toward electrification of all fossil fuel-based transportation modes.

      (j) Opportunities to minimize impacts to the electric grid from transportation electrification, including rate design, managed charging, vehicle-to-grid services and electricity conservation techniques.

      (k) In consultation with the Department of Transportation, the impact of the sales and ownership of zero-emission vehicles on revenues that would otherwise accrue to the State Highway Fund under ORS 366.505.

      (4) If the State Department of Energy determines that the state is not on course to meet the goals set forth in ORS 283.398, the department shall make recommendations in the report required by this section, including recommendations for legislation. Recommended legislation:

      (a) May not mandate required levels of motor vehicle sales.

      (b) Must promote the zero-emission vehicle market, address barriers to adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the light-duty portion of the transportation sector, encourage transportation electrification and further the goals set forth in ORS 283.398. [2019 c.565 §2]

MASTER ASBESTOS MANAGEMENT PLAN

 

      283.415 Legislative findings; policy. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Asbestos has been found to be a human carcinogen. There is no known safe level for human exposure to asbestos. Ailments caused by asbestos can become manifest many years after exposure.

      (2) In a decayed or damaged state, asbestos can pose a health risk to employees, adults in custody, patients or residents of state institutions. This state does not know where asbestos-containing materials exist in its buildings nor in what condition those materials are to be found.

      (3) It is the goal of the Legislative Assembly to assure that state facilities are safely maintained and operated. It is, therefore, the policy of the Legislative Assembly that:

      (a) A Master Asbestos Management Plan be developed that will assure orderly well-reasoned asbestos control and abatement.

      (b) As any conditions of immediate hazard to health become known, they be acted on promptly in accordance with the Master Asbestos Management Plan.

      (c) The plan include standards for employee awareness and training.

      (d) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services be the agency to develop and centrally manage the plan for this state.

      (e) Each agency cooperate fully in carrying out the plan.

      (f) The State of Oregon engage in a long-term commitment to control the asbestos hazard in state facilities through control and abatement. [1989 c.1037 §1; 2019 c.213 §128]
