OREGON TOURISM COMMISSION

 

      284.101 Definitions for ORS 284.101 to 284.148. As used in ORS 284.101 to 284.148, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Commission” means the Oregon Tourism Commission.

      (2) “Executive director” means the executive director of the Oregon Tourism Commission. [Formerly 285A.255]

 

      284.104 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Travel and recreation industries are important to the State of Oregon as a whole, and the health of these industries affects the well-being of all Oregonians.

      (2) Tourist facilities and attractions serve the recreational and cultural needs of both visitors and residents.

      (3) It is in the public interest to encourage the orderly growth and development of nonpolluting, labor-intensive industries such as tourism within the state.

      (4) The travel and recreation industries have become increasingly important to the economic growth of the state and will become more important in the future because of increased leisure time and declining employment opportunities in other traditional Oregon industries.

      (5) State involvement in tourism, recreational and cultural activities needs to be better coordinated to respond effectively to state interests and, where appropriate, to meet the needs of local governments and the private sector.

      (6) There is a need to encourage communication, partnership and cooperation between the public and private sectors of the industry to promote orderly growth and implementation of statewide objectives.

      (7) It is desirable that there be an agency in state government to act in matters pertaining to public relations.

      (8) It is in the public interest to promote quality, integrity and reliability in all tourism and tourism related services and in information offered to visitors to the State of Oregon.

      (9) Oregonians want to preserve the historical and cultural foundations of the state as a living part of community life and development and to insure future generations and visitors the opportunity to appreciate and enjoy the rich heritage of Oregon.

      (10) Planning and promotion of tourism and recreation should be compatible with other state interests in energy development and conservation, environmental protection, transportation and the judicious use of natural resources.

      (11) It is in the best interest of the nation and the tourism and recreation industries to proceed in an orderly fashion toward the development of a promotional program for advancing and enhancing tourism in the state. [Formerly 285A.258]

PACIFIC NORTHWEST MANUFACTURING PARTNERSHIP

 

      284.590 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) New approaches are needed to plan the way economic development takes place in the manufacturing sectors of this state. The concept of manufacturing business ecosystems has become relevant as the focus of economic development in manufacturing sectors extends to regional economic communities of interacting organizations and individuals who produce and consume goods and services in a specified region. Such manufacturing business ecosystems include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, investors, consumers and other stakeholders.

      (2) Over time, manufacturing business ecosystems evolve as members share capabilities and resources and align objectives. Such manufacturing business ecosystems enable regions of similar focus and interests to share visions, align investments and provide mutually supportive roles that benefit the entire region, resulting in job creation and maintenance, leverage of advantages and opportunities, coordination of research and commercialization, acceleration of new technologies across manufacturing industries, growth of small- and medium-sized businesses, collaborative development of public infrastructure and increased access to capital.

      (3) Providing legislative support to the efforts of manufacturing business ecosystems and designating an entity to unify efforts, provide oversight and leverage regional resources and strengths, are appropriate and innovative means of moving forward with manufacturing economic development in Oregon.

      (4) There has been extensive progress toward creating a manufacturing business ecosystem, called the Pacific Northwest Manufacturing Partnership, in the southwest part of the State of Washington and the geographic region located within the Willamette Valley and the Columbia River corridor in Oregon. The partnership was formed in response to a federal initiative known as the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership program in the United States Economic Development Administration which aims to accelerate the resurgence of manufacturing in the United States. The federal initiative seeks to encourage communities to develop comprehensive economic development strategies and best practices that will strengthen the communities’ competitive edge for attracting global manufacturer and supply chain investments. The partnership will make application to the federal initiative program for a federal designation as a manufacturing community in accordance with the program requirements and geographical limitations. The partnership is an example of the type of business ecosystem that this state should encourage and support, and may serve as a model for future partnerships for manufacturing economic development in other regions of this state and the Pacific Northwest. [2015 c.22 §1]
