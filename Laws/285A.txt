      285A.303 Findings; purpose. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Local government is experiencing increasing difficulty in obtaining necessary financing for eligible community development projects, such as public works projects, causing project delays and significant increased costs to property owners and municipalities.

      (b) The improvement, expansion and new construction of eligible community development projects contributes to orderly economic growth by providing the framework necessary to attract industry to this state and to promote increased employment opportunities and other community improvements which are for the benefit of the people of Oregon.

      (c) It is important, therefore, that state agencies authorized to distribute state or federal funds for such improvements be able to provide programs and allocate moneys that will provide the greatest impetus to community development opportunities in Oregon.

      (2) Since municipalities in this state often suffer from a lack of available financing for eligible community development projects, it is the purpose of ORS 285A.300 to 285A.312 to provide financial assistance to municipalities in order that they may develop and construct community development projects and may construct, improve and repair facilities necessary for orderly community development. [Formerly 285.683]

      (2) Moneys in the Title I Bank Fund, with the approval of the State Treasurer, may be invested as provided by ORS 293.701 to 293.857, and the earnings from such investments and other program income shall be credited to the Title I Bank Fund.

      (3) The Title I Bank Fund shall consist of:

      285A.309 Use of funds. All payments, receipts and interest from outstanding indebtedness shall be retained and accumulated in the Title I Bank Fund and used for the purposes specified in ORS 285A.303. [Formerly 285.687; 1999 c.509 §14]

 

      285A.312 Application of federal statutes. All federal overlay statutes associated with moneys received from the federal Housing and Urban Development Community Development Block Grant Program for Small Cities shall continue to apply to the use of those moneys in the Title I Bank Fund received from sources described in ORS 285A.306 (3)(b).

BEGINNING AND EXPANDING

FARMER LOAN PROGRAM

 

      285A.420 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that the demand in Oregon for local food is surging, that the interest in farming among younger generations is on the rise and that access to capital is one of the most important factors contributing to the development and success of a local market agricultural sector in the Oregon economy.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly also finds that the establishment and implementation of a federal-state, public-private partnership program to assist beginning farmers is a cost-effective way for Oregon to support beginning farmers and the growth of the local market agricultural sector across this state and to stabilize the agricultural workforce. Such a program would represent no cost or risk to the state and would allow participating lenders to earn federally tax exempt interest income on loans to eligible beginning farmers. [2013 c.742 §1; 2015 c.165 §1]

 

      Note: 285A.420 to 285A.435 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 285A or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (6) “Eligible revenue” means the revenue or assets of an eligible agricultural project that are provided as security for a loan under ORS 285A.420 to 285A.435 by a beginning farmer, an agent of the beginning farmer or a related party to the beginning farmer.

      (7) “Lender” means a person or entity authorized to make loans to beginning farmers pursuant to ORS 285A.420 to 285A.435, that is one of the following:

      (3) The Oregon Business Development Department shall adopt rules for the operation of the program, to define terms and to establish an application process and requirements, criteria and eligibility standards for beginning farmers and lenders to participate in the program.

      (6) The Oregon Business Development Department may enter into contracts and agreements as necessary and appropriate to implement and manage the program. [2013 c.742 §3]
