INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN OREGON

 

      285B.500 Purpose of ORS 285B.500 to 285B.512; legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) It is a matter of statewide importance to increase the infrastructure capacity of Coos, Jackson and Josephine Counties and the rest of southern Oregon.

      (b) The absence of such infrastructure capacity, the lack of inexpensive industrial fuel and inadequate transportation facilities restrict national and international trade and otherwise hinder the economic development of the region.

      (c) State financial assistance to specified local projects in southern Oregon will sustain and increase jobs, foster national and international trade, allow industrial and commercial expansion and eliminate other negative effects caused by infrastructure that is inadequate to support a vibrant and expanding economy.

      (d) It is desirable to make a present commitment of lottery revenues that are expected to be received in the 1999-2001 and 2001-2003 biennia. A clear and prompt financial commitment from the State of Oregon will allow the project sponsors, in reliance on that commitment, to make prompt commitments to pay their share. Prompt commitment by the project sponsors will enhance the likelihood that other private or federal funds will be received for the projects.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that the purpose of ORS 285B.500 to 285B.512 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, is to obligate the State of Oregon to pay the amounts specified in ORS 285B.500 to 285B.512 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, from future lottery revenues. The obligation of the state to pay the amounts specified in section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws, 1997, and in grant agreements authorized by ORS 285B.506 is limited to, and conditioned solely on, the availability of unobligated net lottery proceeds and any other moneys lawfully credited to the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund. Neither the faith and credit nor any of the taxing power of the State of Oregon are pledged or otherwise committed by ORS 285B.500 to 285B.515 and 777.277 to 777.287 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, and the commitments of the State of Oregon under ORS 285B.500 to 285B.515 and 777.277 to 777.287 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, and any grant agreement shall not constitute a debt or liability of the state within the meaning of section 7, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. [1997 c.644 §7]

Notwithstanding any other law, the commitment of the State of Oregon and the authority under this section shall be conditioned solely on receipt by this state of unobligated net lottery proceeds sufficient to make the deposits specified in section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997.

      (2) The total amount paid to the primary sponsor under the grant agreement shall not exceed the amount deposited in the appropriate account for the sponsor’s project in the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund, plus any interest earnings on the amounts in the account.

      285B.551 Issuance of additional lottery bonds; uses; maximum amounts; Economic Infrastructure Project Fund. (1) Pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585, at the request of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, after the department consults with the Oregon Business Development Department, the State Treasurer is authorized to issue lottery bonds:

      (a) To provide financial and other assistance, including but not limited to loans and grants, to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities in accordance with the laws governing use of moneys in the Special Public Works Fund created by ORS 285B.455, the Water Fund created by ORS 285B.563, the Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund created by ORS 285A.213, the Oregon Port Revolving Fund created by ORS 285A.708, the Brownfields Redevelopment Fund created by ORS 285A.188, the Oregon Business Development Fund created by ORS 285B.092 and the Marine Navigation Improvement Fund created by ORS 777.267.

      (b) To fund Oregon’s share of the costs of the Columbia River channel deepening project.

      (c) To fund Oregon’s share of the costs of studies and ecosystem restoration projects in the lower Columbia River estuary designed to improve habitat for listed endangered or threatened species of Columbia River anadromous salmonids.

      (2) The use of lottery bond proceeds is authorized based on the following findings:

      (a) The financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities will assist in the establishment and expansion of businesses in Oregon and in the construction, improvement and expansion of infrastructure, community and port facilities and other facilities that comprise the physical foundation for industrial and commercial activity and provide the basic framework for continued and expanded economic opportunities and quality communities throughout Oregon.

      (b) The Columbia River channel deepening project is necessary to allow newer, larger steamships access to Oregon and Washington deep draft ports. A deeper shipping channel will allow the Columbia River to continue as a world leader in agricultural exports and as a key trade corridor for farms and businesses throughout Oregon and the region.

      (c) Such financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities and the deepening of the Columbia River channel will therefore promote economic development within this state, and thus the use of net proceeds derived from the operation of the Oregon State Lottery to pay debt service on lottery bonds issued under this section to provide such financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities and to pay a portion of the costs of deepening the Columbia River channel is an authorized use of state lottery funds under section 4, Article XV of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 461.510.

      (d) The current lower Columbia River estuary habitat for listed endangered or threatened species of Columbia River anadromous salmonids could be improved through ecosystem restoration projects. The use of the Oregon State Lottery to pay debt service on lottery bonds issued under this section to pay for studying how the estuary could be improved and to pay for ecosystem restoration projects are authorized uses of state lottery funds.

      (3)(a) The aggregate principal amount of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section for financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities may not exceed the sum of $336,226,252 and an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs. The aggregate principal amount of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section for the Columbia River channel deepening project may not exceed the sum of $17.7 million and an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs.

      (b) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services may not request the issuance of lottery bonds under subsection (1)(b) of this section until the Director of the Oregon Business Development Department determines that a final environmental impact statement has been issued and a record of decisions has been submitted to Congress by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Congress has authorized the Columbia River channel deepening project, and the Washington sponsors’ shares of the costs of the Columbia River channel deepening project have been committed.

      (4) The net proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section shall be deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund, which is hereby established in the State Treasury separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned by the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund shall be credited to the fund. All moneys in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund are continuously appropriated to the Oregon Business Development Department for any purpose for which moneys in the Special Public Works Fund created by ORS 285B.455 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Water Fund created by ORS 285B.563 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund created by ORS 285A.213 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Oregon Port Revolving Fund created by ORS 285A.708 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Brownfields Redevelopment Fund created by ORS 285A.188 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Oregon Business Development Fund created by ORS 285B.092 may be used and any purpose for which moneys in the Marine Navigation Improvement Fund created by ORS 777.267 may be used. The Director of the Oregon Business Development Department shall allocate the moneys deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund for the purposes described in this subsection in accordance with the priorities developed by the Oregon Business Development Commission in accordance with ORS 285A.020. However, the director shall transfer from the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund and deposit into the Channel Deepening Account of the Marine Navigation Improvement Fund the proceeds of any lottery bonds sold to finance a portion of the costs of the Columbia River channel deepening project. Upon determining the relative allocation of moneys deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund among the purposes described in this subsection, the director shall transfer from the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund, and deposit into each of the other funds described in this subsection, the amounts so allocated. Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the funds described in this subsection, the funds described in this subsection may be credited with moneys transferred from the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund by the director in accordance with this subsection.

      (5) The aggregate principal amount of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section for the costs of studies and ecosystem restoration projects in the lower Columbia River estuary may not exceed the sum of $750,000 and an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs. The net proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section shall be deposited in the Oregon Business, Innovation and Trade Fund created by ORS 285A.227 and may be used only for the Oregon nonfederal share of United States Army Corps of Engineers Columbia River estuary projects authorized by Congress prior to August 9, 2001. The director may not request the issuance of lottery bonds under subsection (1)(c) of this section until Congress and Washington have authorized their respective shares of the costs of the studies and ecosystem restoration projects in the lower Columbia River estuary.

      (6) The proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to this section may be used only for the purposes set forth in this section and for bond-related costs.

OREGON INDUSTRIAL SITE READINESS PROGRAM

 

      285B.625 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Traded sector industries are the foundation of state and regional economic development strategies for long-term prosperity and job creation. Because traded sector jobs typically pay higher than average wages and generate higher than average income tax revenues, such jobs play an important role in supporting critical state services.

      (2) Industrial development that provides new traded sector jobs reinforces the economies of local and regional communities and contributes to the economic recovery of the State of Oregon.

      (3) There is a shortage of market-ready regional industrial sites in this state. Project sponsors have limited financial tools to facilitate development of significant and complex industrial sites that are appropriate for traded sector industrial use.

      (4) Public assistance is necessary to overcome development-related constraints and to incentivize industrial site development in this state.

      (5) The State of Oregon has a significant interest in the success of regional economic development strategies and is the primary beneficiary of such economic development through increased income tax revenues. These revenues should be shared and invested in facilitating significant site development for traded sector industrial use in this state. [2013 c.763 §1; 2017 c.561 §1]

 

      Note: 285B.625 to 285B.632 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 285B or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (a) Is conducting a traded sector business on a regionally significant industrial site; and

      (b)(A) With respect to a rural site, has hired at least 25 full-time employees whose wages average at least 150 percent of the county or state average wage, whichever is less; or

      (B) With respect to an urban site, has hired at least 50 full-time employees whose wages average at least 150 percent of the county or state average wage, whichever is less.

      (2) “Estimated incremental income tax revenues” means the Oregon personal income tax revenues that are equivalent to the amount of tax that employees of an eligible employer who are hired by the eligible employer on a designated regionally significant industrial site have paid under ORS chapter 316 in the tax years following the first tax year in which the eligible employer begins conducting a traded sector business on the designated regionally significant industrial site.

      (3) “Industrial use” means employment activities, including but not limited to manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, processing, storage, logistics, warehousing, importation, distribution, transshipment and research and development, that generate income from the production, handling or distribution of goods or services, including goods or services in the traded sector.

      (4) “Project sponsor” means:

      (a) A public owner of a regionally significant industrial site that is investing in preparation of the site for industrial use by a third party; or

      (b) A public entity that has entered into a development or other agreement with the private owner of a regionally significant industrial site to prepare the site for industrial use.

      (5) “Regionally significant industrial site” means a site planned and zoned for industrial use that:

      (a)(A) Is suitable for the location of new industrial uses or the expansion of existing industrial uses and that can provide significant additional employment in the region;

      (B) Has site characteristics that provide significant competitive advantages that are difficult or impossible to replicate in the region; and

      (C) Has superior access to transportation and freight infrastructure, including but not limited to rail, port, airport, multimodal freight or transshipment facilities and other major transportation facilities or routes; or

      (b) Is located in an area designated by Metro, as defined in ORS 197.015, as a regionally significant industrial area.
