INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN OREGON

 

      285B.500 Purpose of ORS 285B.500 to 285B.512; legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) It is a matter of statewide importance to increase the infrastructure capacity of Coos, Jackson and Josephine Counties and the rest of southern Oregon.

      (b) The absence of such infrastructure capacity, the lack of inexpensive industrial fuel and inadequate transportation facilities restrict national and international trade and otherwise hinder the economic development of the region.

      (c) State financial assistance to specified local projects in southern Oregon will sustain and increase jobs, foster national and international trade, allow industrial and commercial expansion and eliminate other negative effects caused by infrastructure that is inadequate to support a vibrant and expanding economy.

      (d) It is desirable to make a present commitment of lottery revenues that are expected to be received in the 1999-2001 and 2001-2003 biennia. A clear and prompt financial commitment from the State of Oregon will allow the project sponsors, in reliance on that commitment, to make prompt commitments to pay their share. Prompt commitment by the project sponsors will enhance the likelihood that other private or federal funds will be received for the projects.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that the purpose of ORS 285B.500 to 285B.512 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, is to obligate the State of Oregon to pay the amounts specified in ORS 285B.500 to 285B.512 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, from future lottery revenues. The obligation of the state to pay the amounts specified in section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws, 1997, and in grant agreements authorized by ORS 285B.506 is limited to, and conditioned solely on, the availability of unobligated net lottery proceeds and any other moneys lawfully credited to the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund. Neither the faith and credit nor any of the taxing power of the State of Oregon are pledged or otherwise committed by ORS 285B.500 to 285B.515 and 777.277 to 777.287 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, and the commitments of the State of Oregon under ORS 285B.500 to 285B.515 and 777.277 to 777.287 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, and any grant agreement shall not constitute a debt or liability of the state within the meaning of section 7, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. [1997 c.644 §7]

 

      Note: 285B.500 to 285B.515 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 285B by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      285B.503 Oregon Unified International Trade Fund; uses. (1) There is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund, the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund. Interest earned by the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund shall be credited to the fund. The moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the Oregon Business Development Department for the Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority for:

      (a) Paying all or a portion of the costs of:

      (A) A project for the extension and improvement of Jackson County Airport runway.

      (B) A project for the extension of a natural gas pipeline to the Coos Bay and North Bend area from a location near Roseburg.

      (C) A project for improvements to the Klamath Falls International Airport maintained by the City of Klamath Falls.

      (b) Transfer to the Oregon Port Revolving Fund created by ORS 285A.708.

      (2) A separate account within the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund shall be established for each project listed in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The Oregon Unified International Trade Fund shall consist of moneys allocated to the fund under section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, and such other moneys as may be appropriated to the fund by the Legislative Assembly, including interest on such moneys. [1997 c.644 §8; 2009 c.830 §110]

 

      Note: See note under 285B.500.

 

      285B.506 Grant agreements; maximum grant amount; required provisions; assignment of right to receive grant moneys; agreement not to constitute state debt or liability. (1) The administrator of the Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority shall enter into a grant agreement with the primary sponsor of a project listed in ORS 285B.503 that commits the State of Oregon to make the deposits specified in section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, and commits the Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority to pay those deposits, plus earnings, to the primary sponsor as soon as funds are available in the appropriate account of the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund and are required by the primary sponsor for payment of project costs. Notwithstanding any other law, the commitment of the State of Oregon and the authority under this section shall be conditioned solely on receipt by this state of unobligated net lottery proceeds sufficient to make the deposits specified in section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997.

      (2) The total amount paid to the primary sponsor under the grant agreement shall not exceed the amount deposited in the appropriate account for the sponsor’s project in the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund, plus any interest earnings on the amounts in the account. The grant agreement shall:

      (a) Pledge the unobligated net lottery proceeds to pay the amounts due to the primary sponsor under the grant agreement;

      (b) Specify the administrative procedures for making payments to the primary sponsor;

      (c) Provide for notification to the administrator if the primary sponsor determines that it is unable to undertake the project;

      (d) Allow assignment of the right to receive amounts payable under the grant agreement to third parties;

      (e) Obligate the primary sponsor to remit any unexpended grant funds and any earnings thereon to the State of Oregon after the sponsor’s project is complete and all its costs have been paid; and

      (f) Contain other terms and conditions that are necessary or appropriate, as determined by the administrator, to implement ORS 285B.500 to 285B.512 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, to protect the interests and investments of the State of Oregon in the projects specified in ORS 285B.503.

      (3) The grant agreement, when executed by the administrator and accepted by the primary sponsor, shall be a valid, binding and irrevocable contractual obligation of the State of Oregon in accordance with its terms. However, amounts due under the grant agreement shall be payable solely from the unobligated net lottery proceeds required by section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, to be deposited in the appropriate account in the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund.

      (4) The primary sponsor may pledge or assign its right to receive amounts due under the grant agreement as security for any contractual obligation the primary sponsor undertakes to pay or finance costs of the project. Any pledge or assignment authorized by ORS 285B.500 to 285B.515 and 777.277 to 777.287 and section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, shall be valid and binding upon the primary sponsor, the authority, the State of Oregon and all other persons from the date it is made. The unobligated net lottery proceeds so pledged shall be immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery, filing or other act, and the lien of the pledge shall be superior to all other claims and liens of any kind whatsoever. Upon notice from the primary sponsor that it has pledged the unobligated net lottery proceeds or assigned the right to receive amounts due under the grant agreement, the authority shall fully cooperate with the primary sponsor and the pledgee or assignee to give effect to the pledge or assignment, including but not limited to acknowledging in writing to the primary sponsor and the pledgee or assignee the existence and validity of the pledge or assignment and agreeing that amounts due under the grant agreement shall be paid to the pledgee or assignee or into the custodial accounts established for the benefit of the pledgee or assignee.

      (5) The grant agreement shall not contain provisions or be construed or enforced in any manner that may cause the grant agreement to constitute a debt or liability of the state that violates section 7, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. [1997 c.644 §10; 2009 c.830 §111]

 

      Note: See note under 285B.500.

 

      285B.509 Agreements between primary sponsor and United States. The primary sponsors of projects listed in ORS 285B.503 are authorized to enter into agreements with agencies of the United States for the project and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, may each agree to be bound by any requirement imposed by an Act of the United States Congress as a condition of federal participation in the project. [1997 c.644 §11]

 

      Note: See note under 285B.500.

 

      285B.512 End of lottery allocations upon certification by administrator of authority. (1) The deposit of unobligated net lottery proceeds to an account in the Oregon Unified International Trade Fund shall cease if and when the administrator of the Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority certifies in writing that deposits are no longer required because:

      (a) Sufficient funds are on hand in the account to pay all amounts required to be paid under the grant agreement;

      (b) All amounts required to be paid under the grant agreement have been paid; or

      (c) The primary sponsor has notified the administrator pursuant to the grant agreement that the primary sponsor is unable to undertake the project.

      (2) Upon receipt of the administrator’s written certification pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the State Treasurer shall thereafter credit any amounts remaining in the account that are not required to pay amounts due under the grant agreement, and any lottery revenues that otherwise would have been deposited in the account under section 9, chapter 644, Oregon Laws 1997, to the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund. In addition, any unexpended grant funds and earnings which are remitted to the State of Oregon pursuant to the grant agreement shall be credited to the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund.

      Note: See note under 285B.530.

 

      285B.551 Issuance of additional lottery bonds; uses; maximum amounts; Economic Infrastructure Project Fund. (1) Pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585, at the request of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, after the department consults with the Oregon Business Development Department, the State Treasurer is authorized to issue lottery bonds:

      (a) To provide financial and other assistance, including but not limited to loans and grants, to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities in accordance with the laws governing use of moneys in the Special Public Works Fund created by ORS 285B.455, the Water Fund created by ORS 285B.563, the Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund created by ORS 285A.213, the Oregon Port Revolving Fund created by ORS 285A.708, the Brownfields Redevelopment Fund created by ORS 285A.188, the Oregon Business Development Fund created by ORS 285B.092 and the Marine Navigation Improvement Fund created by ORS 777.267.

      (b) To fund Oregon’s share of the costs of the Columbia River channel deepening project.

      (c) To fund Oregon’s share of the costs of studies and ecosystem restoration projects in the lower Columbia River estuary designed to improve habitat for listed endangered or threatened species of Columbia River anadromous salmonids.

      (2) The use of lottery bond proceeds is authorized based on the following findings:

      (a) The financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities will assist in the establishment and expansion of businesses in Oregon and in the construction, improvement and expansion of infrastructure, community and port facilities and other facilities that comprise the physical foundation for industrial and commercial activity and provide the basic framework for continued and expanded economic opportunities and quality communities throughout Oregon.

      (b) The Columbia River channel deepening project is necessary to allow newer, larger steamships access to Oregon and Washington deep draft ports. A deeper shipping channel will allow the Columbia River to continue as a world leader in agricultural exports and as a key trade corridor for farms and businesses throughout Oregon and the region.

      (c) Such financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities and the deepening of the Columbia River channel will therefore promote economic development within this state, and thus the use of net proceeds derived from the operation of the Oregon State Lottery to pay debt service on lottery bonds issued under this section to provide such financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities and to pay a portion of the costs of deepening the Columbia River channel is an authorized use of state lottery funds under section 4, Article XV of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 461.510.

      (d) The current lower Columbia River estuary habitat for listed endangered or threatened species of Columbia River anadromous salmonids could be improved through ecosystem restoration projects. The use of the Oregon State Lottery to pay debt service on lottery bonds issued under this section to pay for studying how the estuary could be improved and to pay for ecosystem restoration projects are authorized uses of state lottery funds.

      (3)(a) The aggregate principal amount of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section for financial and other assistance to municipalities, ports and other persons and entities may not exceed the sum of $366,226,252 and an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs. The aggregate principal amount of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section for the Columbia River channel deepening project may not exceed the sum of $17.7 million and an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs.

      (b) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services may not request the issuance of lottery bonds under subsection (1)(b) of this section until the Director of the Oregon Business Development Department determines that a final environmental impact statement has been issued and a record of decisions has been submitted to Congress by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Congress has authorized the Columbia River channel deepening project, and the Washington sponsors’ shares of the costs of the Columbia River channel deepening project have been committed.

      (4) The net proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section shall be deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund, which is hereby established in the State Treasury separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned by the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund shall be credited to the fund. All moneys in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund are continuously appropriated to the Oregon Business Development Department for any purpose for which moneys in the Special Public Works Fund created by ORS 285B.455 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Water Fund created by ORS 285B.563 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund created by ORS 285A.213 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Oregon Port Revolving Fund created by ORS 285A.708 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Brownfields Redevelopment Fund created by ORS 285A.188 may be used, any purpose for which moneys in the Oregon Business Development Fund created by ORS 285B.092 may be used and any purpose for which moneys in the Marine Navigation Improvement Fund created by ORS 777.267 may be used. The Director of the Oregon Business Development Department shall allocate the moneys deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund for the purposes described in this subsection in accordance with the priorities developed by the Oregon Business Development Commission in accordance with ORS 285A.020. However, the director shall transfer from the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund and deposit into the Channel Deepening Account of the Marine Navigation Improvement Fund the proceeds of any lottery bonds sold to finance a portion of the costs of the Columbia River channel deepening project. Upon determining the relative allocation of moneys deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund among the purposes described in this subsection, the director shall transfer from the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund, and deposit into each of the other funds described in this subsection, the amounts so allocated. Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the funds described in this subsection, the funds described in this subsection may be credited with moneys transferred from the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund by the director in accordance with this subsection.

      (5) The aggregate principal amount of lottery bonds issued pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section for the costs of studies and ecosystem restoration projects in the lower Columbia River estuary may not exceed the sum of $750,000 and an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs.

OREGON INDUSTRIAL SITE READINESS PROGRAM

 

      285B.625 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Traded sector industries are the foundation of state and regional economic development strategies for long-term prosperity and job creation. Because traded sector jobs typically pay higher than average wages and generate higher than average income tax revenues, such jobs play an important role in supporting critical state services.

      (2) Industrial development that provides new traded sector jobs reinforces the economies of local and regional communities and contributes to the economic recovery of the State of Oregon.

      (3) There is a shortage of market-ready regional industrial sites in this state. Project sponsors have limited financial tools to facilitate development of significant and complex industrial sites that are appropriate for traded sector industrial use.

      (4) Public assistance is necessary to overcome development-related constraints and to incentivize industrial site development in this state.

      (5) The State of Oregon has a significant interest in the success of regional economic development strategies and is the primary beneficiary of such economic development through increased income tax revenues. These revenues should be shared and invested in facilitating significant site development for traded sector industrial use in this state. [2013 c.763 §1; 2017 c.561 §1]

 

      Note: 285B.625 to 285B.632 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 285B or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (B) With respect to an urban site, has hired at least 50 full-time employees whose wages average at least 150 percent of the county or state average wage, whichever is less.

      (2) “Estimated incremental income tax revenues” means the Oregon personal income tax revenues that are equivalent to the amount of tax that employees of an eligible employer who are hired by the eligible employer on a designated regionally significant industrial site have paid under ORS chapter 316 in the tax years following the first tax year in which the eligible employer begins conducting a traded sector business on the designated regionally significant industrial site.

      (3) “Industrial use” means employment activities, including but not limited to manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, processing, storage, logistics, warehousing, importation, distribution, transshipment and research and development, that generate income from the production, handling or distribution of goods or services, including goods or services in the traded sector.

The department, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with prudent financial controls, may delegate the administration and operation of the loan program created by ORS 285B.740 to 285B.758 to local and community-based entities. To carry out the policy described in this section:

      (2) When entering into an agreement for the administration of the loan program by any nonprofit corporation or agency, the department may agree to waive any claims it may have against such corporation or agency for losses arising out of the normal course of business, as long as the corporation or agency does not act negligently or fraudulently in providing loans under ORS 285B.740 to 285B.758.

      (3) When entering into an agreement to have a nonprofit corporation or agency administer the loan program created by ORS 285B.740 to 285B.758, the department may pay loan origination and loan servicing fees to the corporation or agency.
