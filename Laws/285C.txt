      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 285C.140 (1), a new building or structure or an addition to or modification of an existing building or structure may qualify for the exemption allowed under ORS 285C.175 if the qualified property is leased or sold by an unrelated party to one or more authorized business firms after commencement of the construction, addition or modification but prior to use or occupancy of the qualified property.

      (3) A business firm may not be considered authorized and is not qualified for the exemption allowed under ORS 285C.175 if the county assessor discovers prior to initially granting the exemption that the application for authorization was not submitted by the business firm in a timely manner in accordance with ORS 285C.140, except as allowed under subsection (2) of this section or ORS 285C.140 (11) and (12).

      (4) Records, communications or information submitted to a public body by a business firm for purposes of ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250 that identify a particular qualified property, that reveal investment plans prior to authorization, that include the compensation the firm provides to firm employees, that are described in ORS 192.355 (17) or that are submitted under ORS 285C.225 or 285C.235 are exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478 and, as appropriate, shall be shared among the county assessor, the zone sponsor, the Department of Revenue and the Oregon Business Development Department.

      (2) The conditions that a sponsor may impose under this section must be reasonably related to the public purpose of providing opportunities for groups of persons, as defined by the sponsor, to obtain employment, including but not limited to providing training to these groups of persons.

      (3) The sponsor may establish procedures for monitoring and verifying compliance with conditions imposed on the firm under this section and require the firm to agree to the procedures as a condition to authorizing the firm.

      (4) Conditions established under this section may be imposed on a firm only if the sponsor has adopted a policy that establishes standards for the imposition of the conditions.

      (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(f) of this section, the Oregon Business Development Department shall adopt rules that define the effect of noncompliance on an eligible business firm’s continuing exemption in an enterprise zone and that indicate what is necessary to establish the noncompliance in terms of materiality of the relevant violation, the finality of applicable legal or regulatory proceedings and judgments involving the firm, the failure by the firm to perform or submit to remedial or curative actions and similar factors.

      (7) As used in this section:

      (a) “Annual average employment of the firm” means the average employment of the firm, calculated over the 12 months preceding the date of application for authorization.

      (b) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, “employment of the firm” means:

      (A) The number of employees working for the firm a majority of their time in eligible operations at locations throughout the enterprise zone; or

      (B) In the case of a firm described in ORS 285C.135 (5)(b), the number of employees working a majority of their time at the facility in the enterprise zone for which authorization was obtained. [Formerly 285B.704; 2010 c.39 §3; 2017 c.83 §5]

 

      285C.203 Suspension of employment requirements; resumption of exemption period; sponsor resolution required. (1)(a) The sponsor of an enterprise zone may suspend the obligation of a qualified business firm to meet the employment requirements of ORS 285C.200 for a period not to exceed two consecutive years if:

      (A) For two or more consecutive calendar quarters in the previous 12 months, as defined by the most recently available data published or officially provided and verified by the United States Government or the Employment Department:

      (i) There has been a decline statewide in seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll employment; and

      (ii) The unemployment rate of the county in which the qualified property of the firm is located has been at least two percentage points greater than the comparable unemployment rate for this state; and

      (B) The qualified business firm has completed an investment in qualified property of at least:

      (i) $4 million if the qualified property is in a rural enterprise zone; or

      (ii) $8 million if the qualified property is in an urban enterprise zone.

      (b) At the time a period of suspension is granted, the sponsor must specify a minimum number of employees greater than zero that the qualified business firm is required to employ during the period of suspension.

      (2)(a) The granting of a period of suspension under subsection (1) of this section does not affect an eligible business firm’s status as an authorized business firm under ORS 285C.140.

      (b) During the period of suspension:

      (A) The qualified business firm is not exempt from taxation under ORS 285C.175; and

      (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the qualified business firm must file an exemption claim as required under ORS 285C.220 and 285C.225.

      (c) The period of suspension does not count toward the total period of time for which exemption from taxation is allowed under ORS 285C.175.

      (d)(A) After the period of suspension has ended, the qualified business firm is eligible to resume exemption from taxation for the period of time remaining under ORS 285C.175.

      (B) To resume exemption under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the qualified business firm must satisfy the requirements of ORS 285C.200 for the remaining period of exemption, including, but not limited to, any reduced employment level pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, which must also be met on or before April 1 preceding the first tax year after the period of suspension if the qualified business firm received at least one year of exemption under ORS 285C.175 before the period of suspension began.

      (3)(a) The sponsor’s actions under subsection (1) of this section are not effective unless set forth in a resolution adopted by the governing body of the sponsor no later than the earlier of:

      (A) Sixty days after the date on which the sponsor notifies the qualified business firm that the sponsor intends to act pursuant to subsection (1) of this section; or

      (B) August 31 of the first year of suspension.

      (b) A resolution adopted under this subsection may be revoked or amended by the sponsor at any time during the period of suspension.

      (4) A resolution adopted under subsection (3) of this section may reduce the employment level required under ORS 285C.200 (1)(c) after the period of suspension.

      (5) A sponsor shall promptly provide to the county assessor:

      (a) A copy of a resolution adopted under subsection (3)(a) of this section;

      (b) A copy of a resolution as amended under subsection (3)(b) of this section; and

      (c) Notice that a resolution has been revoked under subsection (3)(b) of this section. [2010 c.39 §2; 2017 c.83 §6]

 

      285C.205 Effect of productivity increases on qualification of certain firms; uses of tax savings. The requirements of ORS 285C.200 (2)(b)(B) are met if the qualified business firm does all of the following:

      (1) The firm demonstrates at least a 10 percent increase in productivity no later than 18 months following January 1 of the first assessment year for which an exemption under ORS 285C.175 is claimed. Unless further specified by the sponsor of the enterprise zone through the resolution adopted under ORS 285C.155:

      (a) The increase must be in business operations of the firm that are using qualified property receiving the exemption;

      (b) Productivity is measured by dividing physical units or quantity of output by the number of labor hours engaged in the operations that produced the physical units or quantity of output; and

      (c) The base level of productivity shall be established over a minimum 12-month period preceding the date on which the qualified property is placed in service.

      (2) The firm maintains or exceeds the 10 percent increase in productivity under subsection (1) of this section as an annual average rate for each subsequent assessment year during the remainder of the exemption period.

      (3) On or before April 1 of each of the first three assessment years for which an exemption is claimed, the firm deposits into an account established by the sponsor an amount equal to 25 percent of the estimated tax savings arising from the exemption for that year. The sponsor may adopt additional specifications or requirements applicable to this subsection in the resolution the sponsor adopts under ORS 285C.155. Consistent with this subsection and any additional specifications or requirements adopted by the sponsor:

      (a) For up to 30 months following the relevant April 1 date for which a deposit is made, the firm may draw from the account amounts equal to any expense incurred for training or retraining employees to promote or facilitate productivity increases under this section, except that the total amount withdrawn from the account for that deposit may not exceed $3,500 per trained employee;

      (b) Any amount attributable to the deposit that remains in the account after the 30-month period in which firm withdrawals may be made under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be transferred to a special fund for use by local publicly funded job training providers; and

      (c) No more than 18 months after the deposit, the estimated tax savings on which the deposit was based shall be reconciled with the actual tax savings arising from the exemption. The reconciliation shall be accomplished by the firm immediately making a further deposit into the account to cover any shortfall or by being reimbursed from the account for any surplus. A deposit or reimbursement made pursuant to this paragraph does not affect withdrawals or transfers that occur as a result of paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection. [2003 c.662 §33a]

 

      285C.210 Substantial curtailment of business operations. (1) For purposes of ORS 285C.175, 285C.200 and 285C.240, except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, operations of a business firm within the enterprise zone are substantially curtailed when:

      (a) Pursuant to the initial claim of exemption and satisfaction of ORS 285C.200 (1)(c), the number of employees of the firm:

      (A) Is reduced by more than 85 percent from the highest number of employees of the firm; or

      (B) Has been reduced by more than 50 percent from the highest number of employees of the firm over two consecutive annual filing periods under ORS 285C.220 (1); or

      (b) The annual average number of employees of the firm during the first assessment year for which the exemption under ORS 285C.175 is granted, or any subsequently allowed year of exemption, is reduced below the greater of:

      (A) The annual average number of employees of the firm, averaged over the 12 months preceding the date of the application for authorization, plus one employee; or

      (B) 110 percent of the annual average number of employees of the firm, averaged over the 12 months preceding the date of the application for authorization.

      (2) For the purposes of this section:

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(A) of this subsection, the number of employees of the firm is the employment of the firm, as defined in ORS 285C.200 (7)(b), on the earlier of the date a claim for exemption is filed under ORS 285C.220 or April 1 of the year in which the exemption is initially claimed under ORS 285C.175 and following each assessment year of the exemption, including after the last such assessment year.

      (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(B) of this subsection, the annual average number of employees of the firm is the number of employees of the firm averaged over the course of each assessment year in which an exemption under ORS 285C.175 is allowed, using employment figures for no fewer than four equivalent periods during the year.

      (c) For the first assessment year for which an authorized business firm that qualifies under ORS 285C.200 (5) claims an exemption under ORS 285C.175, substantial curtailment under subsection (1)(a)(A) or (b) of this section shall be determined by:

      (A) Combining the number of employees of the firm and the number of employees at any applicable site of the firm outside the enterprise zone; and

      (B) Combining the annual average number of employees of the firm with the annual average number of employees at any applicable site of the firm outside the enterprise zone.

      (3) Operations of a business firm are not substantially curtailed under this section during a period of suspension as otherwise provided in ORS 285C.203. [2003 c.662 §40; 2010 c.39 §5; 2017 c.83 §7]

 

      285C.215 First-source hiring agreements; rules. (1) The qualified property of an authorized business firm may be exempt from property tax under ORS 285C.175 only if the firm enters into a first-source hiring agreement for the period of property tax exemption. The agreement must be executed prior to the assessment date for the first tax year for which qualified property of the firm is exempt under ORS 285C.175 and must expire no sooner than December 31 of the final year of the exemption.

      (2)(a) If a firm has not entered into a first-source hiring agreement when qualified property of the firm is first placed in service, as of April 1 preceding the first tax year for which the authorized business firm claims an exemption for qualified property under ORS 285C.175, the sponsor shall inform the county assessor that an agreement under this section has not been executed.

      (b) A publicly funded job training provider having knowledge of the date when qualified property of the firm is first placed in service may also inform the county assessor that an agreement under this section has not been executed.

      (3) In accordance with rules adopted by the Oregon Business Development Department, the Director of the Oregon Business Development Department may waive the requirements of subsection (1) of this section for an authorized business firm. The rules adopted by the department shall provide for a waiver under this subsection when the director finds that:

      (a) The business firm is unable to employ persons referred under the agreement; or

      (b) The waiver would further the goals and purposes of applicable state policies. [Formerly 285B.710]

      (a) Reasonably rely on information set forth in the exemption claim filed under ORS 285C.220; and

      (b) Request and be given assistance from the sponsor before making certain determinations, including but not limited to:

      (6) The county assessor shall make reasonable and timely efforts to notify an authorized business firm that is seeking or receiving an exemption under ORS 285C.175 of the filing requirements under ORS 285C.220, but the county assessor and the Department of Revenue are not under any obligation other than as otherwise provided in ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250 to seek or receive information about the continued entitlement of property to an exemption under ORS 285C.175.

      (7) The sponsor is primarily responsible for assisting a business firm in timely filing claims under ORS 285C.220. If the sponsor, or a local zone manager designated by the sponsor, does not receive a copy of the claim as required under ORS 285C.220 by the time the claim is required to be filed under ORS 285C.220, the sponsor or manager shall immediately contact the assessor for taking action under subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) The sponsor of an enterprise zone may initiate procedures in order to verify compliance by qualified business firms with requirements imposed under ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250. The procedures may include written requests to the assessor by the local zone manager or an executive official of the sponsor that the assessor exercise authority under this section for a particular qualified business firm.

      (c) The qualified business firm fails to meet any of the qualifications required under ORS 285C.200;

      (d) The qualified business firm fails to meet any condition that the firm is required to satisfy under ORS 285C.150, 285C.155, 285C.203 or 285C.205 or any term of an agreement entered into with the sponsor under ORS 285C.160 with which the firm had agreed to comply;

      (e) The qualified business firm uses the property to conduct activities in the enterprise zone that are not eligible activities; or

      (f) Property of the qualified business firm for which exemption under ORS 285C.175 is claimed ceases to be qualified property under ORS 285C.180.

      (2) If the sponsor receives written notice under subsection (1) of this section, the sponsor shall immediately send a copy of the notice to the county assessor of the county in which the enterprise zone is situated.

      (3)(a) When an assessor receives written notice under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the assessor shall:

      (B) Impose 100 percent of the additional taxes calculated under ORS 285C.175 against the property for each year for which the property had been granted exemption under ORS 285C.175.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, if a qualified business firm fails to meet any of the requirements of an agreement entered into by the firm under ORS 285C.160 during the exemption, but meets all other applicable requirements under ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250 during the first three years of the exemption, the qualified property of the firm may not be disqualified during the first three years of exemption for failure to comply with the requirements of the agreement entered into under ORS 285C.160.

      (c) The additional taxes assessed under this subsection shall be reduced by the amount, if any, paid by the qualified business firm to the sponsor under subsection (6) of this section for the same property.

      (4) If the qualified business firm or owner fails to give the notice on time or at all as required by subsection (1) of this section, upon discovering the property no longer qualifies for the exemption due to a circumstance described in subsection (1) of this section, the assessor shall:

      (a) Disqualify the property from exemption;

      (5) The amount determined to be due under subsections (3) and (4) of this section:

      (a) May be paid to the tax collector before completion of the next general property tax roll pursuant to ORS 311.370; and

      (6)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (3) and (5) of this section, if an assessor or sponsor receives notice from a business firm under subsection (1)(b), (c) or (d) of this section and the qualified business firm has not closed its operations, the sponsor may collect from the qualified business firm an amount equal to the property taxes for the qualified property in the assessment year for which the exemption is claimed in lieu of the amounts otherwise due under subsection (3) of this section.

      (b) Moneys collected under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be used by the sponsor to benefit the residents of the enterprise zone and for the development of jobs, skills and training for residents of the enterprise zone and the zone’s immediate vicinity.

      (8) Additional taxes collected under this section shall be deemed to have been imposed in the year to which the additional taxes relate.

      (9) If property is disqualified from exemption under this section, the assessor shall notify the qualified business firm, and the owner of any qualified property that is leased by the firm, of the disqualification. The notification shall be made in writing. The assessor shall provide copies of the disqualification to the sponsor, the Department of Revenue and the Oregon Business Development Department. The decision of the assessor to disqualify property under this section may be appealed to the Oregon Tax Court under ORS 305.404 to 305.560. [Formerly 285B.728; 2010 c.39 §9; 2017 c.83 §10]

 

(Termination of Enterprise Zone)

 

      285C.245 Termination; effect of termination on property; procedures. (1) When the termination of an enterprise zone occurs under this section:

      (a) The termination of the enterprise zone does not affect:

      (A) The continuation of a qualified business firm’s property tax exemption first allowed before the effective date of the termination of the enterprise zone; or

      (B) The ability of an authorized business firm to claim exemption under ORS 285C.175 if:

      (i) The authorization application of the firm was filed with the sponsor before the effective date of the termination of the zone;

      (ii) The firm remains authorized at the time the exemption is claimed;

      (iii) The firm completes construction, addition, modification or installation of the qualified property within a reasonable time and without interruption of construction, addition, modification or installation activity; and

      (iv) The property meets all other applicable requirements for exemption under ORS 285C.175.

      (b) A business firm that is currently authorized or qualified in the enterprise zone shall be allowed until 10 years after the effective date of the termination of the enterprise zone to apply for authorization under ORS 285C.140 and to subsequently claim the exemption for any qualified property that is constructed, added, modified or installed inside the former enterprise zone boundaries, as those boundaries existed at the time of termination, and entirely outside of the boundaries of any current enterprise zone. Construction, addition, modification or installation of qualified property must commence prior to the end of the final tax year in which qualified property of the firm is exempt under ORS 285C.175 and must be completed within a reasonable time and without interruption of construction, addition, modification or installation activity. The property must meet all other applicable requirements for exemption under ORS 285C.175.

      (c) Disqualification under ORS 285C.240 of all exempt property of the business firm after the effective date of the termination of the enterprise zone shall prohibit and terminate all authorizations sought or obtained by the business firm that would not otherwise be allowed except for paragraph (b) of this subsection. Disqualification under ORS 285C.240 of all exempt property of the business firm on or after the effective date of the termination of the enterprise zone shall cause the assessor to deny any claim for exemption under ORS 285C.175 of qualified property of the business firm made in a subsequent tax year.

      (2) An enterprise zone designated under ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250 shall terminate when 10 years plus that number of days necessary to delay the date of termination to the June 30 next following have elapsed since the effective date of the designation.

      (3) An enterprise zone designated under ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250 shall terminate prior to the time specified in subsection (2) of this section only as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.

      (4) The governing body of the sponsor may submit a resolution requesting termination of the enterprise zone to the Oregon Business Development Department. The sponsor shall provide copies of the resolution to the county assessor and the Department of Revenue. After receipt of the request, the Director of the Oregon Business Development Department shall order termination of the enterprise zone and shall specify the effective date of the termination.

      (5) If a sponsor is unable or unwilling to carry out its responsibilities under ORS 285C.105, the director shall order termination of the enterprise zone and shall specify the effective date of the termination. However, in the case of failure to provide enhanced local public services, local incentives or local regulatory flexibility that the sponsor has established under ORS 285C.105, termination is not required if the sponsor provides to any affected authorized or qualified business firms new enhanced local public services, local incentives or local regulatory flexibility of comparable value, or makes reasonable corrections of shortcomings in existing local incentives. A sponsor may reduce the time within which it will provide enhanced local public services, local incentives and local regulatory flexibility to a time period equal to the amount of time allowed for an exemption under ORS 285C.175 without causing termination under this section.

      (6) A reservation enterprise zone designated, or a reservation partnership zone cosponsored, under ORS 285C.306 shall terminate in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, but may be redesignated at any time under ORS 285C.306. [Formerly 285B.686; 2010 c.76 §21; 2015 c.648 §23]

 

      285C.250 Redesignation or designation of new zone following zone termination. (1)(a) Within a reasonable period of time prior to the termination of an enterprise zone under ORS 285C.245 (2), the sponsors of the enterprise zone may redesignate the enterprise zone in accordance with ORS 285C.065 and 285C.074, except that the redesignation shall take effect no sooner than the date of termination.

      (b) The sponsor of an enterprise zone terminated under ORS 285C.245 (4) or (5) is not eligible to redesignate an enterprise zone or designate a new enterprise zone for a period not to exceed 10 years after the zone is terminated.

      (c) Paragraph (b) of this subsection does not apply to a county government if the terminated zone was also jointly sponsored by one or more cities or ports.

      (2) Enterprise zones redesignated under this section are subject to ORS 285C.245. [Formerly 285B.689; 2005 c.94 §10; 2005 c.704 §12; 2009 c.33 §5; 2012 c.71 §3; 2015 c.648 §24]

      285C.303 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that the welfare of the residents of the rural Indian reservations of this state is acutely dependent upon the growth, development and expansion of employment and business opportunities within reservation boundaries. Geographic and other obstacles have made it difficult for rural Indian reservations to attract and retain private business investment. The tax systems of this state, by subjecting businesses located within reservation boundaries to state taxation in addition to any taxation imposed by the reservations themselves, has heightened the economic isolation of this state’s rural reservations and impeded the efforts of Indian tribes to develop sufficient tax bases to fund essential governmental services on their reservations. The Legislative Assembly further finds that it is in the best interests of this state to create equality that will enable rural Indian reservations to attract and retain private business investment. The Legislative Assembly declares that it is the purpose of ORS 285C.300 to 285C.320 to remove the tax disincentives that currently inhibit private business and industry from locating and operating enterprises within the boundaries of the rural Indian reservations of this state. [Formerly 285B.767]

      (b) Upon request, the department shall designate a reservation enterprise zone if the land for which zone designation is sought is:

      (A) Land held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the tribe;

      (B) Land for which an application to transfer the land into trust has been filed with the federal government and is pending; or

      (C) Land that is located within the boundaries of the tribe’s reservation.

      (c) Land designated as a reservation enterprise zone pursuant to paragraph (b)(A) or (B) of this subsection may be outside the boundaries of the tribe’s reservation.

      (3)(a) The government of an eligible Indian tribe may cosponsor a reservation partnership zone comprising an area of up to 12 square miles.

      (2) Reservation enterprise zones and reservation partnership zones may not be taken into account in determining the number of rural enterprise zones allowable in this state under ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250, and are not subject to numerical limitation under ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250.

      (3) Exemptions and tax credits available in connection with an enterprise zone are available in connection with a reservation enterprise zone or a reservation partnership zone.

      (f) Information regarding the proposed use of proceeds from the issuance of the qualified equity investment.

      (g) A nonrefundable application fee of $20,000. This fee shall be paid to the department and shall be required for each application submitted.

      (2) Within 15 days after receipt of a completed application containing the information necessary for the department to certify a proposed equity investment, including the payment of the application fee, the department shall grant or deny the application in full or in part. If the department denies any part of the application, the department shall inform the qualified community development entity of the grounds for the denial. If the qualified community development entity provides any additional information required by the department or otherwise completes its application within 15 days after the notice of denial, the application shall be considered completed as of the original date of submission. If the qualified community development entity fails to provide the information or complete its application within the 15-day period, the application remains denied and must be resubmitted in full with a new submission date.

      Note: 285C.650, 285C.653, 285C.656 and 285C.659 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 285C or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      285C.653 Tax credit utilization limit per tax year; rules. (1) Once the Oregon Business Development Department has certified a cumulative amount of qualified equity investments that can result in the utilization of $16 million of tax credits in any tax year, the department may not certify any more qualified equity investments under ORS 285C.650. This limitation shall be based on the scheduled utilization of tax credits without regard to the potential for taxpayers to carry forward tax credits to later tax years.

      (2) The Department of Revenue may recapture any portion of a tax credit allowed under ORS 315.533 if:

      (a) Any amount of federal tax credit that might be available with respect to the qualified equity investment that generated the tax credit under ORS 315.533 is recaptured under section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code. The department’s recapture shall be proportionate to the federal recapture with respect to the qualified equity investment.

      (b) The qualified community development entity redeems or makes a principal repayment with respect to the qualified equity investment that generated the tax credit prior to the final credit allowance date of the qualified equity investment. The department’s recapture shall be proportionate to the amount of the redemption or repayment with respect to the qualified equity investment.

      (c) The qualified community development entity fails to invest at least 85 percent of the purchase price of the qualified equity investment in qualified low-income community investments within 12 months of the issuance of the qualified equity investment and maintain the same level of investment in qualified low-income community investments until the last credit allowance date for the qualified equity investment. For purposes of calculating the amount of qualified low-income community investments held by a qualified community development entity, an investment shall be considered held by the entity even if the investment has been sold or repaid provided that the entity reinvests an amount equal to the capital returned to or recovered from the original investment, exclusive of any profits realized, in another qualified active low-income community business in this state within 12 months of the receipt of the capital. A qualified community development entity may not be required to reinvest capital returned from qualified low-income community investments after the sixth anniversary of the issuance of the qualified equity investment, the proceeds of which were used to make the qualified low-income community investment, and the qualified low-income community investment shall be considered held by the issuer through the qualified equity investment’s final credit allowance date.

      (3) The department shall provide notice to the qualified community development entity of any proposed recapture of tax credits pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The entity shall have 90 days to cure any deficiency indicated in the department’s original recapture notice and avoid the recapture. If the entity fails or is unable to cure the deficiency within the 90-day period, the department shall provide the entity and the taxpayer from whom the credit is to be collected with a final order of recapture. Any tax credit for which a final recapture order has been issued shall be recaptured by the department from the taxpayer who claimed the tax credit on a tax return.
