      (a) Has categorized the bonds that may be issued under bond programs as general obligation, direct revenue and pass-through revenue bonds; and

      (b) Assigned a maximum amount to each category.

      (6) This section applies to bonds:

      (2) To estimate the amount of cash flow deficit, the State Treasurer shall take into account the most recent cash flow forecast made by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and any other information the State Treasurer determines is reliable and relevant.

      (3) When the State Treasurer issues bonds under this section:

      (a) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall account for and administer the proceeds of the bonds and the repayment of the bonds. The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, shall determine the appropriate investment strategy for the proceeds of the bonds. The State Treasurer shall notify the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, the Legislative Fiscal Officer and the Legislative Revenue Officer before issuing bonds under this section.

      (b) The State Treasurer may pledge:

      (A) All or a portion of the revenues of the State of Oregon to pay bonds issued under this section.

      (B) The full faith and credit of the State of Oregon to pay bonds issued under this section if the bonds are payable from the Short Term Borrowing Account established under ORS 286A.050 and the bonds mature not later than the end of the biennium in which the bonds are issued.

      (c) A state agency may use the proceeds of bonds issued under this section:

      (A) For a purpose for which the revenues that are pledged to pay the bonds may be used;

      (B) To pay principal, interest and premium, if any, on the bonds or a rebate or penalty due to the United States in connection with the bonds;

      (C) To pay the cost of credit enhancement devices with respect to the bonds;

      (D) To pay the costs of the State Treasurer and the Oregon Department of Administrative Services of issuing, administering or maintaining the bonds including, but not limited to, the cost of a consultant or adviser retained by the State Treasurer or the Oregon Department of Administrative Services; or

      (E) To make payments with respect to agreements for the exchange of interest rates.

      (4) This section constitutes complete authority for the State Treasurer to issue bonds described in this section.

      (5) ORS 286A.035 does not apply to bonds authorized by this section.

      (6) The requirements and limitations that apply to certificates of indebtedness issued under ORS 293.165 do not apply to bonds issued by the State Treasurer under this section.

      (7) This section and ORS 286A.050 constitute complete authorization by the Legislative Assembly for the use and expenditure of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues pledged to pay those bonds for the purposes described in subsection (3)(c) of this section. Additional appropriation or authorization is not necessary. The authorization contained in this section and ORS 286A.050 to spend moneys for the purposes described in subsection (3)(c) of this section does not constitute an appropriation for purposes of ORS 291.357.

      (8) The proceeds of bonds issued by the State Treasurer under this section do not constitute revenues received by the General Fund for purposes of section 14, Article IX of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 291.349.

      (9) The State Treasurer may perform the duties and exercise the powers of a related agency under this section. [2007 c.783 §11]

 

      286A.050 Short Term Borrowing Account; sources; uses. (1) The Short Term Borrowing Account is created in the General Fund.

      (2) The State Treasurer shall credit the proceeds of bonds issued by the State Treasurer under ORS 286A.045 to the Short Term Borrowing Account. The State Treasurer shall, in addition, transfer to the Short Term Borrowing Account any amounts that are pledged to pay bonds issued by the State Treasurer under ORS 286A.045 and that are required to pay those bonds.

      (3) Amounts in the Short Term Borrowing Account are continuously appropriated to the respective state agencies for which the revenues that are pledged to pay the bonds were appropriated, for the purposes described in ORS 286A.045 (3)(c).

The faith and credit of the State of Oregon or any of its taxing power shall not be pledged or committed to the payment of lottery bonds or any other commitment of the State of Oregon authorized by ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585. [Formerly 286.563]

      (b) The agencies or other entities receiving proceeds of lottery bonds shall, if so directed by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, take any action specified by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that is necessary to maintain the excludability of lottery bond interest from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code. [Formerly 286.566]

 

      286A.570 Lottery Bond Fund; purposes. (1) The Lottery Bond Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. The amounts of unobligated net lottery proceeds described in ORS 286A.576 (2)(a) and (b) and any appropriated funds and investment earnings of the Lottery Bond Fund shall be credited to the Lottery Bond Fund. The State Treasurer may establish reserves for lottery bonds as provided in ORS 286A.580 (6). The reserves shall be credited to such account in the Lottery Bond Fund as the State Treasurer may designate.

      (2) The amounts credited to the Lottery Bond Fund are continuously appropriated only for the purpose of paying, when due, the principal of and the interest and premium, if any, on outstanding lottery bonds, funding lottery bond reserves and paying amounts due in connection with any instrument authorized by ORS 286A.580 (6).

      (3) The moneys in the Lottery Bond Fund shall be used and applied solely to pay, when due, the principal of and the interest and premium, if any, on any lottery bonds, to fund reserves and to pay amounts due under instruments authorized by ORS 286A.580 (6). [Formerly 286.570]

 

      286A.573 Lottery Bond Administrative Fund; purposes. The Lottery Bond Administrative Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. The amounts of unobligated net lottery proceeds specified in ORS 286A.576 (2)(c), the proceeds of any lottery bonds issued to pay bond-related costs and the investment earnings on amounts in the Lottery Bond Administrative Fund shall be credited to the Lottery Bond Administrative Fund. All moneys credited from time to time to the Lottery Bond Administrative Fund, including any investment earnings thereon, are appropriated continuously to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services only for payment of bond-related costs. Amounts in the Lottery Bond Administrative Fund shall be disbursed upon the written request of the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. [Formerly 286.573]

 

      286A.576 Allocation of lottery moneys for lottery bonds; priorities. (1) Subject only to the availability of unobligated net lottery proceeds, in each fiscal period established by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services in which lottery bonds are outstanding, there shall be allocated, in accordance with a schedule determined by the department, from the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund created by ORS 461.540 or, if unobligated net lottery proceeds in that fund are insufficient, from any other fund or account of this state that contains unobligated net lottery proceeds, an amount of unobligated net lottery proceeds that is sufficient:

      (a) To pay all lottery bond principal, interest and premium, if any, that is scheduled to be paid in that fiscal period;

      (b) To restore the balance in any reserve account for lottery bonds to the level the state has covenanted to maintain in the account under ORS 286A.580 (6), including any amounts due under an instrument authorized by ORS 286A.580 (6); and

      (c) To pay bond-related costs that will be due in that fiscal period.

      (2) The amounts of unobligated net lottery proceeds allocated pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be transferred to the following funds and accounts in the following order of priority:

      (a) First, there shall be transferred to the Lottery Bond Fund an amount of unobligated net lottery proceeds that, when added to any amounts credited to the Lottery Bond Fund that are available for such purpose, will be sufficient to pay all amounts of lottery bond principal, interest and premium scheduled to be paid in that fiscal period;

      (b) Second, if the balances in any reserve accounts for lottery bonds are less than the amounts the state has covenanted to maintain in those reserve accounts, there shall be transferred to the Lottery Bond Fund for credit to those reserve accounts amounts of unobligated net lottery proceeds sufficient to restore the balances in those reserve accounts to the levels the state has covenanted to maintain; and

      (c) Third, any remaining amount shall be transferred to the Lottery Bond Administrative Fund.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in accordance with Article XV, section 4 (4), of the Oregon Constitution, the annual allocations of unobligated net lottery proceeds made by this section and the transfers of unobligated net lottery proceeds required to be made by this section shall be satisfied and credited from the first unobligated net lottery proceeds received by this state before any other allocation, appropriation or disbursement of the earnings of the unobligated net lottery proceeds is made in the fiscal period.

      (4) The percentages of revenues of the Oregon State Lottery that are dedicated for particular purposes under Article XV, section 4 (4), of the Oregon Constitution, shall be calculated without deducting from the total lottery revenues the amount of unobligated net lottery proceeds that are required to pay lottery bonds.

      (5) If there are not sufficient revenues of the Oregon State Lottery to pay lottery bonds and to satisfy the percentage dedications set forth in the Oregon Constitution, the State Treasurer shall, before issuing any series of lottery bonds, cause a projection of unobligated net lottery proceeds and lottery bond debt service to be prepared. The State Treasurer shall not issue a series of lottery bonds if the projection indicates that there will not be sufficient proceeds of the Oregon State Lottery to satisfy the percentage dedications of Article XV, section 4 (4), of the Oregon Constitution, and to leave unobligated net lottery proceeds in amounts at least equal to the debt service on all lottery bonds, including the series proposed to be issued. However, if at some time in the future a conflict arises because of a decline in revenues of the Oregon State Lottery, unobligated net lottery proceeds shall be allocated and applied first to pay lottery bonds, and the remaining net revenues of the Oregon State Lottery shall be divided pro rata among the constitutionally dedicated uses.

      (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the Legislative Assembly enacts laws granting pledges, making dedications or making appropriations of net proceeds of the Oregon State Lottery for purposes other than payment of lottery bonds, all such pledges, dedications and appropriations, whenever granted or made, shall be subordinate to the pledges and dedications of unobligated net lottery proceeds for lottery bonds. [Formerly 286.576; 2015 c.20 §1]

 

      286A.578 Litigation challenging legality of Oregon State Lottery. (1) Lottery bonds may be issued pursuant to ORS 286A.580 without regard to any litigation challenging the legality of the Oregon State Lottery. Lottery bonds issued pursuant to ORS 286A.580 are valid and binding obligations of the State of Oregon that are payable only from amounts pledged under ORS 286A.580 (7) or from appropriated funds, even if the Oregon State Lottery is partially or wholly invalidated. In the event the lottery is invalidated, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall request the Legislative Assembly or, if the Legislative Assembly is not in session, the Emergency Board to provide appropriated funds pursuant to ORS 286A.580 (6).

      (2) By enacting this section, the Legislative Assembly acknowledges its current intention to provide appropriated funds if amounts are certified by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services under ORS 286A.580, but the Legislative Assembly or the Emergency Board does not have a legal obligation to provide appropriated funds. [Formerly 286.578]

 

      286A.580 Issuance of lottery bonds; refunding bonds; bond covenants; reserves for bonds; appropriation to maintain reserves; credit enhancements. (1) The State Treasurer, at the request of the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, may issue lottery bonds from time to time to finance any lottery bond program and to pay costs of issuing lottery bonds and administering the lottery bond program, and the State Treasury may be paid for all bond-related costs the State Treasury incurs.

      (2) Lottery bond proceeds and unobligated net lottery proceeds may be used to pay bond-related costs.

      (3) In addition to lottery bonds for any lottery bond program, the State Treasurer may, at the request of the affected agency or the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, issue one or more series of refunding lottery bonds. The refunding lottery bonds shall be structured so that the amount required to pay those bonds in each year does not exceed the amount of unobligated net lottery proceeds that could have been committed to pay the lottery bonds that are refunded. Refunding lottery bonds shall be issued in such amount as the State Treasurer determines is necessary or appropriate in order to:

      (a) Pay or defease the principal of and the interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds to be refunded; and

      (b) Pay any bond-related costs related to the refunding lottery bonds.

      (4) All lottery bonds issued under this section shall be payable from:

      (a) The amount pledged for payment under subsection (7) of this section; and

      (b) Any appropriated funds.

      (5) The lottery bonds shall not be general obligations of this state and shall not be secured by or payable from any funds or assets of this state other than the amounts pledged for payment or security and any appropriated funds. The Legislative Assembly shall not be under any legal compulsion or obligation to provide any appropriated funds and shall not be liable to any party for any failure to provide appropriated funds. All lottery bonds issued under ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585 shall contain a statement that this state is not obligated to pay lottery bond principal, interest or premium thereon from any source other than the amounts pledged for payment and any appropriated funds, and that the full faith and credit or the taxing power of the State of Oregon are not pledged to the payment of lottery bond principal, interest or premium.

      (6) The State Treasurer may establish reserves for lottery bonds. The reserves may be in the form of cash, investments, surety bonds, municipal bond insurance, lines of credit, letters of credit or other similar instruments. The State Treasurer, on behalf of the State of Oregon, may covenant to maintain the reserves at particular levels, but solely from the amounts that may be pledged to pay lottery bonds under subsection (7) of this section. If the reserves are drawn down below the level that this state has covenanted to maintain, the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall promptly certify to the Legislative Assembly or, if the Legislative Assembly is not then in session, to the Emergency Board, the amount needed to restore the reserves to their required level. The Legislative Assembly or the Emergency Board may provide appropriated funds in the amount certified by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. Any appropriated funds so provided shall be used immediately to restore the balance in the reserves established for the lottery bonds. The State of Oregon may enter into covenants with the owners of the lottery bonds that specify the timing and content of the director’s certification. By enacting this subsection, the Legislative Assembly acknowledges its current intention to provide appropriated funds in the amount certified by the director under this subsection. However, the Legislative Assembly or the Emergency Board shall not have any legal obligation to provide any appropriated funds.

      (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the State Treasurer may pledge all or any portion of the unobligated net lottery proceeds, amounts in the Lottery Bond Fund and any unexpended lottery bond proceeds to pay lottery bonds and to pay amounts due in connection with any credit enhancement or any instrument authorized by subsection (6) of this section. The lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding immediately upon delivery by the state of the lottery bonds, credit enhancement agreement or instrument secured by the pledge. The amounts so pledged shall be immediately subject to the lien of the pledge upon receipt of the amounts by this state regardless of when or whether they are allocated or transferred to the Lottery Bond Fund or the Lottery Bond Administrative Fund and regardless of whether there was physical delivery, filing or other act. Except to the extent provided in the pledge, the lien of the pledge shall be superior to all other claims, liens and appropriations of any kind. The State Treasurer may provide that lottery bonds may be issued in different series and that each series may be secured by a lien on, and pledge of, the unobligated net lottery proceeds that is superior to, subordinate to, or on a parity with, the lien of the pledge securing other series of lottery bonds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the powers granted in any other part of ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585.

      (8) Any covenants made under this section for the benefit of owners of lottery bonds shall constitute contracts between the State of Oregon and the owners of lottery bonds. The State Treasurer, or the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services with the consent of the State Treasurer, may, on behalf of the State of Oregon and in addition to the covenants authorized by subsection (6) of this section, make the following covenants for the benefit of the owners of lottery bonds and any providers of credit enhancement or instruments authorized by subsection (6) of this section:

      (a) Except as permitted by a pledge made under subsection (7) of this section, this state shall not create any lien or encumbrance on the unobligated net lottery proceeds that is superior to the liens of the pledges authorized by subsection (7) of this section.

      (b) Subject only to the availability of unobligated net lottery proceeds, the State of Oregon shall budget and appropriate in each fiscal year an amount of unobligated net lottery proceeds that, when added to other funds lawfully budgeted and appropriated and available for the purpose, will be sufficient:

      (A) To pay in full the principal, interest and premium due and to become due on all outstanding lottery bonds in the fiscal year;

      (B) To maintain the required balance in any reserves established for lottery bonds; and

      (C) To pay amounts due to the providers of credit enhancement for lottery bonds or instruments authorized by subsection (6) of this section.

      (c) This state shall apply the unobligated net lottery proceeds and any other amounts so budgeted and appropriated for those purposes.

      (d) This state shall continue to operate the Oregon State Lottery until all lottery bonds are paid or defeased.

      (9) In connection with the issuance of any lottery bonds, the State Treasurer may establish such accounts and subaccounts within the Lottery Bond Fund that the State Treasurer determines are necessary or appropriate. In addition, the State Treasurer or the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services may, on behalf of this state, enter into any agreements that the State Treasurer determines are necessary or appropriate to issue lottery bonds and carry out the provisions of ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585 and all legislation authorizing lottery bond programs.

      (10) If the State Treasurer determines that the acquisition is cost-effective, the State Treasurer may acquire a municipal bond insurance policy, letter of credit, line of credit, surety bond or other credit enhancement device for lottery bonds, and may enter into any related agreements.

      (11) The State Treasurer may provide that all or any portion of the Lottery Bond Fund, the Lottery Bond Administrative Fund or any accounts in either fund shall be held by a trustee, may enter into agreements with the trustee regarding the use and application of the amounts held in those funds and accounts and may transfer amounts credited to those funds and accounts to the trustee. [Formerly 286.580]

 

      286A.585 Lottery bonds for community sports facilities; use of proceeds of bonds. (1) Pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585 and subject to future legislative approval, lottery bonds may be issued to make grants or loans to Oregon cities to fund projects for the reconstruction, renovation or development of community sports facilities in order to make the facilities suitable for use by a major league baseball team if a city is selected as an expansion site by major league baseball or if a major league baseball team agrees to relocate to a city.

      (2) The use of lottery bond proceeds is authorized based on the following findings:

      (a) The financial assistance to cities will assist in the construction, improvement and expansion of infrastructure and community facilities that comprise the physical foundation for commercial activity and provide the basic framework for continued and expanded economic opportunities and quality communities throughout Oregon.

      (b) Such financial assistance to cities will therefore promote economic development within this state, and thus the use of net proceeds derived from the operation of the Oregon State Lottery to pay debt service on lottery bonds issued under this section to provide such financial assistance to cities is an appropriate use of state lottery funds under section 4, Article XV of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 461.510.

      (3) Lottery bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be issued only at the request of the Director of the Oregon Business Development Department.

      (4) The net proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund established by ORS 285B.551. The Director of the Oregon Business Development Department shall allocate the moneys deposited in the Economic Infrastructure Project Fund for the purpose described in this section in accordance with the priorities developed by the Oregon Business Development Commission in accordance with ORS 285A.020.

      (5) The proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be used only for the purposes set forth in this section and for bond-related costs. [Formerly 286.585]
