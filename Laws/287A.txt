[2007 c.783 §44; 2013 c.491 §4]

 

      287A.105 Limitation on bonded indebtedness of county. (1) A county may incur bonded indebtedness within the meaning of section 10, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, by issuing revenue bonds when a county is expressly authorized to issue revenue bonds by a law other than this section.

      (2) The change in the use of facilities described in subsection (1) of this section does not affect any authority the county may have to impose taxes outside the limitations imposed by Article XI, sections 11 and 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, for the original bonds or bonds issued to refund the original bonds.

      (3) The county shall use any revenue from the change in the use of facilities to reduce the taxes imposed to pay bond-related costs. [2013 c.684 §1]

If within 60 days after the publication of the notice described in subsection (4) of this section, electors file petitions with the public body containing valid signatures of at least five percent of the public body’s electors, the public body:

      (A) Shall place the question of issuing the revenue bonds on the ballot at the next lawfully available election date; and

      (a) The date the resolution was adopted and the number thereof, if any;

      (b) The expected source of revenue for repayment of the revenue bonds;

      (c) The estimated principal amount of the revenue bonds to be sold;

If revenue bonds are authorized by resolution under subsection (3) of this section, the revenue bonds may be secured by the revenues or other property of the public body that is described in the notice required under subsection (4) of this section.

      (6) A public body may issue refunding bonds under ORS 287A.360 to 287A.380 to pay revenue bonds that were authorized by this section. The procedures and limitations of subsections (1) to (5) of this section do not apply to refunding bonds. [2007 c.783 §46]

 

      287A.180 Short-term borrowing by public body.

      (b) Obtain credit enhancement devices for the revenue bonds authorized by this section.

      (c) Establish debt service reserves.

      (d) Enter into covenants, by ordinance, resolution or agreement, for the protection and security of the owners of revenue bonds authorized by this section. The covenants constitute enforceable contracts with the owners of the revenue bonds.

      (4) Revenue bonds authorized by this section that are issued in anticipation of grant moneys or to provide interim financing for capital projects and revenue bonds issued under subsection (1)(c) of this section must mature not later than five years after the revenue bonds are issued.

      (5) The debt limitations imposed by law or the charter of a public body do not apply to revenue bonds or credit enhancement devices authorized by this section. [2007 c.783 §47]

      (c) If a bond is issued to a provider of a credit enhancement device for a bond that is subject to a debt limit, the bond issued to the provider must be taken into account only to the extent that the amount of the bond issued to the provider exceeds the amount of the bond secured by the credit enhancement device.

      (d) A public body may deduct from the amount of outstanding indebtedness:

      (A) The amount of money and investments that the public body or a trustee of the public body or a trustee or agent of the public body holds to pay bonds that have not been defeased.

      (B) The commitment of a public body in connection with a credit enhancement device; or

      (C) An agreement for exchange of interest rates.

      (b) “Property” means:

      (A) Real or personal property, tangible or intangible, whether owned when a pledge is made or acquired subsequently to the time the pledge is made; and

      (3) When otherwise authorized by statute, charter, ordinance or resolution to issue bonds, a public body may pledge as security for payment of obligations all or part of the property of the public body expressly authorized to be pledged by the governing body of the public body.

      (4) The lien created by a pledge is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. Pledged property is subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery, filing or any other act.

      (5) Except as otherwise expressly provided in an operative document, the lien of the pledge is superior to and has priority over all other claims and liens.

      (6) When property subject to a pledge is acquired by a public body after the pledge is made:

      (a) The property is subject to the lien upon acquisition by the public body without physical delivery, filing or any other act.

      (b) The lien relates to the time the pledge was originally made.

      (7) A public body may reserve a right to pledge a pledged property as security for bonds subsequently issued by the public body. If the public body reserves the right, subject to the terms of the operative document that created a previous pledge, the lien of the subsequent pledge may be on a parity or pari passu basis with the lien of the previous pledge, on a prior and superior basis with the lien of the previous pledge or on a subordinate basis with the lien of the previous pledge, as specified in the operative document creating the subsequent pledge. The lien of the subsequent pledge:

      (b) Is superior to and has priority over all other claims and liens except the lien of a pledge with which the lien of the subsequent pledge is on a parity or subordinate basis, as specified in the operative document.

      (8) A pledgee may commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose the lien of the pledge and exercise rights and remedies available to the pledgee under the operative document.

      (9) When pledged property consists of moneys or property that is in a fund for debt service reserves or payments, a pledgee may foreclose the lien of the pledge by applying the moneys or property in the fund to the payment of the bonds subject to the terms, conditions and limitations in the operative document. [2007 c.783 §50]

 

      287A.315 Pledge of full faith and credit and taxing power. (1) A public body may pledge its full faith and credit and taxing power when the public body issues:

      (a) A general obligation bond; or

      (b) An obligation that is secured by all lawfully available funds of the public body.

      (2) When a public body pledges its full faith and credit and taxing power to pay an obligation, the pledge constitutes an enforceable promise or contract by the public body:

      (a) To pay the obligation out of lawfully available funds of the public body; and

      (b) If lawfully available funds are insufficient to pay when due the amounts owing on the obligation, to levy, impose and collect a tax that is within the authority of the public body to levy, impose and collect in an amount sufficient to pay the amounts owing under the obligation, including past due amounts and penalties.

      (3) If a public body fails to pay when due an amount owing under an obligation secured by a pledge of the full faith and credit and taxing power of the public body, the owner of the obligation, or the trustee appointed to act on behalf of the owner, may bring an action in the circuit court of the county in which the principal offices of the public body are located to compel the public body:

      (a) To appropriate and expend sufficient lawfully available funds to pay the amounts owing on the obligation; or

      (b) If lawfully available funds are insufficient to pay when due the amounts owing on the obligation, to levy, impose and collect a tax that is within the authority of the public body to levy, impose and collect in an amount sufficient to pay the amounts owing under the obligation, including past due amounts and penalties.

      (4) An owner of the obligation, or a trustee appointed to act on behalf of the owner, may initiate a proceeding to impose remedial sanctions under ORS 33.055 against members of the governing body of a public body for failure to comply with an order of the court under this section.

      (5) A pledge of the full faith and credit and taxing power authorized by this section does not, by itself, create a lien on the revenues or property of the public body. [2007 c.783 §50a]

 

      287A.325 Covenants of public bodies regarding pledges. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) It is a matter of statewide concern that certain covenants made by public bodies regarding a pledge of revenues to secure bonds not be impaired by subsequent initiative or referendum measures.

      (b) The covenants described in paragraph (a) of this subsection usually are in the form of a promise to charge and collect rates, fees, tolls, rentals or other charges sufficient to produce moneys to maintain a specified level of debt service coverage.

      (c) The possibility that the covenants described in paragraph (a) of this subsection might be rolled back, frozen or otherwise subjected to subsequently imposed conditions or restrictions negatively affects the ability of public bodies to market their bonds, to obtain credit enhancement and to obtain satisfactory ratings on their bonds.

      (2) Therefore, the Legislative Assembly declares that covenants are material to the security for bonds and to investors’ expectations regarding timely payment of the bonds.

      (3) An elector-approved initiative or referendum measure that purports to change ordinances or resolutions affecting rates, fees, tolls, rentals or other charges has no force or effect if giving force and effect to the change would impair existing covenants made with existing bond owners.

      (4) A public body may enter into rate covenants that obligate the public body to periodically set rates and charges:

      (a) That generate pledged revenues at specific levels including, but not limited to, a specific monetary charge for each unit of commodity or service provided or a schedule of rates and charges that includes fixed and variable components;

      (b) At levels sufficient to maintain underlying credit ratings assigned to bonds by one or more nationally recognized credit rating services without regard to improvement in credit ratings due to the additional security provided for the bonds by a credit enhancement device;

      (c) That generate pledged revenues each year in amounts at least equal to operations and maintenance expenses of the system that produces the pledged revenues, plus debt service on revenue bonds and other borrowings, plus an additional amount that is reasonably required to obtain favorable terms for the revenue bonds and other borrowings; or

      (d) In accordance with a formula established in the operative document governing revenue bonds or other borrowings. The formula may provide for rates and charges to be determined by reference to factors including, but not limited to:

      (A) Historical operating expenses;

      (B) Projected future operating expenses;

      (C) The funding of depreciation;

      (D) The costs of capital improvements;

      (E) The costs of complying with contractual obligations and covenants;

      (F) The costs of complying with regulatory requirements;

      (G) Reports of independent consultants regarding the level of pledged revenues required to operate and maintain a utility in accordance with prudent utility practice;

      (H) Debt service on the revenue bonds or other borrowings bonds; and

      (I) The moneys needed to establish or maintain reserves required by law or contract and the moneys needed to maintain an unencumbered carryforward fund balance or working capital to meet unanticipated expenses or fluctuations in revenues that may arise.

      (5) Without regard to the date of execution of a rate covenant, a rate covenant authorized by this section is a contract that binds the public body and is enforceable against the public body in accordance with the terms of the rate covenant. [2007 c.783 §51]

 

      287A.335 Agreements for exchange of interest rates; rules. (1) As used in this section, “counterparty” means an entity with whom a public body enters into an agreement for exchange of interest rates.

      (2) Upon a finding by a public body that an agreement for exchange of interest rates benefits the public body, the public body may enter into the agreement for exchange of interest rates with a counterparty. An agreement for exchange of interest rates may be made to manage payment, interest rate, spread or similar exposure undertaken in connection with related bonds that:

      (a) Exist when the agreement for exchange of interest rates is executed;

      (b) Are reasonably expected to be executed when regularly scheduled payments are due from the issuer under the agreement; or

      (c) Are identified after the agreement for exchange of interest rates is executed and substituted for related bonds described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection as a result of prepayment, refunding, conversion, ratings changes, redemption, defeasance or other similar event.

      (3) Upon entering into an agreement for exchange of interest rates under this section and continuing until the agreement is satisfied, terminated or otherwise no longer in effect, provided a payment default has not occurred, the public body may treat the amount or rate of interest on the related bond as the amount or rate of interest payable after giving effect to the agreement for exchange of interest rates for the purpose of calculating:

      (a) Tax levies to pay regularly scheduled bond debt service; and

      (b) Other amounts that are based on the rate of interest of the bond.

      (4) Subject to covenants applicable to a related bond and the limitations of this section, payments required under an agreement for exchange of interest rates may:

      (a) Be treated as interest payments on the related bond;

      (b) Be made from revenues or other moneys contributed to or legally available to pay the related bond; and

      (c) Rank in an order of priority of payment relative to the payment of the related bond as the public body determines.

      (5) In connection with entering into an agreement for exchange of interest rates, a public body may obtain a credit enhancement device to secure the agreement for exchange of interest rates.

      (6) An agreement for exchange of interest rates entered into under this section:

      (a) Is not a debt or other obligation of the issuer for purposes of any limitation upon the indebtedness of the issuer.

      (b) Is subject only to the limitations of this section and is not subject to other limitations applicable to the related borrowing.

      (7) A termination payment required to be paid by the public body under an agreement for exchange of interest rates:

      (a) May be paid from moneys derived from the issuance and sale of revenue bonds.

      (b) May not be paid from ad valorem property taxes levied outside the limitations of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (8) The Oregon Municipal Debt Advisory Commission shall adopt administrative rules establishing required terms, conditions, annual or periodic reporting requirements and other requirements for an agreement for exchange of interest rates entered into by a public body, if the commission determines those requirements are desirable to protect the interests of the public body.

      (9) A public body may create reserves to pay amounts due under agreements for exchange of interest rates and fund the reserves with moneys derived from the issuance and sale of bonds or from revenues or other moneys described in subsection (4)(b) of this section. [2007 c.783 §53; 2009 c.538 §8]

 

      287A.339 Termination payment of conduit borrower. When a public body is authorized by law to issue bonds, the public body may lend moneys derived from an issuance and sale of bonds to a conduit borrower of proceeds from outstanding, previously issued conduit revenue bonds for the purpose of paying a termination payment required to be paid by the borrower under an agreement for exchange of interest rates entered into by the borrower in relation to the outstanding conduit revenue bonds. [2009 c.538 §6]

 

      Note: 287A.339 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 287A by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      287A.340 Credit enhancement devices. (1) A public body may obtain a credit enhancement device and enter into related agreements.

      (2) The public body may pay the provider of the credit enhancement device from the same sources that the public body may lawfully use to pay the related bonds or from any other legally available source.

      (3) The public body may issue a bond to the provider of a credit enhancement device to secure the obligations of the public body or to pay amounts due to the provider. [2007 c.783 §52]

 

      287A.343 Public body purchase of own bonds. (1) Notwithstanding any limitation in a local charter, a public body may bid for, purchase, hold, cause to be held in trust and remarket bonds issued by the public body.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in the operative documents, the purchase or acquisition of bonds under this section does not cancel or extinguish the bonds unless the public body elects in writing to cancel or extinguish the bonds. [2009 c.537 §4]

 

      Note: 287A.343 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 287A by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      287A.345 State taxation of bond interest. Interest on bonds of a public body is exempt from personal income tax under ORS chapter 316. [2007 c.783 §65]

 

      287A.350 Public records. The records of registered bond ownership, whether maintained by a public body or otherwise, are not public records within the meaning of ORS 192.311. [2007 c.783 §69; 2017 c.456 §10]

      287A.365 Advance refunding bonds and forward current refunding. (1) The Legislative Assembly declares that the issuance of advance refunding bonds and the authority to effect a forward current refunding are matters of general statewide concern, and ORS 287A.360 to 287A.380 preempt all local statutory or charter authority to issue advance refunding bonds or to effect a forward current refunding.

      (2) A public body may issue advance refunding bonds or enter into forward current refundings in compliance with:
