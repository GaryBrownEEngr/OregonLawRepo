The Attorney General may condition an authorization on a finding by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, or a designee of the director, the State Chief Information Officer, or a designee of the State Chief Information Officer, or by any other agency with a role in approving such contracts that the contract administration practices of the requesting agency are adequate to manage the proposed contract and that the mission of the agency will be significantly impaired without such authorization.

      (2) Upon approval of the public contract for legal sufficiency and ratification of the public contract by a state agency under this section, the public contract is effective and the state agency may make payments on the ratified public contract even if the payments are for services rendered prior to ratification.

      (2) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall devise and supervise statewide financial management systems for all state agencies by preparing policies and procedures for implementing and operating financial management systems for all agencies in state government and measuring implementation.

      (g) No later than October 1 of each year, submit a report to the Legislative Fiscal Officer on the progress state agencies have made in meeting performance measures.

      (2) State agencies shall develop measurable performance measures consistent with and aimed at achieving performance outcomes. To that end, each state agency shall:

      (a) Identify the mission, goals and objectives of the agency and any applicable performance measures to which the goals are directed.

      (b) Develop written defined performance measures that quantify desired organization intermediate outcomes, outputs, responsibilities, results, products and services, and, where possible, develop unit cost measures for evaluating program efficiency.

      (c) Involve agency managers, supervisors and employees in the development of statements of mission, goals, objectives and performance measures as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection and establish teams composed of agency managers, supervisors and employees to implement agency goals, objectives and performance measures.

      291.120 Distribution of agency savings; agency use. (1) Pursuant to ORS 291.252, if the Oregon Department of Administrative Services certifies agency savings due to agency actions rather than changes in service demands and such actions do not materially reduce legislatively authorized programs, 50 percent of the savings shall be credited to the General Fund or, if the agency’s funds originated as dedicated funds or federal funds, to the fund or account of the agency to be used for purposes of the fund or account.

      (2) The remaining 50 percent shall be continuously appropriated to the agency for enhancing professional development, including employee training projects related to productivity, technology enhancement and related expenditures that have a long term benefit.

STATE BUDGET; GOVERNOR’S BUDGET AND TAX EXPENDITURE REPORT

 

      291.190 Short title. ORS 291.195, 291.201 and 291.203 may be cited as the Budget Accountability Act. [1995 c.746 §61]

 

      Note: 291.190 and 291.195 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 291 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      291.195 Policy for financial expenditure planning. (1) The Legislative Assembly hereby declares that the ability to make fiscally sound and effective spending decisions has been enhanced by requiring agencies and programs to develop performance measures and to evaluate all General Fund, State Lottery Fund and other expenditures in accordance with these performance measures. Fiscal pressure on this state requires even greater accountability and necessitates a review of the fairness and efficiency of all tax deductions, tax exclusions, tax subtractions, tax exemptions, tax deferrals, preferential tax rates and tax credits. These types of tax expenditures are similar to direct government expenditures because they provide special benefits to favored individuals or businesses, and thus result in higher tax rates for all individuals.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly further finds that 76 percent of property in this state is exempt from property taxation and that income tax expenditures total billions of dollars per biennium. An accurate and accountable state budget should reflect the true costs of tax expenditures and should fund only those tax expenditures that are effective and efficient uses of limited tax dollars.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares that it is in the best interest of this state to have prepared a biennial report of tax expenditures that will allow the public and policy makers to identify and analyze tax expenditures and to periodically make criteria-based decisions on whether the expenditures should be continued. The tax expenditure report will allow tax expenditures to be debated in conjunction with online budgets and will result in the elimination of inefficient and inappropriate tax expenditures, resulting in greater accountability by state government and a lowering of the tax burden on all taxpayers. [1995 c.746 §62]

 

      Note: See note under 291.190.

 

      291.200 Budget policy. (1) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to require the Governor, in the preparation of the Governor’s budget, to state as precisely as possible what programs the Governor recommends be approved for funding under estimated revenues under ORS 291.342. If estimated revenues are inadequate, the Legislative Assembly intends that it be advised by the Governor as precisely as possible how the Legislative Assembly might proceed to raise the additional funds. It is also the intent of the Legislative Assembly, in the event that the additional funding is not possible, to be informed by the Governor precisely what programs or portions thereof the Governor recommends be reduced accordingly. Finally, if the Governor chooses to recommend additional new programs or program enhancements, the Legislative Assembly intends that the Governor specify how the additional funding might be achieved. The Legislative Assembly believes that the state government must allocate its resources for effective and efficient delivery of public services by:

      (a) Clearly identifying desired results;

      (b) Setting priorities;

      (c) Assigning accountability; and

      (d) Measuring, reporting and evaluating outcomes to determine future allocation.

      (2) In addition to the intentions of subsection (1) of this section, in preparing the Governor’s budget, the Governor and the Legislative Assembly shall use an outcomes-based budgeting process described in ORS 291.217 (2) and (3).

      (3) To achieve the intentions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, it is the budget policy of this state to create and administer programs and services designed to attain societal outcomes and to promote the efficient and measured use of resources.

      (4) To effect the policy stated in subsection (3) of this section, state government shall:

      (a) Allocate resources to achieve desired outcomes;

      (b) Express program outcomes in measurable terms;

      (c) Measure progress toward desired outcomes;

      (d) Encourage savings;

      (e) Promote investments that reduce or avoid future costs;

      (f) Plan for the short term and long term using consistent assumptions for major demographic and other trends; and

      (g) Require accountability at all levels for meeting program outcomes. [1985 c.270 §1; 1993 c.724 §8; 2011 c.563 §6; 2016 c.117 §11]

[1995 c.746 §63; 2005 c.837 §9; 2007 c.217 §11]

ALLOTMENTS

 

      291.232 Declaration of policy. (1) It is declared to be the policy and intent of the Legislative Assembly that:

      (a) The legislatively adopted or approved budget for a state agency constitutes a determination by the Legislative Assembly of the amount needed by the agency for the biennium to meet the responsibilities imposed on the agency through the budget and through statutes governing the agency; and

      (b) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, appropriations from the General Fund to a state agency constitute a direction to the agency to spend the amount of moneys appropriated in order to meet the responsibilities imposed on the agency through the budget and through statutes governing the agency.

      (2) If a state agency does not need all of the moneys that are made available to it by the legislatively adopted or approved budget to meet its responsibilities, the agency need not spend all moneys appropriated or otherwise made available to it.

      (3) The Governor and the Oregon Department of Administrative Services are given the powers granted by ORS 291.201 to 291.222 and 291.232 to 291.260 in order that the Governor and the department might effect savings, without reducing the responsibilities imposed on state agencies, by:

      (a) Careful supervision throughout each biennium, with due regard to changing conditions; and

      (b) Promotion of more economic and efficient management of state agencies. [Amended by 2003 c.734 §11]

 

      291.234 Department to make allotments to state officers and agencies of appropriations and funds; allotment period; exemptions. (1) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall make allotments to state officers and agencies of appropriations and funds pursuant to the allotment system provided for in ORS 291.234 to 291.260.

      (2) For the purposes of the allotment system, each fiscal year shall be divided into four quarterly allotment periods, beginning, respectively, on the first days of July, October, January and April. The department may prescribe a different period suited to the circumstances or may exempt agencies that have demonstrated to the department’s satisfaction that the appropriate fiscal controls are in place. [Amended by 1993 c.724 §4]

 

      291.236 Application of allotment system; controlling expenditures and encumbering of emergency, contingent, revolving and trust funds. (1) The provisions of ORS 291.234 to 291.260 relating to the allotment system shall apply to all appropriations for state officers and agencies. For this purpose “appropriation” includes standing, continuing and annual appropriations, and dedicated funds. In those cases where periodical allotments are impracticable, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services may dispense therewith and prescribe such regulations as will insure proper application and encumbering of funds.

      (2) Subject to ORS 291.238, emergency or contingent funds, revolving funds and trust funds shall be subject to such regulations as the department may prescribe for controlling the expenditures and encumbering of such funds.

 

      291.238 Expenditures without allotment prohibited; expenditures from dedicated, revolving and trust funds. (1) Except as expressly authorized in this section or ORS 291.236, no person shall incur, or order or vote to incur, any obligation against the state in excess of, or make or order or vote to make any expenditure not authorized by, an allotment.

The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall base its estimate on the last forecast given to the Legislative Assembly before adjournment sine die of the odd-numbered year regular session on which the printed, adopted budget prepared in the Oregon Department of Administrative Services is based, adjusted only insofar as necessary to reflect changes in laws adopted at that session. The report shall contain the estimated revenues from corporate income and excise taxes separately from the estimated revenues from other General Fund sources. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services may revise the estimate if necessary following adjournment sine die of a special session or an even-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly, but any revision does not affect the basis of the computation described in subsection (3) or (4) of this section.

      (2) As soon as practicable after the end of the biennium, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall report to the Legislative Revenue Officer and the Legislative Fiscal Officer, or the Legislative Assembly if it is in session, the amount of General Fund revenues collected as of the last June 30 of the preceding biennium. The report shall contain the collections from corporate income and excise taxes separately from collections from other sources.

      (3) If the revenues received from the corporate income and excise taxes during the biennium exceed the amounts estimated to be received from such taxes for the biennium, as estimated after adjournment sine die of the odd-numbered year regular session, by two percent or more, the total amount of that excess shall be retained in the General Fund and used, in the manner described in ORS 291.345, to provide additional funding for public education, kindergarten through grade 12.

      (4) If the revenues received from General Fund revenue sources, exclusive of those described in subsection (3) of this section, during the biennium exceed the amounts estimated to be received from such sources for the biennium, as estimated after adjournment sine die of the odd-numbered year regular session, by two percent or more, there shall be credited to personal income taxpayers an amount equal to the total amount of that excess, reduced by the cost certified by the Department of Revenue under ORS 291.351 as being allocable to credits described under this subsection. The excess amount to be credited shall be credited to personal income taxpayers in a percentage amount of prior year personal income tax liability as determined under subsection (5) of this section.

      (5)(a) If there is an excess to be credited under subsection (4) of this section, on or before October 1, following the end of each biennium, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall determine and certify to the Department of Revenue the percentage amounts of credit for purposes of subsection (4) of this section. The percentage amounts determined shall be percentage amounts to the nearest one-tenth of a percent that will distribute the excess to be credited to personal income taxpayers.

      (b) The percentage amount applicable to subsection (4) of this section shall equal the amount distributed under subsection (4) of this section divided by the estimated total personal income tax liability for all personal income taxpayers for tax years beginning in the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the excess is determined.

      (c) The amount of the surplus credit under subsection (4) of this section is determined by multiplying the percentage amount determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection by the total amount of a personal income taxpayer’s tax liability for the tax year beginning in the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the excess is determined in order to calculate the amount to be credited to the taxpayer.

      (d) The credit shall be determined based on the tax liability as shown on the return of the taxpayer or as corrected by the Department of Revenue.

      (e) The credit shall be computed after the allowance of a credit provided under ORS 316.082, 316.131 or 316.292, but before the allowance of any other credit or offset against tax liability allowed or allowable under any provision of law of this state, and before the application of estimated tax payments, withholding or other advance tax payments.

      (f) For personal income taxpayers, if a credit applied against tax liability as described in paragraph (e) of this subsection reduces tax liability to zero and an amount of the credit remains unused, the remaining unused amount shall be refunded to the taxpayer. For purposes of ORS chapters 305, 314, 315 and 316, refunds issued under this paragraph are refunds of an overpayment of tax imposed under ORS chapter 316.

      (g) The Department of Revenue may prescribe by rule the manner of calculating and claiming a credit if the filing status of a taxpayer changes between the tax year for which a credit may be claimed and the succeeding tax year.

      (6) A refund may not be made under this section to a taxpayer if the amount of the refund is less than $1.

      (7) Not later than October 15 following the end of the biennium, the Department of Revenue shall provide information and guidance to taxpayers relating to the calculation of the credit. The department may make the information and guidance available electronically or otherwise.

      (8) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules specifying the manner for issuing refunds under this section to taxpayers who filed returns for the tax year on which the credit is computed but who are not required to file returns for the year in which the credit could be claimed.

(1) Before July 1 of each fiscal year, the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall request from the appropriate state agency or division a certificate as prescribed in this section. The request shall be made by letter to the agency or division.

      (2) Each state agency authorized to issue general obligation bonds that are ordinarily to be repaid from other than General Fund appropriations shall, on or before August 15 of each fiscal year:

      (a) Certify to the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that the amounts available or that will become available during the current year to the bond program debt service fund to pay bond principal and interest that has accrued or will accrue during the current year are sufficient and will be sufficient to pay bond program principal and interest scheduled for payment during the current year; or

      (b) Certify to the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that the amounts available or that will become available during the current year to the bond program debt service fund will not be sufficient to pay bond program principal and interest scheduled for payment during the current year. A certificate issued under this paragraph shall specify the amount of the anticipated current year deficit. The Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall review and confirm the correctness of each certification made under this paragraph.

      (3) On or before August 15 of each fiscal year, the administrative division of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that has primary responsibility for accounting for each general obligation bond program in which the bond principal and interest is ordinarily to be repaid, in whole or in part, from General Fund appropriations shall:

      (a) Certify to the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that the amounts available or that will become available during the current year from General Fund appropriations to defray program bond principal and interest that has accrued or will accrue during the current year are sufficient and will be sufficient to pay program bond principal and interest scheduled for payment during the current year; or

      (b) Certify to the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that the amounts available or that will become available during the current year from General Fund appropriations will not be sufficient to pay program bond principal and interest scheduled for payment during the current year. A certificate issued under this paragraph shall specify the amount of the anticipated current year deficit.

      (4)(a) For a general obligation bond program for which a property tax may be levied under the Oregon Constitution, if a deficit in funds available to pay principal and interest is certified and confirmed under subsection (2) or certified under subsection (3) of this section, the amount of the deficit, together with any deficit that is certified for any other general obligation bond program shall upon certification constitute a state tax levy on property that shall be apportioned among and charged to the several counties in that proportion which the total assessed value of all the taxable property in each county bears to the total assessed value of all the taxable property of the state as equalized.

      (b) If any agency fails to make the certification under subsection (2) or (3) of this section with respect to any general obligation bond fund program, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall determine the amount of revenue and other funds that are available and the amount of taxes, if any, that should be levied in addition to the revenues and funds, to pay bond principal and interest under the program for the fiscal year in question. The additional amount so determined shall thereupon constitute a state tax levy on property that shall be apportioned, certified, collected and distributed as if determined and certified as a deficit by the agency. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall charge the agency for cost recovery for time spent on that agency’s behalf.

      (5) Immediately after the department has determined the amount of a state tax levy on property in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, a certificate of levy, signed by the director of the department, shall be filed in the office of the department. If no state levy is required for the fiscal or tax year, a certificate so stating and signed by the director shall be filed in the office of the department.

      (6) If, for any reason, after the close of any regular session of the Legislative Assembly, it becomes necessary to reduce General Fund appropriations, General Fund appropriations for a debt service fund of a general obligation bond program described under subsection (3) of this section may not be reduced.

      (7)(a) For purposes of this section, state agencies that are authorized to finance projects or programs through the issuance of general obligation bonds ordinarily to be repaid from other than General Fund appropriations are those agencies that have outstanding general obligation bonds, the debt service on which is not the subject of a General Fund appropriation in the current biennium.

      (b) Each agency authorized to finance projects or programs through the issuance of general obligation bonds that are ordinarily to be repaid from other than General Fund appropriations shall determine the amount of revenues or other funds that are available and the amount of taxes, if any, that should be levied for the ensuing year in the manner required under rules adopted by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and make the certification required under subsection (2) of this section.

      (8)(a) For purposes of this section, state agencies that are authorized to finance projects or programs through the issuance of general obligation bonds that are ordinarily to be repaid from General Fund appropriations are those agencies that have outstanding general obligation bonds, the debt service on which is the subject of a General Fund appropriation in the current biennium.

      (b) Each agency authorized to finance projects or programs through the issuance of general obligation bonds ordinarily to be repaid from General Fund appropriations shall furnish any data required by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services to determine the amount of revenues or other funds that are available and the amount of taxes, if any, that should be levied for the ensuing year and the administrative division of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services that has primary responsibility for accounting shall make the determination for purposes of the making of the certification required under subsection (3) of this section.
