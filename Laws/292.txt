The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall determine corresponding equivalent salary ranges for the compensation plans applicable to the legislative and judicial branches of government.

      (3) The distribution of funds to each employee bargaining unit and unrepresented employees by this section shall be determined by collective bargaining agreement or by compensation plan in accordance with the priority described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) Pay equity wage adjustments authorized by ORS 240.190 and 292.951 to 292.971 shall be in addition to any general salary adjustments authorized by the Legislative Assembly.

      (5) No employee shall have wages decreased as a result of implementation of this section.
