      (c) “Legislatively approved budget” has the meaning given that term in ORS 291.002.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 293.148, as soon as possible after the ending balance for a biennium is determined, an amount equal to one percent of the amount of General Fund appropriations for that biennium shall be transferred to the Oregon Rainy Day Fund established by ORS 293.144. If the ending balance does not equal or exceed one percent of the amount of General Fund appropriations, an amount equal to the ending balance shall be transferred to the Oregon Rainy Day Fund. [2007 c.5 §4]

(Deficiencies)

 

      293.165 Borrowing to pay warrants against General Fund. (1) If the moneys in the General Fund become exhausted, the State Treasurer shall borrow from the most advantageous sources the amounts necessary to pay warrants drawn against the General Fund in pursuance of law, other than warrants drawn against funds whose use is restricted to particular purposes by the Constitution of Oregon or by federal law. The Governor, Secretary of State and State Treasurer, jointly, shall issue certificates of indebtedness therefor. The certificates shall draw interest not to exceed the legal rate of interest until redeemed. All certificates of indebtedness shall be redeemable by the State Treasurer from the first moneys regularly accruing and credited to the General Fund.

      (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the moneys in the General Fund shall be deemed to be exhausted when there are no moneys remaining in the General Fund other than funds whose use is restricted to particular purposes by the Constitution of Oregon or by federal law. [Formerly 291.378; 1967 c.454 §102; 2003 c.81 §6]

      (b) “Restricted fund” means a fund in the General Fund whose use is restricted to particular purposes by the Constitution of Oregon or by federal law.

      (2) Instead of paying warrants drawn on the General Fund, the State Treasurer shall indorse on the warrants the words “Not paid for want of funds” and shall register the warrants for future payment if:

      (a) The General Fund becomes exhausted after the State Treasurer has borrowed moneys as provided in ORS 293.165 and has made the transfers of surplus funds as provided in ORS 293.205 to 293.225; and

      (b) The Governor, the Secretary of State and the State Treasurer deem it necessary or advisable to refuse to pay the warrants and to register the warrants, and direct the State Treasurer to do so.

      (3) The State Treasurer shall register the warrants indorsed as provided in subsection (2) of this section by number and by date according to the date on which the warrants were presented for payment. All warrants so indorsed and registered shall thereafter become payable in full according to the date of registration, beginning with the earliest date. Warrants described in this subsection are payable only from moneys in the General Fund that are not in restricted funds.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, a warrant that is drawn against a restricted fund may be paid, even if the General Fund is exhausted, if there are sufficient moneys in the restricted fund to pay the warrant. The State Treasurer need not indorse or register a warrant paid under this subsection in the manner described in subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

      (5) Warrants that are registered under subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall draw interest payable from the General Fund, until called for payment by the State Treasurer, at the rate of five percent per year. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall determine the amount of interest payable on each warrant under this subsection and when and how the interest will be paid.

      (6) As funds for the payment of all the warrants registered on a particular date and of the interest thereon become available in the General Fund, the State Treasurer shall give notice of the calling of the warrants for payment by one publication in a newspaper printed and published in Salem, Oregon.

      (b) Warrants drawn on the General Fund are being registered under ORS 293.167;

      (3) A state agency that receives a notice from the State Treasurer under subsection (1) of this section must cease issuing checks or warrants drawn on, or initiating electronic funds transfers from, the specified fund or account. If authorized to do so by the State Treasurer, a state agency that ceases issuance of checks or warrants or initiation of electronic funds transfers under this section may pay obligations by warrants that may be registered under ORS 293.167 if the checks or warrants are drawn on, or the electronic funds transfers are from, moneys in the General Fund.

      (4) As used in this section, “state agency” means any board, commission, department, institution, branch or agency the costs of which are paid in whole or in part from funds held in the State Treasury. [2003 c.81 §9]

(1) If a check, warrant or demand for payment by electronic funds transfer is presented to the State Treasurer for payment and at the time of presentment the account or fund from which payment should be drawn has insufficient moneys to pay in full the amount presented, the State Treasurer may transfer the overdraft amount from other moneys deposited in the State Treasury by the state agency from whose account or fund the payment is required. The State Treasurer may charge interest at a rate determined by the State Treasurer on any negative account or fund balance that results from the overdraft. The interest shall be paid to the account or fund from which moneys were transferred to pay the overdraft. The State Treasurer may also charge fees for the transfer, in amounts determined by the State Treasurer.

      (2) The authority given the State Treasurer in this section is in addition to, and not in lieu of, authority given the treasurer in ORS 293.205 to 293.225.

If there is insufficient money to the credit of any fund in the State Treasury to pay the obligations against such fund and there is money to the credit of one or more other state funds that is not then required to meet the respective obligations against such funds, the State Treasurer shall transfer so much as the State Treasurer deems advisable of such money standing to the credit of the funds having excess money to the fund having insufficient money if there are or will be moneys accruing to the borrowing fund or that can be transferred to it in like manner, as provided in this section, to enable a retransfer to be made of such moneys to the credit of the lending funds from which they were so transferred in time to meet the requirements of the lending funds. However, unless conditions are such at the time when the original transfer of moneys is considered as to make sure that such retransfer can be so made, the original transfer shall not be made. All moneys transferred under this section from lending to borrowing funds shall be retransferred to the lending funds when or before they are needed in the lending funds.

The treasurer shall transfer the money if:

      (a) The lending fund has money that is not required at the time of the transfer to meet the obligations against the fund; and

      (b) The treasurer determines that there are or will be enough moneys accruing to the borrowing fund, or that can be transferred to it, to enable a retransfer of the money to the lending fund in time to meet the requirements of the lending fund.

      (2) All moneys transferred under this section to a borrowing fund shall be retransferred to the lending funds when or before they are needed.

      (3) The department may request transfers of money under this section regardless of whether or not the insufficiency in a fund that triggers the request was anticipated by the department. [1991 c.793 §2; 2005 c.22 §218]

      (4) A line of credit may operate as a revolving fund, so that draws shall proportionately reduce and repayments shall proportionately increase the credit remaining under the line of credit, but at no time shall the total amount of draws against the line of credit exceed the credit limit.

      (5) Every state agency for which a line of credit is established shall report promptly in writing to the State Treasurer any change in information furnished in support of the request for a line of credit.

      (6) The State Treasurer may grant or deny, modify or terminate a line of credit when in the judgment of the State Treasurer it is in the best interest of the state. [1993 c.68 §2; 2003 c.16 §3]

The department may prescribe criteria for the kinds of accounts that may be assigned under this section, including a minimum dollar amount owed.

      (3)(a) Subject to rules prescribed by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services for collection of delinquent accounts owing to state agencies or to counties, the Department of Revenue shall render assistance in the collection and shall charge the state agencies or counties separately for the cost of assistance. The charges may not exceed the proceeds of collection credited to the state agency or county for the same biennium. The Department of Revenue may designate a single percentage to retain from the proceeds of collection as a charge for the cost of assistance. If the Department of Revenue finds that accounts assigned to the department for collection by certain state agencies or counties lack sufficient information to properly and efficiently identify the debtor or that the account information must be put into a form usable by the department in order to efficiently provide collection services, the department may establish a separate percentage charge to be retained from collections for the state agency or county. The charge must reflect the average of the actual cost to provide collection services for all accounts assigned by that state agency or county.

      (b) In providing assistance, the Department of Revenue shall make all reasonable efforts to collect the delinquent accounts including the setoff of any refunds or sums due to the debtor from the department or any other state agency. The department may offset any refunds or sums due to the debtor from the department or any other state agency against delinquent accounts assigned by a county to the department for collection under this section.

      (c) No setoff may be made by the Department of Revenue unless the debt is in a liquidated amount.

      (d) At the time any setoff is made, the Department of Revenue shall notify the debtor of the sums due to the debtor from a state agency that are applied against the debtor’s delinquent account. The notice must provide that the debtor may, within 30 days and in a manner prescribed by the department, contest the setoff and request a hearing before the department. No issues may be considered at the hearing that were previously litigated or that the debtor failed to raise timely after being given due notice of rights of appeal.

      (e) All moneys received by the Department of Revenue in payment of charges made under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be paid into the State Treasury and deposited in a miscellaneous receipts account for the department.

      (f) Net proceeds of collections of delinquent accounts shall be credited to the account or fund of the state agency or county to which the debt was originally owing.

      (3)(a) Subject to rules prescribed by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services for collection of delinquent accounts owing to state agencies or to counties, the Department of Revenue shall render assistance in the collection and shall charge the state agencies or counties separately for the cost of assistance. The charges may not exceed the proceeds of collection credited to the state agency or county for the same biennium. The Department of Revenue may designate a single percentage to retain from the proceeds of collection as a charge for the cost of assistance. If the Department of Revenue finds that accounts assigned to the department for collection by certain state agencies or counties lack sufficient information to properly and efficiently identify the debtor or that the account information must be put into a form usable by the department in order to efficiently provide collection services, the department may establish a separate percentage charge to be retained from collections for the state agency or county. The charge must reflect the average of the actual cost to provide collection services for all accounts assigned by that state agency or county.

      (b) In providing assistance, the Department of Revenue shall make all reasonable efforts to collect the delinquent accounts including the setoff of any refunds or sums due to the debtor from the department or any other state agency.

      (c) No setoff may be made by the Department of Revenue unless the debt is in a liquidated amount.

      (d) When the Department of Revenue has notified the assigning state agency or county that a refund or other sum due to the debtor is available for setoff, the debtor may arrange with the department or county for payment of the debt in full before the setoff is made. However, the assigning state agency or county may not enter into any agreement with the debtor for payment of the debt before the setoff is made.

      (e) At the time any setoff is made, the debtor shall be notified by the Department of Revenue of its intention to apply sums due from a state agency against the debtor’s delinquent account. The notice shall provide that the debtor within 30 days may request a hearing before the claimant state agency or county. No issues at the hearing may be considered that have been litigated previously, or if the debtor after being given due notice of rights of appeal has failed to exercise them timely.

      (f) All moneys received by the Department of Revenue in payment of charges made under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be paid into the State Treasury and deposited in a miscellaneous receipts account for the department.

      (g) Net proceeds of collections of delinquent accounts shall be credited to the account or fund of the state agency or county to which the debt was originally owing.

      (4)(a) In providing assistance in the collection of any delinquent account under this section, the Department of Revenue may issue a warrant for the collection of the delinquent account. The warrant may be recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record maintained under ORS 205.130.

      (b) A warrant may not be issued under this subsection unless the debt is in a liquidated amount.

      (c) The amount of any warrant issued under this subsection shall include the principal amount of the debt, any added penalties or interest attributable to the delinquent account and any costs associated with recording, indexing or service of the warrant and any satisfaction or release thereof.

      (d) A warrant may not be issued under this subsection before the debtor has been notified that the department intends to issue the warrant and of the collection action that may be taken under the warrant.

      (5) Nothing in this section prohibits the collection of:

      (a) A child or spousal support obligation as provided in ORS 25.610; or

      (b) Criminal judgments that impose monetary obligations, including judgments requiring the payment of fines, costs, assessments, compensatory fines, attorney fees, forfeitures or restitution.

      (6) As used in this section, “state agency” means any state officer, board, commission, corporation, institution, department or other state organization.

      293.723 Discrete investment of moneys. (1) Moneys in a fund established by law may not be discretely invested unless the law establishing the fund specifically indicates that the moneys may be invested.

      (2) As used in this section, “discretely invested” means invested in something other than the Oregon Short Term Fund established under ORS 293.728. [2007 c.217 §2; 2009 c.541 §13; 2009 c.821 §20]

      (2) The standard stated in subsection (1) of this section requires the exercise of reasonable care, skill and caution, and is to be applied to investments not in isolation but in the context of each investment fund’s investment portfolio and as a part of an overall investment strategy, which should incorporate risk and return objectives reasonably suitable to the particular investment fund.

      (3) In making and implementing investment decisions, the Oregon Investment Council and the investment officer have a duty to diversify the investments of the investment funds unless, under the circumstances, it is not prudent to do so.

      (a) Conform to the fundamental fiduciary duties of loyalty and impartiality;

      (b) Act with prudence in deciding whether and how to delegate authority and in the selection and supervision of agents; and

      (c) Incur only costs that are reasonable in amount and appropriate to the investment responsibilities imposed by law.

      (5) The duties of the council and the investment officer under this section are subject to contrary provisions of privately created public trusts the assets of which by law are made investment funds. Within the limitations of the standard stated in subsection (1) of this section and subject to subsection (6) of this section, there may be acquired, retained, managed and disposed of as investments of the investment funds every kind of investment which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence acquire, retain, manage and dispose of for their own account.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, not more than 50 percent of the moneys contributed to the Public Employees Retirement Fund or the Industrial Accident Fund may be invested in common stock, and not more than 65 percent of the moneys contributed to the other trust and endowment funds managed by the Oregon Investment Council or the State Treasurer may be invested in common stock.

      293.728 Oregon Short Term Fund. (1) The Oregon Short Term Fund is established in the State Treasury as a commingled investment vehicle for investment funds and the moneys described in subsection (2) of this section. Interest earned by the Oregon Short Term Fund shall be credited to the participating investor funds or accounts in the fund in proportion to the amount invested.

      (2) Unless a federal law, court order, settlement or similar agreement or business practice requires otherwise, moneys received by the State Treasurer that may not be discretely invested as provided in ORS 293.723 shall be deposited in the fund. Moneys that may be discretely invested as provided in ORS 293.723 may be deposited in the fund.

      (3) Moneys in the fund may be transferred as provided in ORS 293.205 to 293.225.

The interest rate may not be less than the rate specified in ORS 293.220. [2009 c.821 §19]

The council, from time to time, shall review those policies and make changes therein as it considers necessary or desirable. The council may formulate separate policies for any fund included in the investment funds. This section does not apply to the Oregon Growth Account, the Oregon Growth Fund, the Oregon Growth Board, the Oregon Commercialized Research Fund, the Oregon Innovation Fund or the Oregon Innovation Council.

      293.733 Venture capital investments; council’s duty.

The council may require a person contracted with to give to the state a fidelity bond in a penal sum as may be fixed by law or, if not so fixed, as may be fixed by the council, with corporate surety authorized to do business in this state.

INVESTMENT POOLS

 

      293.861 Investment pools authorized. The Legislative Assembly recognizes that changes in federal arbitrage regulations have imposed substantial additional financial and administrative burdens on state agencies and local governments which issue tax-exempt obligations. The impact of these burdens is exacerbated by the fiscal restrictions placed on these agencies and governments by section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. The Legislative Assembly finds that it will benefit the citizens of the state to authorize the State Treasurer to create one or more investment pools which are designed to reduce these burdens of compliance with federal arbitrage rules. [Formerly 293.822]

 

      293.863 Investment pool procedures; duties of State Treasurer. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Council” means the Oregon Investment Council.

      (b) “Investor” means an entity which deposits proceeds with the State Treasurer for investment in a pool.

      (c) “Pool” means a fund or account established by the State Treasurer for the investment of proceeds for one or more investors, pursuant to this section.

      (d) “Public body” has the meaning given that term in ORS 287A.001.

      (e) “Proceeds” means funds obtained from the sale of tax-exempt obligations, and other funds which secure, or are held to pay debt service on, tax-exempt obligations.

      (f) “Tax-exempt obligations” means bonds, notes, certificates or other obligations, the interest on which is excluded from gross income under the United States Internal Revenue Code.

      (2) In addition to the other powers granted to the State Treasurer, the State Treasurer may create one or more pools for the investment of proceeds. The pools shall be separate and distinct from the General Fund. Amounts in a pool shall be invested under the standards for investment of state funds which are provided in ORS 293.701 to 293.857. However, the investment objective for the pools shall be to make the amounts therein as productive to the investor as is administratively reasonable, taking into account restrictions imposed by the United States on the investment of the proceeds and the ability of the investor to retain investment earnings for its benefit. Amounts in a pool shall be invested according to policies established by the Oregon Investment Council. ORS 293.857 shall not apply to investments of amounts in a pool. The State Treasurer or the council may enter into agreements with investors regarding the investment of proceeds in a pool authorized by this section and may take other action reasonably required to establish and operate pools for the investment of proceeds in a manner which reduces the burden on investors of complying with federal arbitrage laws.

      (3) The State Treasurer or the council may contract for trust, investment management, legal, accounting, financial advisory and other services with respect to the funds invested in a pool. Costs of the services may be paid from earnings on proceeds invested in a pool, from fees charged to investors or from any other legally available funds. The State Treasurer may charge investors fees for deposit or withdrawal of amounts from a pool. The fees shall not exceed the State Treasurer’s reasonable estimate of the costs of creating and operating the pool.

      (4) The State Treasurer shall establish policies and procedures for the allocation of pool expenses, earnings and losses among investors in a pool, and for the deposit and withdrawal of amounts in a pool. Net earnings on amounts in pools shall be distributed among investors in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the State Treasurer.

      (5) The State of Oregon, its agencies, public bodies and trustees which hold proceeds may invest proceeds through the State Treasurer in a pool. [Formerly 293.824]
