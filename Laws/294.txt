      294.015 Payment on lost, stolen or destroyed warrants upon affidavit of owner, payee or representative. A warrant may be paid without surrender or delivery thereof if the one claiming to be the lawful owner of the warrant:

      (1) Satisfies the officer by whom payment is to be made that the warrant has been lost, stolen or destroyed prior to the owner having received value therefor or having negotiated the warrant; and

      (2) Furnishes to the issuing officer a written statement signed by such person specifically alleging that the owner is the lawful owner, payee or legal representative of the lawful owner or payee of the original instrument giving the date of issue, the number, amount, for what services or claim the original instrument was issued and that the original instrument has been lost, destroyed or stolen, and has not been paid. However, if the lawful owner, payee or legal representative is (a) a bank or national bank, (b) the federal government or (c) this state or any board, department, commission or subdivision of this state, or any officer thereof in the officer’s official capacity, a certificate may be furnished in lieu of an affidavit or affirmation.

[Amended by 2005 c.22 §222]

      (2) Such governing body may authorize the use of check-warrant forms, to be drawn by its appropriate warrant issuing officer or officers upon the custodian of its funds, so prepared that such custodian may, by subscribing a direction to the depository of such funds to pay the same to the order of the payee, convert the instrument to a check or, by subscribing an indorsement that such warrant is not paid for want of funds, convert the same to an interest-bearing warrant and such governing body may direct that such check-warrants shall not be delivered to the payees therein named until such direction or indorsement shall have been subscribed by the custodian of its funds.

      (3) Such governing body may provide that when funds are available for the payment of approved claims, the approval of claims for payment shall, without the issuance of any warrant, be authority to the custodian of its funds to pay such claims by check. [1953 c.664 §1]

 

      294.028 Payment of warrants by depository. When authorized by the governing body, any custodian of funds of any municipal or quasi-municipal corporation or civil subdivision of this state other than a school district may direct the depository of such funds to pay any warrant drawn upon such custodian upon presentment of such warrant to such depository, to the same extent and with the same effect as though such warrant were a check drawn upon such depository by such custodian. Such direction shall be in writing and shall identify by name and signature the warrant issuing officer or officers and such depository may rely upon such direction and identification in the payment of such warrants. [1953 c.664 §2]

 

      294.029 Provisions of ORS 294.027 and 294.028 not mandatory.

[1953 c.664 §3]

 

      294.030 Deductions for bonds from compensation of municipal and other employees; purchasing bonds in advance.

      (2) The governing body shall take proper precautions for the depositing, securing and disbursing of the sums so deducted and for the delivering of all bonds or other obligations purchased.

      (3) Balances to the credit of the accounts in which the sums so deducted are deposited may be used for the purchase in advance, from the federal government or from any federal reserve bank or other authorized federal agency, of war savings bonds or other obligations of the federal government, either in blank or in inscribed form, in convenient denominations to meet the requirements of the purchasers thereof.

 

      294.033 Investment of deferred compensation funds. Funds set aside by any local government pursuant to a deferred compensation plan may be invested in any investment enumerated in ORS 294.035 and are not subject to the collateral requirements of ORS chapter 295.

      (2) The estimate shall be used to determine the estimated percent of the moneys available in the County Assessment Function Funding Assistance Account that each county will receive as grants and the total estimated grant that each county will receive for the ensuing fiscal year. The estimates so determined shall serve as the estimates required to be included in any certification issued under ORS 294.175 for that county.

      (3) On or before the 28th day of the month following the close of each fiscal quarter, the department shall pay a percentage of the moneys in the County Assessment Function Funding Assistance Account to each county to which a certificate has been issued under ORS 294.175.

      (4) Except as provided under subsections (5) and (6) of this section, the percentage to be paid to each county under subsection (3) of this section shall be the percentage that the expenditures of the county certified by the department to the county governing body under ORS 294.175 bears to the total of all expenditures of all counties certified by the department to counties under ORS 294.175.

If grant funds are denied to any county under this subsection for any fiscal quarter, the percentage determined under subsection (4) of this section shall be redetermined, excluding from the computation for that fiscal quarter the certified expenditures of the county for which grant funds are denied to the end that all of the funds available in the County Assessment Function Funding Assistance Account at the time of calculating the quarterly distribution may be distributed.

      (b) Percentages of grants may not be redetermined under paragraph (a) of this subsection in instances in which a distribution is made under subsection (6)(b) of this section.

      (a)(A) Fifty percent of the amount allocated shall be based on the taxes imposed for the preceding fiscal year for taxes certified to the county assessor under ORS 310.060 (2)(a) from the permanent rate limitations of the municipal corporations after reductions necessary to comply with section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, and funds raised pursuant to the notice provided to the county assessor under ORS 457.440 (2) for an urban renewal agency located in a municipal corporation subject to this subsection.

      (D) Municipal corporations that do not levy ad valorem taxes are exempt from proration under this paragraph.

      (b)(A) Fifty percent of the amount allocated shall be based on the expenditures, as defined in ORS 294.311, for the current fiscal year for each municipal corporation required to reimburse the county under this subsection.

      (B) The amount allocated under this paragraph shall be prorated based on each municipal corporation’s share of the total expenditures for those municipal corporations that are under the jurisdiction of the tax supervising and conservation commission.

      (C) A minimum amount of $250 shall be allocated to any municipal corporation under this paragraph.

      (D) Municipal corporations with budgeted expenditures of $50,000 or less and urban renewal agencies formed under ORS chapter 457 are exempt from proration under this paragraph.

      (E) If a municipal corporation has adopted a biennial budget, the calculation of the proration under this paragraph shall use fiscal year expenditures.

      (3) Not later than August 30 of each fiscal year, the tax supervising and conservation commission shall distribute to each municipal corporation an accounting of the calculations under this section showing:

      (a) The net costs under subsection (1) of this section;

      (b) The 50 percent of net costs allocable to municipal corporations, except the county, under subsection (2) of this section; and

      (c) The amounts prorated to each municipal corporation under subsection (2) of this section.

(1) A political subdivision shall pay into the Local Government Employer Benefit Trust Fund an amount equal to the percentage rate of the political subdivision, as determined under subsections (2) to (5) of this section, multiplied by the gross wages the political subdivision pays to individuals in employment subject to ORS chapter 657, except that minor adjustments to wages in a calendar quarter on which payments have previously been made may not result in either a credit to the political subdivision or an additional amount due the fund.

      (2)(a) As soon as possible after June 30 of each year, the Employment Department shall determine for each political subdivision the benefit cost rate, the account reserve ratio and the percentage rate, applicable as of that June 30.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, upon the written request of a political subdivision, the Director of the Employment Department or an authorized representative of the director may redetermine at any time the benefit cost rate, the account reserve ratio and the percentage rate of the political subdivision.

      (3)(a) The percentage rate assigned to a political subdivision whose account has been potentially chargeable with benefits for each of the last four calendar quarters ending on the June 30 immediately preceding the determination shall be the benefit cost rate of the political subdivision plus one-third of the difference obtained by subtracting the political subdivision’s account reserve ratio from 1.5 times the political subdivision’s benefit cost rate. The resulting percentage rate shall be rounded up to the nearest one-tenth of one percent. A political subdivision’s percentage rate shall be at least one-tenth of one percent but no more than five percent.

      (b) The percentage rate assigned to a political subdivision whose account has not been potentially chargeable with benefits for each of the last four calendar quarters ending on the immediately preceding June 30 shall be the greater of one percent or 1.5 times the aggregate benefit cost rate.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, a local government employer with an account balance on June 30 that is less than five percent of the taxable wage base currently in effect may not be assigned a percentage rate of:

      (a) Less than two percent if the payroll of the employer was less than $25,000 during the four most recently completed calendar quarters;

      (b) Less than one percent if the payroll of the employer was $25,000 or more but less than $50,000 during the four most recently completed calendar quarters;

      (5) Percentage rates determined or redetermined in subsections (3) and (4) of this section apply until July 1 next following the determination or redetermination.

      (6)(a) In addition to the payment made into the fund under subsection (1) of this section, a political subdivision that has a negative account balance at the end of a calendar quarter and had a negative account balance at the end of each of the three immediately preceding calendar quarters shall make additional payments into the fund during each of the next four calendar quarters.

      (b) The additional payment required under this subsection shall be computed as follows, with all computations omitting cents:

      (A) Multiply the gross payroll reported by the employer during the four most recent calendar quarters by the current percentage rate of payment into the fund.

      (B) Subtract the amount of benefits attributable to the employer that was reimbursed from the fund during the most recent four calendar quarters from the product computed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

      (C) If the remainder computed under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is more than zero, subtract the remainder from the negative balance of the account.

      (D) If the remainder computed under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is zero or less, make no adjustment to the amount of the negative balance of the account.

      (E) Divide the amounts computed under either subparagraph (C) or (D) of this paragraph by four. The resulting quotient is the additional payment required for each quarter.

      (c) One computation under this subsection may be made for an employer in each calendar quarter. If the negative balance is eliminated before the end of the four quarters in which the additional payments were determined necessary, further additional payments may not be required under this subsection.

      (7) During the first four calendar quarters in which a political subdivision is a participant in the fund, additional payments shall be required if the account balance of the political subdivision is negative at the end of any of the four calendar quarters. The additional payment shall be computed in the same manner described in subsection (6) of this section except that the computation in subsection (6)(b)(A) and (B) of this section shall include only those calendar quarters in which the political subdivision was a participant in the fund.

      (8) Employers subject to this section may request a refund of amounts in excess of the amount determined using the minimum percentage rate.

      (9)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (6) of this section, a political subdivision that has an account reserve ratio equal to or less than zero and a percentage rate assigned under subsection (3) of this section equal to or greater than three percent may request in writing that the Director of the Employment Department grant an extended plan of additional payments.

      (b) An extended plan of additional payments granted under this subsection may not exceed a period of 12 consecutive calendar quarters. [1977 c.491 §5; 1981 c.5 §1; 1983 c.53 §2; 1989 c.135 §3; 1993 c.778 §3; 2007 c.71 §92; 2011 c.569 §2]

      (3) Erroneous benefit payments determined after June 30, 1978, and attributable to wages paid by a political subdivision making payments under ORS 294.735 shall be excluded from the account balance determination and the determination of the benefit cost rate of that political subdivision.

For purposes of this section, instruments of title of investments of the investment pool may include such evidence of title as the investment officer shall consider secure and consistent with modern investment, banking and commercial practices, and may include book entry and automated recordation of such title.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 294.850 and 294.855 (3) and subsections (1) and (3) of this section, the investment officer shall collect the principal and interest or other income of investments of the investment pool, title of which is in the investment officer’s custody, when due and payable, and shall pay to the appropriate local government official or tribal government official the principal and interest or other income, within 30 days after the last day of the calendar quarter in which the principal and interest or other income accrues. Not less often than quarterly and without regard to whether the short-term investments were made with moneys placed by local government officials, by tribal government officials or by other sources, the investment officer shall compute the amount by which the current fair market value exceeds or is less than the net purchase price of all short-term investments administered by the investment officer that mature more than 270 days from the date computation is made. The investment officer shall compute the fair market value of such investments based upon the mean value of the bid and ask price of such investments as of the date of computation, based upon quotations from reputable dealers or financial institutions dealing in such investments. If the amount so computed by the investment officer totals more than one percent of the balance of the pool, either in terms of a gain or loss, the investment officer shall allocate the amount to all pool participants. Any addition to or deduction from amounts to be distributed shall be allocated among the municipalities and tribal governments participating in the pool at any time during the month in proportion to their average daily balances of funds invested through the pool. Investments maturing 270 days or less from the date of computation shall not be subject to the foregoing computation, but for other purposes shall be valued at book value or original purchase price.

      (a) Institute the proper proceedings to collect the matured principal or interest or other income.

The investment officer shall also furnish a financial report monthly to each participating governmental unit investor in the investment pool. The financial report shall include, but not be limited to, such comparative data for the preceding six months operation of the investment pool as will provide a basis for analyzing trends and comparing operating results and financial position. A monthly statement shall be distributed within 30 days after the end of that month. [1973 c.748 §§14,15; 1979 c.608 §5; 1989 c.569 §4; 2007 c.783 §122b; 2013 c.338 §7]

The reports shall include a description of every investment in the portfolio of assets in the investment pool showing issuer, coupon, purchase date, maturity date, yield to maturity, book value, market value as of the end of the month for which the report is rendered and the method used to value pool investments; a computation of the average life of the portfolio of assets in the investment pool weighted according to the market value of each investment that matures more than 270 days from the report date as of the end of the month for which the report is rendered; and a computation of the annualized rate of return of the investment pool portfolio, net of expense.

An examination and audit of the investment pool shall be made separately from the audit of the treasurer for submission to the Oregon Investment Council, public bodies that are investors in the pool, the Legislative Assembly and the Oregon Short Term Fund Board at least once a year and at other times as the council may require. An audit report shall be submitted to the individuals and public bodies specified within 60 days after the end of the fiscal year or as soon as practical. The report shall include a statement prepared by the State Treasurer of the investment rules governing investments authorized by the council.

      294.882 Merger or subsequent separation of investment pool and Oregon Short Term Fund; preconditions. (1) It is recognized that a time may come when the interest of local governments and tribal governments diminishes to the extent that participation in the investment pool no longer warrants its operation as a separate fund. If the investment pool decreases to a level below $125 million, the State Treasurer may transfer the assets of the pool to the Oregon Short Term Fund established under ORS 293.728. In that event, the investment pool participant accounts will be treated as are other state funds and accounts in receiving a proportionate share of the earnings of the Oregon Short Term Fund. Notwithstanding ORS 294.805 to 294.895, but subject to ORS 294.810, when the State Treasurer transfers the assets of the investment pool to the Oregon Short Term Fund, the distributions of income to local governments and tribal governments, payment of related expenses and the reporting, program examination and audit functions with respect to the investment pool participant accounts shall be administered in accordance with ORS 293.353 and 293.701 to 293.857.

      (2) The State Treasurer, at the discretion of the treasurer, may reestablish the investment pool as a separate fund if the participant accounts increase to over $125 million and, in the State Treasurer’s judgment, sufficient interest by local government and tribal government exists to ensure the investment pool will remain over $125 million. Prior to reestablishing the pool as a separate fund, the State Treasurer shall first present a plan for operation, including the reasons for such action, to the Oregon Investment Council at a regularly scheduled meeting for its review and comment. The State Treasurer shall publish notice in the Secretary of State’s administrative rules bulletin of the treasurer’s intent to reestablish the pool as a separate fund at least 30 days prior to the meeting at which the Oregon Investment Council shall review the proposal, and notice of the meeting time and location of the Oregon Investment Council at which the proposal will be discussed.
