      (b) In consultation with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the State Treasurer may permit a qualified depository to increase the depository’s collateral as required under paragraph (a) of this subsection over a period of time the State Treasurer specifies or may require a qualified depository to increase the depository’s collateral to an amount that is less than the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (2) The State Treasurer shall order an increase in collateral under subsection (1) of this section if the director so advises. If the qualified depository is a national bank, a federally chartered savings bank, a savings and loan association or a federal credit union, in giving advice to the State Treasurer the director may rely exclusively on information that the federal regulatory agencies and the bank, savings bank, association or federal credit union provide to the director on forms the director prescribes. As a condition of being analyzed and reviewed by the director, a national bank, a federally chartered savings bank, a savings and loan association or a federal credit union shall agree and consent to provide the director with accurate, pertinent and timely information.

      (3) If the State Treasurer orders a qualified depository to increase the depository’s collateral under subsection (1) of this section, the State Treasurer shall give notice of the order to the director and the depository’s custodians within one business day after issuing the order.

      (4) The director’s failure to inform the State Treasurer of the condition of any qualified depository does not give a public depositor any right or impose liability on the director. The State Treasurer is not liable to a public depositor or to a qualified depository for increasing or not increasing the collateral requirement as authorized in subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) A qualified depository that the State Treasurer notifies of the increased collateral requirement shall:

      (a) Within three business days after receiving the notice, submit to the State Treasurer the qualified depository’s plan to increase the depository’s collateral to the level the State Treasurer requires under subsection (1) of this section; and

      (b) Within five business days after receiving approval of the plan the qualified depository submitted under paragraph (a) of this subsection, or within a longer period approved by the State Treasurer in coordination with the Department of Consumer and Business Services, increase the depository’s collateral to the level the State Treasurer requires under subsection (1) of this section.

      (6)(a) If the qualified depository does not increase the depository’s collateral to the level the State Treasurer requires under subsection (1) of this section within the applicable period under subsection (5)(b) of this section, the State Treasurer shall immediately send, to each public official who has notified the State Treasurer that the public official has public funds on deposit in that depository, notice that the depository has failed to comply.

      (b) If, after giving notice as required by paragraph (a) of this subsection, the State Treasurer receives notice that the qualified depository has complied with the increased collateral requirements, the State Treasurer shall notify each public official that the State Treasurer notified under paragraph (a) of this subsection that the depository has complied.

      (7) A qualified depository that does not comply with subsection (5) of this section may not accept additional uninsured public funds deposits.

      (8) Records the State Treasurer receives or compiles that contain the collateralization requirement for a depository and the amount of collateral a custodian holds are exempt from public disclosure unless the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance.

      (9) The State Treasurer may require a qualified depository that must increase the depository’s collateral under subsection (5) of this section to file the reports required under ORS 295.061 (3).

      295.031 Notice to public officials regarding adequacy of collateral. (1) Within three business days after the State Treasurer determines that a qualified depository has failed to increase the value of the depository’s collateral within the time required under ORS 295.015 (3)(b) or receives information from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or other sources under ORS 295.071 or 295.073, or otherwise receives information that indicates that a qualified depository has failed to pledge adequate securities with the depository’s custodian or otherwise provided adequate collateral, the State Treasurer shall send written notice of the failure to each public official who has uninsured public funds on deposit in the depository.

      (2) Within five business days after the State Treasurer receives a receipt from a custodian pursuant to ORS 295.013 (1) that indicates that a qualified depository has pledged adequate securities with the depository’s custodian or satisfactory evidence of other adequate collateral, the State Treasurer shall send written notice to each public official who was notified under subsection (1) of this section stating that the depository has adequate collateral. [2007 c.871 §2; 2009 c.821 §8; 2010 c.101 §9; 2017 c.500 §5; 2019 c.587 §13]

      295.037 Distribution of collateral after loss in qualified depository. (1) The provision of collateral, including the deposit of securities by a qualified depository with its custodian pursuant to ORS 295.001 to 295.108, constitutes consent by the depository to the disposition of the securities in accordance with this section.

      (2) When a loss has occurred in a qualified depository, the depository shall as soon as possible make payment to the proper public officials of all funds subject to the loss, pursuant to the following procedures:

      (a) Immediately upon occurrence of the loss, the State Treasurer shall exercise all of the State Treasurer’s rights in the collateral, including without limitation taking possession of any securities segregated as collateral for uninsured public funds deposits held by the closed depository and beginning to collect payment from as much of the collateral, including without limitation the liquidation of securities, as the State Treasurer estimates is necessary, based upon the most recent information available to the State Treasurer on the amount of uninsured public funds deposits held by the closed depository, for distribution of the proceeds among public officials entitled to the proceeds as provided in this section.

      (b) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the receiver for the closed depository shall, within 20 days after the issuance of a restraining order or taking possession of any qualified depository, ascertain the amount of public funds on deposit in the depository as disclosed by its records and the amount of the public funds covered by deposit insurance or deposit guaranty bonds and certify the amounts to the State Treasurer and to each public official who has public funds on deposit in the depository.

      (c) Each public official who has uninsured public funds on deposit in the qualified depository shall, within 10 days after receipt of the certification from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the receiver, furnish to the State Treasurer verified statements of the uninsured public funds that the public official has on deposit in the depository.

      (3) Upon receipt of the certification from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the receiver and the verified statements from the public officials who have uninsured public funds on deposit in the qualified depository, the State Treasurer shall ascertain and fix the amount of public funds on deposit in the depository, plus interest to the date the funds are distributed to the public official at the rate the depository agreed to pay on the funds, minus any amount covered by deposit insurance or deposit guaranty bonds. [2007 c.871 §4; 2009 c.821 §10; 2019 c.587 §15]

 

      295.038 Assessment against collateral of qualified depositories. (1) After making the calculation described in ORS 295.037, the State Treasurer shall assess the amount of uninsured public funds against a collateral pool that consists of collateral provided by all other qualified depositories of the same type, either bank or credit union, as the closed depository as follows:

      (a) First, against the closed depository, to the extent of the full value of the proceeds from the State Treasurer’s liquidation of the closed depository’s collateral under ORS 295.037, plus the State Treasurer’s estimate of the amount of proceeds the State Treasurer expects to receive from collateral the State Treasurer has not yet liquidated; and

      (b) Second, against all other qualified depositories on a proportionate basis determined as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The amount the State Treasurer assesses against another qualified depository may not exceed the depository’s maximum liability.

      (2) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the State Treasurer shall determine the proportionate share of each of the other qualified depositories in the collateral pool by:

      (a) Averaging, for each qualified depository, the total amounts of all uninsured public funds deposits the depository reported on the depository’s last two treasurer reports;

      (b) Averaging the aggregate total amounts of all uninsured public funds deposits all qualified depositories in the pool reported on the depositories’ last two treasurer reports; and

      (c) Dividing the result of the calculation performed under paragraph (a) of this subsection by the results of the calculation performed under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (3) For purposes of the calculations set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, “qualified depository” refers only to qualified depositories that are of the same type as the closed depository.

      (4) Notwithstanding the assessment provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the State Treasurer shall assess the amount of a public official’s uninsured public funds deposits only against the closed depository and not against other qualified depositories, if the public official:

      (a) Received appropriate notice about the closed depository from the State Treasurer under ORS 295.018 (6)(a) or 295.031 (1) and did not comply with ORS 295.034; or

      (b) Failed to timely comply with the requirements of ORS 295.006 and, as a result of failing to timely comply, did not receive appropriate notice about the closed depository from the State Treasurer under ORS 295.018 (6)(a), 295.031 (1) or 295.061 (4)(a).

      (5) Assessments the State Treasurer makes against the closed depository are payable immediately from the proceeds of the collateral delivered to the State Treasurer. Assessments the State Treasurer makes against other qualified depositories are payable on the fifth business day following demand. If a qualified depository fails to pay an assessment, the State Treasurer shall exercise the State Treasurer’s legal rights to acquire payment under the collateral, including taking possession of and liquidating any securities the depository segregated as collateral, in the amount necessary to satisfy the depository’s assessment.

      (6) The State Treasurer shall distribute the amounts the State Treasurer receives from the assessments among the public officials entitled to the proceeds in proportion to the public officials’ respective claims, to the extent that the proceeds do not exceed the total amount of uninsured public funds deposits that the public officials claim.

      (7) If, after all other available sources are applied, the amounts the State Treasurer receives from the assessments are inadequate to meet the total claims of the public officials to uninsured public funds deposits, the public officials may make claims against the closed depository as general creditors, but not against a qualified depository other than the closed depository.

      (8)(a) If the final amount of proceeds the State Treasurer receives from the liquidation of collateral from a closed depository exceeds the amount of the assessment against the closed depository under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the State Treasurer shall pay the amount of the excess to the closed depository.

      (b) If the final amount of proceeds the State Treasurer receives from the liquidation of collateral from other qualified depositories exceeds the amount of the assessment against the other qualified depositories in the applicable pool under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the State Treasurer shall pay the excess to the other qualified depositories in the pool in proportion to the amounts the other qualified depositories in the pool paid in assessments to the State Treasurer.

      (c) If the final amount of proceeds the State Treasurer receives from the liquidation of collateral from a qualified depository other than the closed depository under subsection (5) of this section exceeds the amount of the assessment against the depository, the State Treasurer shall pay the excess to the depository.

      (9) The prohibition on transfers of assets set forth in ORS 711.410 does not apply to assessments, payments, transfers or sales of securities made in accordance with this section. [2010 c.101 §12; 2019 c.587 §16]

 

      295.039 State Treasurer acceptance of moneys for purposes of administering ORS 295.038. (1) The State Treasurer may accept moneys from any public or private source for the purpose of paying initial or continuing expenses related to administering the provisions of ORS 295.038.

      (2) The State Treasurer shall deposit moneys the State Treasurer receives under this section into the Miscellaneous Receipts Account established for the State Treasurer in the General Fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 295.106, moneys the State Treasurer receives under this section are continuously appropriated to the State Treasurer for the purpose of paying the State Treasurer’s initial or continuing expenses related to administering ORS 295.038. The State Treasurer shall expend the moneys in accordance with the terms and conditions upon which the moneys were made available. [2010 c.101 §13; 2011 c.667 §1; 2019 c.587 §17]

      295.041 Subrogation rights of State Treasurer. When the State Treasurer distributes the proceeds of assessments and liquidated collateral to a public official under ORS 295.038, the State Treasurer is subrogated to all of the public official’s right, title and interest against the closed depository, and shares in any distribution of the closed depository’s assets ratably with other depositors. Sums received from a distribution must be paid to the public official to the extent of any unpaid net deposit liability. The State Treasurer shall pay the remaining balance to the qualified depositories in the pool against which the assessments were made, pro rata in proportion to the assessments each qualified depository paid. However, the closed depository may not share in a distribution of the balance remaining. The State Treasurer may charge expenses that the State Treasurer incurs in enforcing the State Treasurer’s rights under this section as provided in ORS 295.106. The State Treasurer shall submit a claim for expenses to the closed depository, and if the charges are thereafter paid to the State Treasurer, they shall be treated as a liquidation expense of the closed depository.

(1) A qualified depository may not accept a deposit of public funds if the deposit would cause the aggregate of public funds deposits that any one public official makes in the depository to exceed at any time the depository’s net worth. If a qualified depository’s net worth is reduced, the depository may allow public funds on deposit in excess of the reduced net worth to remain if the depository deposits with the depository’s custodian eligible securities, or provides other collateral, valued at market value in an amount at least equal to the amount of the excess public funds deposits. If the additional securities required by this section are not deposited with the custodian, or other collateral is not provided, the depository shall permit the public official to withdraw deposits prior to maturity, including accrued interest, in accordance with applicable statutes and governmental regulations.

      (2) The limitations of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to public funds deposits a qualified depository holds in a certificate of deposit, time deposit or insured deposit account under ORS 295.004.

      (a) 100 percent of the value of the qualified depository’s net worth, if the depository is an undercapitalized depository;

      (b) 150 percent of the value of the qualified depository’s net worth, if the depository is an adequately capitalized depository;

      (c) 200 percent of the value of the qualified depository’s net worth, if the depository is a well capitalized depository;

      (2) The State Treasurer shall notify each qualified depository, or the depository’s custodian if required by an individual pledge agreement or by rule, of the total aggregate uninsured public funds deposits of all public officials in all qualified depositories, based on the most recently submitted treasurer reports. The State Treasurer shall give the notification required by this subsection by the last day of the month in which the depositories are required to submit a treasurer report.

      (3) If a qualified depository’s aggregate of uninsured public funds deposits exceeds the amount set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the depository shall, within three business days after receiving notice from the State Treasurer, cease accepting deposits of uninsured public funds.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (3) of this section:

      (a) A qualified depository may accept and hold uninsured public funds deposits in excess of the limits specified in subsection (1) of this section if the State Treasurer, upon good cause shown, approves the depository’s request to hold uninsured public funds in excess of the limits specified in subsection (1) of this section for a period not exceeding 90 days and eligible collateral is provided in an amount at least equal to the amount by which the uninsured public funds deposits exceed the limits specified in subsection (1) of this section. Upon the expiration of the 90-day period, if the depository does not comply with the limits specified in subsection (1) of this section, the depository shall, within three business days after receiving notice from the State Treasurer, cease accepting deposits of public funds.

      (b) The limits specified in subsection (1) of this section do not apply to public funds deposits a qualified depository holds in a certificate of deposit, time deposit or insured deposit account under ORS 295.004.

      (c) A well capitalized qualified depository or an adequately capitalized qualified depository may accept and hold uninsured public funds deposits that exceed the limit specified in subsection (1)(d) or (e) of this section if eligible collateral is provided in an amount at least equal to the amount by which the uninsured public funds deposits exceed the limit specified in subsection (1)(d) or (e) of this section.

      (5) If the State Treasurer notifies a qualified depository that the depository must cease accepting deposits of public funds under subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the State Treasurer may also notify public officials who have deposited public funds in the depository that within 15 business days after the public official receives the notice from the State Treasurer, the public official must withdraw from the depository to which the notice applies all public funds deposits that exceed the limit specified in subsection (1)(d) or (e) of this section.

A state agency may use alternative methods to those set forth in this chapter to secure public funds that are collected, deposited or transferred by a third party, if the methods collateralize the public funds at 100 percent and the State Treasurer approves the methods by rule or policy that sets forth how the methods are intended to protect public funds from loss by the third party and by any financial institution used by the third party. The State Treasurer may establish rules, procedures, standards and related requirements that the State Treasurer considers necessary to implement this section. [2011 c.253 §2; 2019 c.587 §29]

      (a) The alternative methods must be approved by an official action of the governing body or appropriate public official of the public body. The official action must include findings by the governing body or public official describing any financial institution used by the third party and how the alternative methods will protect public funds from loss by the third party; and

      (b) The alternative methods must be designed so that the public funds are fully secured while held or deposited by the third party and until the funds are remitted to the public body. A public official shall calculate the minimum amount of collateral required of a third party as follows:

      (A) For the initial calendar quarter of the agreement, the public official shall calculate the minimum amount of collateral to equal a reasonable estimate of the highest amount of public funds that the third party is expected to hold or deposit unremitted at any time within the initial calendar quarter.

      (B) Within the first month of each calendar quarter subsequent to the initial calendar quarter of the agreement, the public official shall recalculate the minimum amount of collateral to equal a reasonable estimate of the highest amount of public funds that the third party is expected to hold or deposit unremitted at any time within the current calendar quarter based on factors that must include but are not limited to:

      (i) The highest amount of public funds that the third party held or deposited unremitted at any time on any day within the preceding calendar quarter; and

      (ii) Any reasonably expected increase or decrease in the amount of public funds the third party is expected to hold or deposit within the current calendar quarter.

      (2) If the State Treasurer prepares a model policy related to acceptable alternative methods as described in subsection (1) of this section, a governing body may adopt all or part of the model policy.

      (3) This section does not apply to a public body that is a state agency.

      (4) As used in this section, “collateral” means cash or a letter of credit or similar instrument intended to ensure payment, approved by a governing body or appropriate public official of a public body, to be used as security to ensure the obligations of a third party. [2019 c.587 §30]

      (e) Funds that are held pursuant to a contract with provisions that require the funds to be collateralized at 100 percent, if the funds are deposited into an account that is separate from other accounts of the holder of the funds and the public official and the financial institution in which the funds are deposited have entered into a written agreement that provides a perfected security interest to the public official in collateral valued at an amount at least equal to the amount of funds in the account, in a manner substantially similar to a pledge agreement described in ORS 295.001 (17).
