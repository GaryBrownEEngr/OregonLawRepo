      (a) Maintain an accurate inventory of the securities of each depository described in the custodian’s receipts that the custodian issues to the State Treasurer and adjust the inventory to reflect pledges or releases of securities that the custodian previously inventoried.

      (b) Appraise the value of the securities added to and released from the depository’s inventory and appraise the value of the depository’s entire inventory on the last day of each month and at such other times as the State Treasurer directs.

      (c) Provide reports to the State Treasurer that describe the type and value of each security pledged by each depository and any additional information required by the State Treasurer.

      (3) The State Treasurer, by rule or through individual pledge agreements, may specify:

      (a) Additional information that must be reported related to the securities pledged;

      (b) The frequency with which reports required under this section must be provided; and

      (c) Requirements for distribution of reports to depositories or other persons. [Formerly 295.035; 2009 c.821 §5; 2010 c.101 §6; 2017 c.500 §2]

 

      295.015 Maintenance of securities by depository. Except as provided in ORS 295.018:

      (1)(a) A depository throughout the period during which the depository possesses uninsured public funds deposits shall maintain on deposit with the depository’s custodian, at the depository’s own expense, securities that have a value at least equal to the depository’s minimum collateral requirement and as otherwise prescribed in ORS 295.001 to 295.108. The depository shall deposit the collateral with the depository’s custodian and the depository and the custodian shall clearly mark the collateral as security for public funds deposited in accordance with ORS 295.001 to 295.108.

      (b) For purposes of this section, when pledged as collateral for public funds deposits, loans described in ORS 295.001 (19)(f) must be discounted to 75 percent of the unpaid principal balance owing on the loan from time to time, or to a lower value that the State Treasurer determines from time to time.

      (c) A bond anticipation note that is pledged as collateral for public funds deposits and for which there is no readily determinable market value must be discounted to 75 percent of the unpaid principal balance owing on the note from time to time, or to a lower value that the State Treasurer determines from time to time.

      (2) A depository may deposit other eligible securities with the depository’s custodian and release from deposit securities that the depository pledged to secure deposits of public funds if the remaining securities have a value not less than the depository’s minimum collateral requirement. The State Treasurer shall execute releases and surrender custodian’s receipts that are appropriate to effect pledges and releases of matured and excess pledged securities.

      (3) If a depository’s minimum collateral requirement increases because the depository ceases to be a well capitalized depository as reflected in the depository’s last treasurer report, call report or other public filing, or if the depository receives notice from the depository’s custodian or from the State Treasurer:

      (a) Within three business days after the date on which the depository’s minimum collateral requirement increases, the depository shall notify the depository’s custodian and the State Treasurer in writing that the depository’s minimum collateral requirement has increased, setting forth the depository’s new minimum collateral requirement and the depository’s plan for increasing the depository’s pledged collateral to the minimum collateral requirement; and

      (b) Within five business days after the date on which the depository’s minimum collateral requirement increases, or within a longer period approved by the State Treasurer in coordination with the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the depository shall, in accordance with the plan approved by the State Treasurer, tender to the depository’s custodian additional securities that have a value sufficient to increase the total value of the depository’s securities pledged as collateral for public funds deposits to the depository’s new minimum collateral requirement.

      (4) If a depository’s minimum collateral requirement decreases because the depository becomes a well capitalized depository, or because the State Treasurer no longer requires the depository to pledge additional collateral under ORS 295.018, the depository may:

      (a) Notify the depository’s custodian and the State Treasurer in writing that the depository’s minimum collateral requirement has decreased, setting forth the depository’s new minimum collateral requirement; and

      (b) With the written approval of the State Treasurer, release from the depository’s custodian securities that exceed the depository’s new minimum collateral requirement.

      (5) The State Treasurer shall act upon requests for releases of securities under subsections (2) and (4)(b) of this section within three business days after receiving each request. [1967 c.451 §2; 1975 c.515 §3; 2007 c.871 §17; 2009 c.821 §6; 2010 c.101 §7; 2017 c.500 §3]

 

      295.018 Increase in required collateral of depository; notifications; failure to increase collateral. (1)(a) The State Treasurer may require a depository, during any period when the depository possesses uninsured public funds deposits, to maintain on deposit with the depository’s custodians securities that have a value not less than 110 percent of the greater of:

      (A) All uninsured public funds the depository holds; or

      (B) The average of the balances of uninsured public funds the depository holds, as shown on the last two immediately preceding treasurer reports.

      (b) In consultation with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the State Treasurer may permit a depository to increase the depository’s collateral as required under paragraph (a) of this subsection over a period of time the State Treasurer specifies or may require a depository to increase the depository’s collateral to an amount that is less than the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (2) The State Treasurer shall order an increase in collateral under subsection (1) of this section if the director so advises. If the depository is a national bank, a federally chartered savings bank, a savings and loan association or a federal credit union, in giving advice to the State Treasurer the director may rely exclusively on information that the federal regulatory agencies and the bank, savings bank, association or federal credit union provide to the director on forms the director prescribes. As a condition of being analyzed and reviewed by the director, a national bank, a federally chartered savings bank, a savings and loan association or a federal credit union shall agree and consent to provide the director with accurate, pertinent and timely information.

      (3) If the State Treasurer orders a depository to increase the depository’s collateral under subsection (1) of this section, the State Treasurer shall give notice of the order to the director and the custodian of the depository within one business day after issuing the order.

      (4) The director’s failure to inform the State Treasurer of the condition of any depository does not give a public depositor any right or impose liability on the director. The State Treasurer is not liable to a public depositor or to a depository for increasing or not increasing the collateral requirement as authorized in subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) A depository that the State Treasurer notifies of the increased collateral requirement shall:

      (a) Within three business days after receiving the notice, submit to the State Treasurer the depository’s plan to increase the depository’s collateral to the level the State Treasurer requires under subsection (1) of this section; and

      (b) Within five business days after receiving approval of the plan the depository submitted under paragraph (a) of this subsection, or within a longer period approved by the State Treasurer in coordination with the Department of Consumer and Business Services, increase the depository’s collateral to the level the State Treasurer requires under subsection (1) of this section.

      (6)(a) If the depository does not increase the depository’s collateral to the level the State Treasurer requires under subsection (1) of this section within the applicable period under subsection (5)(b) of this section, the State Treasurer shall immediately send, to each public official who has notified the State Treasurer that the public official has public funds on deposit in that depository, notice that the depository has failed to comply.

      (b) If, after giving notice as required by paragraph (a) of this subsection, the State Treasurer receives notice that the depository has complied with the increased collateral requirements, the State Treasurer shall notify each public official that the State Treasurer notified under paragraph (a) of this subsection that the depository has complied.

      (7) A depository that does not comply with subsection (5) of this section may not accept additional uninsured public funds deposits.

      (8) Records the State Treasurer receives or compiles that contain the collateralization requirement for a depository and the amount of collateral a custodian holds are exempt from public disclosure unless the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance.

      (9) The State Treasurer may require a depository that must increase the depository’s collateral under subsection (5) of this section to file the reports required under ORS 295.061 (3).

      295.031 Notice to public officials regarding adequacy of collateral. (1) Within three business days after the State Treasurer determines that a depository has failed to increase the value of the depository’s securities within the time required under ORS 295.015 (3)(b) or receives information from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or other sources under ORS 295.071 or 295.073, or otherwise receives information that indicates that a depository has failed to pledge adequate collateral with the depository’s custodian, the State Treasurer shall send written notice of the failure to each public official who has uninsured public funds on deposit in the depository.

      (2) Within five business days after the State Treasurer receives a receipt from a custodian pursuant to ORS 295.013 (1) that indicates that a depository has pledged adequate collateral with the depository’s custodian, the State Treasurer shall send written notice to each public official who was notified under subsection (1) of this section stating that the depository has adequate collateral. [2007 c.871 §2; 2009 c.821 §8; 2010 c.101 §9; 2017 c.500 §5]

 

      295.034 Withdrawal of inadequately collateralized funds. (1) Within 15 business days after a public official receives a notice from the State Treasurer pursuant to ORS 295.018 (6)(a), 295.031 (1) or 295.061 (4)(a), the public official shall withdraw from the depository to which the notice applies all uninsured public funds deposits.

      (2) If a public official receives a notice from the State Treasurer pursuant to ORS 295.018 (6)(a), 295.031 (1) or 295.061 (4)(a), beginning 15 business days after the public official receives the notice, the public official may not deposit into the depository to which the notice applies any public funds that, as a result of the deposit, would be uninsured public funds deposits. The prohibition on deposits continues until the public official receives notice under ORS 295.018 (6)(b), 295.031 (2) or 295.061 (4)(b) indicating that the depository is in compliance with ORS 295.013, 295.018 or 295.061, as applicable.

      (3) Except as required by any applicable law or regulation, a depository may not impose an early withdrawal penalty or a forfeiture of interest with respect to a withdrawal that a public official makes pursuant to this section. [2007 c.871 §3; 2009 c.821 §9; 2010 c.101 §10]

      295.037 Distribution of collateral after loss in bank depository; assessments. (1) The deposit of securities by a bank depository with its custodian pursuant to ORS 295.001 to 295.108 constitutes consent by the bank depository to the disposition of the securities in accordance with this section.

      (2) When a loss has occurred in a bank depository, the bank depository shall as soon as possible make payment to the proper public officials of all funds subject to the loss, pursuant to the following procedures:

      (a) Immediately upon occurrence of the loss, the State Treasurer shall take possession of the securities segregated as collateral for uninsured public funds deposits held by the closed depository and begin to liquidate as much of the collateral as the State Treasurer estimates is necessary, based upon the most recent information available to the State Treasurer on the amount of uninsured public funds deposits held by the closed depository, for distribution of the proceeds among public officials entitled to the proceeds as provided in this section.

      (b) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the receiver for the closed depository shall, within 20 days after the issuance of a restraining order or taking possession of any bank depository, ascertain the amount of public funds on deposit in the bank depository as disclosed by its records and the amount of the public funds covered by deposit insurance or deposit guaranty bonds and certify the amounts to the State Treasurer and to each public official who has public funds on deposit in the bank depository.

      (c) Each public official who has uninsured public funds on deposit in the bank depository shall, within 10 days after receipt of the certification from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the receiver, furnish to the State Treasurer verified statements of the uninsured public funds that the public official has on deposit in the bank depository.

      (3) Upon receipt of the certification from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the receiver and the verified statements from the public officials who have uninsured public funds on deposit in the bank depository, the State Treasurer shall ascertain and fix the amount of public funds on deposit in the bank depository, plus interest to the date the funds are distributed to the public official at the rate the bank depository agreed to pay on the funds, minus any amount covered by deposit insurance or deposit guaranty bonds.

      (4) After making the calculation described in subsection (3) of this section, the State Treasurer shall assess the amount of uninsured public funds against all bank depositories, as follows:

      (a) First, against the closed depository, to the extent of the full value of the proceeds realized from the liquidation of its collateral by the State Treasurer under subsection (2) of this section, plus the treasurer’s estimate of the amount of proceeds expected to be received from the collateral still to be liquidated by the State Treasurer; and

      (b) Second, against all of the other bank depositories, on a proportionate basis determined as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The amount assessed against each other bank depository under this paragraph may not exceed the maximum liability of the bank depository.

      (5) For purposes of subsection (4) of this section, the proportionate share of each of the other bank depositories shall be determined by:

      (a) Averaging the total amounts of all uninsured public funds deposits reported on the bank depository’s last two treasurer reports;

      (b) Averaging the aggregate total amounts of all uninsured public funds deposits reported on the last two treasurer reports of all of the bank depositories; and

      (c) Dividing the result of the calculation performed under paragraph (a) of this subsection by the result of the calculation performed under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (6) Notwithstanding the assessment provisions of subsection (4) of this section, the State Treasurer shall assess the amount of uninsured public funds deposits of a public official only against the closed depository, and not against other bank depositories, if the public official:

      (a) Was given appropriate notice about the closed depository by the State Treasurer under ORS 295.018 (6)(a), 295.031 (1) or 295.061 (4)(a) and did not comply with ORS 295.034; or

      (b) Failed to timely comply with the requirements of ORS 295.006 and, as a result of the failure to timely comply, did not receive appropriate notice about the closed depository from the State Treasurer under ORS 295.018 (6)(a), 295.031 (1) or 295.061 (4)(a).

      (7) The assessment by the State Treasurer against the closed depository shall be payable immediately from the proceeds of the collateral delivered to the State Treasurer. Assessments made by the State Treasurer against the other bank depositories are payable on the fifth business day following demand. If any bank depository fails to pay its assessment, the State Treasurer shall take possession of and liquidate the securities segregated as collateral for uninsured public funds deposits held by the bank depository or so much of the securities as is needed to pay the bank depository’s assessment.

      (8) The State Treasurer shall distribute the amounts received by the State Treasurer from the assessments, to the extent that they do not exceed the total amount of uninsured public funds deposits and accrued interest claimed by the public officials, among the public officials entitled to the proceeds in proportion to the public officials’ respective claims.

      (9) If the amounts received by the State Treasurer from the assessments are inadequate, after all other available sources are applied, to meet the total claims of the public officials for the amount of their uninsured public funds deposits, the public officials may make claims against the closed depository as general creditors, but not against any bank depository other than the closed depository.

      (10)(a) If the final amount of proceeds from the liquidation of collateral received by the State Treasurer from a closed depository exceeds the amount of the assessment against the closed depository under subsection (4)(a) of this section, the State Treasurer shall pay the amount of the excess to the closed depository.

      (b) If the final amount of proceeds from the liquidation of collateral received by the State Treasurer from other bank depositories exceeds the amount of the assessment against the other bank depositories under subsection (4)(b) of this section, the State Treasurer shall pay the excess to the other bank depositories in proportion to the amounts paid to the State Treasurer under their assessments.

      (c) If the final amount of proceeds from the liquidation of collateral received by the State Treasurer from a bank depository, other than the closed depository, under subsection (7) of this section exceeds the amount of the assessment against the bank depository, the State Treasurer shall pay the excess to the bank depository.

      (11) The prohibition on transfers of assets set forth in ORS 711.410 does not apply to assessments, payments, transfers or sales of securities made pursuant to this section. [2007 c.871 §4; 2009 c.821 §10]

 

      295.038 Distribution of collateral after loss in credit union depository; assessments. (1) A credit union depository’s deposit of securities with a custodian under ORS 295.001 to 295.108 constitutes the credit union depository’s consent to the disposition of the securities in accordance with this section.

      (2) If a loss occurs in a credit union depository, the credit union depository shall, as soon as possible, pay to the proper public officials all funds subject to the loss in accordance with the following procedures:

      (a) Immediately after the loss occurs, the State Treasurer shall take possession of securities that the closed depository’s custodian has segregated as collateral for uninsured public funds deposits of the closed depository. The State Treasurer shall immediately liquidate as much of the collateral as the State Treasurer estimates is necessary, based on the most recent information available to the State Treasurer concerning the amount of uninsured public funds the credit union depository holds, and distribute the proceeds among public officials entitled to the proceeds as provided in this section.

      (b) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or a receiver shall, within 20 days after issuing a restraining order or taking possession of the credit union depository, ascertain from the credit union depository’s records the amount of public funds on deposit in the credit union depository and the amount of public funds that are covered by deposit insurance or deposit guaranty bonds. The director or the receiver shall certify the amounts to the State Treasurer and to each public official who has public funds on deposit in the credit union depository.

      (c) Within 10 days after receiving the certification from the director or the receiver, a public official who has public funds on deposit in the credit union depository shall furnish to the State Treasurer verified statements of the public funds that the public official has on deposit in the credit union depository.

      (3) When the State Treasurer receives the certification from the director or the receiver and the verified statements from the public officials who have public funds on deposit in the credit union depository, the State Treasurer shall ascertain and fix the amount of public funds on deposit in the credit union depository, plus interest to the date the funds are distributed to the public official at the rate the credit union depository agreed to pay on the funds, minus any amount that deposit insurance or deposit guaranty bonds cover.

      (4) After making the calculation described in subsection (3) of this section, the State Treasurer shall assess the amount of uninsured public funds against all credit union depositories as follows:

      (a) First, against the credit union depository that suffered the loss, to the extent of the full value of the proceeds from the State Treasurer’s liquidation of the credit union depository’s collateral under subsection (2) of this section, plus the State Treasurer’s estimate of the amount of proceeds the State Treasurer expects to receive from collateral the State Treasurer has not yet liquidated; and

      (b) Second, against all other credit union depositories on a proportionate basis determined as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The amount the State Treasurer assesses against another credit union depository may not exceed the credit union depository’s maximum liability.

      (5) For purposes of subsection (4) of this section, the State Treasurer shall determine the proportionate share of each of the other credit union depositories by:

      (a) Averaging, for each credit union depository, the total amounts of all uninsured public funds deposits the credit union depository reported on the credit union depository’s last two treasurer reports;

      (b) Averaging the aggregate total amounts of all uninsured public funds deposits all credit union depositories reported on the credit union depositories’ last two treasurer reports; and

      (c) Dividing the result of the calculation performed under paragraph (a) of this subsection by the results of the calculation performed under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (6) Notwithstanding the assessment provisions of subsection (4) of this section, the State Treasurer shall assess the amount of a public official’s uninsured public funds deposits only against the closed depository and not against other credit union depositories, if the public official:

      (a) Received appropriate notice about the closed depository from the State Treasurer under ORS 295.018 (6)(a) or 295.031 (1) and did not comply with ORS 295.034; or

      (b) Failed to timely comply with the requirements of ORS 295.006 and, as a result of failing to timely comply, did not receive appropriate notice about the closed depository from the State Treasurer under ORS 295.018 (6)(a), 295.031 (1) or 295.061 (4)(a).

      (7) Assessments the State Treasurer makes against the closed depository are payable immediately from the proceeds of the collateral delivered to the State Treasurer. Assessments the State Treasurer makes against other credit union depositories are payable on the fifth business day following demand. If a credit union depository fails to pay an assessment, the State Treasurer shall take possession of and liquidate the securities the credit union depository segregated as collateral for uninsured public funds deposits that the credit union depository holds, or shall liquidate as much of the securities as is necessary to pay the credit union depository’s assessment.

      (8) The State Treasurer shall distribute the amounts the State Treasurer receives from the assessments among the public officials entitled to the proceeds in proportion to the public officials’ respective claims, to the extent that the proceeds do not exceed the total amount of uninsured public funds deposits that the public officials claim.

      (9) If, after all other available sources are applied, the amounts the State Treasurer receives from the assessments are inadequate to meet the total claims of the public officials to uninsured public funds deposits, the public officials may make claims against the closed depository as general creditors, but not against a credit union depository other than the closed depository.

      (10)(a) If the final amount of proceeds the State Treasurer receives from the liquidation of collateral from a closed depository exceeds the amount of the assessment against the closed depository under subsection (4)(a) of this section, the State Treasurer shall pay the amount of the excess to the closed depository.

      (b) If the final amount of proceeds the State Treasurer receives from the liquidation of collateral from other credit union depositories exceeds the amount of the assessment against the other credit union depositories under subsection (4)(b) of this section, the State Treasurer shall pay the excess to the other credit union depositories in proportion to the amounts the other credit union depositories paid in assessments to the State Treasurer.

      (c) If the final amount of proceeds the State Treasurer receives from the liquidation of collateral from a credit union depository other than the closed depository under subsection (7) of this section exceeds the amount of the assessment against the credit union depository, the State Treasurer shall pay the excess to the credit union depository.

      (11) The prohibition on transfers of assets set forth in ORS 711.410 does not apply to assessments, payments, transfers or sales of securities made in accordance with this section. [2010 c.101 §12]

 

      295.039 State Treasurer acceptance of moneys for purposes of administering ORS 295.038. (1) The State Treasurer may accept moneys from any public or private source, including a credit union or an association of credit unions, for the purpose of paying initial or continuing expenses related to administering the provisions of ORS 295.038.

      (2) The State Treasurer shall deposit moneys the State Treasurer receives under this section into the Miscellaneous Receipts Account established for the State Treasurer in the General Fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 295.106, moneys the State Treasurer receives under this section are continuously appropriated to the State Treasurer for the purpose of paying the State Treasurer’s initial or continuing expenses related to administering ORS 295.038. The State Treasurer shall expend the moneys in accordance with the terms and conditions upon which the moneys were made available. [2010 c.101 §13; 2011 c.667 §1]

      295.041 Subrogation rights of State Treasurer. When the State Treasurer distributes the proceeds of assessments and liquidated collateral to a public official under ORS 295.037 or 295.038, the State Treasurer is subrogated to all of the public official’s right, title and interest against the closed depository, and shares in any distribution of the depository’s assets ratably with other depositors. Sums received from a distribution must be paid to the public official to the extent of any unpaid net deposit liability. The State Treasurer shall pay the remaining balance to the depositories against which the assessments were made, pro rata in proportion to the assessments each depository paid. However, the closed depository may not share in a distribution of the balance remaining. The State Treasurer may charge expenses that the State Treasurer incurs in enforcing the State Treasurer’s rights under this section as provided in ORS 295.106. The State Treasurer shall submit a claim for expenses to the depository, and if the charges are thereafter paid to the State Treasurer, they shall be treated as a liquidation expense of the closed depository. [2007 c.871 §6; 2009 c.821 §11; 2010 c.101 §14]

      295.046 Limitation on depository acceptance of public funds from single public official; exceptions. (1) A depository may not accept a deposit of public funds if the deposit would cause the aggregate of public funds deposits that any one public official makes in the depository to exceed at any time the depository’s net worth. If a depository’s net worth is reduced, the depository may allow public funds on deposit in excess of the reduced net worth to remain if the depository deposits with the depository’s custodian eligible securities valued at market value in an amount at least equal to the amount of the excess public funds deposits. If the additional securities required by this section are not deposited with the custodian, the depository shall permit the public official to withdraw deposits prior to maturity, including accrued interest, in accordance with applicable statutes and governmental regulations.

      (2) The limitations of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to:

      (a) Public funds deposits a depository holds in a certificate of deposit or time deposit under ORS 295.004 (1); or

      (b) Public funds that an Oregon depository arranges to deposit into an insured deposit account under ORS 295.004 (2). [2007 c.871 §10; 2009 c.821 §12; 2010 c.101 §15; 2011 c.477 §§5,6; 2013 c.1 §26]

 

      295.048 Limitations on aggregate uninsured public funds deposits; notice; exceptions. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 295.046, a depository may not permit the aggregate of uninsured public funds deposits on deposit with the depository from all public officials to exceed at any time the least of:

      (a) 100 percent of the value of the depository’s net worth, if the depository is an undercapitalized depository;

      (b) 150 percent of the value of the depository’s net worth, if the depository is an adequately capitalized depository;

      (c) 200 percent of the value of the depository’s net worth, if the depository is a well capitalized depository;

      (d) For a bank depository, 30 percent of the total aggregate uninsured public funds deposits of all public officials in all bank depositories as reported in the most recent notice the bank depository received from the State Treasurer; or

      (e) For a credit union depository, 30 percent of the total aggregate uninsured public funds deposits of all public officials in all credit union depositories as reported in the most recent notice the credit union depository received from the State Treasurer.
