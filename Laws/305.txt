The order may apply retroactively and extend a period of limitation that, as of the date of the order, has expired.

      (2) The Secretary of State shall publish the order in the bulletin referred to in ORS 183.360. [2003 c.168 §2]

(1) For the purposes of out-of-state collections, a tax warrant shall have the effect of a judgment as provided by ORS 205.125 and 314.430. However, if the laws of another state require a judgment issued by a court for the purposes of executing creditor’s remedies in that state, the Department of Revenue may obtain a judgment based upon a tax warrant as provided in this section.

      (2) The department shall give 30 days’ written notice to any person subject to a warrant for the collection of taxes, penalties or interest of its intention to obtain a judgment in the Oregon Tax Court.

      (4) If a certificate of release, cancellation or satisfaction of any warrant is presented to the Secretary of State for filing, the Secretary of State shall:

      (b) Cause a certificate of cancellation or satisfaction to be held, marked and indexed as if the certificate were a release of collateral within the meaning of ORS 79.0512. [Formerly 314.432; 2001 c.445 §172]

The uniform fee for such a certificate for a particular person shall be prescribed by the Secretary of State by rule. If the request for the certificate is in writing and not in the standard form prescribed by the Secretary of State, an additional fee shall be prescribed.

      (2) If any person disobeys any subpoena of the director, or refuses to testify when required by the director, the department may apply to the Oregon Tax Court for an order to the person to produce the books and papers or attend and testify, or otherwise comply with the demand of the department. The application to the court shall be by ex parte motion upon which the court shall make an order requiring the person against whom it is directed to appear before the court in the county in which the person resides or has a place of business on such date as the court shall designate in its order and show cause why the person should not comply with the demand of the department. The order shall be served upon the person to whom it is directed in the manner required by this state for service of process, which service shall be required to confer jurisdiction upon the court. Upon failure of such person to show cause for noncompliance, the court shall make an order requiring the person to comply with the demand of the department within such time as the court shall direct. Failure to obey any order issued by the court under this section is contempt of court. The remedy provided by this section shall be in addition to other remedies, civil or criminal, existing under the tax laws or other laws of this state.

      (3) ORS 305.420 (4) applies to the issuance of a subpoena under this section. [Formerly 306.190; 1977 c.884 §4; 1981 c.139 §7; 1993 c.353 §5; 2003 c.46 §3; 2005 c.345 §3]

      (3) Before the department discloses information under subsection (2) of this section, it shall notify the owner of the property to which the information relates. The owner shall have 30 days to seek an order from the tax court prohibiting or limiting the department’s disclosure of the information. In determining whether to allow disclosure of the information, the court shall consider the need for disclosure and the possible harm to the owner from that disclosure. The decision of the tax court is reviewable by the Supreme Court in the same manner as any other decision of the tax court. [1991 c.903 §3; 1995 c.650 §83]

 

      305.193 Disclosure of tax information to designated persons; rules. (1) Notwithstanding any law restricting the disclosure of taxpayer particulars or other tax information, the Department of Revenue may adopt rules permitting the disclosure of particulars or other tax information to a person designated by a taxpayer, either expressly or by implication, to receive the information. The department may consider a person designated by implication if the person reveals to the department knowledge of tax information that is:

      (a) Related to the tax matter that is the subject of the inquiry or communication;

      (b) Of a nature that is generally known only to the taxpayer; and

      (c) Of a nature that a taxpayer ordinarily would not share with another person except for the purpose of empowering that person to receive information regarding the tax matters of the taxpayer.

      (2) Rules adopted under this section may be limited in application to specific tax programs or specific classes of taxpayers.

      (3) This section does not apply to any particulars or other tax information collected for purposes of administering the provisions of ORS chapter 657.

      (4) As used in this section, “particulars” has the meaning given that term in ORS 314.835. [2003 c.541 §3]

 

      305.195 Written interrogatories; contents; time and manner of service; answer; objection; order for answer; demand for information by taxpayer; order for information. (1) The Department of Revenue may serve upon any taxpayer written interrogatories to be answered by the taxpayer served or, if the taxpayer served is a corporation, partnership or association, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the taxpayer. Interrogatories may be served by the department whenever it deems it necessary for the purpose of determining the tax liability of any taxpayer having income from business activity which is taxable both within and without the state. The request for the interrogatories shall explain the nature of the department’s inquiry, the use to be made of the information, and the rights of appeal provided under subsection (4) of this section. The use of interrogatories shall be available at all times prior to a final order or determination by the department in the matter being investigated.

      (2) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them. All objections made to written interrogatories must be signed by the attorney for the party making the objection, or by the party if the party has no attorney. The taxpayer upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories.

      (3) If any taxpayer refuses or fails to answer an interrogatory within the time required, the department may apply to the Oregon Tax Court for an order requiring answer of the interrogatory served. The application to the court shall be by ex parte motion upon which the court shall make an order requiring the taxpayer against whom it is directed to appear before the court on such date as the court shall designate in its order and show cause why the taxpayer should not answer the interrogatory of the department. The order shall require appearance in the county in which the person resides or has a place of business, or if there is no residence or place of business, at the court at Salem, Oregon, or in any event at such place as is agreeable to the parties and the court. The order shall be served upon the person to whom it is directed in the manner required by this state for service of process, which service shall be required to confer jurisdiction upon the court. Upon failure of such person to show cause for noncompliance, the court shall make an order requiring the person to comply with the demand of the department within such time as the court shall direct. Failure to obey any order issued by the court under this section is contempt of court. The remedy provided by this section shall be in addition to other remedies, civil or criminal, existing under the tax laws or other laws of this state.

      (4) If, after the taxpayer has been served with the department’s interrogatories, the taxpayer has reason to believe that the taxpayer has not been fully informed by the department as to the nature of the department’s inquiry or the use by the department of the information supplied, the taxpayer may, within 30 days after service upon the taxpayer, serve upon the department a demand for full information as to such inquiry and use. The department shall answer the demand within 30 days of receipt. If no answer is made by the department, or if answer is made and the answer is deemed unsatisfactory by the taxpayer, the taxpayer may within 30 days of the department’s answer, or 60 days of the demand if no answer has been made, apply to the Oregon Tax Court for an order requiring answer of the department by filing a petition in the manner provided by law for filing a personal income tax appeal to the court. The department shall answer and, after hearing, the court shall make such disposition of the matter as it deems necessary to achieve justice. [1977 c.866 §8]

      (2) If an appeal is taken to the Oregon Tax Court pursuant to ORS 305.560, each person shall make available to the court information from the person’s income tax returns or reports supporting that person’s position, together with all evidence or supporting data furnished to or subpoenaed by the Department of Revenue, as well as such other information as may be presented to the court in the manner otherwise provided for in the hearing of cases in the Oregon Tax Court. If any person fails or refuses to appear or bring such information in part or in whole, the court shall make its determination on the basis of all the evidence introduced. All such evidence shall constitute a public record and shall be available to the parties and the court notwithstanding any provision of ORS 314.835, 314.840 or 314.991.

      (3)(a) If the director determines that the rates of interest for deficiencies, delinquencies and refunds established in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are at least one percentage point more or less than the prevailing rates of interest established by the Internal Revenue Service for underpayments arising under the federal tax laws to which one percentage point has been added, the director may adopt, by rule, adjusted interest rates. The director shall not adopt adjusted interest rates more than once in a calendar year. Notice of intent to adopt adjusted interest rates shall be given in the manner provided in ORS 183.335, not less than three months before the proposed effective date of the adjusted rates.

      (B) To any interest amount determined by taking into consideration the current interest rates established by the Internal Revenue Service for underpayments under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, which interest amount shall be expressed at a rate per annum, there shall be added one percent.

      (4) If the director adopts an adjusted interest rate for deficiencies and delinquencies, the director shall adopt an adjusted interest rate for refunds that is equal to the adjusted interest rate for deficiencies and delinquencies.

      (5) Any change in the rate of interest applicable to deficiencies, delinquencies or refunds resulting from the adoption of adjusted interest rates by the director under this section shall apply to deficiencies, delinquencies and refunds outstanding on the effective date of the rule, or arising on or after that date, but only with respect to interest periods beginning on or after that date.

      305.222 Determination of interest rate. For purposes of determining the interest rate established under ORS 305.220:

      (1) In the case of a refund of tax ordered by the Oregon Tax Court or the Oregon Supreme Court and arising under any law administered by the Department of Revenue, if the refund is not paid by the department within 60 days after the date of the order, the interest rate provided under ORS 305.220 shall be four percent greater than the annual interest rate provided under ORS 305.220, but only with respect to interest periods that begin 61 days after the date the order is entered.

      (2)(a) In the case of a notice of assessment pursuant to any law administered by the department, if the deficiency is not paid within 60 days after the date of the notice of assessment, the interest rate provided under ORS 305.220 shall be four percent greater than the annual interest rate provided under ORS 305.220, but only for interest periods that begin 61 days after the date of notice of assessment.

      (b) In the case of an assessment under ORS 305.265 (12), if the delinquency is not paid within 60 days after the date of the assessment, the interest rate provided under ORS 305.220 shall be four percent greater than the annual interest rate provided under ORS 305.220. The increased rate shall apply only for interest periods that begin 61 days after the date of notice of the delinquency.

      (3) If the deficiency assessment is appealed to the Oregon Tax Court without prior payment of tax, then notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the increased rate of interest shall commence only for interest periods that begin 61 days after the date that the order of the Oregon Tax Court or the Oregon Supreme Court affirming the deficiency is entered. [1987 c.647 §7; 1993 c.726 §2; 1995 c.650 §110; 1997 c.325 §§3,4; 2017 c.278 §4]

 

      305.225 Request of assistance by law enforcement agency; disclosure of tax records. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 314.835, if the Department of Revenue determines that assistance of a law enforcement agency is necessary to insure compliance with any of the laws of this state administered by it, the department may request such assistance. In connection with assistance requested under this section only, the Department of Revenue may disclose a tax return, report or claim, or information in its files regarding a tax return, report or claim permitted or required to be filed with the department under any law administered by the department to the Oregon State Police, district attorney, grand jury, judicial authority or local law enforcement agency for the investigation or the prosecution of violations of the criminal laws of this state relating to perjury, theft or forgery if those violations occur in connection with the filing of such a return, report or claim, or of the tax laws of this state. Disclosure under this section shall be solely for the purpose of investigation or prosecution of violations involving the filing of a false or fraudulent return, report or claim, wherein the validity of the return, report or claim, or information contained therein, is at issue. Returns, reports or claims, or information contained therein shall not be disclosed if the purpose for which the information is sought is as evidence of a crime unrelated to the validity of the return, report or claim, or the information contained therein, supplied to the department or if the information is requested by a law enforcement agency in connection with any other investigation or prosecution.

      (2) Each person given access to the confidential tax information authorized to be disclosed under this section shall first execute and file with the department the certificate required by ORS 314.840 (3) and shall cause a similar certificate to be executed and filed with the department by any associate or subordinate who is assigned to use the information for the purposes stated in this section.

(1) The Department of Revenue shall assess a penalty against any person who has previously tendered a dishonored check, draft, order or electronic funds transfer for the payment of any amount collected by the department and who subsequently makes and tenders to the department any check, draft, order or electronic funds transfer for the payment of any tax or any other amount collected by the department, including amounts assigned for collection under ORS 293.250, that is dishonored by the drawee for the following reasons:

      (a) Lack of funds;

      (b) Lack of credit;

      (c) Because the maker has no account with the drawee; or

      (d) Because the maker has ordered payment stopped on the check, draft, order or electronic funds transfer.

      (2) The amount of the penalty assessed under subsection (1) of this section shall be equal to the greater of $25 or three times the amount of the dishonored check, draft, order or electronic funds transfer. The amount of the penalty shall not be greater than $500.

      (3) The penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other penalty imposed by law. Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this section may appeal to the tax court as provided in ORS 305.404 to 305.560. If the penalty is not paid within 10 days after the order of the tax court becomes final, the department may record the order and collect the amount assessed in the manner as income tax deficiencies are recorded and collected under ORS 314.430.

      (4) The department may waive all or any part of the penalty assessed under this section on a showing that there was a reasonable basis for tendering the check, draft, order or electronic funds transfer.

      (5) As used in this section, “electronic funds transfer” has the meaning given that term in ORS 293.525. [1985 c.85 §3; 1995 c.650 §111; 1999 c.61 §1]

      (2) Within 10 days after the filing of the petition, the tax court shall enter an order directing the person to file the report or return or to appear and show cause why no report or return is required to be filed.

      305.265 Deficiency notice; payment of deficiency; assessment; appeal; interest; rules. (1) Except as provided in ORS 305.305, the provisions of this section apply to all reports or returns of tax or tax liability filed with the Department of Revenue under the revenue and tax laws administered by it, except those filed under ORS 320.005 to 320.150.

      (2) As soon as practicable after a report or return is filed, the department shall examine or audit it, if required by law or the department deems such examination or audit practicable. If the department discovers from an examination or an audit of a report or return or otherwise that a deficiency exists, it shall compute the tax and give notice to the person filing the return of the deficiency and of the department’s intention to assess the deficiency, plus interest and any appropriate penalty. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the notice shall:

      (a) State the reason for each adjustment;

      (b) Give a reference to the statute, regulation or department ruling upon which the adjustment is based; and

      (c) Be certified by the department that the adjustments are made in good faith and not for the purpose of extending the period of assessment.

      (3) When the notice of deficiency described in subsection (2) of this section results from the correction of a mathematical or clerical error and states what would have been the correct tax but for the mathematical or clerical error, such notice need state only the reason for each adjustment to the report or return.

      (4) With respect to any tax return filed under ORS chapter 314, 316, 317 or 318, deficiencies shall include but not be limited to the assertion of additional tax arising from:

      (a) The failure to report properly items or amounts of income subject to or which are the measure of the tax;

      (b) The deduction of items or amounts not permitted by law;

      (c) Mathematical errors in the return or the amount of tax shown due in the records of the department; or

      (d) Improper credits or offsets against the tax claimed in the return.

      (5)(a) The notice of deficiency shall be accompanied by a statement explaining the person’s right to make written objections, the person’s right to request a conference and the procedure for requesting a conference. The statement, and an accompanying form, shall also explain that conference determinations are routinely transmitted via regular mail and that a person desiring to have conference determinations transmitted by certified mail may do so by indicating on the form the person’s preference for certified mail and by returning the form with the person’s written objections as described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) Within 30 days from the date of the notice of deficiency, the person given notice shall pay the deficiency with interest computed to the date of payment and any penalty proposed. Or within that time the person shall advise the department in writing of objections to the deficiency, and may request a conference with the department, which shall be held prior to the expiration of the one-year period set forth in subsection (7) of this section.

      (6) If a request for a conference is made, the department shall notify the person of a time and place for conference and appoint a conference officer to meet with the person for an informal discussion of the matter. After the conference, the conference officer shall send the determination of the issues to the person. The determination letter shall be sent by regular mail, or by certified mail if the person given notice has indicated a preference for transmission of the determination by certified mail. The department shall assess any deficiency in the manner set forth in subsection (7) of this section. If no conference is requested and written objections are received, the department shall make a determination of the issues considering such objections, and shall assess any deficiency in the manner provided in subsection (7) of this section. The failure to request or have a conference shall not affect the rights of appeal otherwise provided by law.

      (7) If neither payment nor written objection to the deficiency is received by the department within 30 days after the notice of deficiency has been mailed, the department shall assess the deficiency, plus interest and penalties, if any, and shall send the person a notice of assessment, stating the amount so assessed, and interest and penalties. The notice of assessment shall be mailed within one year from the date of the notice of deficiency unless an extension of time is agreed upon as described in subsection (8) of this section. The notice shall advise the person of the rights of appeal.

      (8) If, prior to the expiration of any period of time prescribed in subsection (7) of this section for giving of notice of assessment, the department and the person consent in writing to the deficiency being assessed after the expiration of such prescribed period, such deficiency may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period agreed upon.

      (9) The failure to hold a requested conference within the one-year period prescribed in subsection (5) of this section shall not invalidate any assessment of deficiency made within the one-year period pursuant to subsection (7) of this section or within any extension of time made pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, but shall invalidate any assessment of interest or penalties attributable to the deficiency. After an assessment has been made, the department and the person assessed may still hold a conference within 90 days from the date of assessment. If a conference is held, the 90-day period under ORS 305.280 (2) shall run from the date of the conference officer’s written determination of the issues.

      (10)(a) In the case of a failure to file a report or return on the date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension for filing), the department shall determine the tax according to the best of its information and belief, assess the tax plus appropriate penalty and interest, and give written notice of the failure to file the report or return and of the determination and assessment to the person required to make the filing. The amount of tax shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be lawfully claimed upon the return.

      (b) Notwithstanding subsection (14) of this section and ORS 305.280, and only to the extent allowed by rules adopted by the department, the department may accept the filing of a report or return submitted by a person who has been assessed a tax under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) The department may reject a report or return:

      (A) That is not verified as required by ORS 305.810;

      (B) That the department determines is not true and correct as to every material matter as required by ORS 305.815; or

      (C) If the department may impose a penalty under ORS 316.992 (1) with respect to the report or return.

      (d) If the department rejects a report or return of a person assessed a tax under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the department shall issue a notice of rejection to the person. The person may appeal the rejection to the magistrate division of the Oregon Tax Court only if:

      (A) The report or return was filed within 90 days of the date the department’s assessment under paragraph (a) of this subsection was issued; and

      (B) The appeal is filed within 90 days of the date shown on the notice of rejection.

      (e) If the person assessed under paragraph (a) of this subsection submits a report or return to the department and appeals the assessment to the tax court, the department may request a stay of action from the court pending review of the report or return. If the department:

      (A) Accepts the filing of the report or return, the appeal shall be dismissed as moot.

      (B) Rejects the report or return, the stay of action on the appeal shall be lifted.

      (f) If the department accepts the filing of a report or return, the department may reduce the assessment issued under paragraph (a) of this subsection. A report or return filed under this subsection that is accepted by the department, whether or not the assessment has been reduced, shall be considered a report or return described in subsection (1) of this section and shall be subject to the provisions of this section, including but not limited to examination and adjustment pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.

      (g) The department may refund payments made with respect to a report or return filed and accepted pursuant to this subsection. If the report or return is filed within three years of the due date for filing the report or return, excluding extensions, the refund shall be made as provided by ORS 305.270 and 314.415. If the report or return is not filed within three years of the due date for filing the report or return, excluding extensions, the refund shall be limited to payments received within the two-year period ending on the date the report or return is received by the department and payments received after the date the report or return is received by the department. Interest shall be paid at the rate established under ORS 305.220 from the date the report or return is received by the department to the time the refund is made.

      (11) Mailing of notice to the person at the person’s last-known address shall constitute the giving of notice as prescribed in this section.

      (12) If a return is filed with the department accompanied by payment of less than the amount of tax shown on or from the information on the return as due, the difference between the tax and the amount submitted is considered as assessed on the due date of the original report or return (determined without regard to any extension of time granted for the filing of the return) or the date the report or return is filed, whichever is later. For purposes of this subsection, the amount of tax shown on or from the information on the return as due shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax that is paid on or before the due date prescribed for payment of the tax, and by any credits against the tax that are claimed on the return. If the amount required to be shown as tax on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on the return, this subsection shall be applied by substituting the lesser amount.

      (13) Every deficiency shall bear interest at the rate established under ORS 305.220 from the due date of the return to the date of payment. If the return was falsely prepared and filed with intent to evade the tax, a penalty equal to 100 percent of the deficiency shall be assessed and collected. All payments received shall be credited first to penalty, then to interest accrued, and then to tax due.

      (14) If the deficiency is paid in full before a notice of assessment is issued, the department is not required to send a notice of assessment, and the tax shall be considered as assessed as of the date which is 30 days from the date of the notice of deficiency or the date the deficiency is paid, whichever is the later. A partial payment of the deficiency shall constitute only a credit to the account of the person assessed. Assessments and billings of taxes shall be final after the expiration of the appeal period specified in ORS 305.280, except to the extent that an appeal is allowed under ORS 305.280 (3) following payment of the tax.

      (15) Appeal may be taken to the tax court from any notice of assessment. The provisions of this chapter with respect to appeals to the tax court apply to any deficiency, penalty or interest assessed. [1977 c.870 §3; 1981 c.724 §3; 1982 s.s.1 c.16 §5; 1985 c.266 §4; 1987 c.512 §2; 1989 c.414 §4; 1993 c.726 §4; 1995 c.650 §27; 1995 c.780 §3; 1997 c.99 §§26,27; 1999 c.224 §1; 1999 c.249 §1; 1999 c.532 §1; 2001 c.76 §5; 2001 c.660 §21; 2005 c.94 §19; 2015 c.348 §9; 2017 c.23 §2; 2017 c.278 §5]

 

      305.267 Extension of time to issue notice of deficiency or assessment. (1) As a part of its application for an order for the enforcement of a subpoena under ORS 305.190 or for an answer to interrogatories under ORS 305.195, the Department of Revenue may request the Oregon Tax Court for an order extending the time within which the department may issue a notice of deficiency or assessment under ORS 305.265.

      (2) The tax court or the Supreme Court upon appeal, shall extend the time for a period ending 90 days after:

      (a) Delivery to the department of the documents and information ordered produced under the subpoena; or

      (b) Delivery to the department of the answers ordered to be made to the department’s interrogatories. [1985 c.266 §2]

 

      305.270 Refund of excess tax paid; claim procedure. (1) If the amount of the tax shown as due on a report or return originally filed with the Department of Revenue with respect to a tax imposed under ORS chapter 118, 308, 308A, 310, 314, 316, 317, 318 or 321, or collected pursuant to ORS 305.620, or as corrected by the department, is less than the amount theretofore paid, or if a person files a claim for refund of any tax paid to the department under such laws within the period specified in subsection (2) of this section, any excess tax paid shall be refunded by the department with interest as provided in this section and ORS 314.415.

      (2) The claim shall be made on a form prescribed by the department, except that an amended report or return showing a refund due and filed within the time allowed by this subsection for the filing of a claim for refund, shall constitute a claim for refund. The claim shall be filed within the period specified in ORS 314.415 (2) for taxes imposed under ORS chapters 310, 314, 316, 317 and 318, or collected pursuant to ORS 305.620 (except where any applicable ordinance specifies another period), within the period specified in ORS 118.100 (2) for taxes imposed under ORS chapter 118 and within two years of the payment of any tax under ORS chapter 308, 308A or 321.

      (3) Upon receipt of a claim for refund, or original report or return claiming a refund, the department shall either refund the amount requested or send to the claimant a notice of any proposed adjustment to the refund claim, stating the basis upon which the adjustment is made. A proposed adjustment may either increase or decrease the amount of the refund claim or result in the finding of a deficiency. If the proposed adjustment results in a determination by the department that some amount is refundable, the department may send the claimant the adjusted amount with the notice.

      (4)(a) The notice of proposed adjustment shall be accompanied by a statement explaining the claimant’s right to make written objections to the refund adjustment, the claimant’s right to request a conference and the procedure for requesting a conference. The statement, and an accompanying form, shall also explain that conference determinations are routinely transmitted via regular mail and that a claimant desiring to have conference determinations transmitted by certified mail may do so by indicating on the form the claimant’s preference for certified mail and by returning the form with the claimant’s written objections as described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) The claimant may, within 30 days of the date of the notice of proposed adjustment, advise the department in writing of objections to the refund adjustment and may request a conference with the department, which shall be held within one year of the date of the notice. The department shall notify the claimant of a time and place for the conference, and appoint a conference officer to meet with the claimant for an informal discussion of the claim. After the conference, the conference officer shall send a determination of the matter to the claimant. The determination letter shall be sent by regular mail, or by certified mail if the claimant has indicated a preference for transmission of the determination by certified mail. The department shall issue either a notice of refund denial or payment of any amount found to be refundable, together with any applicable interest provided by this section. If the conference officer determines that a deficiency exists, the department shall issue a notice of assessment.

      (5) If no conference is requested, and the adjustments have not resulted in the finding of a deficiency, the following shall apply:

      (a) If written objections have been made by the claimant, the department shall consider the objections, determine any issues raised and send the claimant a notice of refund denial or payment of any amount found to be refundable, together with any interest provided by this section.

      (b) If no written objections are made, the notice of any proposed adjustment shall be final after the period for requesting a conference or filing written objections has expired.

      (6) If no conference is requested, and the notice of proposed adjustment has asserted a deficiency, the department shall consider any objections made by the person denied the refund, make a determination of any issues raised, pay any refunds found due, with applicable interest, or assess any deficiency and mail a notice thereof within one year from the date of the notice of deficiency, unless an extension of time is agreed upon as described in subsection (7) of this section.

      (7) If, prior to the expiration of any period of time prescribed in subsection (6) of this section for giving of notice of assessment, the department and the person consent in writing to the deficiency being assessed after the expiration of such prescribed period, such deficiency may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period agreed upon.

      (8) If the department refunds the amount requested as provided in subsection (3) of this section, without examination or audit of the refund claim, the department shall give notice of this to the claimant at the time of making the refund. Thereafter, the department shall have one year in which to examine or audit the refund claim, and send the notice of proposed adjustment provided for in subsection (3) of this section, in addition to any time permitted in ORS 314.410 or 314.415.

      (9) The failure to hold a requested conference within the one-year period prescribed in subsection (4) of this section shall not invalidate any assessment of deficiency made within the one-year period pursuant to subsection (8) of this section or within any extension of time made pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, but shall invalidate any assessment of interest or penalties attributable to the deficiency. After an assessment has been made, the department and the person assessed may still hold a conference within 90 days from the date of assessment. If a conference is held, the 90-day period under ORS 305.280 (2) shall run from the date of the conference officer’s written determination of the issues.

      (10) The claimant may appeal any notice of proposed adjustment, refund denial or notice of assessment in the manner provided in ORS 305.404 to 305.560. The failure to file written objections or to request or have a conference shall not affect the rights of appeal so provided. All notices and determinations shall set forth rights of appeal.

      (b) If the appeal relates to property assessed under ORS 308.505 to 308.674, the assessor of each county to which a portion of the value is apportioned may issue a potential refund credit under paragraph (a) of this subsection:

      (A) Even if the dollar amount in dispute with respect to the county is $1 million or less; and

      (2) For purposes of this section, the dollar amount in dispute means the dollar amount of real market value or specially assessed value in dispute:

      (a) For all tax years to which the appeal relates and any tax year during the pendency of the appeal; and

      (B) For property that is assessed under ORS 308.505 to 308.674, for all current appeals relating to the property or to a unit of which the property is a part.

      (3)(a) Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this section affects the laws governing the assessment and collection of ad valorem property taxes with respect to property to which a potential refund credit relates.

      (b) Nothing in this section relieves a taxpayer of the obligation to comply with all laws governing the timely payment of ad valorem property taxes assessed on the property of the taxpayer to which a potential refund credit relates.

      (4) For purposes of this section, the county assessor shall determine the amount of a potential refund credit as the dollar amount necessary to address the risk presented to the county by an appeal with respect to the tax year that is the subject of the property tax statement of the property to which the potential refund credit relates.

      (5)(a) The county assessor may order issuance of a potential refund credit pursuant to this section at any time during a tax year to which an appeal relates and any tax year during the pendency of the appeal.

      (b) Within 10 days after issuing a potential refund credit, the county assessor shall notify:

      (A) The county treasurer of the amount of taxes included in the potential refund credit; and

      (B) The taxpayer of the amount of taxes included in the potential refund credit and of the provisions of this section.

      (6)(a) Upon payment by the taxpayer of taxes included in a potential refund credit, the county treasurer shall withhold the amount of taxes included in the potential refund credit from the amounts credited under ORS 311.395, net of any discounts, and deposit the withheld amount into a trust fund administered by the county treasurer in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) The county treasurer may:

      (A) Deposit the amount withheld under paragraph (a) of this subsection in the investment pool as defined in ORS 294.805 or any other investment account.

      (B) Create a separate account for any amount withheld that is deposited in the investment pool or other investment account or commingle the amount withheld with other county moneys and account for the amount withheld separately.

      (c) The county treasurer shall provide for proper accounting of any interest accruing on the amount withheld.

      (7)(a) Upon final resolution of the appeal to which a potential refund credit relates, interest shall be computed and paid solely based on the amount earned by moneys in the investment account in which the amount withheld was deposited during the period the amount withheld was deposited in the account.

      (b) If a refund is ordered, notwithstanding ORS 311.812, the amount of the refund shall be paid to the taxpayer out of the amount withheld under subsection (6) of this section, with interest as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection for the period beginning on the later of the payment date or due date of the taxes included in the potential refund credit and ending on the date on which the refund is paid.

      (c)(A) To the extent that taxes included in a potential refund credit are held to be due to the taxing districts, notwithstanding ORS 311.505, the county treasurer shall withdraw an amount not to exceed the amount due, with interest as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, from any account in which the amount withheld has been deposited under subsection (6) of this section and deposit the amount in the unsegregated tax collections account described in ORS 311.385 for distribution in accordance with ORS 311.390.

      (B) The potential refund credit shall be deemed imposed in the tax year or years to which the appeal that gave rise to the potential refund credit relates. The effect of the tax limitation under Article XI, section 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, shall be determined with respect to the amount of taxes included in the potential refund credit in the tax year or years in which the taxes were levied.

      (8) On or before November 25 of each year, the county assessor shall provide an annual report to the governing body and the treasurer of the county showing the status of all current potential refund credits and the status of the appeals to which the credits relate.

      (9) Issuance of a potential refund credit, the withholding of tax amounts, the deposit of amounts withheld in an account and the payment of interest upon resolution of an appeal under this section do not give rise to a cause of action other than an action to ensure proper application of the provisions of this section.

      (10) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules for purposes of this section. [2011 c.112 §1; 2017 c.541 §1]

      305.287 Determination of real market value of property tax account or components. Whenever a party appeals the real market value of one or more components of a property tax account, or accounts that constitute a unit of property within the meaning of ORS 310.160 (1), any other party to the appeal may seek a determination from the body or tribunal of the total real market value of the unit of property, the real market value of any or all of the other components of the tax account or the unit of property, or both. [2011 c.397 §2; 2015 c.37 §1]

 

      305.288 Valuation changes for residential property substantial value error or for good and sufficient cause. (1) The tax court shall order a change or correction applicable to a separate assessment of property to the assessment and tax roll for the current tax year or for either of the two tax years immediately preceding the current tax year, or for any or all of those tax years, if all of the following conditions exist:

      (a) For the tax year to which the change or correction is applicable, the property was or is used primarily as a dwelling (or is vacant) and was and is a single-family dwelling, a multifamily dwelling of not more than four units, a condominium unit, a manufactured structure or a floating home.

      (b) The change or correction requested is a change in value for the property for the tax year and it is asserted in the request and determined by the tax court that the difference between the real market value of the property for the tax year and the real market value on the assessment and tax roll for the tax year is equal to or greater than 20 percent.

      (2) If the tax court finds that the conditions needed to order a change or correction under subsection (1) of this section exist, the court may order a change or correction in the maximum assessed value of the property in addition to the change or correction in the real market value of the property.

      (3) The tax court may order a change or correction applicable to a separate assessment of property to the assessment or tax roll for the current tax year and for either of the two tax years immediately preceding the current tax year if, for the year to which the change or correction is applicable, the assessor or taxpayer has no statutory right of appeal remaining and the tax court determines that good and sufficient cause exists for the failure by the assessor or taxpayer to pursue the statutory right of appeal.

      (4) Before ordering a change or correction to the assessment or tax roll under subsection (3) of this section, the tax court may determine whether any of the conditions exist in a particular case. If the tax court determines that one of the conditions specified does exist, the tax court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to order a change or correction to the roll.

      (b) “Good and sufficient cause”:

      305.295 Cancellation of tax, penalty or interest; rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 305.265 (14), the Department of Revenue may in its discretion, cancel any tax, penalty or interest or any portion thereof, for which an assessment has become final, if any of the following conditions exist:

      (a) The assessment is based upon an asserted tax deficiency calculated upon income that the state is expressly prohibited from taxing under the Oregon Constitution or the laws of the United States.

      (b) The assessment is based upon an asserted tax deficiency arising from an error made by the department when reviewing the return during processing, and the information necessary to correct the error was properly reported in the return as filed as determined by the department.

      (c) The assessment is against an employer for withholding tax, with respect to any full calendar quarter during which the employer had no payroll and had permanently ceased doing business. An employer shall not be considered to have ceased doing business if the employer has changed its name and the business activity continues under the same beneficial ownership.

      (d) Pursuant to rules adopted by the department, the department determines that:

      (A) Reasonable doubt exists as to the taxpayer’s liability for the assessment;

      (B) The taxpayer has presented documentation that the department considers sufficient to support canceling the tax, penalty or interest, or any portion thereof; and

      (C) The taxpayer has complied with all applicable reporting and filing requirements for all tax years for which the department maintains records.

      (2) When taxes are canceled, in whole or in part, under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall make an order canceling the tax, penalties and interest. The order shall be filed in the records of the department. Upon making the order, the department also shall cause to be canceled or released any lien of record in the counties which may have been filed and entered therein.

      (3) Before the department may cancel an assessment under subsection (1) of this section, the taxpayer to whom the assessment is issued shall provide any information the department deems necessary to verify the existence of one of the conditions under which the assessment may be canceled.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 314.415, the department may refund any payments made with respect to an assessment described in subsection (1) of this section. Interest shall be paid at the rate established under ORS 305.220 for a period beginning on the date the taxpayer requests the refund.

      (5) A taxpayer may appeal denial of a request for cancellation of assessment or refund to the Director of the Department of Revenue. The decision of the director is final and may not be appealed. [1987 c.758 §16; 1997 c.100 §1; 2017 c.278 §6]

 

      305.305 Procedure where deficiency based on federal or other state audit report; effect of appeal; interest suspension. (1) As used in this section, “appeal” means an appeal to the Internal Revenue Service or any federal court or an appeal to another state’s taxing authority or any state court having jurisdiction over the other state’s tax matters that are the subject of the appeal.

      (2) If a deficiency is based wholly or in part upon an Internal Revenue Service revenue agent’s report made upon any audit or adjustment of the person’s federal income tax return or upon an audit report of another state’s taxing authority, the following procedures shall apply:

      (a) If the person has filed a timely appeal from the deficiency asserted by the service or other state taxing authority, the person may file proof of the appeal with the Department of Revenue. If proof of the appeal is received before the tax is assessed, the deficiency shall be assessed without penalty for failure to pay the tax at the time the tax became due.

      (b) If the department assesses the deficiency before receipt of proof of the filing of a timely appeal, the person may file the proof with the department. If the proof is filed after the tax has been assessed with a penalty for failure to pay the tax at the time the tax became due, the penalty shall not be waived.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, filing of proof of a timely appeal under subsection (2) of this section shall extend the time for filing a complaint or petition with the tax court in accordance with this subsection. The person shall notify the department in writing within 30 days after the appeal is finally resolved. The department shall review the issues raised by the appeal and shall make a determination of the effect upon the person’s state income or excise tax liabilities. The department shall then issue a refund, notice of denial of refund or notice of assessment, as appropriate, to the person. If the person disagrees with the department’s action, the person may file a complaint or petition with the tax court within 90 days after the date of the department’s action as provided under ORS 305.404 to 305.560. Notwithstanding ORS 314.835 or any other law relating to confidentiality, the department may notify the magistrate division of the tax court if proof of a timely appeal is filed with the department or if the department determines that an appeal has been finally resolved.

      (4) Except as provided in ORS 314.440 (2), when the department receives proof of a timely appeal, the department shall suspend action to collect the deficiency until the issues are resolved.

      (5) If interest imposed by the federal government on a federal deficiency or partnership settlement agreement has been suspended under section 6601(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, interest imposed on a corresponding deficiency determined under ORS 305.265 and this section shall also be suspended. The suspension of interest imposed under ORS 305.265 shall be effective as of the date the federal interest is suspended and for the duration for which the federal interest is suspended.

      (6) Except as provided in ORS 314.415 (6), the provisions of this section shall constitute the exclusive remedy of a person whose notice of deficiency is based wholly or in part upon a federal revenue agent’s report or the audit report of another state’s taxing authority. [1989 c.414 §6; 1995 c.650 §29; 1997 c.325 §7; 1999 c.74 §2; 1999 c.90 §28a; 2001 c.660 §17; 2005 c.48 §3]

      (a) Means a business entity that, while operating substantially the same business as another entity that incurred a liability for taxes, interest or penalties administered by the Department of Revenue, has been converted to a different form of business entity from that of the entity that incurred the liability or has changed ownership from that of the entity that incurred the liability; and

      (b) Does not include a business entity that is converted to a different form or that has changed ownership solely because of a transfer of assets or because of a transfer of an interest of an investor who has no right to manage the business entity, including, but not limited to, the interest of:

      (A) A person that is solely a minority shareholder in a corporation;

      (B) A member of a manager-managed limited liability company; or

      (C) A limited partner of a limited partnership that does not participate in the control of the business of the limited partnership.

      (2) The department may transfer the liability for taxes, interest or penalties that are administered and collected by the department from the business entity that incurred the liability to a reorganized business entity and may assess those amounts against the reorganized business entity.

      (3) Factors the department may consider when determining if a business entity is a reorganized business entity include, but are not limited to, whether the business entity:

      (a) Operates from the same physical location as did the taxpayer owing the debt.

      (b) Provides the same services or manufactures the same products as did the taxpayer owing the debt.

      (c) Has one or more of the same:

      (5) Within 30 days from the date of notice of liability given under subsection (4) of this section, the reorganized business entity shall:

      (a) Pay the liability stated in the notice and any other penalty or interest related to that liability; or

      (b) Advise the department in writing of objections to the notice of liability and, if desired, request a conference. A conference requested under this paragraph shall be governed by those provisions of ORS 305.265 that govern a conference requested from a notice of deficiency under ORS 305.265. Notwithstanding ORS 314.835, 314.840 or 314.991, the department may disclose any information to the reorganized business entity that the department would be authorized to disclose to the business entity that incurred the liability.

      (6) After a determination of the issues raised in written objections made under subsection (5) of this section or after a conference, if a conference was requested, the department shall mail the reorganized business entity a letter affirming, canceling or adjusting the notice of liability. If the entity remains liable for an outstanding amount under this section, the letter shall be considered a notice of assessment and, within 90 days from the date the letter is mailed, the entity shall:

      (a) Pay the amount set forth in the notice of assessment; or

      (b) Appeal to the Oregon Tax Court in the manner provided for an appeal from a notice of assessment.

      (4)(a) If the department determines that any licensee or provider has neglected or refused to file any return or to pay any tax and that such person has not filed in good faith a petition before the department contesting the tax, and the department has been unable to obtain payment of the tax through other methods of collection, the Director of the Department of Revenue may, notwithstanding ORS 118.525, 314.835 or 314.840 or any similar provision of law, notify the agency and the person in writing.

      (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the agency shall refuse to reissue, renew or extend any license, contract or agreement until the agency receives a certificate issued by the department that the person is in good standing with respect to any returns due and taxes payable to the department as of the date of the certificate.

      (c) Upon the written request of the director and after a hearing and notice to the licensee as required under any applicable provision of law, the agency shall suspend the person’s license if the agency finds that the returns and taxes have not been filed or paid and that the licensee has not filed in good faith a petition before the department contesting the tax and the department has been unable to obtain payment of the tax through other methods of collection. For the purpose of the agency’s findings, the written representation to that effect by the department to the agency shall constitute prima facie evidence of the person’s failure to file returns or pay the tax. The department shall have the right to intervene in any license suspension proceeding.

      (d) Any license suspended under this subsection shall not be reissued or renewed until the agency receives a certificate issued by the department that the licensee is in good standing with respect to any returns due and taxes payable to the department as of the date of the certificate.

      (5) The department may enter into an installment payment agreement with a licensee or provider with respect to any unpaid tax, penalty and interest. The agreement shall provide for interest on the outstanding amount at the rate prescribed by ORS 305.220. The department may issue a provisional certificate of good standing pursuant to subsection (4)(b) and (d) of this section which shall remain in effect so long as the licensee or provider fully complies with the terms of the installment agreement. Failure by the licensee or provider to fully comply with the terms of the installment agreement shall render the agreement and the provisional certificate of good standing null and void, unless the department determines that the failure was due to reasonable cause. If the department determines that the failure was not due to reasonable cause, the total amount of the tax, penalty and interest shall be immediately due and payable, and the department shall notify any affected agency that the licensee or provider is not in good standing. The agency shall then take appropriate action under subsection (4)(b) and (d) of this section.

      (6) No contract or other agreement for the purpose of providing goods, services or real estate space to any agency shall be entered into, renewed or extended with any person, unless the person certifies in writing, under penalty of perjury, that the person is, to the best of the person’s knowledge, not in violation of any tax laws described in ORS 305.380 (4).

      (7) The certification under subsection (6) of this section shall be required for each contract and renewal or extension of a contract or may be provided on an annual basis. A certification shall not be required for a contract if the consideration for the goods, services or real estate space provided under the contract is no more than $1,000.

      (8)(a) The requirements of the certification under subsection (6) of this section shall be subject to the rules adopted by the department in accordance with this section.

      (b) The department may by rule exempt certain contracts from the requirements of subsection (6) of this section. [1987 c.843 §7; 1989 c.656 §1; 1997 c.99 §36]

The order shall specify the allowable uses of the confidential information and establish the conditions under which disclosure may be made to those individuals described in this section.

      (2) The confidential information may be disclosed to the following individuals only:

      (3) Before disclosure of information described in this section, each individual to whom disclosure of confidential information will be made shall execute a written acknowledgment of the confidential nature of the information and consent to be bound by the terms of the order of confidentiality, subject to judicial penalties for contempt. Such an acknowledgment shall be executed by any person to whom access to confidential information is actually given.

      (4) A written record shall be maintained by the Department of Revenue and any party to whom disclosure is made of the specific material disclosed and the identity of those individuals to whom access has been given, including the name and title of the individuals and the date each was approved to be given access.

      (5) The documents, and any copies of them, shall be marked “confidential” or in some way identified to be subject to limited access. Any copies of the original documents shall be reproduced in a way that makes them readily identifiable.

      (6) At the conclusion of the proceeding, all documents subject to the provisions of this section shall be returned to the person or agency that originally produced them.

[2005 c.224 §2]

 

      Note: 305.412 was added to and made a part of 305.404 to 305.560 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      305.415 Service of papers and process. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 305.404 to 305.560, the mailing by registered or certified mail of any pleading, decision, order, notice or process, other than a subpoena, in respect to proceedings before the court shall be sufficient service thereof. [1961 c.533 §25]

 

      305.418 When transmitted complaint or petition considered to be filed. (1) As used in this section, “private express carrier” has the meaning given that term in ORS 293.660.

      (2) Any complaint or petition that is required by law to be filed with the Oregon Tax Court, that is otherwise sufficient for filing and that is:

 

 

 

 

      (a) Transmitted through the United States mail or a private express carrier, shall be deemed filed on the date that it was deposited in the United States mail or dispatched via a private express carrier, as shown by a post-office cancellation mark or by any other record from the United States Postal Service or a private express carrier showing the date that the appealing party initiated mailing or dispatch.

      (b) Lost in transmission through the United States mail or a private express carrier, shall be deemed filed on the date it was deposited in the United States mail or dispatched via a private express carrier if the appealing party:

      (A) Can establish by evidence satisfactory to the tax court that the complaint or petition was deposited in the United States mail or dispatched via a private express carrier and was addressed correctly to the court; and

      (B) Files with the court a duplicate of the lost complaint or petition within 90 days after it was deposited in the United States mail or dispatched via a private express carrier. [1975 c.381 §2; 1979 c.689 §3; 1993 c.612 §3; 2005 c.225 §3; 2019 c.376 §1]

 

      305.419 Tax, penalty and interest payable before appeal; dispute as to nature of tax; how determined; waiver; refund. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, in any appeal from an order, act, omission or determination of the Department of Revenue involving a deficiency of taxes imposed upon or measured by net income, the tax assessed, and all penalties and interest due, shall be paid to the department on or before the filing of a complaint with the regular division of the Oregon Tax Court under ORS 305.560 or within 30 days after entry of an order specially designating a complaint for hearing in the regular division under ORS 305.501. If a dispute exists as to whether the matter involves a deficiency of taxes imposed upon or measured by net income, the tax assessed and all penalties and interest shall be paid within 30 days after entry of a decision or order finding that the matter involves a deficiency of taxes imposed upon or measured by net income. The complaint shall be filed as a claim for refund.

      (2) Penalty and interest due under subsection (1) of this section are the amounts stated in the order, notice of assessment, notice of refund denial or proposed adjustment under ORS 305.270 by the department from which the appeal is taken.

      (3) Where payment of the tax, penalty and interest would be an undue hardship, plaintiff may file an affidavit alleging undue hardship within the time described in subsection (1) of this section. A plaintiff’s failure to file an affidavit alleging hardship is not grounds for dismissal of the complaint, provided the plaintiff files the affidavit within 30 days after receiving notice of lack of an affidavit alleging undue hardship from the court. If the tax court finds undue hardship, the tax court judge may stay all or any part of the payment of tax, penalty and interest required under subsection (1) of this section. If the tax court judge finds no undue hardship, the tax court judge may grant the plaintiff up to 30 days from the date of determination to pay the tax, penalty and interest. Failure by the plaintiff to pay the tax, penalty and interest or to establish undue hardship will be cause for dismissing the complaint.

      (4) If, in any appeal to the Oregon Tax Court for which payment of tax, penalty and interest assessed is required before filing of a complaint, the tax court orders that all or any part of the amount paid be refunded by the department, the amount so ordered to be refunded shall bear interest at the rate established for refunds in ORS 305.220. Interest shall be computed from the date of payment to the department. [1982 s.s.1 c.29 §§2, 3; 1985 c.407 §1; 1995 c.650 §17; 1997 c.872 §19; 2015 c.45 §1]

 

      305.420 Issuance of subpoenas; administration of oaths; depositions. (1) The judge, a magistrate or the clerk of the tax court, on the request of any party to the proceeding, or the attorney of the party, shall issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of and the giving of testimony by witnesses, and subpoenas duces tecum requiring the production of any returns, books, papers, documents, correspondence and other evidence pertaining to the matter under inquiry at any designated place of hearing in the manner prescribed by law in civil actions in courts of this state.

      (2) Any employee of the court designated in writing for the purpose by the judge may administer oaths.

      (3) Any party to the proceeding may cause the depositions of witnesses residing within or without the state to be taken in the manner prescribed by law for like depositions in civil actions in courts of this state. To that end, the party may compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of returns, books, papers, documents, correspondence and other evidence pertaining to the matter under inquiry.

      (4) Subject to ORS 305.390 and 305.392, subpoenas in a proceeding involving the determination of the value of an industrial plant, as defined in ORS 308.408, for purposes of ad valorem property taxation, may be issued as provided in subsection (1) of this section. However, upon petition of the person subpoenaed, the court shall make an order determining if the evidence sought by the subpoena is relevant to the pending proceeding and, if requested by the person subpoenaed, an order as required in the interests of justice to protect the confidentiality of the information subpoenaed. [1961 c.533 §17; 1963 c.304 §1; 1981 c.139 §5; 1993 c.353 §6; 1995 c.650 §18; 2003 c.46 §5; 2005 c.345 §6]

 

      305.422 Waiver of penalty for failure to timely file property return. If a penalty under ORS 308.295 or 308.296 for the failure to timely file a real, combined or personal property return as required by ORS 308.290 is the subject of an appeal to the tax court, the court may waive the liability for all or a portion of the penalty upon a proper showing of good and sufficient cause. [2001 c.303 §5]

 

      305.425 Proceedings to be without jury and de novo; issues reviewable; rules of procedure. (1) All proceedings before the judge of the tax court shall be original, independent proceedings and shall be tried without a jury and de novo.

      (2) If a statute provides for an appeal to or a review by the court of an order, act, omission or determination of the Department of Revenue, a board of property tax appeals or of any other administrative agency, the proceeding shall be an original proceeding in the nature of a suit in equity to set aside such order or determination or correct the act or omission. The time within which the statute provides that the proceeding shall be brought is a period of limitations and is not jurisdictional.

      (3) All hearings and proceedings before the tax court judge shall be in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the court, which shall conform, as far as practical to the rules of equity practice and procedure in this state. [1961 c.533 §16; 1965 c.6 §3; 1967 c.78 §9; 1973 c.484 §7; 1977 c.870 §29; 1981 s.s. c.1 §23; 1995 c.650 §19; 1997 c.541 §60]

 

      305.427 Burden of proof in tax court proceedings. In all proceedings before the judge or a magistrate of the tax court and upon appeal therefrom, a preponderance of the evidence shall suffice to sustain the burden of proof. The burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking affirmative relief and the burden of going forward with the evidence shall shift as in other civil litigation. [1965 c.6 §5; 1995 c.650 §20]

 

      305.430 Hearings to be open to public; report of proceedings; exception; confidential information. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, hearings before the judge or a magistrate of the tax court shall be open to the public. All proceedings in the regular division of the tax court shall be reported unless waived by the parties with the consent of the court. The expense of reporting shall be paid by the state from the appropriation for the court. Proceedings before the magistrate division shall not be reported.

      (2) If information is confidential under ORS 308.411 (4) or by court order under ORS 305.420 (4), and is introduced into evidence in any hearing before the tax court, the court first shall make such order or orders as are necessary to protect the confidentiality of the information.

      (3) In any proceeding before a magistrate or before the tax court judge involving confidential business records, tax returns or documents containing trade secrets, upon motion of a party to the proceeding, the magistrate or judge may make such protective orders as may be necessary to protect the confidentiality of such records or the information contained therein. In determining whether such protective orders should be issued, the court shall weigh the harm suffered by the disclosing party against any benefit received by the public as a result of the disclosure. Complaints, pleadings and other filings containing confidential business record information, tax return information or trade secret information shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection.

      (4) In a matter involving a request for a protective order under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the decision of a magistrate of the tax court may be appealed to the regular division of the tax court and the magistrate may stay the case on the merits until the request for a protective order is resolved by the tax court judge or the Supreme Court. A decision of the tax court judge on a request for a protective order shall be a final order for purposes of appeal to the Supreme Court. The parties may appeal the issue of the protective order to the Supreme Court at any time after the protective order was granted or denied by the tax court judge. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court shall stay the case on the merits until a resolution of the protective order issue is determined by the Supreme Court.

(Appeals Procedure; Effect of Pendency of Appeal)

 

      305.560 Appeals procedure generally; procedure when taxpayer is not appellant; intervention. (1)(a) Except for an order, or portion thereof, denying the discretionary waiver of penalty or interest by the Department of Revenue, an appeal under ORS 305.275 may be taken by filing a complaint with the clerk of the Oregon Tax Court at its principal office at Salem, Oregon, within the time required under ORS 305.280.

      (b) The clerk of the tax court shall serve copies of all complaints and petitions on the Department of Revenue. Service upon the department shall be accomplished by the clerk of the tax court filing the copy of the complaint with the Director of the Department of Revenue. Except as otherwise provided by law, other service shall be accomplished as provided in the rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the tax court.

      (c)(A) The complaint shall be entitled in the name of the person filing the same as plaintiff and the Department of Revenue, county, taxpayer or other person or entity as defendant. If the complaint relates to value of property for ad valorem property tax purposes and the county has made the appraisal, the complaint shall be entitled in the name of the person filing the same as plaintiff and the county assessor as defendant.

      (B) If any, a copy of the order of the department or board of property tax appeals shall be attached to the complaint.

      (2) The complaint shall state the nature of the plaintiff’s interest, the facts showing how the plaintiff is aggrieved and directly affected by the order, act, omission or determination and the grounds upon which the plaintiff contends the order, act, omission or determination should be reversed or modified. A responsive pleading shall be required of the defendant.

      (3) In any case in which the taxpayer is not the appealing party, a copy of the complaint shall be served upon the taxpayer by the appealing party by certified mail within the period for filing an appeal, and an affidavit showing such service shall be filed with the clerk of the tax court. A copy of the order of the department, if any, shall be attached to the complaint. The taxpayer shall have the right to appear and be heard.

      (4)(a) At any time in the course of any appeal before the tax court, the department may intervene as a matter of right. A copy of any order or judgment issued by the tax court in any case in which the department is an intervenor shall be served upon the department in the manner provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (b) The tax court, in its discretion, may permit other interested persons to intervene by filing a complaint in such manner and under such conditions as the court may deem appropriate. [1977 c.870 §10; 1989 c.760 §3; 1991 c.459 §23; 1993 c.270 §16; 1995 c.650 §10; 1997 c.541 §71; 2005 c.225 §4]

 

      305.565 Stay of collection of taxes, interest and penalties pending appeal; exception; bond. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, proceedings for the collection of any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from an assessment of additional taxes imposed by ORS chapter 118, 310, 314, 316, 317, 318, 321 or this chapter shall be stayed by the taking or pendency of any appeal to the tax court.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the Department of Revenue may proceed to collect any taxes, interest or penalties described in subsection (1) of this section if the department determines that collection will be jeopardized if collection is delayed or that the taxpayer has taken a frivolous position in the appeal. For purposes of this subsection:

      (a) Collection of taxes, interest or penalties will be jeopardized if the taxpayer designs quickly to depart from the state or to remove the taxpayer’s property from the state, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partially ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax.

      (b) A taxpayer’s position in an appeal is frivolous if that position is of the kind described in ORS 316.992 (5).

      (3) No proceeding for the apportionment, levy or collection of taxes on any property shall be stayed by the taking or pendency of any appeal to the tax court, or from an order of the county board of property tax appeals or the Oregon Tax Court, unless the assessor or tax collector either as a party to the suit or an intervenor, requests a stay and it appears to the satisfaction of the court that a substantial public interest requires the issuance of a stay.

      (4) The tax court may, as a condition of a stay, require the posting of a bond sufficient to guarantee payment of the tax. Payment of taxes while appeal is pending shall not operate as a waiver of the appeal or of a right to refund of taxes found to be excessively charged or assessed. [1977 c.870 §11; 1982 s.s.1 c.29 §4; 1985 c.761 §9; 1991 c.567 §4; 1993 c.270 §18; 1995 c.650 §23; 1997 c.99 §§47,48; 1997 c.325 §13; 1997 c.541 §73]

 

      305.570 Standing to appeal to regular division of tax court; perfection of appeal. (1)(a) Any person, including a county assessor or county tax collector aggrieved by and affected by a written decision of a tax court magistrate issued under ORS 305.501, or any person seeking a remedy in the tax court provided by statute, other than as provided in ORS 305.275 (1), may appeal to the regular division of the Oregon Tax Court, and appeal shall be perfected in the manner provided in ORS 305.404 to 305.560.

      (b) Except for an appeal brought by a county assessor or county tax collector, the order being appealed under this subsection must affect the person or the property of the person making the appeal or property for which the person making the appeal holds an interest that obligates the person to pay taxes imposed on the property. As used in this paragraph, an interest that obligates the person to pay taxes includes a contract, lease or other intervening instrumentality.

      (2) A taxpayer or political subdivision affected by a determination of the Department of Revenue authorized under ORS 305.620 may appeal to the tax court as provided in ORS 305.620. [1977 c.870 §13; 1983 c.605 §3; 1983 c.749 §3; 1991 c.459 §29; 1993 c.18 §65; 1995 c.650 §24; 1997 c.541 §75; 1997 c.826 §§4,5; 1999 c.21 §11; 1999 c.340 §4]

 

      305.575 Authority of tax court to determine deficiency. In an appeal to the Oregon Tax Court from an assessment made under ORS 305.265, the tax court has jurisdiction to determine the correct amount of deficiency, even if the amount so determined is greater or less than the amount of the assessment determined by the Department of Revenue, and even if determined upon grounds other or different from those asserted by the department, provided that claim for such additional tax on other or different grounds is asserted by the department before or at the hearing or any rehearing of the case before the tax court. In the event such other or different grounds are asserted by the department, the opposing party shall be allowed additional time, not less than 10 days, within which to amend or otherwise plead thereto, which additional time, however, may be waived by stipulation of the parties. The order of the tax court shall be sufficient for the collection by the department of the entire amount found by the court to be owing and due. [1977 c.870 §21; 1995 c.650 §30]

 

(Constitutional Limits Upon Property Taxes; Effects; Determination)

 

      305.580 Exclusive remedies for certain determinations; priority of petitions. (1) The provisions of ORS 305.583, 305.585, 305.587 and 305.589 shall provide the exclusive remedy for determination of questions concerning:

      (a) The effect of the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution on taxes, fees, charges and assessments of units of government.

      (b) The authorized uses of the proceeds of bonded indebtedness described in section 11 (11)(d), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (2) A petition filed with the regular division of the Oregon Tax Court pursuant to ORS 305.583, 305.585, 305.587 or 305.589 shall have priority over all other cases pending before the regular division and shall be heard and decided as soon after coming to issue as is reasonably possible. [1991 c.459 §25; 1999 c.340 §8; 2003 c.195 §19]

 

      305.583 Interested taxpayer petitions for certain determinations; petition contents; manner and time for filing; classification notice requirements; bond proceed use notice requirements. (1) An interested taxpayer may petition the regular division of the Oregon Tax Court to determine a question described in ORS 305.580.

      (2)(a) For purposes of this section and a question described in ORS 305.580 (1)(a), “interested taxpayer” means a person that is subject to the tax, fee, charge or assessment in question.

      (b) For purposes of this section and a question described in ORS 305.580 (1)(b), “interested taxpayer” means a person that is subject to a tax, fee, charge or assessment that is pledged to secure or available for payment of bonded indebtedness described in section 11 (11)(d), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (3) The petition shall be filed and perfected in the following manner only:

      (a) The petitioner shall file a petition with the clerk of the tax court at its principal office in Salem, Oregon. The petition shall name as respondent the government unit that imposes the tax, fee, charge or assessment, that issues the bonded indebtedness or, in the case of an urban renewal agency, that receives the taxes. The filing in the tax court shall constitute the perfection of the petition. The clerk of the tax court shall serve the government unit by mailing a copy of the petition to the recording officer or chief administrative officer of the local government unit or to the Attorney General if the tax, fee, charge or assessment in question is imposed by the State of Oregon. The clerk also shall serve a copy of any petition naming a local government unit as respondent upon the Oregon Department of Justice.

      (b) The petition shall state the facts and grounds upon which the petitioner contends that the tax, fee, charge or assessment is affected by section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, or that a use of the proceeds of bonded indebtedness is not authorized. The case shall proceed thereafter in the manner provided for appeals concerning ad valorem property tax assessments. ORS 305.405 to 305.494 shall apply to such actions.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in subsections (5) to (8) of this section, in the case of a question regarding the effect of the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, on any tax, fee, charge or assessment that is imposed under a resolution or ordinance approved by the governing body of a local government unit, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the action of the governing body approving the ordinance or resolution, adopting a new ordinance or resolution or changing an existing ordinance or resolution under which the tax, fee, charge or assessment is imposed, if the resolution or ordinance includes a classification of the tax, fee, charge or assessment as subject to or not subject to section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. If the local government unit has not classified the tax, fee, charge or assessment, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the later of:

      (A) The last date, but no later than November 15, that the tax statements were mailed for the tax year in which the tax, fee, charge or assessment was imposed; or

      (B) The date of imposition of the tax, fee, charge or assessment on the petitioner.

      (b) If the local government unit adopts an ordinance or resolution classifying all or any of the taxes, fees, charges or assessments it imposes as subject to or not subject to section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, as described in ORS 310.145, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the governing body adopts the ordinance or resolution.

      (5) In the case of a question concerning any tax, fee, charge or assessment that is characterized by the local government unit as an assessment for local improvements, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the local government unit gives notice of its intention to characterize the charge as an assessment for local improvements. Notice may be given to affected property owners by the local government unit either when a local improvement district is formed, in a notice of intent to assess given by the local government unit or by other individual notice prior to assessment. Notice shall be given no later than the date the assessment is imposed. Notice given as provided under this subsection is in lieu of the notice required under subsection (9) of this section.

      (6) In the case of a question concerning any taxes levied to pay principal and interest on bonded indebtedness approved by the governing body of a local government unit, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the date the issuance of the bonded indebtedness was approved by the governing body of the local government unit if the resolution or ordinance of the governing body authorizing issuance of the bonded indebtedness includes a classification of the bonded indebtedness as subject to or not subject to the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. If the local government unit has not classified the bonded indebtedness, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the date specified in subsection (4)(a) of this section.

      (7) In the case of a question concerning any taxes levied to pay principal and interest on bonded indebtedness not subject to the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, that was approved by the electors of the local government unit at an election held on or after September 29, 1991, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the date of the election at which the question of issuing the bonded indebtedness was approved by the electors of the local government unit.

      (8) In the case of a question concerning the effect of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, on any tax, fee, charge or assessment imposed by the state, the petition shall be filed within 60 days after the first imposition of the tax, fee, charge or assessment by a state agency. For purposes of this subsection, a tax, fee, charge or assessment shall be considered imposed when it is due as provided by statute or when the state agency notifies a person that the tax, fee, charge or assessment is due.

      (9) A local government unit:

      (a) Shall give notice of its adoption of an ordinance or resolution classifying any of its taxes, fees, charges or assessments as not being subject to the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, by publishing, within 15 days after adoption of the ordinance or resolution, an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the local government unit is located or, if there is no newspaper of general circulation, in a newspaper of general circulation in a contiguous county.

      (b) May give notice of its adoption of an ordinance or resolution specifying the authorized uses of the proceeds of bonded indebtedness by publishing, within 15 days after adoption of the ordinance or resolution, an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the local government unit is located or, if there is no newspaper of general circulation, in a newspaper of general circulation in a contiguous county.

      (10) A notice described in subsection (9) of this section shall:

      (a) Appear in the general news section of the newspaper, not in the classified advertisements;

      (b) Measure at least three inches square;

      (c) Be printed in a type size at least equal to 8-point type; and

      (d) State that the local government unit has adopted a resolution or ordinance:

      (A) Classifying one or more of its taxes, fees, charges or assessments as not being subject to the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, that the reader may contact a designated individual within the local government unit to obtain a copy of the ordinance or resolution and that judicial review of the classification of the taxes, fees, charges or assessments may be sought within 60 days of the date of the resolution or ordinance; or

      (B) Specifying the authorized uses of the proceeds of bonded indebtedness, that the reader may contact a designated individual within the local government unit to obtain a copy of the ordinance or resolution and that judicial review of the specification of authorized uses may be sought within 60 days of the date of the resolution or ordinance.

      (11) An ordinance or resolution that results in a mere change in the amount of a tax, fee, charge or assessment and does not result in a change in the characteristics or attributes of the tax, fee, charge or assessment, or contain a change in purpose to which the revenue is applied, may not be considered a change that may result in a proceeding commenced under subsection (4) of this section.

      (12) In the case of a question concerning the authorized uses of the proceeds of bonded indebtedness, the petition must be filed within 60 days after the adoption of the ordinance or resolution described in subsection (9)(b) of this section or, if the governing body has not published the notice described in subsection (9)(b) of this section, the petition must be filed within 180 days after the questioned use of the proceeds is made. [1991 c.459 §26; 1993 c.18 §66; 1993 c.270 §19; 1995 c.79 §110; 1995 c.650 §73; 1997 c.541 §§78,78a,79,79a; 1999 c.340 §9; 2003 c.195 §20; 2005 c.225 §5; 2005 c.443 §18; 2011 c.256 §3]

 

      305.585 Local government petitions concerning taxes of another local government under 1990 Measure 5; manner and time for filing. (1) A local government unit may petition the regular division of the Oregon Tax Court to determine whether the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution apply to a tax, fee, charge or assessment of another local government unit if the boundaries of both units include common territory and if the petitioning local government unit will lose or has lost revenue because of the tax, fee, charge or assessment that is the subject of the petition.

      (2) The petitioner shall file a petition with the clerk of the tax court at its principal office in Salem, Oregon. The petition shall name the local government unit that imposes the tax, fee, charge or assessment as respondent. Such filing in the tax court shall constitute the perfection of the petition. The clerk of the tax court shall serve the respondent local government unit by mailing a copy of the petition to the recording officer or chief administrative officer of the local government unit. The clerk also shall serve a copy of the petition upon the Oregon Department of Justice.

      (3) The petition shall state the facts and grounds upon which the petitioner contends that the tax, fee, charge or assessment at issue is not subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. The case shall proceed thereafter in the manner provided for appeals concerning ad valorem property tax assessments. ORS 305.405 to 305.494 shall apply to such actions.

      (4) The petition shall be filed not later than 30 days after the date the respondent local government unit filed its certificate required under ORS 310.060 with the county assessor. [1991 c.459 §26a; 1995 c.79 §111; 1995 c.650 §74; 1999 c.340 §10; 2005 c.225 §6]

 

      305.586 Legislative findings; policy on remedies for misspent bond proceeds. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Capital construction” has the meaning given that term in ORS 310.140.

      (b) “Capital costs” has the meaning given that term in ORS 310.140.

      (c) “Capital improvements” has the meaning given that term in ORS 310.140.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds that, when general obligation bonds are issued by a government unit to finance capital costs or to finance the costs of capital construction or capital improvements, subjecting the taxes imposed to pay the principal and interest on that bonded indebtedness to the limits of Article XI, section 11b (1), of the Oregon Constitution, reduces the credit quality of the bonds, injures bondholders and increases the cost of borrowing for all local governments in Oregon. The Legislative Assembly also finds that it is in the best interests of the State of Oregon and local governments in Oregon to ensure that, if a local government body expends proceeds from the bonds for other than capital costs, capital construction or capital improvements, whichever is an authorized use of proceeds of the bonds, the holders of the bonds, who are innocent with regard to the expenditure, will not suffer impairment of their security and interest in the bonds as a result.

      (3) It is the policy of the State of Oregon and a matter of statewide concern that, notwithstanding ORS 305.587 (1) and 305.589 (8), if in a proceeding commenced under ORS 305.583 or 305.589, the Oregon Tax Court finds that the proceeds of general obligation bonds issued for capital construction or capital improvements as defined in Article XI, section 11 (13), of the Oregon Constitution, or general obligation bonds issued for capital costs, as defined in Article XI, section 11L, of the Oregon Constitution, have been expended for purposes other than capital costs or the costs of capital construction or capital improvements, the court shall endeavor, to the fullest extent practicable and consistent with equitable principles, to fashion a remedy that does not impair the security or value of the bonds to the bondholders and does not prejudice the ability of the local government body to satisfy its obligations under the bonds.

      (4) In addition, the court shall fashion any remedy in a manner that takes into account the financial capacity and practical alternatives available to the local government body, and shall ensure that the remedy is proportional to, and restricted to correcting the amount of, any unlawful expenditure of bond proceeds. To the fullest extent possible, the court shall avoid any remedy that either invalidates, in whole or in part, the bonds or taxes levied or to be levied for payment of the bonds, or that makes any amount of the bonds for which the proceeds lawfully were expended subject to the limits of Article XI, section 11b (1), of the Oregon Constitution. [1997 c.171 §5; 2013 c.491 §7]

 

      305.587 Tax court findings; orders; refunds; bond measure construction; other relief. (1) If, in a proceeding commenced under ORS 305.583, the regular division of the Oregon Tax Court finds that a challenged tax, fee, charge or assessment is subject to the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the tax court may:

      (a) Order the government unit to make refunds to petitioners of any part of the challenged tax, fee, charge or assessment imposed on or after the date that is 90 days before the date the petition was filed and that was collected in excess of the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. The tax court may not order refunds if the government unit previously had obtained a judgment of the tax court or the Oregon Supreme Court under ORS 305.589, that the tax, fee, charge or assessment in question was not subject to the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (b) Order such other relief as it considers appropriate, including cancellation of taxes imposed but not collected, but such relief shall have prospective effect only. In cases involving local government units, a copy of the tax court’s order shall be served upon the assessor of the county or counties in which the local government unit is located at the same time the order is served upon the parties.

      (2) If the tax court orders a unit of government to make refunds of any tax, fee, charge or assessment that was imposed and collected in excess of the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the government unit shall do so out of the resources of the government unit. No refund so ordered shall be paid from the unsegregated tax collections account. The assessor shall not be required to recompute the amount of tax due from any property or property owner with respect to the tax, fee, charge or assessment that is the subject of the order for any tax year for which a tax statement has been delivered under ORS 311.250.

      (3) If, in a proceeding commenced under ORS 305.585, the tax court finds that a tax, fee, charge or assessment is not subject to the limits of section 11 or 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the tax court may order such relief as it considers appropriate, but such relief shall have prospective effect only. In cases involving local government units, a copy of the tax court’s order shall be served upon the assessor of the county or counties in which the local government unit is located at the same time the order is served upon the parties. The assessor shall not be required to recompute the amount of tax due from any property or property owner with respect to the tax, fee, charge or assessment that is the subject of the order for any tax year for which a tax statement has been delivered under ORS 311.250.

      (4) For purposes of this section, taxes, fees, charges or assessments are deemed imposed when the statement or bill for the taxes, fees, charges or assessments is mailed.

      (5) In the case of a question concerning the authorized uses of the proceeds of bonded indebtedness, the tax court shall construe the provisions of the measure authorizing the bonded indebtedness and the use of the proceeds liberally to allow the government unit to provide the facilities or services approved by the voters.

      (6) If, in a proceeding commenced under ORS 305.583, the regular division of the tax court finds that a use of the proceeds of bonded indebtedness is not authorized by the applicable law, the tax court may prohibit the expenditure or proceed in accordance with ORS 305.586.

UNIFORM REGULATIONS AND

FORMS

Whenever any two or more party states, or subdivisions of party states, have uniform or similar provisions of law relating to an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales or use tax, the commission may adopt uniform regulations for any phase of the administration of such law, including assertion of jurisdiction to tax, or prescribing uniform tax forms.

      2. Prior to the adoption of any regulation, the commission shall:

ARTICLE VIII

INTERSTATE AUDITS

 

      1. This Article shall be in force only in those party states that specifically provide therefor by statute.

      2. Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records or other documents may request the commission to perform the audit on its behalf. In responding to the request, the commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise. The commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit. The commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.

      3. The commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, document, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit. If the person is not within the jurisdiction, he may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the commission within the state of which he is a resident: provided that such state has adopted this Article.

      4. The commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this Article and any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court. If the party or subject matter on account of which the commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the state or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the state in which the object of the order being sought is situated. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to courts in a state that has adopted this Article.

      5. The commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the commission.

      6. Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this Article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions or the United States. Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the states or subdivisions on whose account the commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such states or subdivisions. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law.

      7. Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to law for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party states or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this Article.

      8. In no event shall the commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit.

      9. As used in this Article, “tax,” in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes.

 

ARTICLE IX

ARBITRATION

 

      1. Whenever the commission finds a need for settling disputes concerning apportionment and allocations by arbitration, it may adopt a regulation placing this Article in effect, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII.

      2. The commission shall select and maintain an arbitration panel composed of officers and employees of state and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration.

      3. Whenever the laws of the party state or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of ORS 314.605 to 314.675, the taxpayer, by written notice to the commission and to each party state or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if he is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the state or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject him to double or multiple taxation by two or more party states or subdivisions thereof. Each party state and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.

      4. The arbitration board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the commission’s arbitration panel. If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the arbitration panel. The two persons selected for the board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the board. If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the arbitration panel. No member of a board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if he is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding. Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph.

      5. The board may sit in any state or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the state of the taxpayer’s incorporation, residence or domicile, in any state where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it.

      6. The board shall give due notice of the times and places of its hearings. The parties shall be entitled to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The board shall act by majority vote.

      7. The board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony. Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the board. In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state in which the board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt. The provisions of this paragraph apply only in states that have adopted this Article.

      8. Unless the parties otherwise agree the expenses and other costs of the arbitration shall be assessed and allocated among the parties by the board in such manner as it may determine. The commission shall fix a schedule of compensation for members of arbitration boards and of other allowable expenses and costs. No officer or employee of a state or local government who serves as a member of a board shall be entitled to compensation therefor unless he is required on account of his service to forego the regular compensation attaching to his public employment, but any such board member shall be entitled to expenses.

      9. The board shall determine the disputed apportionment or allocation and any matters necessary thereto. The determinations of the board shall be final for purposes of making the apportionment or allocation, but for no other purpose.

      10. The board shall file with the commission and with each tax agency represented in the proceeding: the determination of the board; the board’s written statement of its reasons therefor; the record of the board’s proceedings; and any other documents required by the arbitration rules of the commission to be filed.

      11. The commission shall publish the determinations of boards together with the statements of the reasons therefor.

      12. The commission shall adopt and publish rules of procedure and practice and shall file a copy of such rules and of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.

      13. Nothing contained herein shall prevent at any time a written compromise of any matter or matters in dispute, if otherwise lawful, by the parties to the arbitration proceeding.

 

ARTICLE X

ENTRY INTO FORCE AND

WITHDRAWAL

 

      1. This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof. The commission shall arrange for notification of all party states whenever there is a new enactment of the compact.

      2. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.

      3. No proceeding commenced before an arbitration board prior to the withdrawal of a state and to which the withdrawing state or any subdivision thereof is a party shall be discontinued or terminated by the withdrawal, nor shall the board thereby lose jurisdiction over any of the parties to the proceeding necessary to make a binding determination therein.

 

ARTICLE XI

      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:

      (a) Affect the power of any state or subdivision thereof to fix rates of taxation.

      (c) Withdraw or limit the jurisdiction of any state or local court or administrative officer or body with respect to any person, corporation or other entity or subject matter, except to the extent that such jurisdiction is expressly conferred by or pursuant to this compact upon another agency or body.

ARTICLE XII

CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY

 

      This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

The commission shall limit the number of entities to be listed on the form to conform to the department’s notice unless it determines that the number of eligible entities justifies adding a page to the form.

      (2) Any new entity added to the list must, in the judgment of the commission, have a high probability of meeting the requirement in ORS 305.720 (5). [1989 c.987 §7a; 2007 c.822 §2]

      (1) The entity supports private charitable causes or engages in public activities that are consistent with policies and programs of the state and:

      (a) Checkoff resources are used to augment existing programs or provide new funding to related activities of proven value;

      (b) Checkoff funds are not to be used to meet the administrative expenses of the entity;

      (d) After checkoff resources are received by the entity, the entity shows a pattern over several years of increasing its total revenues from other than checkoff sources or reaches the level where no more than 50 percent of its revenues are from checkoff sources.

      (a) Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to contributions and gifts to charitable and governmental entities).

      (5) The entity received $25,000 or more in checkoff contributions in at least one of the two tax years immediately preceding the tax year for which it is to be listed on the Oregon income tax return. This subsection does not apply if the entity has not been included on the Oregon personal income tax return for each of the two tax years immediately preceding the tax year for which determination for purposes of this subsection is being made.

      305.723 Eligibility roster. (1) In the event that one or more entities are certified and placed on the eligibility roster under ORS 305.715 but not all entities can be included on the Oregon individual income tax return forms because of space limitations, the Oregon Charitable Checkoff Commission shall, prior to determining the entities to be listed on the eligibility roster for the ensuing year, identify those entities that have been included on the tax forms for two or more years.

      (2) To the extent there are entities on the eligibility roster that have not been form listed, the commission shall direct the Department of Revenue to remove from the tax forms for the next year those entities that have been included on the tax forms for two or more years.

      (3)(a) The identified entities shall be removed from inclusion on the tax forms based on the number of calendar years for which the entities have been included on the forms, with entities that have been included on the forms for the greatest number of years being removed first.

      (b) If identified entities have been included on the tax forms for an equal number of years and space limitations require the removal of some, but not all, of the entities identified in subsection (1) of this section, in order to permit inclusion of entities from the eligibility roster on the tax forms for the next year, the commission shall direct the department to remove the entity or entities garnering the smallest average amount of donations for the years that the entity or entities appeared on the tax forms.

      (4) If an entity removed from form listing under subsection (3) of this section continues to meet the eligibility requirements under ORS 305.720, an entity removed from the charitable checkoff portion of the tax forms shall be placed at the end of the eligibility roster for form listing in succeeding tax years and shall be considered to be an entity that has not been form listed for purposes of subsection (2) of this section. [2007 c.822 §4]
