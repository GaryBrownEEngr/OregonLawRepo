SUPERVISION OF PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATION BY DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE

 

      306.113 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that for the property tax system to function appropriately it is essential that administration be results-based, innovative and efficient. Any direction to, or review of, county administration by the State of Oregon shall carry out this finding. [1997 c.782 §1]

 

      Note: 306.113 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 306 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      306.115 General supervision over property tax system; correction of assessment or tax rolls. (1) The Department of Revenue shall exercise general supervision and control over the system of property taxation throughout the state. The department may do any act or give any order to any public officer or employee that the department deems necessary in the administration of the property tax laws so that all properties are taxed or are exempted from taxation according to the statutes and Constitutions of the State of Oregon and of the United States. Among other acts or orders deemed necessary by the department in exercising its supervisory powers, the department may order the correction of clerical errors, errors in valuation or the correction of any other kind of error or omission in an assessment or tax roll as provided under subsections (2) to (4) of this section.

      (2) The department may order a change or correction to the assessment or tax roll for the current tax year applicable to all real or personal property of the same class or in the same area if the order of the department is mailed not later than October 15 of the current tax year.

      (3) The department may order a change or correction applicable to a separate assessment of property to the assessment or tax roll for the current tax year and for either of the two tax years immediately preceding the current tax year if for the year to which the change or correction is applicable the department discovers reason to correct the roll which, in its discretion, it deems necessary to conform the roll to applicable law without regard to any failure to exercise a right of appeal.

      (4) Before ordering a change or correction to the assessment or tax roll under subsection (3) of this section, the department may determine whether any of the conditions specified in subsection (3) of this section exist in a particular case. If the department determines that one of the conditions specified does exist, the department shall hold a conference to determine whether to order a change or correction in the roll.

      (5) For purposes of this section, “current tax year” means the tax year in which the need for the change or correction is brought to the attention of the department.

      (6) The remedies provided under this section are in addition to all other remedies provided by law. [1983 c.605 §1; 1985 c.613 §18; 1987 c.656 §1; 1989 c.171 §42; 1991 c.5 §20; 1991 c.459 §32; 1995 c.650 §66; 1997 c.541 §89]

      (2) Upon request pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the Governor shall consult with the Director of the Department of Revenue to determine whether to declare a property tax assessment services emergency, a property tax collection services emergency or both.

      (a) Declare the existence of a property tax assessment services emergency, a property tax collection services emergency or both in the county; or

      (b) Issue a determination that the county’s fiscal situation does not cause the county to provide a less than minimally adequate level of property tax assessment services or property tax collection services, as applicable.

      (4) As soon as practicable after declaration of an emergency under subsection (3)(a) of this section and after consultation with the tax assessor and tax collector of the county, the Department of Revenue shall provide services in the county to the extent necessary to ensure a minimally adequate level of property tax assessment services, property tax collection services or both to all municipal corporations in the county.

      (5)(a) When an emergency is declared in a county pursuant to subsection (3)(a) of this section, the department shall immediately:

      (d) If the amounts received by the department under paragraph (c) of this subsection are less than the department’s stated costs for the period covered by the statement submitted under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the department shall seek reimbursement of the remaining costs, and such additional spending authority as the department considers necessary to carry out its duties under this section, from the Emergency Board.

      (6) At any time after declaration of an emergency pursuant to subsection (3)(a) of this section, the governing body of the county or the director may request that the Governor, after consultation with the director, issue a determination pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section.

      (7) The county shall resume providing property tax assessment services and property tax collection services, as applicable, to all municipal corporations in the county on the earlier of:

      (b) The Legislative Assembly creates property tax exemptions and special assessments, but cities, counties and special districts bear the cost of those exemptions in forgone property tax revenues.

      (c) The demand for additional property tax exemptions and special assessments is likely to increase.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that adverse consequences to cities, counties and special districts may be eliminated by:

      (a) Providing state funding for new exemptions and special assessments or new expansions of existing exemptions and special assessments; or

      (b) Reducing or eliminating other existing exemptions at the time exemptions are created or expanded. [1999 c.821 §1]

 

      Note: 306.350 to 306.359 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 306 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      306.353 Property tax expenditures to be funded. (1) If, for tax years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, a new property tax expenditure is created, or an existing property tax expenditure is expanded, 50 percent of the amount of the property tax revenues of a city, county or special district that are forgone as a result of the new expenditure or expansion shall be funded by amounts appropriated to the Property Tax Expenditure Funding Account established under ORS 306.356.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies:

      (a) Only to the operating taxes, as defined in ORS 310.055, of the city, county or special district.

      (b) To the extent that the legislative Act creating the new expenditure or expansion also did not offset the loss of revenue by repealing or restricting one or more property tax expenditures that were in effect for the tax year immediately prior to the tax year in which the new expenditure or expansion first applies.

      (3) As used in ORS 306.353 to 306.359:

      (a) “Property tax expenditure” or “expenditure” means a property tax exemption or special assessment of the assessed value of property for ad valorem property tax purposes.

      (b) “Special district” does not include a taxing district that imposes property taxes for the purpose of funding the public school system.

      (4) Legislation that extends the applicability or operative period of a property tax expenditure is not subject to the provisions of ORS 306.353 to 306.359.

      (5) Legislation that authorizes a local taxing district to exempt a class of property from the taxes of that local taxing district is not subject to the provisions of ORS 306.353 to 306.359. [1999 c.821 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 306.350.

 

      306.356 Property Tax Expenditure Funding Account. The Property Tax Expenditure Funding Account is created in the General Fund. Amounts appropriated to the Property Tax Expenditure Funding Account for the biennium are continuously appropriated to the Department of Revenue for the purpose of making property tax expenditure funding payments as provided in ORS 306.359. [1999 c.821 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 306.350.

 

      306.359 Procedures for determining property tax expenditure funding payments. (1)(a) As soon as is practicable after the end of the regular session of the Legislative Assembly, the Department of Revenue shall determine the new expenditures and expansions that are subject to the funding requirements of ORS 306.353.

      (b) If an expansion of an existing property tax expenditure is subject to the funding requirements of ORS 306.353, the department shall calculate a cost adjustment factor. The factor shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the estimated statewide amount of forgone property taxes attributable to the expenditure for the year for which the determination is being made minus the estimated statewide amount of forgone property taxes attributable to the expenditure for the tax year immediately prior to the expansion. The denominator shall be the estimated statewide amount of forgone property taxes attributable to the expenditure for the year for which the determination is being made.

      (c) The department shall distribute to each county assessor a list of:

      (A) The expenditures that are subject to the funding requirements of ORS 306.353 because the expenditures are new expenditures; and

      (B) The expenditures that are subject to the funding requirements of ORS 306.353 because the expenditures are newly expanded expenditures, along with each newly expanded expenditure’s corresponding cost adjustment factor.

      (2) Each county assessor shall estimate the amount of forgone property taxes of the county and of each city and special district in the county for each expenditure listed by the department. If a cost adjustment factor is applicable to the expenditure, the county assessor shall multiply the forgone property tax attributable to the expenditure by the expenditure’s cost adjustment factor. After taking into account cost adjustment factors, the county assessor shall determine the total amount of forgone property taxes from expenditures listed by the department in subsection (1)(c) of this section and shall certify the total amount so determined for the county and for each city and special district in the county to the department. Certification shall be made on or before October 25 of the tax year.

      (3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the department shall pay 50 percent of the amounts certified by the county assessor to the county and to the cities and special districts in the county.

      (4) If payments are being made for the first fiscal year of the biennium, the department shall use no more than 50 percent of the Property Tax Expenditure Funding Account balance to make payments under this section.

      (5) If the amount of moneys available to make payments under this section is less than the total amount being certified by all county assessors, the payments made under subsection (3) of this section shall be proportionally reduced so that the state does not accrue a debt in excess of the amount available for payment. [1999 c.821 §4]
