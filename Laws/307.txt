[2001 c.422 §5]

 

      307.158 Continued exemption for former cemetery or crematory land used for exempt low income housing; application; disqualification; additional taxes. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 92.095, 307.155 and 311.411, if land that is exempt under ORS 307.150 ceases to be used or held exclusively for cemetery or crematory purposes, the additional taxes that would otherwise be due under ORS 307.155 (2) shall remain a potential tax liability that is not imposed if:

      (a) As of the date of sale or other transfer of title to the land, the land is being used or held for the purpose of providing low income housing that will be exempt from ad valorem property taxation under ORS 307.515 to 307.523 or 307.540 to 307.548; and

      (b) All other requirements set forth in subsections (2) to (5) of this section are met.

      (2) At the time of recording the deed to the land with the county clerk, the owner of the land shall file with the assessor of the county, and the governing body of the city or county that adopted the low income housing exemption, as applicable, in which the land is located a notice of intent:

      (9) The amount of additional taxes determined to be due under this section may be paid to the tax collector prior to the completion of the next general property tax roll, pursuant to ORS 311.370.

The claim must contain statements, verified by the oath or affirmation of the president or other proper officer of the institution or organization, that:

      (A) List all real property claimed to be exempt and show the purpose for which the real property is used; and

      (B) Cite the statutes under which exemption for personal property is claimed.

      (b) If the ownership of all property, other than property described in ORS 307.110 (3)(h), included in the claim filed with the county assessor for a prior year remains unchanged, a new claim is not required.

      (b)(A) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a claimant that demonstrates good and sufficient cause for failing to file a timely claim, is a first-time filer or is a public entity described in ORS 307.090 may file a claim under this section for the five tax years prior to the current tax year:

      (i) Within 60 days after the date on which the county assessor mails notice of additional taxes owing under ORS 311.206 for the property to which the claim filed under this subparagraph pertains; or

      (ii) At any time if no notice is mailed.

      (B) A claim filed under this paragraph must be accompanied by a late filing fee of the greater of $200, or one-tenth of one percent of the real market value as of the most recent assessment date of the property to which the claim pertains, multiplied by the number of prior tax years for which exemption is claimed.

      (c) If a claim filed under this subsection is not accompanied by the late filing fee or if the late filing fee is not otherwise paid, an exemption may not be allowed for the tax years sought by the claim. A claim may be filed under this subsection notwithstanding that there are no grounds for hardship as required for late filing under ORS 307.475.

      (d) The value of the property used to determine the late filing fee under this subsection and the determination of the county assessor relative to a claim of good and sufficient cause are appealable in the same manner as other acts of the county assessor.

      (e) A late filing fee collected under this subsection must be deposited in the county general fund.

      (3)(a) In a claim for exemption of property described in ORS 307.110 (3)(h), the county or city, town or other municipal corporation or political subdivision of this state that is filing the claim must substantiate that the property is used for affordable housing or that it is leased or rented to persons of lower income, as applicable.

      (b) A claim filed under this subsection must be filed annually on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue.

      (4) As used in this section:

      (B) Did not receive notice from the county assessor on or before December 1 of the tax year for which exemption is claimed regarding the potential property tax liability of the property.

      (b)(A) “Good and sufficient cause” means an extraordinary circumstance beyond the control of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s agent or representative that causes the failure to file a timely claim.

      (B) “Good and sufficient cause” does not include hardship, reliance on misleading information unless the information is provided by an authorized tax official in the course of the official’s duties, lack of knowledge, oversight or inadvertence.

      (c) “Ownership” means legal and equitable title.

      (5)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if an institution or organization owns property that is exempt from taxation under a provision of law listed in subsection (1) of this section and fails to file a timely claim for exemption under subsection (1) of this section for additions or improvements to the exempt property, the additions or improvements may nevertheless qualify for exemption.

      (b) The organization must file a claim for exemption with the county assessor to have the additions or improvements to the exempt property be exempt from taxation. The claim must:

      (A) Describe the additions or improvements to the exempt property;

      (c) Upon the county assessor’s receipt of a completed claim and late filing fee, the assessor shall determine for each tax year for which exemption is sought whether the additions or improvements that are the subject of the claim would have qualified for exemption had a timely claim been filed under subsection (1) of this section. Any property that would have qualified for exemption had a timely claim been filed under subsection (1) of this section is exempt from taxation for each tax year for which the property would have qualified.

      (d) A claim for exemption under this subsection may be filed only for tax years for which the time for filing a claim under subsections (1) and (2)(a) of this section has expired. A claim filed under this subsection, however, may serve as the claim required under subsection (1) of this section for the current tax year.

      (e) A late filing fee collected under this subsection must be deposited in the county general fund.

      (6) For each tax year for which an exemption granted pursuant to subsection (2) or (5) of this section applies:

      (a) Any tax, or interest attributable thereto, that was paid with respect to the property that is declared exempt from taxation must be refunded. Refunds must be made without interest from the unsegregated tax collections account established under ORS 311.385.

      (b) Any tax, or interest attributable thereto, that remains unpaid as of the date the exemption is granted must be abated.

      (7) If an institution or organization owns property that is exempt from taxation under a provision of law listed in subsection (1) of this section and changes the use of the property to a use that would not entitle the property to exemption from taxation, the institution or organization must notify the county assessor of the change to a taxable use within 30 days.

      (5)(a) If the owner or person in possession or control of a solar project that has entered into an agreement under this section fails to pay the fee as required under this section, the property constituting the solar project is not exempt for the following property tax year and shall be assessed and taxed as other similar property is assessed and taxed.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the property shall be exempt for the following property tax year upon payment, within one year after the date of delinquency, of the delinquent fee plus interest at the rate prescribed in ORS 311.505 (2).

      (7)(a) Property constituting a solar project that has received an exemption under ORS 285C.350 to 285C.370 or 307.123 for any property tax year is not eligible to pay a fee in lieu of property taxes under this section.

      (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to property constituting a solar project that was the subject of an application filed pursuant to ORS 285C.350 to 285C.370 if the property did not receive the exemption for any property tax year. The election to pay the fee in lieu of property taxes for property described in this paragraph is not a disqualifying event. [2015 c.571 §1; 2019 c.628 §1]

(Nonprofit Corporation Housing for Elderly Persons)

 

      307.241 Policy. The purpose of ORS 307.241 to 307.248 is to assist private nonprofit corporations to provide permanent housing, recreational and social facilities, and care to elderly persons. The Legislative Assembly finds that the housing and related facilities furnished by private nonprofit corporations provide inherent benefits that justify the funded property tax exemption provided by ORS 307.241 to 307.248. [1977 c.411 §1; 2005 c.94 §32]

 

      307.242 Property of nonprofit corporation providing housing to elderly persons; necessity of filing claim to secure exemption. (1) Upon compliance with this section, whenever a corporation, as described in ORS 307.375, is receiving or has received any federal or state financial assistance, such as a loan, mortgage insurance, aid to construction, rent supplement or otherwise, under the following federal or state laws, the property owned or being purchased by that corporation in actual use for corporate purposes or in the process of construction for use for corporate purposes on January 1 of the assessment year is exempt from ad valorem taxation:

      (a) Section 202 of Title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701q).

      (b) Section 236 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-1).

      (c) Section 231 of Title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715v).

      (d) Section 101 of Title I of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701s) or section 8 of Title II of the National Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f), providing rent supplement or housing assistance payments.

      (e) ORS 456.515 to 456.725 and 458.505 to 458.515.

      (2) A corporation claiming the exemption under subsection (1) of this section shall file with the county assessor, on forms prescribed by the Department of Revenue and supplied by the assessor, a written claim therefor in duplicate on or before April 1 of each assessment year for which the exemption is claimed. If the claim for any year is not filed within the time specified, the exemption may not be allowed on the assessment roll for that year. In addition to any other matters prescribed by the Department of Revenue to be contained in or accompany the claim, the claim shall:

      (a) Declare or be accompanied by a declaration that the corporation meets the requirements of ORS 307.375 and that the property meets the requirements of ORS 307.243 (1);

      (b) Describe or be accompanied by a description of the federal financial assistance the corporation is receiving or has received;

      (c) Contain or be accompanied by a statement showing in detail the sources and amounts of all income received by the corporation and the basis for rental amounts charged for occupancy of the facilities; and

      (d) Be signed by the taxpayer subject to the penalties for false swearing.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) If the property qualifies for exemption on or after March 1 and before July 1, the claim may be filed within 30 days after the date of qualification.

      (b) A statement may be filed under this section at any time prior to September 15 of the assessment year for which exemption is first desired. However, any statement filed after the time for filing the statement specified in subsection (2) of this section, unless filed under paragraph (a) of this subsection, must be accompanied by a late filing fee of the greater of $200 or one-tenth of one percent of the real market value of the property to which the statement pertains, as determined as of January 1 of the assessment year by the assessor for this purpose. If the statement is not accompanied by the late filing fee or if the late filing fee is not otherwise paid, no exemption shall be allowed for the year based upon a statement filed pursuant to this subsection. A statement may be filed under this section notwithstanding that there are no grounds for hardship as required for late filing under ORS 307.475. The value of the property used to determine the late filing fee under this section is appealable in the same manner as other acts of the county assessor. Any filing fee collected under this section shall be deposited to the county general fund to be made available for county general governmental expenses.

      (4) The assessor shall act upon the claim and shall approve or reject it, noting the action of the assessor upon both the original and the duplicate copies. The duplicate copy therefor shall be returned to the claimant.

      (5) The Department of Revenue shall furnish to a county assessor, upon the request of the county assessor, a statement certifying the qualification or nonqualification of a corporation under ORS 307.375 and this section based upon the corporation’s claim under this section.

      (6) Residents of a facility of a corporation exempt from taxation under this section are not entitled to the tax benefits of ORS 307.370 to 307.385. [1977 c.411 §2; 1987 c.372 §1; 1987 c.756 §18; 1989 c.803 §13; 1991 c.459 §50; 1995 c.300 §2; 1997 c.170 §21; 1997 c.541 §110; 1999 c.579 §2; 2001 c.114 §14; 2001 c.753 §22; 2003 c.46 §12]

 

      307.243 Property to which exemption applies.

      (b) The exemption allowed by ORS 307.242 (1)(e) shall apply only to property, consisting of land and improvements, meeting the requirements of ORS 307.241 to 307.248 (including paragraph (a) of this subsection) that on January 1, 1990, is actually being occupied and used, wholly or partially, to furnish permanent residential, recreational and social facilities primarily for elderly persons. Construction, reconstruction, renovation, maintenance, repair or other improvement (including addition of square footage to the existing buildings and structures and the construction or addition of buildings and structures within the initial land area) made to property that is in actual use on January 1, 1990, wholly or partially, to furnish permanent residential, recreational and social facilities primarily for elderly persons shall not disqualify the property for exemption under ORS 307.242 if, during the process of improvement, the property continues to be in actual use, in whole or in part, to furnish permanent residential, recreational and social facilities primarily for elderly persons. The property, as improved, may qualify for exemption. However, land area and the improvements thereon, contiguous or noncontiguous to the initial land area and improvements in use, in whole or in part, for the corporate purposes of the corporation on January 1, 1990, and first placed in service for the corporate purposes of the corporation after January 1, 1990, shall not qualify for exemption under ORS 307.242 (1)(e).

      (2) The exemption allowed by ORS 307.242 shall not apply to the property of any corporation that requires any payment in excess of one month’s rent, including a deposit or founder’s fee, to be paid, in addition to rent paid for occupancy of the facility, as a condition for occupancy.

      (3) The exemption allowed by ORS 307.242 shall not apply in any year in which delinquencies exist for taxes or other amounts charged against the property on the tax roll. [1977 c.411 §3; 1989 c.803 §14; 1993 c.19 §5]

 

      307.244 Funded exemption; computation of rate of levy by county assessor; payments to county by department; proration. (1) The assessor shall compute and list the value and compute and list the amount of tax which would have been charged on each property receiving an exemption under ORS 307.242 had the property not received an exemption. On or before October 15, the county assessor shall certify the total amounts so computed for each county to the Department of Revenue and to the county treasurer.

      (2) Not later than November 15, the Department of Revenue shall pay to each county treasurer the amount certified under subsection (1) of this section, less any discount provided in ORS 311.505. The payments made by the department under this section shall be made from the suspense account referred to in ORS 307.248. If necessary, the payments may be prorated as provided in ORS 307.248.

      (3) Payments made by the department to the various county treasurers under this section shall be distributed to the taxing units of the county in accordance with the schedule of percentages computed under ORS 311.390. [1977 c.411 §4; 1977 c.761 §6; 1985 c.761 §29; 1991 c.459 §51; 2001 c.753 §23]

 

      307.245 Denial of exemption for failure to reflect exemption by rent reduction. The funded property tax exemption granted under ORS 307.241 to 307.248 may not be granted in any year following a year for which the corporation has failed to satisfy the county assessor or the Department of Revenue that the exemption granted in the previous year has been reflected by a reduction in the amount of rent that would otherwise be paid for occupancy of the facility by its residents. [1977 c.411 §5; 2005 c.94 §33]

 

      307.248 Suspense account; fiscal year allocation; proration of payments. (1) Amounts necessary to make the payments authorized by ORS 307.244 shall be transferred to a suspense account established under ORS 293.445. Moneys in the suspense account are continuously appropriated to the Department of Revenue to carry out the purposes of ORS 307.241 to 307.248.

      (2) Of the total amount transferred to the suspense account referred to in subsection (1) of this section for the biennium, the department shall allocate a portion to each fiscal year. The allocation shall be the department’s best estimate of the most efficient use of the moneys in the suspense account so as to minimize any reductions in the payments required under ORS 307.244 for each fiscal year.

      (3) On or before November 1 of each fiscal year of each biennium, the department shall determine the amount of money needed to make the payments under ORS 307.244 for that fiscal year. If the sum of the obligations is greater than the amounts credited to the suspense account referred to in subsection (1) of this section and allocated to that fiscal year for those obligations under subsection (2) of this section, the payments required under ORS 307.244 shall be proportionally reduced so that the state does not accrue a debt in excess of the amount credited. A claim for payment may not accrue to a county under ORS 307.244 in excess of the amount determined under this subsection.

      (4) If the amount allocated to the first fiscal year of a biennium under subsection (2) of this section exceeds the amount of actual payments made under ORS 307.244, the excess amount shall be available for payments under ORS 307.244 in the second fiscal year of the biennium. [Formerly 310.692]

      (D) Owned by a nonprofit corporation that has made legally enforceable arrangements to convey its interest in any property with respect to which exemption is claimed to the educational institution or institutions whose students are served by the housing upon final payment of the mortgage indebtedness incurred in connection with the construction or acquisition of the housing; and

      (E) Regulated by federal or state law in regard to rents, charges, development costs and methods of operation. The renting of the property for safekeeping purposes during the summer months shall not disqualify the property from the exemption granted by this section.

      (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the nonprofit corporation shall apply to the assessor for the exemption on or before April 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is claimed on forms prescribed by the Department of Revenue. The exemption claim shall include a certification by the university, college or community college attended by a majority of the student occupants that the property is being used for student housing during the current school year.

      (4) When property that has received special exemption as student housing under subsection (1) of this section thereafter becomes disqualified for such exemption, and the notice required by subsection (3) of this section is not given, the assessor shall determine the date that the notice should have been given, shall notify the owner thereof and notwithstanding ORS 311.235, there shall be added to the tax extended against the property on the next general property tax roll, to be collected and distributed in the same manner as the remainder of the real property tax, an amount equal to the sum of the following:

      (a) The total amount by which taxes assessed against the property would have been increased if it had been subject to tax without regard to subsection (1) of this section during the tax year for which the notice should have been given and each tax year thereafter together with the interest which would have accrued had the taxes been properly assessed and the exemption not been granted in the applicable years; and

      (b) A penalty equal to 20 percent of the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, however, no penalty shall be imposed on any amount attributable to interest.

      (b) Redetermined pursuant to ORS 308.146 (6).

      (b) The notice required under this subsection shall state the reasons for the proposed termination and shall require the owner to appear at a specified time, not less than 20 days after mailing the notice, to show cause, if any, why the exemption should not be terminated.

      (2) If the owner fails to appear and show cause why the exemption should not be terminated, the governing body shall notify every known lender, and shall allow any lender not less than 30 days after the date the notice of the failure to appear and show cause is mailed to cure any noncompliance or to provide assurance adequate to the governing body that all noncompliance will be remedied.

      (3)(a) If the owner fails to appear and show cause why the exemption should not be terminated, and the lender fails to cure or give adequate assurance of the cure of any noncompliance, the governing body shall adopt an ordinance or resolution stating its findings that terminate the exemption.

      (b) A copy of the ordinance or resolution required under this subsection shall be filed within 10 days after its adoption with the county assessor, and a copy shall be sent to the owner at the owner’s last-known address and to the lender at the last-known address of the lender within 10 days after its adoption.

      (b) The property shall be assessed and taxed as other property similarly situated is assessed and taxed; and

      (c) Notwithstanding ORS 311.235, there shall be added to the general property tax roll for the tax year next following the presentation or discovery, to be collected and distributed in the same manner as other real property tax, an amount equal to the difference between the taxes assessed against the property and the taxes that would have been assessed against the property had it not been exempt under ORS 307.540 to 307.548 for each of the years, not to exceed the last 10 years, during which the property was exempt from taxation under ORS 307.540 to 307.548.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, if at the time of presentation or discovery, the property is no longer exempt, additional taxes may be collected as provided in subsection (4) of this section, except that the number of years for which the additional taxes shall be collected shall be reduced by one year for each year that has elapsed since the year the property was last granted exemption, beginning with the oldest year for which additional taxes are due.

      (6) The assessment and tax rolls shall show potential additional tax liability for each property granted exemption under ORS 307.540 to 307.548 because the property is being held for future development of low income housing.

      (7) Additional taxes collected under this section shall be deemed to have been imposed in the year to which the additional taxes relate. [1997 c.752 §14; 2013 c.193 §17]

(Multiple-Unit Housing)

 

      307.600 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to stimulate the construction of transit supportive multiple-unit housing in the core areas of Oregon’s urban centers to improve the balance between the residential and commercial nature of those areas, and to ensure full-time use of the areas as places where residents of the community have an opportunity to live as well as to work.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly further finds that it is in the public interest to promote private investment in transit supportive multiple-unit housing in light rail station areas and transit oriented areas in order to maximize Oregon’s transit investment to the fullest extent possible and that the cities and counties of this state should be enabled to establish and design programs to attract new development of multiple-unit housing, and commercial and retail property, in areas located within a light rail station area or transit oriented area.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly further finds that the cities and counties of this state should be enabled to establish and design programs to attract new development of multiple-unit housing in light rail station areas, in transit oriented areas or in city core areas by means of the local property tax exemption authorized under ORS 307.600 to 307.637. The programs shall emphasize the following:

      (a) The development of vacant or underutilized sites in light rail station areas, transit oriented areas or core areas, rather than sites where sound or rehabilitable multiple-unit housing exists.

      (b) The development of multiple-unit housing, with or without parking, in structures that may include ground level commercial space.

      (c) The development of multiple-unit housing, with or without parking, on sites with existing single-story commercial structures.

      (d) The development of multiple-unit housing, with or without parking, on existing surface parking lots.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly further finds that it is in the public interest to preserve or establish existing housing that is affordable to low income persons by providing the incentives authorized in ORS 307.600 to 307.637 to:

      (a) Existing multiple-unit housing subject to a low income housing assistance contract with an agency or subdivision of this state or the United States; and

      (b) Existing multiple-unit housing that becomes subject to a low income housing assistance contract with an agency or subdivision of this state or the United States in order to use the incentives authorized in ORS 307.600 to 307.637.

      (5) The programs shall result in the preservation, construction, addition or conversion of units at rental rates or sale prices accessible to a broad range of the general public. [1975 c.428 §2; 1995 c.596 §1; 1999 c.808 §1; 2003 c.457 §1; 2017 c.315 §8]

A county may designate areas as light rail station areas or transit oriented areas but may not designate areas as core areas.

A city or county from time to time may, by amending its resolution or ordinance, add or withdraw territory from the area originally designated as a light rail station area or a transit oriented area, but any area added must be within the boundaries of the area as limited by ORS 307.603 (3) or (6).

      (3) The city or county shall, prior to passage of a resolution or ordinance electing to utilize the provisions of ORS 307.600 to 307.637, hold a public hearing in order to determine whether multiple-unit housing meeting the qualifications of subsection (4) of this section would not otherwise be built in the designated area or preserved without the benefits provided by ORS 307.600 to 307.637.

      (4) Prior to accepting project applications under ORS 307.600 to 307.637, cities or counties shall promulgate standards and guidelines to be utilized in considering applications and making the determinations required by ORS 307.618.

[Formerly 307.620]

 

      307.610 [1975 c.428 §3; 1979 c.425 §2; 1983 c.493 §1; 1989 c.1051 §2; 1991 c.459 §72; 1995 c.596 §3; 1997 c.325 §27; 1999 c.808 §3; 2003 c.457 §3; renumbered 307.606 in 2005]

 

      307.612 Duration of exemption; exclusions. (1) Multiple-unit housing that qualifies for exemption under ORS 307.600 to 307.637 may be exempt from ad valorem taxation for no more than 10 successive years. The first year of exemption is the assessment year beginning January 1 immediately following the calendar year in which construction, addition or conversion is completed, determined by that stage in the construction process when, pursuant to ORS 307.330, the improvement would have gone on the tax rolls in the absence of the exemption provided for in ORS 307.600 to 307.637 or, in the case of multiple-unit housing that is or becomes subject to a low income housing assistance contract, the application is approved.

      (2)(a) The exemption may not include the land or any improvements not a part of the multiple-unit housing.

      (b) The exemption may include:

      (A) Parking constructed as part of the multiple-unit housing construction, addition or conversion; and

      (B) Commercial property to the extent that the commercial property is a required design or public benefit element of a multiple-unit housing construction, addition or conversion approved by an authorizing city or county.

      (c) In the case of a structure to which stories or other improvements are added or a structure that is converted in whole or in part from other use to dwelling units, only the increase in value attributable to the addition or conversion may be exempt from taxation.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the multiple-unit housing is or becomes subject to a low income housing assistance contract with an agency or subdivision of this state or the United States, the city or county may extend the exemption provided by ORS 307.600 to 307.637 through June 30 of the tax year during which the termination date of the contract falls.

      (4)(a) The exemption provided by ORS 307.600 to 307.637 is in addition to any other exemption provided by law. However, nothing in ORS 307.600 to 307.637 may be construed to exempt any property beyond 100 percent of its real market value.

      (b) If property is located within a core area and within a light rail station area or a transit oriented area, or both, and application for exemption under more than one program is made, only the exemption for which application is first made and approved may be granted. If property is granted exemption under ORS 307.600 to 307.637 pursuant to an ordinance or resolution adopted by a city, the property may not be granted exemption pursuant to an ordinance or resolution adopted by a county. If property is granted exemption under ORS 307.600 to 307.637 pursuant to an ordinance or resolution adopted by a county, the property may not be granted exemption pursuant to an ordinance or resolution adopted by a city. Property may be granted exemption under ORS 307.600 to 307.637 only once. [Formerly 307.630; 2011 c.266 §2]

      (2) In the case of housing that is or becomes subject to a low income housing assistance contract with an agency or subdivision of this state or the United States, it is important to the community to preserve or establish the housing as low income housing and it is probable that the housing would not be produced, be established or remain as low income housing without the exemption being granted.

      (3) The owner has complied with all standards and guidelines adopted by cities or counties pursuant to ORS 307.606 (4). [Formerly 307.650; 2011 c.266 §3]

The application fee shall be paid to the city or county at the time the application for exemption is filed. If the application is approved, the city or county shall pay the application fee to the county assessor for deposit in the county general fund, after first deducting that portion of the fee attributable to its own administrative costs in processing the application. If the application is denied, the city or county shall retain that portion of the application fee attributable to its own administrative costs and shall refund the balance to the applicant. [Formerly 307.660; 2013 c.193 §9]

 

      307.624 Termination of exemption for failure to complete construction or noncompliance; notice. (1) Except as provided in ORS 307.627, if the city or county finds that construction of multiple-unit housing was not completed on or before the date specified in ORS 307.637, or that any provision of ORS 307.600 to 307.637 is not being complied with, or any provision required by the city or county pursuant to ORS 307.600 to 307.637 is not being complied with, the city or county shall give notice to the owner, mailed to the owner’s last-known address, and to any known lender, mailed to the lender’s last-known address, of the proposed termination of the exemption. The notice shall state the reasons for the proposed termination and shall require the owner to appear at a specified time, not less than 20 days after mailing the notice, to show cause, if any, why the exemption should not be terminated.

      (2) If the owner fails to appear and show cause why the exemption should not be terminated, the city or county shall further notify every known lender and shall allow the lender a period of not less than 30 days, beginning with the date that the notice of failure to appear and show cause is mailed to the lender, to cure any noncompliance or to provide assurance that is adequate, as determined by the governing body, to assure the governing body that the noncompliance will be remedied.

      (3) If the owner fails to appear and show cause why the exemption should not be terminated, and a lender fails to cure or give adequate assurance that any noncompliance will be cured, the city or county shall adopt an ordinance or resolution stating its findings terminating the exemption. A copy of the ordinance or resolution shall be filed with the county assessor and a copy sent to the owner at the owner’s last-known address, and to any lender at the lender’s last-known address, within 10 days after its adoption.

(1) If, after application has been approved under ORS 307.600 to 307.637, a declaration defined in ORS 100.005 with respect to the property is presented to the county assessor or tax collector for approval under ORS 100.110, or if the county assessor discovers that the multiple-unit housing or a portion of the multiple-unit housing is changed to a use that is other than residential or housing, or if the exemption was granted for housing being or becoming subject to a low income housing assistance contract with an agency or subdivision of this state or the United States and the housing is not housing subject to a low income housing assistance contract as of a date the housing is required to be subject to a low income housing assistance contract in order to receive the exemption:

      (a) The exemption granted the multiple-unit housing or portion under ORS 307.600 to 307.637 shall terminate immediately, without right of notice or appeal;

      (b) The property or portion shall be assessed and taxed as other property similarly situated is assessed and taxed; and

      (c)(A) Notwithstanding ORS 311.235, there shall be added to the general property tax roll for the tax year next following the presentation or discovery, to be collected and distributed in the same manner as other real property tax, an amount equal to the difference between the amount of tax that would have been due on the property or portion had it not been exempt under ORS 307.600 to 307.637 for each of the years, not to exceed the last 10 years, during which the property was exempt from taxation under ORS 307.600 to 307.637.

      (B) In the case of multiple-unit housing described in ORS 307.603 (5)(a), this paragraph applies only if the low income housing assistance contract to which the housing was or was to become subject was not entered into, breached or terminated prematurely.

      (2) If, at the time of presentation or discovery, the property is no longer exempt, additional taxes shall be imposed as provided in this section, but the number of years that would otherwise be used to compute the additional taxes shall be reduced one year for each year that has elapsed since the year the property was last granted exemption beginning with the oldest year for which additional taxes are due.

      (3) The assessment and tax rolls shall show “potential additional tax liability” for each property granted exemption under ORS 307.600 to 307.637.

      (4) Additional taxes collected under this section shall be deemed to have been imposed in the year to which the additional taxes relate. [Formerly 307.675]

The county assessor shall make such valuation of the property as shall be necessary to permit such correction of the rolls. The owner may appeal any such valuation in the same manner as provided for appeals under ORS 311.216 to 311.232. Where there has been a failure to comply with ORS 307.624, the property shall become taxable beginning January 1 of the assessment year following the assessment year in which the noncompliance first occurred. Any additional taxes becoming due shall be payable without interest if paid in the period prior to the 16th of the month next following the month of correction. If not paid within such period, the additional taxes shall be delinquent on the date they would normally have become delinquent if timely extended on the roll or rolls in the year or years for which the correction was made.

      (4) A rural health care facility described in this section shall be exempt from the taxes to which the exemption applies for the tax year in which the facility is first in service as of the assessment date and for the next two succeeding tax years. [2001 c.642 §2]

 

      307.806 Exemption limited to taxes of district adopting ORS 307.804; procedures. (1) In order for a rural health care facility to be exempt from tax under ORS 307.804, prior to the construction, addition, modification or installation of the facility the governing body of the county in which the facility is to be located must, by ordinance or resolution, authorize the exemption provided under ORS 307.804.

      (2) Within 10 days following adoption of the ordinance or resolution that authorizes the exemption provided under ORS 307.804, the county governing body must give written notice of the authorization of the exemption to:

(Long Term Care Facilities)

 

      307.808 Findings and declarations. The Legislative Assembly finds that owners of long term care facilities who devote substantial proportions of those facilities to providing long term care to residents eligible for medical services under Medicaid provide an essential community service. The Legislative Assembly declares that a property tax exemption will enable these essential community provider long term care facilities to increase the quality of care provided to facility residents. The Legislative Assembly further declares that the quality of care is increased most efficiently when the full value of the exemption is applied to increasing direct caregiver wages, physical plant improvements and other expenditures that directly benefit the facility residents and staff. [1999 c.476 §1]

 

      307.810 [1959 c.659 §1; repealed by 1979 c.692 §13]

[1999 c.872 §4]

 

      307.820 [1959 c.659 §2; 1965 c.395 §1; repealed by 1979 c.692 §13]

 

      307.821 Disqualification; additional taxes. (1) If, after an exemption under ORS 307.818 is granted, the county assessor determines that the property or a portion of the property is not managed, operated or maintained in a manner consistent with ORS 307.818:

      (5) A property that has lost eligibility for exemption under ORS 307.818 may requalify for exemption beginning with the tax year following payment of any additional taxes. [1999 c.872 §5]

 

(Environmentally Sensitive Logging Equipment)

 

      307.824 Findings and declarations. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) The public policy of this state is to facilitate the transition of older logging equipment to newer equipment designed and manufactured to be as environmentally sensitive as current technology can provide, consistent with the need to match the equipment to the specifics of the site being harvested.

      (2) Personal property taxes paid on logging equipment act as a disincentive to a transition to environmentally sensitive technology, because older equipment has a lower assessed value and therefore generates a correspondingly reduced property tax liability. In contrast, newer equipment, the use of which benefits the environment more than the use of older equipment, has a higher assessed value and a correspondingly higher property tax liability.

      (3) A property tax incentive is a means of facilitating the transition to newer, environmentally sensitive equipment and accomplishing the declared public policy. [1999 c.957 §2]

 

      307.827 Environmentally sensitive logging equipment. (1) Environmentally sensitive logging equipment is exempt from ad valorem property taxation.

      (2) As used in this section:

      (a) “Environmentally sensitive logging equipment” means logging equipment that was originally manufactured after 1992.

      (A) Used in logging or forest management operations involving timber harvest, including the felling, bucking, yarding, loading or utilization of timber, logs or wood fiber in the forest, or used in reforestation, forest vegetation restoration, site preparation, vegetation control, stand and tree improvement or thinning;

      (B) That is specifically designed for activities related to water quality or fish and wildlife habitat protection in the forest; or

      (C) Consisting of excavators used in logging road construction, maintenance, reconstruction or improvements, including the closing or obliterating of existing forest roads.

      (c) “Logging equipment” does not include:

      (A) Equipment used in nonforest applications for more than 20 percent of the tax year, as measured by the operating hours of the equipment.

      (B) Equipment used in the manufacturing or milling of forest products.

      (C) Power saws, hand tools, blocks or pulleys that are not a part of the equipment, rigging, shop equipment or support equipment.

(Cargo Containers)

 

      307.835 Cargo containers. All cargo containers principally used for the transportation of cargo by vessels in trade and ocean commerce shall be exempt from taxation. The term “cargo container” means a receptacle:

      (2) Specially designed to facilitate the carriage of goods, by one or more modes of transport, one of which shall be by vessels, without intermediate reloading; and

      Sec. 2. Cargo containers, as defined in ORS 307.835, are exempt from taxation for tax years beginning on or after July 1, 1974, and before July 1, 2026. [1979 c.783 §2; 1987 c.583 §1; 1995 c.748 §7; 2003 c.218 §1; 2009 c.548 §1; 2013 c.213 §1; 2019 c.578 §3]

 

      Note: 307.835 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 307 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
