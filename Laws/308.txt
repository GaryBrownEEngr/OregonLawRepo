      (2) A delinquent taxpayer is subject to a penalty of $10 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of assessed value of the property as placed on the assessment roll of the department for the year of delinquency; except that for a delinquent taxpayer required to file a statement under ORS 308.805 to 308.820, the penalty shall be based upon the assessed value of such property of the taxpayer as would have been placed upon the assessment roll of the department if such property were subject to ad valorem taxation.

      (3) The department shall send any delinquent taxpayer against whom a penalty is imposed under this section a notice of its intention to impose the penalty, by mailing a notice to the taxpayer at the last-known address shown on the records of the department.

      (A) Good and sufficient cause exists for the actions of the taxpayer that resulted in the imposition of a penalty;

      (B) The actions of the taxpayer that resulted in the imposition of a penalty constitute a first-time offense on the part of the taxpayer; or

The amount of penalty constitutes a lien as of July 1 of the year of imposition on all real and personal property of the delinquent taxpayer in the state.

      (6) Any penalty collected under this section shall be deposited in the unsegregated tax collections account of the counties in which the property of the taxpayer is located. [1977 c.884 §13; 1981 c.804 §29; 1991 c.459 §85; 1997 c.154 §29; 2003 c.317 §1; 2009 c.128 §2]

 

COUNTY ASSESSOR

 

      308.050 Assessor’s annual report on property appraisal program. To aid the county court or board of county commissioners and the Department of Revenue in ascertaining whether a county assessor is maintaining a county’s appraisal program, the county assessor must present, with the annual ratio study required by ORS 309.200, a written report as to the current status of the overall program of property appraisals in the county, specifying what property was reappraised in the past year and what is to be reappraised in the current year. [1967 c.316 §2 (2); 1981 c.804 §30; 1989 c.796 §16; 1991 c.459 §86]

 

      308.055 Special assessor appointed if assessor fails to act. If the assessor fails to commence or continuously and vigorously prosecute the making of the assessment in the manner provided by law, the county court or board of county commissioners may summarily appoint a special assessor. The special assessor shall qualify in the same manner as the assessor. The special assessor shall have all the duties, rights, privileges and emoluments of the assessor in making the assessment for the current year. The acts of the special assessor shall have the same effect as if they had been done by the assessor. [Amended by 1981 c.804 §31]

      (2) If the county assessor does not complete the continuing education as required under rules adopted by the department and submit evidence satisfactory to the department, the department may recommend to the county governing body that the county governing body appoint a special assessor as provided under ORS 308.055. [1989 c.796 §27; 2003 c.46 §14]

 

      308.059 Qualifications of managerial employees of assessor. Any person who is employed in the office of the county assessor in a management position must meet the qualifications as described by rule of the Department of Revenue. [1989 c.796 §28]

      308.062 Action by department when appraisals not being conducted as provided by law; reimbursement of department costs. (1) If the Department of Revenue determines that appraisals in any county are not being made as provided by law, to meet the requirements of real market value and under a program that ensures compliance with ORS 308.234, or if the department determines that the county is not in compliance with a conference agreement or a plan developed at a conference as provided under ORS 294.181, it shall make a written report to the county court or board of county commissioners of the county, describing the provisions of law which are not being followed and recommending specific measures to be taken by the county court or board and the assessor to cure the deficiencies noted.

      (2) If the department thereafter discovers that any measure or measures are not being taken as recommended under subsection (1) of this section, and that as a result, in the department’s opinion, appraisals in the county are not being made as provided by law, including meeting the requirements of ORS 308.232 or 308.234, the department shall give 30 days’ written notice to the assessor and to the county court or board of county commissioners of its intention to use the most practicable means to cure the deficiencies, including but not limited to the use of its own employees and equipment or the use of fee appraisers. If within the 30-day period the assessor and the county court or board of county commissioners fail to take action to correct the deficiencies through the providing of funds and personnel, or by the submission of a plan acceptable to the department, the department shall proceed to cure the deficiencies. The county court or board of county commissioners shall bear the full expense of the necessary actions taken by the Department of Revenue for the benefit of the county, aided by the provisions of subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) In the event that the department must perform services within or for a county pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the costs shall be advanced from its Assessment and Taxation County Account, described in ORS 306.125, and, except as otherwise provided by law, that account shall be reimbursed for the sum of such costs from the county’s share of the state shared funds, unless other provision is made by action of the county court or board. Reimbursement of the Assessment and Taxation County Account shall be made from time to time upon the order of the Secretary of State to the State Treasurer, based upon the Department of Revenue’s certified, itemized statement of such costs to the Secretary of State. Reimbursement shall be from an equal proportion of all state share funds required or permitted to be distributed to the county that are not otherwise dedicated as provided by law. If the county is a county for which expenditures for assessment and taxation have been certified under ORS 294.175, the total reimbursement to the department shall not exceed the amount of the expenditures so certified.

(1) Real market value of all property, real and personal, means the amount in cash that could reasonably be expected to be paid by an informed buyer to an informed seller, each acting without compulsion in an arm’s-length transaction occurring as of the assessment date for the tax year.

      (2) Real market value in all cases shall be determined by methods and procedures in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of Revenue and in accordance with the following:

      (a) The amount a typical seller would accept or the amount a typical buyer would offer that could reasonably be expected by a seller of property.

      (b) An amount in cash shall be considered the equivalent of a financing method that is typical for a property.

      (c) If the property has no immediate market value, its real market value is the amount of money that would justly compensate the owner for loss of the property.

      (d) If the property is subject to governmental restriction as to use on the assessment date under applicable law or regulation, real market value shall not be based upon sales that reflect for the property a value that the property would have if the use of the property were not subject to the restriction unless adjustments in value are made reflecting the effect of the restrictions. [Amended by 1953 c.701 §2; 1955 c.691 §§1, 2; 1977 c.423 §2; 1981 c.804 §34; 1989 c.796 §30; 1991 c.459 §88; 1993 c.19 §6; 1997 c.541 §152]

 

      308.207 Computation of real market value for taxing or bonding limitations. (1) If the taxing or bonding power of any governmental unit is limited to a millage or percentage of the real market value of the taxable property within the unit, the real market value shall be the real market value as reflected in the last certified assessment roll.

      (2) Changes in the boundary lines of a governmental unit shall be taken into account in computing its real market value for purposes of subsection (1) of this section even though such boundary changes may not be included on the latest assessment roll.

      (3) As used in this section, “governmental unit” includes the state, counties, cities, municipal corporations, and all special districts having the power to levy taxes or issue bonds. [1963 c.9 §1; 1967 c.293 §22; 1981 c.804 §35; 1991 c.459 §89; 1999 c.1078 §83]

 

      308.210 Assessing property; record as assessment roll; changes in ownership or description of real property and manufactured structures assessed as personal property. (1) The assessor shall proceed each year to assess the value of all taxable property within the county, except property that by law is to be otherwise assessed. The assessor shall maintain a full and complete record of the assessment of the taxable property for each year as of January 1, at 1:00 a.m. of the assessment year, in the manner set forth in ORS 308.215. Such record shall constitute the assessment roll of the county for the year.

      (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the ownership and description of all real property and manufactured structures assessed as personal property shall be shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of such year or as it may subsequently be changed by divisions, transfers or other recorded changes. This subsection is intended to permit the assessor to reflect on the assessment roll the divisions of property or the combining of properties after January 1 so as to reflect the changes in the ownership of that property and to keep current the descriptions of property. The assessor shall also have authority to change the ownership of record after January 1 of a given year so that the assessment roll will reflect as nearly as possible the current ownership of that property.

      (3) The assessor shall not indicate any changes, divisions or transfers of properties which occurred before, on or after January 1 as a result of the division of a larger parcel of land until all ad valorem taxes, fees and other charges placed upon the tax roll on the entire parcel of property that have been certified for collection under ORS 311.105 and 311.110 have been paid. However, if the owner of one of the portions of the larger property is a public body only the change, division or transfer of that portion shall be recognized.

      (4) The assessor shall not reflect on the assessment roll any combining of properties unless all ad valorem taxes, fees or other charges charged to the tax accounts to be combined that have been certified for collection under ORS 311.105 and 311.110 have been paid. However, if the owner of the affected property is a public body, this subsection shall not apply.

      (5) The assessor shall notify the planning director of a city of all divisions of land within the corporate limits of the city and the planning director of a county of all divisions of land outside the corporate limits of all cities and within the county, including, but not limited to, divisions of land by lien foreclosure, divisions of land pursuant to court order and subdivisions within 30 days after the date the change in the tax lot lines was processed by the assessor. The requirements of this subsection do not apply to divisions for assessment purposes only.

      (6) As used in this section, “public body” means the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities, the state, a county, city, school district, irrigation or drainage district, a port, a water district and all other public or municipal corporations in the state exempt from tax under ORS 307.040 or 307.090. [Amended by 1957 c.324 §1; 1969 c.454 §1; 1977 c.718 §1; 1981 c.632 §2; 1983 c.473 §1; 1983 c.718 §1; 1991 c.459 §90; 1991 c.763 §27; 1993 c.6 §4; 1995 c.610 §1; 1997 c.541 §154]

 

      308.212 Requirement for property owner to file address. (1) Any person who owns real property located in any county shall notify the county assessor for the county where the property is located of that owner’s current address and, within 30 days of the change, shall notify the assessor of any change of address.

      (2) A notice required under subsection (1) of this section does not meet the requirements of this section unless the notice is in writing and:

      (a) For an individual, the notice contains the residence address of the person.

      (b) For any other person, the notice contains the name and address of persons upon whom process may be served.

      (3) The county assessor of each county shall maintain records showing the information required to be submitted to the assessor under this section. The assessor shall note any property owner’s change of address on the tax rolls.

      (4) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to any government body or government agency. [1981 c.153 §49]

 

      Note: 308.212 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 308 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      308.215 Contents of assessment roll; rules. (1) The assessor shall prepare the assessment roll in the following form:

      (a) Real property shall be listed in sequence by account number or by code area and account numbers. For each parcel of real property, the assessor shall set down in the assessment roll according to the best information the assessor can obtain:

      (A) The name of the owner or owners and, if the assessor or tax collector is instructed in writing by the owner or owners to send statements and notices relating to taxation to an agent or representative, the name of such agent or representative.

      (B) A description as required by ORS 308.240 with its code area and account numbers.

      (C) The property class, in accordance with the classes established by rule by the Department of Revenue.

      (D) The number of acres and parts of an acre, as nearly as can be ascertained, unless it is divided into blocks and lots.

      (E) The real market value of the land, excluding all buildings, structures, improvements and timber thereon.

      (F) The real market value of all buildings, structures and improvements thereon.

      (G) The real market value of each unit together with its percentage of undivided interest in the common elements of property subject to ORS 100.005 to 100.910 stating separately the real market value of the land, buildings, structures and improvements of each unit.

      (H) For each parcel of real property granted an exemption under ORS 307.250 to 307.283, the real market value so exempt.

      (I) The total assessed value, maximum assessed value and real market value of each parcel of real property assessed.

      (b) For personal property, the assessor shall set down separately in the assessment roll, according to the best information the assessor can obtain:

      (A) The names, including assumed business names, if any, of all persons, whether individuals, partnerships or corporations, or other owner, owning or having possession or control of taxable personal property on January 1, at 1:00 a.m. of the assessment year. If it is a partnership, the names of two general partners and the total number thereof.

      (B) The real market value of the personal property assessed, with a separate value for each category of personal property, if any. The Department of Revenue, by rule, may establish such categories as appear useful or necessary for good tax administration.

      (C) The number of the code area assigned by the assessor covering the situs of the property on January 1.

      (D) The total assessed, maximum assessed and real market value for the property.

      (c) Real property and machinery and equipment listed on the assessment roll shall each bear a distinctive designation so that machinery and equipment can be identified with the real property upon which the machinery and equipment is located.

      (d)(A) The listing of manufactured structures on the assessment roll, whether as real or personal property, shall be done in a distinctive manner so that manufactured structures may be readily distinguished from other property.

      (B) In lieu of listing manufactured structures on the assessment roll as real or personal property, the assessor may list manufactured structures in a separate section of the assessment roll. In any county where such separate listing of manufactured structures is made the manufactured structures assessed as real property under ORS 308.875 shall bear a distinctive designation so that it can be identified with the real property upon which it is located. In like manner the real property upon which the manufactured structure is situated shall bear a distinctive designation so that it can be identified with the manufactured structure. Where a homestead exemption is granted to a manufactured structure assessed as real property under ORS 308.875, which manufactured structure is listed on a portion of the assessment roll separate from the real property, the exempt amount shall apply first to the value of the manufactured structure, and any remainder shall apply to the parcel of land upon which it is situated.

      (2) For purposes of the classification of real property required under subsection (1)(a)(C) of this section, property listed in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection must be classified, together with any other property listed in the respective paragraph, separately from all other property:

      (a) Machinery and equipment.

      (b) Property appraised under ORS 306.126, other than machinery and equipment.

      (c) Industrial property, other than property appraised under ORS 306.126, and commercial property.

[Amended by 1957 c.324 §2; 1963 c.270 §1; 1963 c.541 §43; 1965 c.344 §1; 1967 c.568 §1; 1971 c.529 §13; 1971 c.568 §1; 1971 c.747 §16; 1977 c.718 §6; 1979 c.692 §3; 1981 c.804 §36; 1983 s.s. c.5 §3; 1985 c.350 §1; 1985 c.613 §7; 1991 c.459 §91; 1997 c.541 §155; 1999 c.579 §4; 2012 c.30 §1]

 

      308.217 Form of assessment and tax rolls; obtaining descriptions of property. (1) For purposes of assessment and taxation, the assessment roll and the tax roll of each county shall be deemed one continuous record. They shall be made up in regular and orderly form, with appropriate headings for assessment of properties, extensions of tax levies, for payments, foreclosures, redemptions, issuance of deeds and other entries as contemplated by law. The rolls shall be in an acceptable form of record keeping, approved by the Department of Revenue, which may be, but is not limited to, bound volumes, numbered loose-leaf sheets, systematic punch cards or magnetic tape. Both rolls may be prepared as continuing rolls, covering two or more years, but all proceedings in the assessment and taxation of property for each year shall be separately exhibited therein.

      (2) The records constituting the assessment roll may be combined with or separated from the records constituting the tax roll. The records constituting each roll may be divided, for convenience, between the assessor’s office and the tax collector’s office, with or without duplication in whole or in part in either office.

      (3) The owner of any real property shall, upon request of the assessor, furnish to the assessor a description of the property from which its area can be computed accurately and the location and boundary lines made certain. [1965 c.344 §3 (308.217, 308.219 and 308.221 enacted in lieu of 308.220)]

 

      308.219 Assessment and tax rolls; preparation; contents; availability to public; rules. (1) This section applies if the assessment and tax rolls do not constitute a written record that can be read by and is available to the public.

      (2) At the same time as the certification required under ORS 311.105 the assessor shall print out the entire assessment and tax roll, including the roll as prepared on September 25, with all corrections, changes and additions to the roll that have occurred to the date the roll is delivered to the tax collector pursuant to ORS 311.115.

      (3) The assessment and tax roll shall be printed out in full, as of the June 30 that is the end of the fiscal year for which the roll was prepared. As of each June 30, thereafter, the tax collector shall print out those accounts not collected in full or canceled as of the preceding June 30. The printout shall contain a record of all payments, corrections, additions and changes that have occurred since the date of the last printing of the roll.

      (4) The printouts required by subsection (3) of this section shall constitute the roll or part thereof as of the date of the particular printout. Such printouts and the source documents that are the basis for the roll shall be retained as otherwise provided by law. The material that is not available to and cannot be read by the general public and that otherwise constitutes the roll up to the date of the printout may be destroyed one year after the printout is made.

      (5) Additional printouts shall be made by the assessor or tax collector as the assessor or tax collector deems necessary for proper administration of the tax laws.

      (6) The Department of Revenue may by rule require that the printouts include information in addition to that required by subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

      (7) Preparation of a microfiche record of the roll shall constitute a printout. [1965 c.344 §4 (308.217, 308.219 and 308.221 enacted in lieu of 308.220); 1975 c.780 §4; 1991 c.459 §92; 1997 c.541 §156; 2005 c.94 §44]

If the description or map is disapproved, the department shall explain what steps must be taken to correct the description or map, and shall cooperate with the filing body in helping it meet the requirements of this section, and whenever possible, the filing deadline of March 31. Corrected descriptions and maps must then be resubmitted to the department, and approved, and filed with the assessor or assessors.

      (8) The filing of the description and map under this section is for assessment and taxation purposes only and does not affect or relate to filing for any other purpose.

      (2) The purpose of this section is to achieve equality and uniformity in assessed values between properties that are physically appraised and those that are not physically appraised, but subject to trending or indexing for the particular assessment year.

      (2) If land is situated within an irrigation, drainage, reclamation or other improvement district, the value of the land shall not be considered to be increased until the construction and improvement of the district have been completed to the point that water may be delivered to or removed from the land, as the case may be. [Amended by 1953 c.701 §2; 1957 c.324 §4; subsection (2) enacted as 1967 c.601 §12; 1969 c.601 §14; 1975 c.671 §1; 1981 c.804 §40]

 

      308.236 Land values to reflect presence of roads; roads not assessed; exception for certain timber roads. (1) The availability, usefulness and cost of using roads, including all roads of the owner of land or timber and all roads that the owner has the right to use, shall be taken into consideration in determining the real market value of land.

      (2) Farm or grazing land roads and forest roads themselves, except principal exterior timber access roads, shall not be appraised, valued or assessed and they shall not be classed as improvements under ORS 308.215. The underlying land upon which roads are constructed shall be assessed if it is otherwise subject to assessment.

      (3) As used in this section:

      308.240 Description of real property; assessment to “unknown owners”; mistake or omission in owner’s name; error in description of property. (1) Real property may be described by giving the subdivision according to the United States survey when coincident with the boundaries thereof, or by lots, blocks and addition names, or by giving the boundaries thereof by metes and bounds, or by reference to the book and page of any public record of the county where the description may be found, or in such other manner as to cause the description to be capable of being made certain. Initial letters, abbreviations, figures, fractions and exponents, to designate the township, range, section or part of a section, or the number of any lot or block or part thereof, or any distance, course, bearing or direction, may be employed in any such description of real property.

      (2) If the owner of any land is unknown, such land may be assessed to “unknown owner,” or “unknown owners.” If the property is correctly described, no assessment shall be invalidated by a mistake in the name of the owner of the real property assessed or by the omission of the name of the owner or the entry of a name other than that of the true owner. Where the name of the true owner, or the owner of record, of any parcel of real property is given, the assessment shall not be held invalid on account of any error or irregularity in the description if the description would be sufficient in a deed of conveyance from the owner, or is such that, in an action to enforce a contract to convey employing such description, a court with jurisdiction to grant equitable remedies would hold it to be good and sufficient.

INDUSTRIAL PLANTS

 

      308.408 “Industrial plant” defined. As used in ORS 305.420 and 308.408 to 308.413, “industrial plant” includes:

      (1) The land, buildings, structures and improvements, and the tangible personal property, including but not limited to machinery, equipment and office machines and equipment that make up the property or complex of properties used for industrial or manufacturing purposes;

      (2) Any industrial real or personal property eligible for appraisal under ORS 306.126 and the rules of the Department of Revenue; and

      (3) Any real or personal property used for generating electricity, if:

      (a) The property consists primarily of a generating facility primarily fueled by wood waste or other biomass fuel;

      (b) The property has a maximum generating capacity of 20 megawatts; and

      (c) The electricity generated by the property is consumed by the property user or is sold exclusively to an electric utility, as defined in ORS 758.505, for the utility’s distribution to utility customers. [1981 c.139 §1; 1995 c.650 §87; 1997 c.656 §1; 2003 c.46 §17]

 

      Note: 308.408, 308.411 and 308.413 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 308 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      308.410 [Repealed by 1979 c.689 §27]

 

      308.411 Appraisal and real market valuation of industrial plants; rules. (1) Except as limited by subsections (2) to (9) of this section, the real market value of an industrial plant shall be determined for ad valorem tax purposes under ORS 308.205, 308.232 and 308.235 utilizing the market data approach (sales of comparable properties), the cost approach (reproduction or replacement cost of the plant) or the income approach (capitalization of income) or by two or more approaches. The assessed value of an industrial plant shall be determined under ORS 308.146.

      (2) The owner of a plant may elect to have the plant appraised and valued for ad valorem property tax purposes excluding the income approach to valuation. An owner making an election under this subsection must further determine which of the following paragraphs is applicable to the election:

      (a) If this paragraph applies to the election, the owner may not be required to provide any itemization of income or expense of the industrial plant for use in making an appraisal of the plant for ad valorem property tax purposes; or

      (b) If this paragraph applies to the election, the owner may not be required to provide any itemization of income of the industrial plant for use in making an appraisal of the plant for ad valorem property tax purposes, but may be required to provide an itemization of operating expenses of the industrial plant for use in measuring functional obsolescence in a market data approach or cost approach to valuation.

      (3) Not less than 30 days prior to the making of a physical appraisal or reappraisal of an industrial plant by the Department of Revenue or by a county assessor, the department or assessor shall notify the owner of the plant by mail, return receipt requested, of the intention to physically appraise the plant. The notice shall inform the owner of the date the appraisal is to commence. In commencing the appraisal and to aid the owner in making an election under subsection (2) of this section, the department’s or assessor’s appraisers first shall make a preliminary survey of the plant as to the methods and approaches to the valuation of the plant to be used in the appraisal. The owner or owner’s representative shall immediately thereafter meet with the appraisers, and within two days after the meeting may give written notice to the appraisers that the owner elects to have the plant valued in accordance with subsection (2) of this section. The written notice shall state which paragraph of subsection (2) of this section is applicable to the election. Failure to make the election precludes the owner from making the election for the tax year in which the valuation determined by the physical appraisal is first used on the assessment and tax rolls of the county.

      (4) If an owner does not make an election under subsection (2) of this section, the owner shall make available to the assessor or department all information requested by the assessor or department needed to determine the real market value for the plant. At the request of the owner, the information shall be made the confidential records of the office of the assessor or of the department, subject to the provisions of ORS 305.420 and 305.430.

      (5) If an owner makes an election under subsection (2) of this section, the owner may not in any proceedings involving the assessment of the industrial plant for the tax year for which the election was made, before the county board of property tax appeals or the Oregon Tax Court, be entitled to introduce evidence relating to the use of the income approach to valuation of the plant or introduce any information protected under the election.

      (6)(a) On or before December 31 of the tax year in which the election under subsection (2) of this section first applies to an assessment and tax roll, or on or before December 31 of any subsequent tax year, if the owner is dissatisfied with the election under subsection (2) of this section, the owner may revoke or revise the election.

      (b) If the election is revoked, the owner may request the Department of Revenue or the county assessor, whichever is applicable, to revalue the plant for the next tax year using the appraisal methods set forth in subsection (1) of this section.

      (c) If the election is revised, the paragraph of subsection (2) of this section that was not applicable to the election shall become applicable to the election in lieu of the paragraph applicable before revision. If the election is revised, the owner may request the Department of Revenue or the county assessor, whichever is applicable, to revalue the plant for the next tax year in accordance with the revised election.

      (d) If a revocation or revision of an election is sought, the owner shall demonstrate that the determination of real market value requires taking into consideration the utilization of the income approach to valuation or the measurement of functional obsolescence using operating expense information. Thereafter, at the request of the department or the assessor, the owner shall make available to the department or the assessor all information requested by the department or the assessor as provided in subsection (4) of this section within 30 days following the department’s or the assessor’s request. If the owner fails to provide the information and a revocation had been sought, the election under subsection (2) of this section shall continue. If the owner fails to provide the information and a revision had been sought, the paragraph of subsection (2) that applied prior to the attempted revision shall continue to apply to the election. Under either circumstance, in any proceedings involving the assessment of the industrial plant for subsequent tax years, before the county board of property tax appeals or the Oregon Tax Court, the owner may not introduce evidence relating to the income approach to valuation or introduce any information protected under the election. If the department or assessor makes such a redetermination of the valuation as may, in their opinion, be necessary, the department or assessor shall furnish to the owner prior to the following May 1 a statement of the value of the plant as redetermined by the department or the assessor, with an explanation of the adjustments made.

      (7) After any physical appraisal of an industrial plant or after the appraisal is updated for use on the assessment and tax rolls for a subsequent year, but in any event prior to May 1 of the assessment year for which the appraisal or update applies, the owner may request a conference with the department or with the assessor concerning the determination of real market value under the physical appraisal or updating of the appraisal. If the request for a conference is made, the department or the assessor shall give written notice to the owner of the time and place for the conference for an informal discussion of the valuation.

      (8) Except as provided in this section, no owner of an industrial plant shall be required to make available to the assessor or department, any itemization of income and expense of the industrial plant for use in an income approach to valuation in making an appraisal of an industrial plant for purposes of ad valorem property taxation. However, information furnished pursuant to subsection (4) of this section is available to the county assessor and to the department for purposes of preparing valuations of other industrial plants, subject to the provisions of ORS 308.413.

      (9) Nothing in this section shall preclude the request for and use of information from an owner of an industrial plant concerning cost items, whether materials, labor or otherwise, for use in the reproduction cost approach to the valuation of the plant. In no event shall the application of subsection (2) of this section operate to value an industrial plant below its real market value for ad valorem property tax purposes under ORS 308.232. The election of an owner under subsection (2) of this section to forgo the consideration of the income approach to valuation shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of any subsequent claim that the failure of the assessor or the department to consider the income approach resulted in a valuation in excess of the real market value of the plant under ORS 308.232.

      (10) If the owner of an industrial plant has made an election under subsection (2) of this section, a subpoena for the production of information for the industrial plant that is protected by the election may not be issued while that election is in effect.

      (11) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section concerning the time for making an election under subsection (2) of this section, if the owner of an industrial plant receives notice under ORS 305.392 that a subpoena will be issued for income or expense information for the industrial plant, and the owner has not previously made an election under subsection (2) of this section that is in effect, the owner may make the election allowed under subsection (2) of this section within the 60-day period specified in ORS 305.392. Any owner making an election under this subsection may not revoke or revise that election until after the industrial plant is next assessed for ad valorem tax purposes.

      (12) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, nothing in this section is intended to exclude the capitalization of market rents from the appraisal of buildings.

      (13) The department may adopt any rules necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. [1981 c.139 §2; 1991 c.459 §132; 1993 c.270 §33; 1993 c.353 §8; 1995 c.79 §129; 1995 c.650 §88; 1995 c.724 §1; 1997 c.541 §§193,194; 1999 c.579 §30]

 

      Note: See note under 308.408.

 

      308.412 Effect of election to exclude income approach to value under prior law. An owner that made an election that was in effect under ORS 308.411 (1997 Edition) shall be considered to have chosen ORS 308.411 (2)(a) to apply to the election. The owner may revise or revoke the election pursuant to ORS 308.411 (6). [1999 c.579 §31]

 

      Note: 308.412 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 308 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      308.413 Confidential information furnished under ORS 308.411; exception; rules. (1) Any information furnished to the county assessor or to the Department of Revenue under ORS 308.411 which is obtained upon the condition that it be kept confidential shall be confidential records of the office in which the information is kept, except as follows:

      (a) All information furnished to the county assessor shall be available to the department and all information furnished to the department shall be available to the county assessor.

      (b) All information furnished to the county assessor or department shall be available to any reviewing authority in any subsequent appeal.

      (c) The department may publish statistics based on the information furnished if the statistics are so classified as to prevent the identification of the particular industrial plant.

      (2) The Department of Revenue shall make rules governing the confidentiality of information under this section.

      (3) Each officer or employee of the Department of Revenue or the office of the county assessor to whom disclosure or access of the information made confidential under subsection (1) of this section is given, prior to beginning employment or the performance of duties involving such disclosure, shall be advised in writing of the provisions of this section and ORS 308.990 (5) relating to penalties for the violation of this section, and shall as a condition of employment or performance of duties execute a certificate for the department or the assessor in a form prescribed by the department, stating in substance that the person has read this section and ORS 308.990 (5), that these sections have been explained to the person and that the person is aware of the penalties for violation of this section.

DESTROYED OR DAMAGED PROPERTY

 

      308.425 Taxes on destroyed or damaged property; proration; reduction; effect of repair. (1) If, during any tax year, any real or personal property is destroyed or damaged by fire or act of God, the owner or purchaser under a recorded instrument of sale in the case of real property, or the person assessed, person in possession or owner in the case of personal property, may apply to the tax collector for proration of the taxes imposed on the property for the tax year.

      (2) Application for proration of taxes under subsection (1) of this section shall be made not later than the end of the tax year or 60 days after the date the property was destroyed or damaged, whichever is later.

      (3)(a)(A) For property that is totally destroyed, the tax collector shall collect only one-twelfth of the taxes imposed on the property for the tax year, for each month or fraction of a month that the property was in existence during the tax year. The tax collector shall cancel the remainder of the taxes imposed on the property for the tax year.

      (B) For property that is damaged, the tax collector shall collect only one-twelfth of the taxes imposed on the property for the tax year, for each month or fraction of a month that preceded the month during which the property was damaged. For the month in which the property was damaged, and for each month of the tax year thereafter in which the property remains damaged, the tax collector shall collect that percentage of one-twelfth of the taxes imposed on the property that the real market value or the assessed value of the property after the damage (whichever is less) bears to the assessed value of the property before the damage. The assessor shall advise the tax collector of the value percentage required under this paragraph. The tax collector shall cancel any taxes not to be collected due to this paragraph.

      (b) If proration under this subsection results in an overpayment of taxes paid, the amount of the overpayment shall be refunded in the manner prescribed in ORS 311.806.

      (4) That portion of the property that is damaged property and that is subsequently repaired shall be considered to be new property or new improvements to property under ORS 308.153 for the assessment year in which the repairs or replacements are first taken into account.

REHABILITATED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY

 

      308.450 Definitions for ORS 308.450 to 308.481. As used in ORS 308.450 to 308.481:

      (1) “Distressed area” means a primarily residential area of a county or city that is designated as a distressed area by the county or city because the area is detrimental to the safety, health and welfare of the community due to the following factors:

      (a) Deterioration;

      (b) Inadequate or improper facilities;

      (c) The existence of unsafe or abandoned structures, including but not limited to a significant number of vacant or abandoned single or multifamily residential units; or

      (d) Any combination of these or similar factors.

      (2) “Governing body” means the city or county legislative body having jurisdiction over the property for which a limited assessment may be applied for under ORS 308.450 to 308.481.

      (3) “Rehabilitated residential property” means land and the improvements thereon:

      (a) That are either single or multifamily residential units or are not residential units but that will become residential units through rehabilitation improvements;

      (b) That fail to comply with one or more standards of the state or local building or housing codes applicable at the time the application is filed;

      (c)(A) That are not less than 25 years of age on January 1 in the year the application is filed with the governing body, and on which sums have been expended after September 13, 1975, and prior to January 1, 2017, for the purpose of making rehabilitation improvements, and which sums in the aggregate equal or exceed five percent of the assessed value of the land and improvements thereon as reflected in the last certified assessment roll next preceding the date on which the application for limited assessment is filed with the governing body pursuant to ORS 308.462; or

      (B) On which, regardless of the age of the residential property, sums have been expended or the renovation completed after October 3, 1989, and prior to January 1, 2017, for the purpose of making rehabilitation improvements, and which sums in the aggregate equal or exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the land and improvements thereon as reflected in the last certified assessment roll next preceding the date on which the applications for limited assessment is filed with the governing body pursuant to ORS 308.462;

      (4) “Rehabilitation improvements” means modifications to existing structures that are made to achieve a condition of substantial compliance.

      (5) “Substantial compliance” means compliance with local building or housing code requirements. It does not mean that all heating, plumbing and electrical systems must be replaced with systems meeting current standards for new construction, notwithstanding that the cost of rehabilitation may exceed 50 percent of the value of the structure before rehabilitation. [1975 c.696 §2; 1977 c.472 §1; 1979 c.768 §1; 1981 c.804 §62; 1985 c.320 §1; 1989 c.1051 §6; 1991 c.459 §133; 1997 c.541 §197; 1997 c.830 §1; 2005 c.94 §48; 2007 c.469 §1]

 

      308.453 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the rehabilitation of existing units in substandard condition and the conversion of transient accommodation to permanent residential units and the conversion of nonresidential structures to permanent residential units in order to make these units sound additions to the housing stock of the state. The Legislative Assembly further finds that cities and counties of this state should be enabled to establish and design programs to stimulate such rehabilitation and or conversion based on the incentive of a local property tax exemption, which is authorized under ORS 308.450 to 308.481. [1975 c.696 §1a; 1977 c.472 §2; 1979 c.768 §2; 1989 c.1051 §7]

      308.456 Application of ORS 308.450 to 308.481; standards for processing certificate applications. (1) ORS 308.450 to 308.481 apply to rehabilitated residential property located within the jurisdiction of a governing body which adopts, by resolution or ordinance, the provisions of ORS 308.450 to 308.481. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the limited assessment provided by ORS 308.450 to 308.481 only applies to the tax levy of a governing body which adopts the provisions of ORS 308.450 to 308.481.

      (2) The limited assessment provided by ORS 308.450 to 308.481 shall apply to the tax levy of all taxing districts in which property certified for limited assessment under ORS 308.450 to 308.481 is located when, upon request of a governing body which has adopted the provisions of ORS 308.450 to 308.481, the rates of taxation of such taxing districts whose governing boards agree to the policy of limited assessment as provided in ORS 308.450 to 308.481, when combined with the rate of taxation of the governing body which adopts the provisions of ORS 308.450 to 308.481, equal 51 percent or more of the total combined rate of taxation on the property certified for limited assessment.

      (3) The governing body shall promulgate standards and guidelines to be utilized in making the determinations required by ORS 308.466 and, in the case of nonowner-occupied residential structures or units, standards and guidelines to be applied if the governing body desires to enter into negotiations with the owner regarding rental rates to be charged during the period of the limited assessment.

      (4) ORS 308.450 to 308.481 do not apply to increases in assessed valuation made by the assessor or by lawful order of the Department of Revenue or a court, to a class of property throughout the county or any specific area of the county to achieve the uniformity of assessment or appraisal required by ORS 308.232. [1975 c.696 §§4,12; 1989 c.1051 §8; 1993 c.270 §34]

 

      308.457 Determining boundaries of distressed areas; rules; limitation. (1) Each city or county that adopts, by resolution or ordinance, ORS 308.450 to 308.481, shall adopt rules specifying the process for determining the boundaries of a distressed area and for distressed area boundary changes.

      (2) The cumulative land area within the boundaries of distressed areas within a city or county, whichever adopts the provisions of ORS 308.450 to 308.481, may not exceed 20 percent of the total land area of the city or county. [2005 c.94 §50]

 

      308.459 Valuation of rehabilitated property not to be increased; effect of filing date of certificate. (1) For purposes of ORS 308.232, the assessed value of rehabilitated residential property shall be not more than its assessed value as it appears in the last certified assessment roll next preceding the date on which the application for limited assessment is filed with the governing body as provided in ORS 308.462. If the certificate of qualification is filed with the assessor as provided in ORS 307.512 and 308.466, the limited assessment shall apply with respect to the first assessment roll certified after that date or if the certificate of qualification is filed after the deadline set forth in ORS 307.512, the limited assessment shall apply as of the following January 1, and shall continue to apply for a total of 10 consecutive assessment rolls.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the multifamily rehabilitated residential housing is subject to a low income rental assistance contract with an agency of this state or of the United States, the city may extend the limited assessment provided by ORS 308.450 to 308.481 through December 31 of the assessment year during which the termination date of the contract falls. [1975 c.696 §3; 1979 c.768 §2a; 1981 c.804 §63; 1985 c.320 §2; 1989 c.1051 §9; 1991 c.459 §134; 1997 c.541 §198; 2013 c.193 §12]

 

      308.460 [Repealed by 1975 c.365 §4]

 

      308.462 Qualifications for limited assessment. To qualify for the limited assessment provided by ORS 308.450 to 308.481, the owner shall:

NONPROFIT HOMES FOR ELDERLY PERSONS

 

      308.490 Determining value of homes for elderly persons. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that ordinary methods of determining the assessed value of real property, particularly by consideration of the cost of replacing a structure with a similar and comparable one of equivalent utility, are not appropriate with respect to property of nonprofit homes for elderly persons, operated by corporations described in ORS 307.375. The Legislative Assembly declares that the benefits inherent in operation of these homes, especially in the housing and care furnished to elderly persons for whom this state and its political subdivisions otherwise might be responsible, justifies the use of criteria set out in subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) In determining the assessed value of the property of a nonprofit home for elderly persons, operated by a corporation described in ORS 307.375, the county assessor shall not take into account considerations of replacement cost, but shall consider:

      (a) The amount of money or money’s worth for which the property may be exchanged within a reasonable period of time under conditions in which both parties to the exchange are able, willing and reasonably well informed.

      (b) The gross income that reasonably could be expected from the property if leased or rented to the public generally, less annual operating expenses, reserves for replacements and insurance, depreciation and taxes.

      (c) The relative supply and demand for similar properties.

      (d) The relative value of the location of the property. [1969 c.587 §8; 1981 c.624 §12; 1983 s.s. c.5 §7; 1991 c.459 §138; 1997 c.541 §202]

[Amended by 1991 c.459 §145; 1997 c.154 §37; 1997 c.541 §205; 2007 c.616 §12]

 

      308.545 Mode of valuing property. For the purpose of arriving at the amount and character and assessed value of the property belonging to a company, the Department of Revenue personally may inspect the property, and may take into consideration the statements filed under ORS 308.505 to 308.674, the reports, statements or returns of the company filed in the office of any board, office or commission of this state, or any county thereof, the earning power of the company, the franchises and special franchises owned or used by the company, and such other evidence of any kind that is obtainable bearing thereon. However, no report, statement or return shall be conclusive upon the department in arriving at the amount and character and assessed value of the property belonging to the company. [Amended by 1991 c.459 §146; 1997 c.154 §38; 1997 c.541 §206]

 

      308.550 Valuing property of company operating both within and without state. (1) When a company owns, leases, operates over or uses rail, wire, pipe or pole lines, operational routes or property within and without this state, if the department values the entire property within and without this state as a unit, it may ascertain the property subject to taxation in Oregon by the proportion which the number of miles of rail, wire, pipe or pole lines or operational routes in Oregon, controlled or used by the company, as owner, lessee, or otherwise, bears to the entire mileage of rail, wire, pipe or pole lines or operational routes controlled or used by the company, as owner, lessee, or otherwise.

      (2) If the value of any property having a situs in this state, of a company operating both within and without the state, cannot fairly be determined in the manner prescribed in subsection (1) of this section, the Department of Revenue may use any other reasonable method to determine the proper proportion of the entire property assessable for taxation in this state.

      (3) The assessed value of the property of a water transportation company apportioned or allocated to Oregon shall not reflect so much of the value of its watercraft as is fairly attributable to voyages made by such watercraft exclusively on the high seas or between inland water ports or termini and the high seas. Voyages made to Oregon ports for the sole purpose or purposes of picking up or discharging company personnel, making repairs, refitting, or taking on supplies shall not be used for allocation or apportionment purposes. [Amended by 1955 c.735 §2; 1991 c.459 §147; 1997 c.541 §207]

 

      308.555 Unit valuation of property. The Department of Revenue, for the purpose of arriving at the assessed value of the property assessable by it, may value the entire property, both within and without the State of Oregon, as a unit. If it values the entire property as a unit, either within or without the State of Oregon, or both, the department shall make deductions of the property of the company situated outside the state, and not connected directly with the business thereof, as may be just, to the end that the fair proportion of the property of the company in this state may be ascertained. If the department values the entire property within the State of Oregon as a unit, it shall make deductions of the property of the company situated in Oregon, and assessed by the county assessors, to an amount that shall be just. For that purpose the county assessors shall, if the department so requests, certify to the department the assessed value of the property of the companies assessable by them, but such certification of assessed value is intended to be advisory only and is not conclusive upon the department. [Amended by 1981 c.804 §64; 1991 c.459 §148; 1997 c.541 §208]

 

      308.558 Taxation of aircraft; criteria; apportionment; exemption of aircraft of foreign-owned carriers. (1) Aircraft shall be subject to assessment, taxation and exemption, as provided in this section.

      (2) Any aircraft used or held for use by an air transportation company that is operating pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by an agency of the federal government shall be assessed and taxed under ORS 308.505 to 308.674.

      (3) Any aircraft used or held for use by an air transportation company to provide scheduled passenger service, whether or not the company is operating pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by a federal agency, shall be assessed and taxed under ORS 308.505 to 308.674.

      (4) Any aircraft that is required to be registered under ORS 837.040 for all or any part of the calendar year is exempt from ad valorem property taxation for the tax year beginning in the calendar year.

      (5) Any aircraft that is used or held for use by a foreign-owned carrier is exempt from ad valorem property taxation.

      (6) Subject to allocation or apportionment for out-of-state service, all other aircraft not otherwise specifically exempt from taxation or licensed in lieu thereof, and not subject to assessment by the Department of Revenue under ORS 308.505 to 308.674, shall be assessed in the county from which they are customarily operated when not in service, or if there is no customary place from which operated, then in the county in which their owner or owners reside, or if neither situs applies, then in the county in which any one of the owners maintains a place of business. [1987 c.601 §4; 1993 c.18 §70; 1995 c.79 §131; 2005 c.135 §1]

      308.560 Assessment roll; description of property; effect of mistake. (1) The assessment roll for the companies assessed under ORS 308.505 to 308.674 shall be prepared in a manner prescribed by the Department of Revenue.

      (2) The assessment roll prepared by the department under this section must include all of the following:

      (a) The name of each company assessed under ORS 308.505 to 308.674.

      (b) Under the name of each company, a general description of the property assessed in the name of the company. A general description under this paragraph is deemed to include all property of the company that is assessable under ORS 308.505 to 308.674. A general description under this paragraph may be in any form prescribed by the department and may refer to or incorporate by reference an order or memorandum made by the department that describes property of the company that is assessable under ORS 308.505 to 308.674.

      (c) Wherever possible, under the name of each company and under an appropriate heading, the aggregate track mileage, miles of wire, pipe or pole line, or the operational routes within the State of Oregon.

      (3) An assessment may not be invalidated because of a mistake related to the ownership, lease or usage of the property if the property is generally correctly described. [Amended by 1957 c.69 §1; 1957 c.711 §8; 1979 c.284 §136; 1997 c.154 §39; 2009 c.128 §7]

 

      308.565 Apportionment of assessment among counties. (1) For the purpose of determining the amount of the assessment of any centrally assessed company that is to be apportioned to those counties in this state in which the rail lines of the company are located, the Department of Revenue shall multiply the values per mile, as ascertained pursuant to ORS 308.570, of main and branch lines by the number of miles of main and branch lines in each county, including miles of main tracks, spurs, yard tracks and sidetracks, as reported by the company or as otherwise determined by the department.

      (2) The department shall apportion values distributed over wire, pipe or pole lines or operational routes to those counties in which the lines or routes are located by multiplying the rate per mile in each case, determined pursuant to ORS 308.575, by the number of miles of the wire, pipe or pole lines or operational routes in each county.

      (3) If the property of any company assessable under ORS 308.505 to 308.674 is of such a character that its value cannot reasonably be apportioned on the basis of rail, wire, pipe, pole line or operational route mileage, the department may adopt any other method or basis of apportionment to each county in which the property is located that the department determines to be feasible and proper.

      (4) As determined by the department, values of electric power plants and water powers, connected with or used in the operation and business of any company, assessable under ORS 308.505 to 308.674, may be apportioned to each county in which power plants and water powers are located in a manner the department deems reasonable and fair.

      (5) Assessments of the mobile property of air transportation companies shall be allocated and apportioned only to those counties in which the air transportation companies make service landings. For aircraft less than 75,000 pounds gross taxi weight, the department shall allocate and apportion to the counties 60 percent of the value which would otherwise be allocated and apportioned.

      (6)(a) Assessments of water transportation companies shall be allocated and apportioned to those counties in which such companies use or maintain ports or termini, including off-shore anchorages.

      (b) For purposes of ORS 308.505 to 308.674, the taxing districts to which assessments are apportioned by the county assessor shall be deemed to extend to the center of any river channel or to the ocean bar. [Amended by 1957 c.711 §9; 1987 c.601 §2; 1997 c.154 §40; 2009 c.128 §8]

 

      308.570 Determining value per mile of main and branch lines of companies using rail lines. (1) In the assessment of the property of any company conducting transportation or operating over rail lines, the Department of Revenue shall determine the value of each branch line of the company located within this state and the mileage of each branch line, including miles of main tracks, spurs, yard and sidetracks.

      (2) The department shall determine the values per mile of a branch line by dividing the value of the line by the mileage of the line.

      (3) The department shall deduct the total value of branch lines of the company from the total value of all centrally assessed property of the company. The department shall then determine the values per mile of the main line of the company by dividing the remainder by the number of miles of the main line, taking into consideration miles of main tracks, spurs, yard and sidetracks. Each mile of spurs, yard and sidetracks shall be valued at not to exceed 50 percent of the value per mile assigned to the main track of the branch or main line with which the spurs, yard and sidetracks are connected.

      (4) This section does not apply to small private railcar companies. [Amended by 1969 c.102 §2; 1991 c.459 §151; 1997 c.154 §41; 1999 c.223 §3; 2009 c.128 §9]

 

      308.575 Determining value per mile of property of companies using wire, pipe or pole lines or operational routes. The Department of Revenue may apportion the assessed value of the property of any company owning or using wire, pipe or pole lines, or operating over operational routes, over the wire, pipe or pole lines in such manner and at such rate or rates per mile as the department determines to be reasonable and fair. [Amended by 1981 c.804 §65; 1991 c.459 §152; 1997 c.541 §209; 2009 c.128 §10]

The department shall mail the notice of tentative assessment no later than May 25 of the assessment year.

      (2) The notice shall be mailed to the last-known address of the person or company.

      (3) A failure by the department to properly give the notice required by this section does not invalidate any assessment made by the department.

      308.584 Request for conference to modify tentative assessment; appeal.

      308.712 Methods to determine specially assessed value; election by owner; procedure; rules; fee. (1) The owner of multiunit rental housing that is subject to a government restriction on use and that is to be assessed under ORS 308.707 must elect the method by which the specially assessed value of the property is to be determined. The property owner must elect one of the following methods to determine the specially assessed value of the property:

      (a) Through an annual net operating income approach to value that uses actual income and stabilized operating expenses that are based on the actual history of the property (if available) and a capitalization rate. The income, expenses and capitalization rate used must be consistent with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and may be further defined by rules adopted by the Department of Revenue. Factors to be considered in setting a capitalization rate include the risks associated with multiunit rental housing subject to a government restriction on use, including but not limited to diminished ownership control, income generating potential and liquidity. The capitalization rate that is set pursuant to this paragraph must be equal to or greater than the capitalization rate used for valuing multiunit rental housing that is not subject to a government restriction on use;

      (b) By adjusting the unrestricted market value of the property being specially assessed, computed without regard to any government restriction on use applicable to the property, based on the ratio of the average annual rent of those dwelling units of the property that are subject to a government restriction on use to the average annual rent of comparable multiunit rental housing that is not subject to a government restriction on use; or

      (c) Through an alternate method for determining the specially assessed value of multiunit rental housing that is subject to a government restriction on use that may be adopted by the department by rule.

      (2)(a) An election under this section must be made at the time an application for special assessment is filed under ORS 308.709, and is considered to be a part of the application.

      (b) A property owner may change the election the owner previously made. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a new election under this section must be made on or before April 1 preceding the tax year for which the new election applies. The election shall be made in writing to the county assessor of the county in which the property is located, in the form prescribed by the department.

      (c) The election form must be accompanied by a written statement of the actual income and stabilized operating expenses of the property, as described in subsection (1)(a) of this section.

      (3) A change in election may be made after April 1 and on or before December 31 of the tax year, if the election form is accompanied by a late filing fee equal to the greater of $200 or one-tenth of one percent of the real market value of the property to which the election relates, as of the assessment date for that tax year. [2001 c.605 §6]

 

      308.714 Disqualification; notification requirements; penalties; rules; reapplication; new property or new improvements. (1) An owner of property assessed under ORS 308.707 must notify the county assessor if:

      (b) New property is constructed at the location of the multiunit rental housing, or new improvements are made to the multiunit rental housing;

      (c) An event described in ORS 308.146 (3)(b) or (c) occurs with respect to the multiunit rental housing; or

      (d) The owner chooses not to have the property assessed under ORS 308.707.

      (2) The notification must be made within 60 days following the date on which the circumstance described in subsection (1) of this section occurred.

      (5)(a) Property shall be disqualified from special assessment under ORS 308.707 as of the tax year immediately following any change, event or choice described in subsection (1)(a), (c) or (d) of this section.

      (b) Following disqualification for any change or event described in subsection (1)(a) or (c) of this section, a property owner may apply for special assessment pursuant to ORS 308.709.

      (c) Following disqualification for a choice described in subsection (1)(d) of this section, a property owner may reapply only once for special assessment pursuant to ORS 308.709 within the 10-year period following the year in which the property was first qualified for special assessment. An owner may not reapply for special assessment pursuant to ORS 308.709 after the end of that 10-year period.

      (6) New property constructed at the location of the multiunit rental housing or new improvements made to the multiunit rental housing may qualify for special assessment under ORS 308.707 only if the property owner files an application under ORS 308.709 in the time and manner prescribed by ORS 308.709. Notwithstanding ORS 308.712, the new property or new improvements, if otherwise qualified for special assessment, must be specially assessed using the method elected by the property owner for the existing multiunit rental housing.

      (2) The owner as of January 1 of each year of a mobile modular unit that is taxed as personal property shall submit no later than the following March 1 a statement of the value of the unit and of its location. The owner shall submit the statement to the county assessor of the county in which the unit is located on January 1 of the year for which the statement is submitted. An owner who fails to provide the statement is subject to the late filing penalty as provided in ORS 308.295. The Department of Revenue shall prescribe the form of statement.

      308.875 Manufactured structures classified as real or personal property; effect of classification on other transactions.

If the manufactured structure is owned separately and apart from the land upon which it is located, the assessor shall assess and tax the manufactured structure as personal property. A change in the property classification of a manufactured structure for ad valorem tax purposes does not change the property classification of the structure with respect to any transactions between the owner and security interest holders or other persons. Manufactured structures classified as personal property need not be returned under ORS 308.290.
