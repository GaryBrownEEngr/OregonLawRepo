In order to be a clerical error, the information necessary to make the correction must be contained in the minutes of the board. Such errors include, but are not limited to, arithmetic and copying errors and omission or misstatement of identification of property.

      (b) “Error of jurisdiction” means an error in an order resulting from a board’s failure to correctly apply the board’s authority as granted under ORS 309.026.

      309.203 Real market value standard; compliance; recommendations or orders by department; examination of ratio study; action if standard in jeopardy. (1) On or before June 15 of each year, the Department of Revenue shall give specific written recommendations or orders to the county assessor as to the actions which, in the department’s judgment, should be taken by the assessor in order to achieve compliance with the real market value standard required under ORS 308.232 in the forthcoming assessment roll. Copies shall be sent to the county governing body for their information. On or before July 15 following, the county assessor shall act upon the recommendations or orders of the department, or notify the department in writing, of any objections to the department’s recommendations or orders.

      (2) After May 1, but prior to September 1, the department shall examine the certified ratio study prepared by each county assessor under ORS 309.200 and studies prepared by the department, to determine if the value of all locally assessed taxable properties complies with the real market value requirements of ORS 308.232. The assessor and the department shall cooperate with each other to keep the department informed as to the assessor’s needs and as to the status of the current assessment work. If, in the judgment of the department, the attainment of the real market value standard required under ORS 308.232 is in jeopardy, the department shall notify the assessor in writing of the determination and the factors giving rise to it, with the statement that if unfulfilled statutory duties specified by the department are not met, the department shall take action pursuant to this section. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the county governing body, for its information. On or before September 1, the department shall issue a written order to the assessor to adjust the classes of property on the assessment roll:

      (a) If the department finds that the ratio of all taxable properties deviates more than five percent from the real market value level required by ORS 308.232, the department shall order an adjustment to the real market values that will result in compliance with ORS 308.232. The assessor shall apply the adjustment to real market values on the assessment roll and compute corrected assessed values if necessary. A tolerance of five percent from 100 percent may be presumed by the department to meet the requirements of ORS 308.232. Notwithstanding satisfactory compliance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this subsection, the department shall take any action necessary to achieve the real market value level required by ORS 308.232.

      (b) If the department finds that the real market value for any class of property provided for under ORS 308.215 deviates more than 10 percent from 100 percent of real market value for the class, the department shall order a change of values to bring the class to 100 percent of real market value. The order may be made applicable to the class throughout the county or to the class in specific areas of the county and may take into account variations caused by appraisals being made in different years.

      (c) If the department’s order results in a valuation increase, the increase may be appealed in the manner provided by ORS 309.100.

      (3) If the department orders an adjustment to the real market values of property under subsection (2) of this section, the department shall immediately give notice to the assessor, showing why the adjustment is ordered. [Formerly 309.035; 2001 c.509 §1]
