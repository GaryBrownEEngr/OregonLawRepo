(Procedure to Certify Taxes and Determine Tax Rates)

 

      310.055 Operating taxes. (1) As used in the property tax laws of this state, “operating taxes” means ad valorem property taxes that are subject to a permanent rate limit under section 11, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, or statutory rate limit under ORS 310.236 (4) or 310.237, if applicable.

      (2) For the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, operating taxes consist of the sum of the following (or such lesser amount as is certified to the assessor under ORS 310.206 (4)(b):

      (a) The total amount of ad valorem property taxes as provided in ORS 310.200 to 310.242, except that the amount under this paragraph does not include:

      (A) Local option taxes;

      (B) Ad valorem property taxes used to repay taxing district bond or pension and disability plan obligations described in section 11 (5), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution;

      (C) Ad valorem property taxes that would otherwise be subject to this paragraph, except that the taxes are of a taxing district other than a city, county or school district, and are used to support a hospital facility;

      (D) Ad valorem property taxes that would otherwise be subject to this paragraph, except that the levy of the taxes was approved by voters prior to December 5, 1996, that met the voter participation requirements in section 11 (8), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, and that are first imposed in the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, or July 1, 1997;

      (E) Serial or one-year levies described in ORS 280.040 to 280.140 (1995 Edition) that replace levies that were imposed in the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, that were approved by voters in an election held after December 4, 1996, and that are first imposed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, if the rate or the amount of the levy is not greater than the rate or the amount of the replaced levy;

      (F) Taxes imposed to pay principal and interest on exempt bonded indebtedness; and

      (G) Urban renewal increment taxes; and

      (b) The total amount of the following ad valorem property taxes, without reduction under ORS 310.200 to 310.242:

      (A) Ad valorem property taxes of a taxing district other than a city, county or school district that are used to support a hospital facility;

      (B) Ad valorem property taxes approved by voters prior to December 5, 1996, that met the voter participation requirements in section 11 (8), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, and that are first imposed in the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, or July 1, 1997; and

      (C) Serial or one-year levies described in ORS 280.040 to 280.140 (1995 Edition) that replace levies that were imposed in the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, that were approved by voters after December 4, 1996, and that are first imposed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, if the rate or the amount of the levy is not greater than the rate or the amount of the replaced levy.

      (3) For tax years beginning on or after July 1, 1998, each taxing district is authorized to levy the full amount of the operating taxes of the district on all taxable property within the boundaries of the district. Operating taxes consist of:

      (a) Ad valorem property taxes imposed at the rate established as the permanent rate limit or statutory rate limit, if applicable, for the taxing district or such lesser rate or amount as the taxing district certifies to the assessor under ORS 310.060; or

      (b) If the district is imposing operating property taxes for the first time, ad valorem property taxes imposed at the rate established in the manner provided for by law as the permanent rate limit for the district or such lesser rate or amount as the taxing district may determine. [1997 c.541 §321; 1999 c.21 §24; 1999 c.186 §4; 2001 c.114 §23; 2013 c.420 §7]

 

      310.060 Notice certifying taxes; contents; extension of time to give notice or correct erroneous certification. (1) Not later than July 15 of each year, a city, school district or other public corporation authorized to levy or impose a tax on property shall file a written notice certifying the ad valorem property tax rate or the estimated amount of ad valorem property taxes to be imposed by the taxing district and any other taxes on property imposed by the taxing district on property subject to ad valorem property taxation that are required or authorized to be placed on the assessment and tax roll for the current fiscal year. The notice must be accompanied by two copies of a lawfully adopted ordinance or resolution that categorizes the tax, fee, charge, assessment or toll as subject to or not subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, identified by the categories set forth in ORS 310.150.

      (2) For ad valorem property taxes levied by a taxing district, the notice required under subsection (1) of this section must state as separate items:

      (a) The taxing district’s rate or amount of ad valorem property taxation that is within the permanent rate limitation imposed by section 11 (3), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, or within the statutory rate limit determined in ORS 310.236 (4)(b) or 310.237, if applicable;

      (b) The total rate or amount of the taxing district’s local option taxes imposed pursuant to ORS 280.040 to 280.145 that have a term of five years or less and that are not for capital projects;

      (c) The total rate or amount of the taxing district’s local option taxes that are for capital projects;

      (d) The total amount levied for the payment of bonded indebtedness or interest on bonded indebtedness that is not subject to limitation under section 11 (11) or section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution; and

      (e) The total amount levied that is subject to section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, but that is not subject to the permanent ad valorem property tax rate limit described in section 11 (3), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, because the amount levied is to be used to repay:

      (A) Principal and interest for a bond issued before December 5, 1996, and secured by a pledge or explicit commitment of ad valorem property taxes or a covenant to levy or collect ad valorem property taxes;

      (B) Principal and interest for any other formal, written borrowing of moneys executed before December 5, 1996, for which ad valorem property tax revenues have been pledged or explicitly committed, or that are secured by a covenant to levy or collect ad valorem property taxes;

      (C) Principal and interest for a bond issued to refund an obligation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph; or

      (D) Local government pension and disability plan obligations that commit ad valorem property taxes.

      (3)(a) The notice required under subsection (1) of this section must list each rate or amount subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, identified by the categories set forth in ORS 310.150.

      (b) If an item described in subsection (2) of this section is allocable to more than one category described in ORS 310.150, the notice must list separately the portion of each item allocable to each category.

      (4) For other taxes on property imposed by the taxing district, the notice must state:

      (a) The total amount of money to be raised by each other tax, in the aggregate or on a property by property basis, as appropriate.

      (b) Each amount that is subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, identified by the categories set forth in ORS 310.150.

      (5) For a district authorized by law to place other fees, charges, assessments or tolls on the assessment and tax roll, the notice must state the total amount of money to be raised on a property by property basis.

      (6) In addition to the notice required under subsection (1) of this section, a taxing district that is subject to the Local Budget Law shall also provide the documents required under ORS 294.458 (3).

      (7) Not later than July 15 of each year, the taxing district shall give the notice and documents described in this section to the assessor of the county in which the principal office of the taxing district is located and, if the taxing district is located in more than one county, to the assessor of each county in which any part of the taxing district is located.

      (8) The Department of Revenue shall prescribe the form of notice required under this section. All amounts contained in the notice must be stated in dollars and cents or ad valorem property tax rates in dollars and cents per thousand dollars of assessed value, as required by law. If the notice is given to the assessor, clerk or tax supervising and conservation commission of more than one county, a copy of each other such notice given must accompany every notice given.

      (9) For good and sufficient reason, a county assessor may extend the time for the giving of the notice required under subsection (1) of this section or correcting an erroneous certification for the current year up to but not later than October 1 as the county assessor considers reasonable. [Amended by 1955 c.259 §1; 1967 c.293 §4; 1973 c.333 §2; 1979 c.241 §28a; 1981 c.790 §12; 1985 c.784 §2; 1991 c.459 §218; 1993 c.270 §44; 1995 c.293 §1; 1997 c.154 §5; 1997 c.541 §244; 1999 c.186 §5; 1999 c.632 §23; 2001 c.135 §31; 2001 c.695 §32; 2001 c.753 §7; 2005 c.750 §1; 2007 c.894 §2; 2011 c.473 §26; 2013 c.420 §8]

 

      310.061 Assessor to determine and report maximum school district operating tax when district certifies lesser rate; determination modified if district divided into zones. (1) If a school district certifies a rate pursuant to ORS 310.060 that is less than the maximum rate of operating taxes allowed by law, the county assessor for each county within which the school district is located shall determine the amount of operating taxes that would have been imposed by the school district if the school district had certified the maximum rate of operating taxes allowed by law.

      (2) If a school district has established tax zones pursuant to ORS 328.570 to 328.579, solely for purposes of subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) The maximum rate of operating tax allowed by law shall be determined for each tax zone of the district; and

      (b) The maximum rate of operating tax for a tax zone in which the district does not provide all of kindergarten through grade 12 education shall equal the maximum rate of operating tax for the district multiplied by the percentage established for the zone in the resolution adopted under ORS 328.576.

      (3) Each county assessor who is required to calculate an amount under subsection (1) of this section shall report that amount to the Department of Education. [1999 c.186 §12; 2001 c.246 §7]

 

      Note: 310.061 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 310 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      310.065 Procedure where notice not given. If the written notice of a taxing district’s ad valorem property tax or other tax is not given to the county assessor at the time specified, or as extended, under ORS 310.060, the assessor shall not include the tax in the computation of the total district tax rate under ORS 310.090. [Formerly part of 310.050; 1993 c.270 §45; 1997 c.541 §246]

 

      310.070 Procedure when taxes exceed limitations or are incorrectly categorized. (1) If the ad valorem property taxes reported to the clerk, assessor or tax supervising and conservation commission under ORS 310.060 are in excess of the constitutional or statutory limitations, or both, the assessor, upon the advice of the Department of Revenue, shall extend upon the tax roll of the county only such part of the taxes as will comply with the constitutional and statutory limitations and requirements governing the taxes.

      (2) If any part of the taxes on property certified under ORS 310.060 is incorrectly categorized as subject to or not subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the Department of Revenue shall notify the taxing unit governing body and the county assessor and the county assessor shall extend the taxes on the roll in a manner that complies with the Oregon Constitution. For purposes of this section, taxes are incorrectly categorized only if:

      (a) The sole authority of the taxing unit to impose taxes on property is provided by statute and the statute does not authorize the imposition of taxes on property categorized as reported under ORS 310.060; or

      (b) The Oregon Tax Court or the Oregon Supreme Court has finally determined the correct manner in which a tax on property of the taxing unit should be categorized and that determination is different from the category reported under ORS 310.060. For purposes of this paragraph, “finally determined” means that the Oregon Tax Court has entered a decision which has become final as described under ORS 305.440 or that, upon appeal from the Oregon Tax Court, the Supreme Court has entered a decision.

      (3) If any item certifying ad valorem property taxes under ORS 310.060 incorrectly characterizes the item attributes under section 11, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the Department of Revenue shall notify the taxing district governing body and the county assessor, and the county assessor shall extend the taxes on the roll in a manner that complies with the Oregon Constitution. [Amended by 1967 c.293 §5; 1971 c.646 §3; 1981 c.790 §13; 1983 s.s. c.5 §19; 1985 c.319 §2; 1993 c.270 §46; 1997 c.541 §247; 2005 c.750 §2]

 

      310.080 [Repealed by 1957 c.626 §1]

 

      310.081 [Subsections (1) and (2) of 1961 Replacement Part enacted as 1957 c.626 §11; subsection (3) of 1957 Replacement Part enacted as part of 1957 s.s. c.2 §4; 1959 c.388 §9; repealed by 1963 c.570 §33]

      310.084 [1957 c.626 §12; repealed by 1963 c.570 §33]

 

      310.090 Computation of rate for each item of tax; category rates; total rates. (1) Subject to ORS 310.070, the county assessor shall compute the rate for each item of ad valorem property taxes, the category rate of ad valorem property taxes for each category described in ORS 310.150 and the total rate of ad valorem property taxes for each taxing district as provided in this section.

      (2) If the item of tax that is reported on the notice filed under ORS 310.060 is an amount, the rate of tax for that item shall be computed by dividing the amount by the assessed value used to compute the tax rate. The assessed value used to compute the tax rate is the tax levying district’s assessed value adjusted as otherwise provided by law.

      (3) The computed tax rates under subsection (2) of this section or as reported on the notice filed under ORS 310.060 shall be carried to the number of decimal places specified by rule of the Department of Revenue and truncated. The truncated rate shall be expressed as a rate per thousand dollars of assessed value.

      (4) All of the taxing district’s taxes that are reported on the notice filed under ORS 310.060 as rates and that are within the same category under ORS 310.150 shall be added together and added to the rates computed under subsection (2) of this section that are within the same category to obtain the category rates for the taxing district.

      (5) The total tax rate of the district shall be the total of the truncated tax rates calculated for the taxing district for the year. [Amended by 1967 c.293 §11; 1991 c.459 §221; 1997 c.541 §248]

 

      310.100 Taxes to apply to property shown by assessment roll; furnishing certificate showing aggregate valuation of taxable property. Each ad valorem property tax of a taxing district shall apply to all the taxable property of the district, or to all the taxable property in a tax zone of a district that has established two or more tax zones within the district, as shown by the assessment roll last compiled by the assessor. The assessor, upon the application of the governing body or of the duly accredited officer of any such taxing district, shall furnish a certificate, properly verified, showing the aggregate valuation of the taxable property therein. [Amended by 1991 c.459 §222; 1997 c.541 §250; 2001 c.246 §8; 2001 c.553 §6]

 

      310.105 Rate adjustments to reflect nontimber offsets; no effect on permanent or statutory rate limits. (1) If a taxing district lying in two or more counties is entitled to offsets which have been provided by statute, the rates determined under ORS 310.090 shall be further adjusted to reflect the offsets.

      (2) Adjustments under this section shall be made to ensure that the rate of taxation is uniform throughout the taxing district.

      (3) Adjustments made under this section shall not affect the permanent rate limit determined for purposes of section 11 (3), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, or the statutory rate limit determined in ORS 310.236 (4)(b) or 310.237, if applicable. [1971 c.720 §1; 1977 c.892 §37; 1979 c.438 §4; 1993 c.801 §37; 1997 c.541 §251; 1999 c.186 §6]

 

      310.108 [1997 c.541 §252; 1999 c.1078 §§33,33b; repealed by 2003 c.621 §26]

 

      310.110 Apportionment of taxes where taxing district lies in two or more counties; estimates. (1) If a taxing district lies in two or more counties, and the district certifies an item of ad valorem property tax as an amount in the notice required under ORS 310.060, the amount certified by the district shall be apportioned on the basis of the assessed value used to compute the tax rate for the current tax year, in the proportion that the assessed value of the part of the district lying in each county bears to the assessed value of the whole district. However, if a boundary change affecting the district becomes effective as to the levy being apportioned, an adjustment of the assessed value shall be made so as to reflect the boundary change.

      (2) Any assessor who is unable to certify the current assessed value for any joint district lying partially in the county by September 25 shall, with the cooperation of the Department of Revenue, estimate as closely as practicable the assessed value of that district for the purpose of apportioning the ad valorem property taxes of the joint district in the current year as equitably as is possible. The estimate shall be completed and certified to the assessor or assessors of the other counties on the fifth business day after September 25 and shall be used as the basis for the apportionment required by this section.

      310.140 Legislative findings; definitions. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that Article XI, section 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, was drafted by citizens and placed before the voters of the State of Oregon by initiative petition. Article XI, section 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, uses terms that do not have established legal meanings and require definition by the Legislative Assembly. Article XI, section 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, was amended by Article XI, section 11 (11), of the Oregon Constitution. This section is intended to interpret the terms of Article XI, section 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, as originally adopted and as amended by Article XI, section 11 (11), of the Oregon Constitution, consistent with the intent of the people in adopting these provisions, so that the provisions of Article XI, section 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, may be given effect uniformly throughout the State of Oregon, with minimal confusion and misunderstanding by citizens and affected units of government.

      (B) The goods or services are provided only on the specific request of the property owner; or

      (C) The goods or services are provided by the government unit only after the individual property owner has failed to meet routine obligations of ownership of the affected property, and such action is deemed necessary by an appropriate government unit to enforce regulations pertaining to health or safety.

[1991 c.459 §210; 1997 c.541 §258; 1999 c.21 §25; 1999 c.90 §33; 2001 c.660 §28; 2003 c.46 §24; 2003 c.77 §6; 2003 c.195 §23; 2003 c.802 §63; 2005 c.832 §18; 2007 c.614 §6; 2007 c.783 §125; 2008 c.45 §7; 2009 c.5 §17; 2009 c.909 §17; 2010 c.82 §17; 2011 c.7 §17; 2012 c.31 §17; 2013 c.377 §17; 2013 c.491 §1; 2014 c.52 §19; 2017 c.17 §27]

 

      310.143 Certification of taxes on taxable property subject to 1990 Measure 5 limits; refunds of taxes on property not certified, erroneously certified or certified by nongovernmental entity. (1) Any tax on property that is imposed on property that is subject to ad valorem taxation by any unit of local government shall be certified to the assessor each year, as provided under ORS 310.060. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, any tax, fee, charge or assessment that is not a tax on property or is not imposed on property subject to ad valorem taxation shall not be certified to the assessor. Each tax certified shall be certified in whichever of the following forms is applicable:

      (a) In dollars and cents in either the total amount to be raised from all property in the unit;

      (b) In dollars and cents per property; or

      (c) As a rate per $1,000 of assessed value.

      (2) If any unit of local government imposes on property that is subject to ad valorem taxation a tax on property, as defined in ORS 310.140, that is not certified to the assessor under ORS 310.060 for imposition and collection, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the tax is subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the unit of local government shall pay any refunds ordered by the court. No refunds shall be paid from the unsegregated tax collections account, and the assessor shall not be required to redetermine the amount of other taxes imposed on any property that also is subject to the challenged tax.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 311.806, when any unit of local government certifies a tax on property to be collected by the tax collector, and the amount of the tax on individual properties is calculated by the unit of local government, any claim for refund of such taxes due to an error in calculation of the amount of the tax shall be made to the unit of local government within the same time and in the same manner as claims for refund are to be made under ORS 311.806. The unit of local government shall pay any refunds it determines to be due to errors in calculation of the amount of the tax out of the funds available to the unit of local government. Such refunds shall not be paid from the unsegregated tax collections account, and the assessor shall not be required to redetermine the amount of other taxes imposed on the property for which the refund is made.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 311.806, when any entity that is not a unit of local government certifies an amount specifically authorized by law to be included on the roll to be collected by the tax collector, and the amount on individual properties is calculated by the entity, any claim for refund of the amount due to an error in calculation of the amount shall be made to the entity within the same time and in the same manner as claims for refunds are to be made under ORS 311.806 (2). The entity shall pay any refunds it determines to be due to errors in calculation of the amount out of the funds available to the entity. The refunds shall not be paid from the unsegregated tax collections account, and the assessor shall not be required to redetermine the amount of other taxes imposed on the property for which the refund is made. [1991 c.459 §211; 1993 c.270 §48; 1995 c.256 §9; 1997 c.541 §259]

 

      310.145 Ordinance or resolution classifying and categorizing taxes subject to 1990 Measure 5 limits. (1) Each unit of local government that imposes a tax, fee, charge or assessment may adopt an ordinance or resolution classifying all or any of the taxes, fees, charges and assessments it imposes as being in one or more of the following categories:

      (a) Taxes on property subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, and within this category, those taxes that are dedicated to funding the public school system, and those that are imposed to support other government operations.

      (b) Incurred charges.

      (c) Assessments for local improvements.

      (d) Taxes to pay principal and interest on exempt bonded indebtedness.

      (e) All other taxes, fees, charges and assessments that are not subject to the limits of section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (2) An ordinance or resolution adopted under this section shall serve as notice of the classification of taxes, fees, charges and assessments for purposes of ORS 305.580 to 305.591. [1991 c.459 §212; 1993 c.270 §49]

 

      310.147 Code area system; tentative consolidated tax rates per category; total consolidated code area rates after adjustment; recordation on assessment roll. (1) Each year, the county assessor shall establish a system of code areas, identified by code numbers, which shall represent all of the various combinations of taxing districts, or tax zones of taxing districts in which district taxes differ, as of July 1 of that year in which a piece of property was located in the county on January 1 of that year.

      (2) The assessor shall compute a tentative consolidated ad valorem property tax rate for each code area. The tentative consolidated ad valorem property tax rate for the code area shall be determined for each category under ORS 310.150. The tentative consolidated ad valorem property tax rate for each category for the code area shall be the sum of the category rates determined under ORS 310.090 for each taxing district in the code area.

      (3)(a) The assessor shall compute the consolidated category rate for each category under ORS 310.150 using the ad valorem property taxes to be imposed on each property after adjustment under ORS 310.150. In the case of the exempt bonded indebtedness category, the tentative consolidated category rate for the code area shall be the consolidated category rate for the code area.

      (b) The total consolidated rate for the code area shall equal the sum of the consolidated rates for each category determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection after adjustment under ORS 310.150.

      (4) The assessor shall indicate on the assessment roll the code area number for each item of property assessed. In addition, the assessor shall compile in duplicate a list of all code areas and their numbers and identify for each area the names of each taxing district in the area, the rate, after adjustment under ORS 310.150, for each item of the taxing district reported on the notice filed under ORS 310.060, the total rate for each taxing district and by category as described in ORS 310.150 and the total consolidated rate for the code area. The list shall constitute a part of the certificate prepared under ORS 311.105, to be delivered to the county clerk and to the tax collector. [Formerly 308.221; 2001 c.246 §9; 2001 c.553 §7; 2003 c.621 §104]

 

      310.150 Segregation into categories; category limits; determination whether amount of taxes on property is within limits; method of reducing taxes to meet limits. (1) The three categories within which ad valorem property tax items are to be categorized in the notice to be filed under ORS 310.060 and for which category rates of ad valorem property taxes are to be computed under ORS 310.090 and tentative consolidated category rates are to be computed for each code area under ORS 310.147 are as follows:

      (a) Taxes levied or imposed for the purpose of funding exempt bonded indebtedness.

      (b) Taxes levied or imposed for the purpose of funding the public school system and that are not described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) Taxes levied or imposed for the purpose of funding government operations other than public school system operations and that are not described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (2) After computation of the tentative ad valorem property tax consolidated rate for each category under ORS 310.147, and after calculation of the amount of ad valorem property taxes to be imposed on properties in the county, but before extending any taxes on the assessment and tax roll, the assessor shall determine whether the total amount of taxes on property to be imposed on each property in the code area in each category is within the limits described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (3)(a) The assessor shall determine whether the ad valorem property taxes to be imposed on any property exceed the limits described in this subsection in order to ensure, as guaranteed in section 11 (11) and 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, that taxes imposed in each geographic area taxed by the same local taxing districts do not exceed $5 (public school system) and $10 (other government) per $1,000 of real market value.

      (b) For the category of taxes imposed for the purpose of funding the public school system that are not for the purpose of paying principal and interest on exempt bonded indebtedness, if the tentative consolidated ad valorem property tax rate determined under subsection (2) of this section exceeds $5 per $1,000 of real market value, the consolidated rate shall be adjusted as provided in this section so that the consolidated rate for the public school system category equals $5 per $1,000 of real market value.

      (c) For the category of taxes imposed for the purpose of funding government operations other than the public school system and that are not for the purpose of paying principal and interest on exempt bonded indebtedness, if the tentative consolidated ad valorem property tax rate exceeds $10 per $1,000 of real market value, the consolidated rate shall be adjusted as provided in this section so that the consolidated rate for the other government category equals $10 per $1,000 of real market value.

      (d) For the category of taxes imposed for the purpose of paying principal and interest on exempt bonded indebtedness, the tentative consolidated rate determined under subsection (2) of this section shall be the consolidated rate for the exempt bonded indebtedness category.

      (4) If the taxes on property in either category to be imposed on any property in the code area exceed the limit established for that category in subsection (3) of this section, the assessor shall reduce the taxes by applying a reduction ratio.

      (5)(a) If local option taxes described under ORS 280.040 to 280.145 have been adopted by one or more taxing districts in the code area, the reduction ratio shall be calculated under this subsection and applied only to the local option taxes imposed on the property for which the taxes are being determined.

      (b) Local option taxes subject to compression under this subsection include urban renewal division of tax revenue that is derived from the division of local option tax authority.

      (c) The numerator of the reduction ratio shall be the amount obtained (but not less than zero) by subtracting the tentative consolidated category rate of ad valorem property taxes that are not local option taxes from the maximum rate of ad valorem property taxes for the category described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (d) The denominator for the ratio shall be the total rate of all local option taxes for the category.

      (e) The assessor shall multiply the reduction ratio determined under this subsection by each local option tax amount to which the property is subject in the category.

      (f) So reduced, the assessor shall again determine if the total taxes for the category to be imposed on the property exceed the limits described in subsection (3) of this section. If the reduced taxes for the category do not exceed the category limit, such taxes shall be the taxes used to compute the consolidated rate for the code area in which the property is located. If the reduced taxes for the category still exceed the category limit after all local option taxes have been eliminated, the taxes in the category shall be subject to further reduction under subsection (6) of this section.

      (6)(a) If the property is not subject to local option taxes or if all local option taxes have been eliminated as a result of the application of the reduction ratio calculated under subsection (5) of this section, and the tentative consolidated rate determined under ORS 310.147 for the category exceeds the maximum rate of ad valorem property taxes for the category described in subsection (3) of this section, the reduction ratio shall be determined under this subsection.

      (b) The numerator of the reduction ratio shall be the maximum rate permitted for the category described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (c) The denominator of the reduction ratio shall be the tentative consolidated category rate under ORS 310.147 (or the category rate applicable to the property after the reduction under subsection (5) of this section, if applicable).

      (d) The assessor shall multiply the reduction ratio determined under this subsection by the amount of each taxing district item of ad valorem property tax that is a component of the tentative consolidated category rate for the code area in which the property is located.

      (7) In determining whether the taxes described in subsection (1)(c) of this section exceed the limitation under subsection (3)(c) of this section, all moneys raised through the urban renewal special levy described in ORS 457.435 and all moneys raised through the urban renewal division of tax, including amounts derived from exempt bonded indebtedness authority and local option tax authority, must be categorized as subject to the limitation described in subsection (3)(c) of this section. [1991 c.459 §213; 1997 c.541 §260; 2003 c.198 §1]

 

      310.153 Total amount to be raised for each taxing district and item; basis for assessor’s certificate. (1) The assessor shall determine the total amount to be raised for each taxing district in the code area and, for the total amount for each taxing district, the amount for each item that is listed in the taxing district’s notice filed under ORS 310.060.

      (2) The amounts determined under this section shall serve as the basis for the assessor’s certificate prepared under ORS 311.105. [1997 c.541 §263]

 

      Note: 310.153 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 310 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

(1) For any unit of property partially exempt from tax under ORS 307.250, 307.370 or 308.459 or any other law, the assessor shall determine the maximum amount of taxes on property to be imposed on such unit of property under ORS 310.150, by using the lesser of the real market value or the taxable value of the unit of property after the exemption has been applied.

      310.200 Purpose. The purpose of ORS 310.200 to 310.242 is to set forth the procedure by which tax reductions caused by implementation of section 11, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, and caused by additional statutory reductions, for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, are to be distributed to the property taxpayers and taxing districts of this state and to derive each district’s permanent rate limit for operating taxes and statutory rate limit for operating taxes for tax years beginning on or after July 1, 1997. [1997 c.541 §20]

      310.204 “Hospital facility” defined. In order to determine if ad valorem property taxes are used to support a hospital facility and therefore are subject to section 11 (6), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the term “hospital facility” means a facility with an organized medical staff, with permanent facilities that include inpatient beds, and with medical services, including physician services and continuous nursing services under the supervision of registered nurses, providing diagnosis and medical or surgical treatment primarily for but not limited to acutely ill patients and accident victims.

      310.210 Measure 5 imposed tax estimate. (1) After the assessor has received all certifications of levy under ORS 310.206 for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, the assessor shall first calculate the Measure 5 imposed tax estimate under this section.

      (2) The assessor shall compute ad valorem property taxes on each property under the property tax laws of this state as set forth in the Oregon Revised Statutes (1995 Edition), including section 11, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution (1995 Edition), as further modified by the property tax laws of this state applicable to the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, except for the following laws:

      (B) Urban renewal taxes; and

      (C) Taxes imposed to pay qualified taxing district obligations, as calculated under subsection (3) of this section.

      (b) The assessor shall calculate the dollar value of offsets against ad valorem property taxes for the tax year beginning July 1, 1995, and shall add to the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection each property’s share of such offsets if:

      (A) The county contains a taxing district with offsets from appeals for the tax year beginning July 1, 1995, that exceed 10 percent of the district’s net levy for the tax year beginning July 1, 1995; and

      (3)(a) The amount subtracted for qualified taxing district obligations under subsection (2)(a)(C) of this section shall be determined for each category described in ORS 310.150.

      (b) For each category, the assessor shall multiply the total amount imposed by a district on a property, less those taxes described in subsection (2)(a)(A) and (B) of this section, by a ratio, the numerator of which is the total amount of qualified obligations that were certified by the district for the tax year beginning July 1, 1995, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the district’s imposed taxes, other than taxes imposed to pay principal and interest on exempt bonded indebtedness and urban renewal taxes, in the category.

      (c) The total of the amounts determined under this subsection for all three categories shall be the amount subtracted under subsection (2)(a)(C) of this section.

      (4) The assessor shall reduce the amount determined under subsection (2) of this section by 10 percent.

      (5) The assessor shall determine for each property the value that has been added to the assessment roll for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, that is attributable to changes in the value of the property for the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, or July 1, 1997, as the result of:

      (a) New property or improvements to property;

      (b) A partition or subdivision of property;

      (6) The assessor shall divide the amount determined in subsection (4) of this section by the Measure 5 value in the code area on the assessment roll for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, reduced by the total value determined in the code area under subsection (5) of this section to arrive at a Measure 47 comparison tax rate.

      (7)(a) The assessor shall multiply the total value determined for each property under subsection (5) of this section by the Measure 47 comparison tax rate in the code area determined under subsection (6) of this section.

      (b) The assessor shall add the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection to the amount determined in subsection (4) of this section to arrive at the total amount of Measure 47 comparison taxes for each property.

      (c) The assessor shall total the amounts determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection for all property in the code area to determine the total Measure 47 comparison taxes for the code area.

      (8) The assessor shall allocate the Measure 47 comparison taxes to each taxing district in the code area in the proportion that each taxing district’s share of the Measure 5 imposed tax estimate in the code area (excluding taxes for exempt bonded indebtedness and urban renewal and the amount certified for qualified taxing district obligations) bears to the total Measure 5 imposed taxes for the code area (excluding taxes for exempt bonded indebtedness and urban renewal and the amount certified for qualified taxing district obligations). The total of the amounts so allocated to a district from all of the district’s code areas shall be the taxing district’s Measure 47 comparison tax.

      (9) If the taxing district is other than a city, county or school district and supports a hospital facility through ad valorem property taxes, the Measure 47 comparison tax shall be further adjusted by subtracting the allocated portion of taxes used to support a hospital facility from the total amount allocated to the district under subsection (8) of this section.

      (10) The Measure 47 comparison tax shall be further adjusted by subtracting the allocated portion of taxes that are imposed pursuant to an operating tax levy approved by voters prior to December 5, 1996, in an election and for which property taxes are first imposed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, or July 1, 1997, if the levy was approved by voters in an election:

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 310.212, the Measure 47 comparison taxes of a taxing district described in subsection (1) of this section shall be increased by reducing the preliminary reduction percentage in ORS 310.218 by each percentage point, or fraction thereof, that the additions to value in the district identified in subsection (1)(b) of this section exceed 10 percent. [1997 c.541 §25a]

      310.222 Computation of 1997 Measure 50 reduction and supplemental statutory reduction; certification to assessor. (1) Upon receipt of all certifications made under ORS 310.220, the Department of Revenue shall compute:

      (a) A statewide constitutional reduction percentage for pre-reduction Measure 50 taxes so as to achieve a statewide average reduction in Measure 50 taxes of 17 percent; and

      (b) A supplemental statutory reduction percentage so as to achieve a statewide average reduction of 17 percent in all of the following taxes:

      (A) Pre-reduction Measure 50 taxes;

      (B) Taxes used to pay qualified obligations of the taxing districts, if the qualified obligations consist of local government pension and disability plan obligations;

      (C) Urban renewal taxes other than urban renewal taxes used to pay principal and interest on bonded indebtedness; and

      (D) An operating tax levy approved by voters prior to December 5, 1996, and for which property taxes are first imposed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, or July 1, 1997, if the levy was approved by voters in an election:

      (i) In which at least 50 percent of registered voters eligible to vote in the election cast a ballot; or

      (ii) That was the general election in an even-numbered year.

      (2) The department shall compute a constitutional reduction percentage for Measure 50 taxes by comparing the total statewide pre-reduction Measure 50 tax amount with the total statewide Measure 47 comparison tax amount and calculating the statewide percentage by which the total Measure 47 comparison tax amount is less than the total pre-reduction Measure 50 tax amount.

      (3) If the statewide reduction percentage for Measure 50 taxes determined under subsection (1) of this section equals 17 percent, the constitutional reduction percentage for each district shall equal the percentage certified to the district under ORS 310.220. The department shall proceed to calculate the supplemental statutory reduction under subsection (6) of this section.

      (4) If the statewide reduction percentage for Measure 50 taxes determined under subsection (1) of this section is greater than 17 percent, each taxing district’s preliminary reduction percentage shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the percentage point difference between the statewide reduction percentage and 17 percent, and the denominator of which is the statewide reduction percentage. The product shall then be subtracted from the preliminary reduction percentage to obtain the taxing district’s constitutional reduction percentage. The department shall then calculate the supplemental statutory reduction under subsection (6) of this section.

      (5) If the statewide reduction percentage for Measure 50 taxes determined under subsection (1) of this section is less than 17 percent, each taxing district’s preliminary reduction percentage shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the percentage point difference between the statewide reduction percentage and 17 percent, and the denominator of which is the statewide reduction percentage. The product shall then be added to the preliminary reduction percentage to obtain the constitutional reduction percentage for the district. The department shall then calculate the supplemental statutory reduction under subsection (6) of this section.

      (6)(a) Following the determination made under subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section, the department shall compute a supplemental statutory reduction percentage so that the statewide total amount of all of the taxes described in subsection (1)(b) of this section is reduced by 17 percent, using the procedure in this subsection.

      (b) The department shall compute a statewide total amount of the taxes certified under ORS 310.220 (6), (7) and (8), and shall multiply this amount by 17 percent.

      (c) The supplemental reduction shall be the percentage equivalent of a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section and the denominator of which is the statewide total pre-reduction Measure 50 tax amount plus the total amount of taxes certified under ORS 310.220 (6), (7) and (8).

      (d) For each taxing district, the department shall:

      (A) Add the supplemental reduction percentage to the constitutional reduction percentage determined for the district under subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section to determine a total reduction percentage for taxes that are subject to constitutional reduction; and

      (B) Reduce the district’s other taxes that were certified by the assessor under ORS 310.220 (6), (7) and (8) by the supplemental statutory reduction percentage.

      (7)(a) If the statewide constitutional reduction percentage no longer equals 17 percent after the department estimates compression of Measure 50 taxes on a code area basis, the department shall recalculate the constitutional reduction percentages as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section until the statewide reduction percentage equals 17 percent. Constitutional reduction percentages for each district shall be finally determined prior to any determination of supplemental statutory reduction.

      (b) The reduction percentages determined under this section shall be adjusted so that the appropriate pre-compression rate is the rate used under ORS 310.236.

      (8) The department shall certify to the assessor:

      (a) The constitutional reduction percentages and reduction amounts for each district as determined under subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section; and

      (b) The statutory reduction percentages and reduction amounts determined under subsection (6) of this section. [1997 c.541 §29]

 

      310.228 Determination of state replacement obligation. (1) Based on the constitutional reduction amounts computed under ORS 310.222, the Department of Revenue shall determine the statewide total amount of constitutionally required reduction certified under ORS 310.222 (8), excluding statutory reduction amounts, for:

      (a) School districts;

      (b) Education service districts;

      (c) Community college districts; and

      (d) Community college service districts.

      (2) Amounts appropriated to districts in the categories described in subsection (1) of this section for the fiscal year that equal the amounts determined under subsection (1) of this section shall constitute the state’s replacement obligation under section 11 (9), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. [1997 c.541 §29a]

 

      310.230 Adjustment of Measure 47 comparison taxes and supplemental statutory reduction to account for certain additions of value. (1) If the total statewide amount of additions of value certified to the Department of Revenue under ORS 310.220 (4) exceeds four percent of the assessed value of taxable property in this state for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997 (not taking into account the additions of value certified under ORS 310.220), the department shall subtract the portion of the Measure 47 comparison taxes attributable to additions of value in excess of four percent from the statewide total of Measure 47 comparison taxes, prior to making the computation under ORS 310.222.

      (2) The supplemental statutory reduction percentage determined under ORS 310.222 (6) shall be adjusted so as to achieve the same total reduction percentage for the taxes described in ORS 310.222 (1)(b) as is achieved for the statewide constitutional reduction percentage following the calculation in subsection (1) of this section. [1997 c.541 §30]

 

      310.232 Subtraction of urban renewal increment from assessed value. The assessed value of taxable property of a taxing district shall be further adjusted by the assessor for purposes of determining the district’s amount of taxes before compression under ORS 310.242 by subtracting any assessed value in the district attributable to an urban renewal increment in the district. [1997 c.541 §31]

 

      310.234 Nonschool taxing district 1997-1998 operating tax adjustment for timber offsets. If the taxing district is a district other than a school district, education service district, community college district or community college service district and is a district for which the assessor is directed to offset timber harvest privilege tax revenues against the district’s ad valorem property taxes under ORS 321.312 or 321.515 (1997 Edition), the operating tax rate calculated under ORS 310.236 (3), (4) or (5), whichever is applicable, shall be further adjusted to reflect the amount of the offset. Except as provided in this section, the adjusted rate shall not be used for any purpose under ORS 310.200 to 310.242 other than determination of the district’s ad valorem property taxes for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997. [1997 c.541 §32a; 1999 c.1078 §71]

 

      Note: 321.312 was repealed by section 26, chapter 621, Oregon Laws 2003. The text of 310.234 was not amended by enactment of the Legislative Assembly to reflect the repeal. Editorial adjustment of 310.234 for the repeal of 321.312 has not been made.

 

      310.236 Determination of taxing district 1997-1998 operating taxes and permanent and statutory rate limits for tax years after 1997-1998; 1997-1998 pre-compression consolidated rates for code areas and categories. (1) Upon receipt of the reduction percentages for each district, the assessor shall determine the district’s post-reduction Measure 50 taxes for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, under this section.

      (2) The assessor shall multiply the certified constitutional reduction percentage by the pre-reduction Measure 50 tax amount determined under ORS 310.216 and then add to the product any of the following taxes applicable to the district:

      (a) If the taxing district is other than a city, county or school district, taxes imposed to support a hospital facility; and

      (b) Taxes imposed pursuant to an operating tax levy approved by voters prior to December 5, 1996, for which property taxes are first imposed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, or July 1, 1997, if the levy was approved by voters in an election:

      (A) In which at least 50 percent of registered voters eligible to vote in the election cast a ballot; or

      (B) That was the general election in an even-numbered year.

      (3) The assessor shall then calculate the operating tax rate for the district by dividing the amount determined under subsection (2) of this section by the assessed value of taxable property in the district determined under ORS 310.232. The rate so determined shall be the district’s permanent rate limit for operating taxes.

      (4)(a) If the taxing district is a district for which a supplemental statutory reduction percentage has been certified to the assessor, the assessor shall repeat the calculation described in subsection (2) of this section, substituting the total reduction percentage for the constitutional reduction percentage. Any district taxes that are described in subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be reduced by the supplemental reduction percentage in determining the amount.

      (b) The assessor shall then calculate the operating tax rate for the district by dividing the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection by the assessed value of taxable property in the district determined under ORS 310.232. The rate so determined shall be the district’s statutory rate limit for operating taxes.

      (5) If, in the written notice made under ORS 310.206, the district made a separate certification for permanent rate limit purposes and for 1997 operating tax purposes, and the rate determined under subsection (3) of this section, or subsection (4) of this section (if applicable), will produce operating taxes greater than the amount certified for operating taxes, the rate determined under subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be adjusted so as to produce the amount certified by the district. Except as provided in ORS 310.234, the adjusted rate shall not be used for any purpose under ORS 310.200 to 310.242 other than determination of the district’s ad valorem property taxes for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997.

      (6) The assessor shall determine a rate per $1,000 of assessed value for any of the following taxes applicable to the district:

      (a) Taxes imposed to pay qualified obligations of the district;

      (b) Local option taxes; and

      (c) Taxes imposed to pay exempt bonded indebtedness.

      (7) The rates per $1,000 of assessed value determined under subsection (6) of this section shall be determined by dividing the amount of the tax for which a rate is being determined by the assessed value of taxable property in the district under ORS 310.232.

      (8) The assessor shall determine a total rate for the district and a rate for each category described in ORS 310.150 for the district.

      (9) Based on the rates determined under subsection (8) of this section, the assessor shall determine a pre-compression consolidated rate for each code area and a pre-compression consolidated rate per category described in ORS 310.150 for each code area. [1997 c.541 §32]

 

      310.237 Reallocation of Measure 47 comparison taxes and adjustment of rate limits for certain districts for 2000-2001 and later tax years. (1) This section applies to a taxing district that is located in a county in which:

      (a) For the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, a taxing district imposed one or more serial or one-year levies that expired before the tax year beginning July 1, 1997;

      (b) Between December 5, 1996, and July 1, 1997, voters approved one or more temporary levies to replace the levies described in paragraph (a) of this subsection and increased the amount being replaced;

      (c) Each levy described in paragraph (b) of this subsection is treated as a local option tax under section 11 (7)(c), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution;

      (d) The total amount of local option taxes described in paragraph (c) of this subsection that were imposed by the taxing district for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, exceeded $1.2 million; and

      (e) The total amount of replacement authority for the taxing district exceeds $900,000.

      (2) For each taxing district described in subsection (1) of this section, the Department of Revenue shall recompute the amount of property taxes that would have been imposed by the taxing district for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, making the following changes in the calculation of 1997-1998 operating taxes for all taxing districts within the county in which the taxing district is located:

      (a) The total Measure 5 imposed tax estimate determined under ORS 310.210 shall consist of the total Measure 5 imposed tax estimate determined for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, plus that portion of any local option taxes that represent replacement authority for a serial or one-year levy imposed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, and described in subsection (1)(a) of this section;

      (b) A taxing district’s Measure 5 imposed tax estimate shall take the replacement authority into account only if that taxing district imposed the serial or one-year levy for the tax year beginning July 1, 1996; and

      (c) Measure 47 comparison taxes shall be allocated to taxing districts in the county based on the ratio described in ORS 310.212 (8), substituting the Measure 5 imposed tax estimate determined under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.

      (3) The rate of tax that would have been achieved for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, had the operating taxes of the taxing district been calculated as provided for in this section, shall serve as the taxing district’s statutory rate limit on operating taxes, to the extent the rate limit is less than or equal to the lesser of the district’s permanent rate limit on operating taxes or statutory rate limit on operating taxes as determined under ORS 310.200 to 310.242 (1997 Edition).

      (4) The department shall recalculate taxes for each taxing district under this section separately.

      (5) As used in this section, “replacement authority” means that portion of the levy described in subsection (1)(c) of this section that would have been incorporated into the permanent rate limit of the taxing district if the levy described in subsection (1)(c) of this section were treated as a levy described in section 11 (7)(b), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution. [1999 c.186 §1]

 

      Note: 310.237 was added to and made a part of 310.200 to 310.242 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      310.238 Rate conversion; Measure 5 assessed value rate. (1) In order to ensure that the consolidated rates for each code area do not exceed the $5 per $1,000 of real market value limit for the public school system and $10 per $1,000 of real market value limit for other government operations that is guaranteed in section 11 (11) and 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, the assessor shall, for each code area, convert the constitutional rate limit for each category into a rate per $1,000 of assessed value by multiplying the applicable rate limit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the code area market value and the denominator of which is the code area assessed value.

      (2) The assessor shall add the rates determined under subsection (1) of this section and the consolidated rate under ORS 310.236 for the exempt bonded indebtedness category. The total shall be the Measure 5 assessed value rate. [1997 c.541 §33]

 

      310.239 [2003 c.715 §35; repealed by 2009 c.698 §23]

 

      310.240 Calculation of taxes imposed on urban renewal increment for 1997-1998; special levies. (1) In the case of a code area in which urban renewal taxes are to be imposed for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997, the assessor shall determine the rate of taxes to be imposed on the urban renewal increment under this section.

      (2) The assessor shall use the lesser of the total consolidated rate for the code area determined under ORS 310.236, or the total consolidated Measure 5 assessed value rate, for purposes of the remainder of the calculation under this section.

      (3) The assessor shall multiply the rate determined under subsection (2) of this section by the urban renewal increment for the code area. The assessor shall determine the total amount under this subsection for all code areas within an urban renewal plan to determine the total amount of taxes to be raised on the urban renewal increment.

      (4) For each urban renewal plan, the assessor shall compare the amount determined under subsection (3) of this section with the amount certified by the urban renewal agency under ORS 310.208. If the amount determined under subsection (3) of this section is less than the amount certified, the assessor shall determine a special levy in the amount of the difference.

      (5) The assessor shall determine a rate per $1,000 of assessed value for the special levy described in subsection (4) of this section by dividing the amount of the special levy by the assessed value of the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency and all taxable property in the urban renewal area lying outside the city or county, including the value of the urban renewal increment, and shall add the rate to the pre-compression consolidated rate for each code area in which the special levy is to be extended.

      (6) For tax years beginning on or after July 1, 1998, urban renewal tax increment calculations shall be made as provided in ORS 457.420 to 457.470. [1997 c.541 §34; 1999 c.579 §24]

 

      310.242 1997-1998 compression of consolidated rates. (1) For each property, the assessor shall adjust the pre-compression consolidated rates for each category determined under ORS 310.236 including any special levy under ORS 310.240 (5) (and as further modified by ORS 310.234) to be rates per $1,000 of real market value.

      (2) The assessor shall compare the pre-compression consolidated rates for each category as modified under subsection (1) of this section with the rate of $5 per $1,000 of real market value of the property for the public school system category and $10 per $1,000 of real market value of the property for the other government operations category.

      (3) If a pre-compression consolidated category rate for a property, as modified under subsection (1) of this section, exceeds the $5 or $10 per $1,000 category rate limits set forth in subsection (2) of this section (whichever is applicable), the consolidated category rate shall be compressed as provided in subsection (4) or (5) of this section.

      (4)(a) If local option taxes in the category for which compression is being determined have been adopted by one or more taxing districts that impose taxes on the property, the reduction ratio shall be calculated under this subsection and applied only to the local option taxes imposed on the property.

      (b) The numerator of the reduction ratio shall be the amount obtained, but not less than zero, by subtracting the property’s pre-compression consolidated category rate of ad valorem property taxes that are not local option taxes from the maximum rate of ad valorem property taxes for the category.

      (c) The denominator for the reduction ratio shall be the total rate of all local option taxes for the category.

      (d) The assessor shall multiply the reduction ratio determined under this subsection by the rate of each local option tax in the category to which the property is subject. After reduction, the assessor shall recompute:

      (A) The rates per $1,000 of assessed value for the property;

      (B) The total amount of local option taxes to be raised in the code area; and

      (C) The local option tax rates per $1,000 of assessed value for the code area and incorporate those rates into the consolidated rate for the code area.

      (5)(a) If no local option taxes have been adopted by a taxing district in the category in the code area or if all local option taxes have been eliminated as a result of application of the reduction ratio calculated under subsection (4) of this section, and the pre-compression consolidated category rate as modified under subsection (1) of this section or following further adjustment under subsection (4) of this section exceeds the $5 or $10 per $1,000 category rate limits set forth in subsection (2) of this section (whichever is applicable), the reduction ratio shall be determined under this subsection.

      (b) The numerator of the reduction ratio shall be the maximum rate permitted for the category.

      (c) The denominator of the reduction ratio shall be the pre-compression consolidated category rate as modified under subsection (1) of this section or following further adjustment under subsection (4) of this section, if applicable.

      (d) The assessor shall multiply the reduction ratio determined under this subsection by each taxing district item of ad valorem property tax that is a component of the consolidated category rate for the code area. The sum of the rates so reduced within the category shall be the consolidated rate for the category for the property. After reduction, the assessor shall recompute:

      (A) The rates per $1,000 of assessed value for the property;

      (B) The total amount of local option taxes to be raised in the code area; and

      (C) The total amount of taxes in each category to be raised in the code area. [1997 c.541 §35]

 

      310.244 Adjustment of city’s post-compression tax rate under certain circumstances. (1) This section applies to a city with a Measure 5 tax estimate that was reduced by compression.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 310.200 to 310.242, the combination of the constitutional and the statutory reductions determined under ORS 310.222 shall not cause a city’s Measure 50 post-reduction taxes prior to additions made in ORS 310.236 (2)(a) and (b), to be less than the lesser of:

      (a) The city’s Measure 47 comparison taxes; or

      (b) The city’s Measure 50 pre-reduction taxes.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 310.200 to 310.242, in the case of a city whose voters approved a local option tax in March 1997 of less than $100,000 per year and whose Measure 47 comparison taxes plus the local option taxes exceed the city’s Measure 50 pre-reduction taxes plus local option taxes, the city’s post-reduction Measure 50 taxes shall not be less than $228,000.

      (4) The Department of Revenue shall increase a city’s post-reduction tax rate by the amount necessary to meet the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

      (5) The department shall also adjust the post-reduction tax rates of each taxing district, other than a school district, taxing the same property as a city affected by subsections (2) and (3) of this section to ensure that the district’s tax revenue is not reduced by more than one-quarter of one percent by the operation of this section.

      (6) The calculations in this section shall be based on department estimates and shall include the effects of code area compression, but shall not include the effect of property-by-property compression.

      (7) If the statewide constitutional reduction percentage determined under ORS 310.222 no longer equals 17 percent after the department makes the determinations described in this section, the department shall recalculate the constitutional reduction percentages as described in ORS 310.222 until the statewide reduction percentage equals 17 percent. [1997 c.541 §37]

 

      310.246 Adjustment of permanent rate limit to correct mistakes by June 30, 1998. (1) The Department of Revenue may adjust the permanent rate limits for operating taxes established under ORS 310.200 to 310.242 to correct for mistakes. All adjustments by the department must be made by June 30, 1998.

      (2) No change to the assessment and tax roll shall be made as the result of an adjustment under this section. [1997 c.541 §38]

      (a) “Authorized representative” means a senior citizen who is authorized by a tax-exempt entity to perform charitable or public service on behalf of a senior citizen who has entered into a contract under subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) “Homestead” means an owner-occupied principal residence.

      (c) “Senior citizen” means a person who is 60 years of age or older.

      (d) “Tax-exempt entity” means an entity that is exempt from federal income taxes under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code as defined in ORS 305.842.

      (e) “Taxing unit” means any county, city or common or union high school district, community college service district or community college district within this state with authority to impose ad valorem property taxes.

      (2) A tax-exempt entity may establish a property tax work-off program pursuant to which a senior citizen may contract to perform charitable or public service in consideration of payment of property taxes extended against the homestead of the senior citizen and billed to the senior citizen. For purposes of ORS chapters 316 and 656, and notwithstanding ORS 670.600 or other law, a senior citizen who enters into a contract under this subsection shall be considered an independent contractor and not a worker or employee with respect to the services performed pursuant to the contract.

      (3) A taxing unit may enter into an agreement with a tax-exempt entity that has established a property tax work-off program.

      (4) A taxing unit may provide funds or make grants to any tax-exempt entity that has established a property tax work-off program for use to carry out the program.
