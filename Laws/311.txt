      311.010 “County court” defined. As used in the tax laws of this state, unless the context requires otherwise, “county court” includes the board of county commissioners or other governing body of the county. [Amended by 1965 c.344 §8; 1995 c.79 §142]

[Amended by 1965 c.344 §9]

 

      311.020 Collection procedure when offices of assessor and tax collector combined. (1) Wherever a statute provides for the assessor to certify an assessment to the tax collector for collection, the person exercising the duties of both assessor and tax collector in a county having a charter shall prepare the certificate required by law, file it in the office of the person and proceed in the manner otherwise provided by law.

      (2) In counties where the duties of assessor and tax collector have been delegated to one person, the filing of the warrant under ORS 311.115 shall constitute a constructive delivery of the roll to such person in the tax collecting capacity of the person. [1963 c.238 §§10,12]

 

TAX COLLECTOR

 

      311.055 Tax collector. The county court or board of county commissioners of each county shall designate the tax collector thereof. [Amended by 1973 c.305 §1]

 

      311.060 Bond. Before entering upon the duties the tax collector shall give a bond, issued by some responsible surety company, or given by some responsible surety or sureties as approved by the county court, conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties as tax collector, in the amount the county court directs. The premium for the bond, if issued by a surety company, shall be paid by the county court. In all counties the bond shall be additional and cumulative to any other bond given by the officer or employee under any other statute, to which resort may be had, in case of failure or default of the duties as tax collector, if the bond required by this section is unenforceable or insufficient. [Amended by 1963 c.238 §5; 1965 c.344 §10; 1973 c.305 §6]

 

      311.065 Deputies and clerical assistance.

      311.070 Tax collecting functions of sheriff transferred to designated tax collector.

For the purpose of succession to such rights, duties and obligations, the tax collector shall constitute a continuation of the sheriff and not a new authority, and the tax collector shall exercise and perform such rights, duties and obligations with the same force and effect as if they had not been transferred.

      (2) The transfer of duties, functions and powers as authorized by ORS 311.070 shall not affect any proceeding, prosecution, action or suit pending at the time of the transfer.

      (3) Such a transfer shall not relieve any person of any obligation with respect to any tax or other charge, interest, penalty, forfeiture or any other liability, duty or obligation accrued under or with respect to the duties, functions and powers transferred as provided by ORS 311.070. [1973 c.305 §3]

At the same time, the assessor shall deliver to the tax collector the second copy of the certificate prepared under ORS 311.105, and the warrant issued under ORS 311.110, and the tax collector shall file them in the office. The tax collector shall give a receipt, in duplicate, for the roll. One copy of the receipt shall be filed with the assessor and the other with the county clerk.

      (2) There shall be, if necessary, a relisting, reassessment and a relevy of the proper tax in the manner and by the person authorized by law to list property and levy and assess a tax. The relisting, reassessment and relevying shall take place within five years from the date the tax would have been delinquent if the property had been properly listed, assessed and tax levied thereon. If the question is raised in the courts as to the legality of such tax, the five years shall not commence to run until the question is finally determined by the courts.

 

      311.125 Entering delinquent taxes on tax roll. Immediately after receipt of the tax roll each year:

      (1) If delinquent tax payments are to be posted to the previous year’s rolls the tax collector shall enter on the roll received, for each property assessment, a memorandum of all taxes then unpaid and delinquent on such property, showing the tax year or years and the amount of such taxes for each such year. Where a continuing tax roll card system is used on which is shown the prior years’ unpaid taxes, no new annual entry or entries need be made until a new card is used to replace the old card. Where the property description for an account in the current tax roll is different than the description of the property for a prior year, but includes a portion or all of the property on which the unpaid taxes are a lien, the full amount of the unpaid taxes shall be shown, and no segregation of the value of the property need be made unless requested pursuant to ORS 311.280 by a person desiring to pay a portion or all of such unpaid taxes.

      (2) If delinquent tax payments are to be posted to the current tax roll, the tax collector shall enter on the roll received, for each property assessment, all taxes then unpaid and delinquent on such property, showing the tax year or years and the amount of such taxes for each such year. A segregation of value of the property and of the unpaid taxes applicable to each portion of the property segregated shall be made whenever the property description for an account on the current tax roll is different from a prior year or years, as described in subsection (1) of this section. [Amended by 1965 c.344 §14]

 

      311.130 [Repealed by 1965 c.344 §42]

 

      311.135 Restoration of current assessment roll after destruction or damage. (1) If the current assessment roll of any county is destroyed or damaged by fire or other disaster, the county assessor shall repair and restore the assessment roll, extend all regular and lawful tax levies therein and deliver the restored roll as a tax roll to the tax collector at the earliest practicable time.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 311.115 as to the time of delivery of a tax roll to the tax collector by the assessor are waived in such case.

 

      311.140 Restoration of tax rolls after destruction or damage; preparing transcripts as rolls for unpaid taxes. (1) If the tax rolls of any county are destroyed or damaged, the tax collector of the county shall prepare transcripts of those parts of the rolls in which it appears, from evidence in the possession of the tax collector or otherwise obtainable, that taxes are unpaid on real or personal properties. The Department of Revenue and the assessor of the county shall assist the tax collector in the preparation of the transcripts.

      (2) The tax collector shall then certify that, to the best belief and knowledge of the tax collector, the transcripts are a true and correct record of the taxes remaining unpaid. When certified by the tax collector, the transcripts shall be the tax rolls of the county for all taxes so determined to be unpaid.

      (3) Thereafter, the tax collector may make corrections of such tax rolls, pursuant to ORS 311.205, to conform such rolls to the destroyed rolls. Such corrections shall be considered to be clerical errors, except that where a taxpayer is aggrieved by such correction, the taxpayer may within 60 days thereof petition the county court for relief. The petition shall set forth in detail the facts upon which the petitioner relies and the relief requested. The county court may hear such petitions in a summary manner and shall issue its order denying the relief requested or granting such relief as it determines proper. Any taxpayer aggrieved by such order may petition to the Oregon Tax Court in the manner provided in ORS 305.404 to 305.560.

      (4) The unpaid taxes exhibited in tax rolls prepared and certified in accordance with this section are liens upon the real and personal properties therein described, and shall have the same force and effect as the liens of taxes charged in the original tax rolls of the county. Such taxes shall be subject to the provisions of law for the collection of taxes on real or personal property. [Amended by 1965 c.344 §15; 1995 c.79 §144; 1995 c.650 §77]

 

      311.145 Supplying materials and clerical help to restore rolls. The county court shall supply and furnish the tax collector and assessor with the books and other materials and clerical help necessary to carry out ORS 311.135 and 311.140.

      311.150 Adding to, changing or correcting rolls by vouchers; preservation of vouchers. (1) In lieu of the procedures for additions, changes or corrections to the assessment and tax rolls authorized by ORS 309.120, 311.205, 311.370 (5), 311.645, 312.140 (2) and 358.495, the officer in possession of the roll may prepare a voucher for each correcting entry. The voucher shall state what change is to be made, identify the tax account or accounts affected, provide sufficient evidence to indicate the propriety of the transaction and the date the voucher is approved by the officer in charge of the roll or an authorized deputy. The date the voucher is completed and approved is the date the change shall become effective and the voucher shall become a public record. The vouchers shall be numbered and the voucher number shall appear on the assessment or tax roll adjacent to the entry changing the roll.

      (2) The vouchers provided for in this section shall be preserved until the real property tax rolls of the year affected by the voucher have been foreclosed and the foreclosed property has been deeded to the county; or, in the case of personal property, until one year after the tax account affected by the voucher has been collected or canceled under the provisions of ORS 311.790.

      311.165 Collection of taxes upon severance and removal of improvements from the land. (1) If in the opinion of the assessor:

      (a) It appears probable that real property improvements, whether assessed as improvements only or as real property improvements assessed together with land have been or will be severed from the land upon which they are situated and have been or will be removed from such land;

      (b) It appears that the amount of taxes which have been levied against the property in the current and prior years or which are anticipated to be levied for the current assessment year will not be adequately secured by the value of the property remaining in the tax account; and

      (c) It appears that unless prompt action is taken the taxes will not be collected, then the assessor shall proceed to levy and the tax collector to collect the taxes in the manner set forth in subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) If the amount of the taxes for the current year attributable to the property improvements is not able to be determined, the assessor shall estimate the taxes due for the current year. The assessor shall make demand upon the owner of the improvements as shown by the most recent assessment roll, for payment of the unpaid taxes attributable to the improvements for the current and all prior years. Any payments shall be paid immediately upon demand of the assessor either to the assessor for remittance to the tax collector or directly to the tax collector of the county pursuant to ORS 311.370. If the taxes are not paid immediately upon demand, the assessor shall certify the assessment and tax levies so made by the assessor to the tax collector. For the purposes of collection of the assessments, the owner shall be considered a taxpayer owning personal property against which ad valorem taxes have been assessed. Review may be had as provided in ORS 311.467. All taxes collected by the tax collector, or taxes collected by the assessor and remitted to the tax collector shall be credited to the real property account containing the improvements which were the basis of the tax.

CORRECTING ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ROLLS

 

      311.205 Correcting errors or omissions in rolls. (1) After the assessor certifies the assessment and tax roll to the tax collector, the officer in charge of the roll may correct errors or omissions in the roll to conform to the facts, as follows:

      (a) The officer may correct a clerical error. For purposes of this paragraph:

      (A) A clerical error is an error on the roll:

      (i)(I) That arises from an error in the ad valorem tax records of the assessor, or the records of the Department of Revenue for property assessed under ORS 306.126; or

      (II) That is a failure to correctly reflect the ad valorem tax records of the assessor, or the records of the department for property assessed under ORS 306.126;

      (ii) That, had it been discovered by the assessor or the department prior to the certification of the assessment and tax roll of the year of assessment, would have been corrected as a matter of course; and

      (iii) For which the information necessary to make the correction is contained in the records.

      (B) Clerical errors include, but are not limited to, arithmetic and copying errors and the omission or misstatement of a land, improvement or other property value on the roll.

      (b)(A) The officer may correct an error in valuation judgment at any time in any account when an appeal has been filed in the tax court alleging that the value on the roll is incorrect, if the correction results in a reduction of the tax owed on the account.

      (B) The officer may not make corrections under this paragraph to accounts appraised by the department pursuant to ORS 306.126 and 308.505 to 308.674 without the approval of the department.

      (C) The officer may correct any other error or omission of any kind. Corrections that are not corrections of errors in valuation judgment include, but are not limited to:

      (i) The elimination of an assessment to one taxpayer of property belonging to another on the assessment date;

      (ii) The correction of a tax limit calculation;

      (iii) The correction of a value changed on appeal; and

      (iv) The correction of an error in the assessed value of property resulting from an error in the identification of a unit of property, but not from an error in a notice filed under ORS 310.060.

      (D) For purposes of this paragraph, an error in valuation judgment is one in which the assessor or the department would arrive at a different opinion of value.

      (c) The officer shall make any change requested by the department that relates to an assessment of property made by the department under ORS 308.505 to 308.674.

      (d) The officer shall make any change ordered by the tax court or the department under ORS 305.288 or 306.115.

      (e) The officer shall make any change required under ORS 308A.089.

      (2)(a) The officer in charge of the roll shall make corrections with the assent and concurrence of the assessor or the department. The direction for the correction must be made in writing and state the type of error and the statutory authority for the correction. The officer may correct the roll for any year or years not exceeding five years prior to the last certified roll.

      (b) Any additional taxes resulting from corrections for years prior to the current year are deemed assessed and imposed in the particular year or years to which the corrections apply. Addition of tax to a prior year’s tax roll due to corrections under this section may not be considered in calculating the effect of the tax limitation under Article XI, section 11b, of the Oregon Constitution, for the current year.

      (3) The officer in charge of the roll shall make a correction pursuant to this section in whatever manner is necessary to make the assessment, tax or other proceeding regular and valid. The correction must be distinguishable upon the roll, must include the date of the correction and must identify the officer making the correction.

      (4) Whenever a correction that will increase the assessment to which it relates is to be made after the assessor has delivered the roll to the tax collector, unless the correction is made by order of the department, the officer in charge of the tax roll shall follow the procedure prescribed in ORS 311.216 to 311.232. The provisions of ORS 311.216 to 311.232 with respect to appeals apply under this subsection.

      (5) Corrections that would result in a change in assessed value or real market value of less than $1,000 do not change the value for purposes of computing the taxes levied against the property, but shall be made only for purposes of correcting the office records.

      (6) The remedies under this section are in addition to other remedies provided by law. [Amended by 1953 c.26 §2; 1957 c.324 §8; 1959 c.181 §2; 1961 c.234 §1; 1963 c.267 §1; 1965 c.344 §16; 1971 c.472 §3; 1973 c.402 §28; 1977 c.606 §2; 1979 c.687 §3; 1983 c.605 §5; 1991 c.459 §231; 1993 c.18 §73; 1993 c.270 §54; 1995 c.79 §146; 1995 c.127 §4; 1997 c.541 §278; 1999 c.21 §27; 2001 c.509 §2; 2007 c.590 §2; 2013 c.176 §4]

 

      311.206 Additional taxes resulting from correction of error or omission; date of delinquency; limitations; prepayment. (1)(a) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, when the roll is corrected under ORS 311.205, and taxes are added to the roll, the additional taxes shall be added to the tax extended against the property on the general property tax roll for the tax year determined under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, to be collected and distributed in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes imposed on the property.

      (b) Notwithstanding ORS 311.205 (2)(b), for purposes of collection and enforcement, the additional taxes added to the roll under subsections (1) to (4) of this section shall be considered delinquent as of the date the other taxes for the year in which the additional taxes are added to the roll become delinquent.

      (2) When taxes for a single tax year are added to an assessment and tax roll under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the additional taxes shall be added to the tax extended against the property on the general property tax roll for the tax year following the tax year in which the correction is made.

      (3)(a) When taxes for more than one tax year are added to an assessment and tax roll under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the additional taxes for the earliest tax year shall be added to the tax extended against the property on the general property tax roll for the tax year following the tax year in which the correction is made and additional taxes for each subsequent tax year through the tax year in which the correction is made shall be added in chronological order to the tax extended against the property on the general property tax roll for the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth tax years, as necessary, following the tax year in which the correction is made.

      (b) For each tax year in which the additional tax is deferred under this subsection, the county assessor shall enter the notation “deferred additional tax liability” on the assessment and tax roll. The notation shall continue to appear on subsequent assessment and tax rolls until all the additional taxes have been added as required under this subsection. If the property is sold or otherwise transferred, or is moved out of the county, the lien for the taxes added under this subsection shall attach and the taxes are due and payable as of the day before the sale or transfer, or, if the property is removed from the county, five days before the removal, whichever is earlier. Additional taxes on personal property or a manufactured structure imposed as a result of an error corrected under ORS 311.205 is a personal debt due and owing from the owner to which ORS 311.455 applies.

      (4) When additional taxes are added to the roll as the result of a request from the Department of Revenue as described in ORS 311.205 (1)(c), the additional taxes shall be added to the tax extended against the property on the general property tax roll for the tax year following the current tax year, to be collected and distributed in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes imposed on the property.

      (5) When additional taxes are added to the roll as the result of an order described in ORS 311.205 (1)(d), the additional taxes shall be collected as provided in ORS 311.513.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section or other provision of law establishing the delinquency date for additional taxes, additional taxes may not be assessed and imposed if the correction is a result of:

      (a) The disqualification of property from a tax exemption granted erroneously by a tax official; or

      (b) The failure by a tax official to timely disqualify property from a tax exemption.

      (7) Subsection (6) of this section does not apply to a failure by a tax official to timely disqualify property from a tax exemption if the property owner fails to timely notify the assessor of a change in use of the property to a nonexempt use.

      (8)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, additional taxes arising from a correction under ORS 311.205 may be paid to the tax collector prior to the completion of the next general property tax roll, pursuant to ORS 311.370.

      (b) The amount to be added to the tax extended against the property under subsection (3)(a) of this section may be paid to the tax collector prior to the completion of the tax roll to which the tax is to be added, pursuant to ORS 311.370. The tax collector may apply prepayments of additional taxes under this paragraph for one or more future years to the taxes imposed on the next following assessment and tax roll.

      (9) For purposes of this section, “additional taxes” includes increases in taxes that have already been extended on the roll. [1975 c.780 §15; 1983 c.106 §1; subsections (2) to (7) enacted as 1983 c.106 §3; 1985 c.784 §9; 1991 c.459 §232; 1993 c.270 §55; 1995 c.256 §6; 1999 c.500 §3; 1999 c.862 §1a; 2001 c.303 §7; 2003 c.274 §3; 2010 c.36 §1]

      311.208 Notice required when current roll corrections increase value; time for payment of additional taxes; appeals. (1) The assessor shall notify the property owner of record or other person claiming to own the property or occupying the property or in possession of the property, if:

      (b) The correction is made after roll certification under ORS 311.105 and prior to December 1 of the current tax year; and

      (c) The correction increases the value of the property.

      (3) If the additional taxes described in subsection (2) of this section are not paid prior to the 16th of the month next following the date the notice was sent under this section, the additional taxes shall be considered for all purposes of collection and enforcement of payment as having become delinquent on the date the taxes would normally have become delinquent if the taxes had been timely extended on the roll.

      (a) Be mailed prior to December 1 to the last-known address of the person described in subsection (1) of this section;

      (b) That the cost as of January 1 of any building, structure, improvement, machinery or equipment reported in a return required by the assessor under ORS 308.285 or 308.290 exceeds the cost stated in the return.

      (3) If the tax collector discovers or receives credible information or if the tax collector has reason to believe that any property subject to taxation has been omitted from the tax roll, the tax collector shall immediately bring this to the attention of the assessor by written notice. [Formerly 311.207; 1999 c.21 §28; 1999 c.500 §4; 2003 c.46 §27]

 

      311.219 Notice of intention to assess omitted property. Notice shall be given to the person claiming to own the property or occupying it or in possession thereof of the assessor’s intention to add the property to the assessment or tax roll under ORS 311.216 to 311.232 and to assess the property in such person’s name. Where the assessor has reason to believe the property is either no longer in existence or is outside the county, the assessor shall give the notice to the owner or the person in possession on the assessment date of the year or years as to which the property was omitted. The notice shall be in writing, mailed to the person’s last-known address. It shall describe the property in general terms, and require the person to appear at a specified time, not less than 20 days after mailing the notice, and to show cause, if any, why the property should not be added to the assessment and tax roll and assessed to such person. [Formerly 311.209]

      311.223 Correction of rolls; filing statement of facts; notice to taxpayer; powers of assessor; appeals. (1) If the person or party notified as provided in ORS 311.219 does not appear or if the person or party appears and fails to show good and sufficient cause why the assessment shall not be made, the assessor shall proceed to correct the assessment or tax roll or rolls from which the property was omitted. The assessor shall add the property to the tax roll or rolls, with the proper valuation, and extend on the tax roll or rolls taxes at the consolidated rate under ORS 310.147 that is applicable in the code area in which the property was located for each year as to which it was omitted. To carry out the correction of a tax roll or rolls the assessor shall send a written statement to the tax collector instructing the tax collector to make the necessary changes on the tax roll. The statement shall contain all of the information needed by the tax collector to make the changes in the roll and it shall be dated and signed by the assessor or the deputy of the assessor. The tax collector shall then correct the tax roll.

      (2) Immediately after the assessor corrects the assessment or tax roll, the assessor shall file in the office of the assessor a statement of the facts or evidence on which the assessor based the correction and notify the taxpayer by written notice, sent by first class mail to the taxpayer’s last-known address, of:

      (a) The date and amount of the correction;

      (b) If a penalty for failing to timely file a real, combined or personal property return as required by ORS 308.290 is being imposed under ORS 308.295 or 308.296, the amount of the penalty;

      (c) An explanation of the collection procedures applicable to the corrected amount, or applicable to the penalty; and

      (d) An explanation of the taxpayer’s right to appeal under subsection (4) of this section and the procedures for making the appeal.

      (3) To enable the assessor to comply with this section, the assessor is invested with all the powers of the county clerk under the law in force during the years for which correction may be made under ORS 311.216 to 311.232 and thereafter.

      (4) Any person aggrieved by an assessment made under ORS 311.216 to 311.232 may appeal to the tax court within 90 days after the correction of the roll as provided in ORS 305.280 and 305.560. If a penalty under ORS 308.295 or 308.296 is imposed for failing to timely file a real, combined or personal property return with respect to the assessment under ORS 311.216 to 311.232, the imposition of the penalty may be appealed to the tax court. The appeal of the penalty must be brought within the same period of time as an assessment under ORS 311.216 to 311.232 may be appealed to the tax court. An appeal of the value assigned under this section, or of any penalty described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, may not be made to the board of property tax appeals under ORS 309.100. [Formerly 311.211; 2001 c.114 §27; 2001 c.303 §1; 2007 c.452 §1; 2011 c.204 §9]

 

      311.226 Tax deemed assessed and imposed in year for which property was omitted. Omitted property shall be deemed assessed and any tax on it shall be deemed imposed in the year or years as to which the property was omitted. Addition of omitted property to the tax roll in the year in which it is discovered shall not be considered in making the determination of the amount of tax imposed in calculating the effect of the tax limitation under section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution in that year. [Formerly 311.212]

 

      311.229 Taxes added to rolls become liens; delinquency of additional taxes; interest added for willful evasion; prepayment. (1) When the taxes are added to an assessment or tax roll under ORS 311.216 to 311.232, the additional taxes shall be added to the tax extended against the property on the general property tax roll for the tax year following the current tax year, to be collected and distributed in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes imposed on the property. Notwithstanding ORS 311.226, for purposes of collection and enforcement, the additional taxes added to the roll under this subsection shall be considered delinquent as of the date the other taxes for the year in which the additional taxes are added to the roll become delinquent.

      (2) When it appears to the satisfaction of the assessor that the omission of the property was due to a willful attempt to evade the payment of taxes on the property, then the assessor shall so advise the tax collector and interest at the rate provided in ORS 311.505 (2) shall be added to the amounts so charged, which interest shall be computed from the date or dates that payment of the charges were properly due, and which interest shall continue to run until payment of the charges.

      (3) Additional taxes arising from the assessment of omitted property under ORS 311.216 to 311.232 may be paid to the tax collector prior to the completion of the next general property tax roll, pursuant to ORS 311.370.

      (4) For purposes of this section, “additional taxes” includes increases in taxes that have already been extended on the roll. [Formerly 311.213; 1999 c.862 §2; 2001 c.303 §8]

 

      311.232 Mandamus to require placing omitted property on roll. If any officer described in ORS 311.216 to 311.232 fails to comply with ORS 311.216 to 311.232 on the discovery by the officer, or on credible information being furnished by another person, that property has been omitted from taxation, the state, on the relation of any state officer or of any taxpayer of the county in which the failure occurs, may proceed against the officer in any court of competent jurisdiction by mandamus to compel the officer to comply with ORS 311.216 to 311.232. In the trial of the suit the question of what constitutes credible information is a question of fact to be determined by the court trying the case in the same manner other issues of fact are determined. If judgment is rendered that credible information has been discovered by or furnished to the officer, or that the officer has reason to believe that property has been omitted from taxation, the officer shall forthwith place the omitted property on the assessment and tax roll in accordance with ORS 311.216 to 311.232. If judgment is rendered against the officer, the officer shall be liable for all costs of the mandamus suit, and for a reasonable attorney fee at trial and on appeal for relator’s attorney, which shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the suit. If proceedings are instituted under this section on the relation of any private individual, the relator shall give bond to the satisfaction of the court to pay all costs that may be recovered against the relator. [Formerly 311.215; 2017 c.315 §15]

 

      311.234 Correction in maximum assessed value; requirements; limitation; filing deadline; appeals. (1) The current owner of property or other person obligated to pay taxes imposed on property may petition the county assessor for a correction of the maximum assessed value of the property for the current tax year for the circumstances described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) The assessor shall correct the maximum assessed value of the property for the current tax year if, in the petition filed under this section, the petitioner demonstrates:

      (a) A difference between the actual square footage of the property as of the assessment date for the current tax year and the square footage of the property as shown in the records of the assessor for the tax year.

      (b) That new property, or new improvements to property, added to the tax roll in a prior tax year did not exist as of the assessment date for that prior tax year or any subsequent tax year.

      (3)(a) A correction made under subsection (2)(a) of this section must be proportional to the change in the real market value for the current tax year that is due to the correction of the square footage of the property.

      (b) A correction made under subsection (2)(b) of this section:

      (A) Must reflect, in a manner determined by the assessor, the removal of the new property or new improvements to property from the assessment and tax rolls as accepted by the assessor.

      (B) May not be made to the extent that the assessor finds that the new property or new improvements to property existed on the assessment date of a prior tax year and the petition is best construed as demonstrating a difference in the nature, extent or value of the new property or new improvements to property.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, a correction made under this section may not cause the maximum assessed value of the property to increase by more than three percent from the maximum assessed value of the property for the preceding tax year.

      (5) A petition filed under this section must be on the form and contain the information prescribed by the Department of Revenue and must be filed with the county assessor on or before December 31 of the current tax year.

      (6) A decision by the assessor pursuant to a petition filed under this section may be appealed under ORS 305.275. [2001 c.764 §2; 2007 c.516 §3; 2009 c.443 §4; 2015 c.39 §1; 2015 c.97 §1a]

 

      311.235 Bona fide purchaser; when taxes become lien. No ad valorem taxes imposed on real property, a manufactured structure or a floating home purchased by a bona fide purchaser shall be a lien on the real property, manufactured structure or floating home unless at the time of purchase the taxes were a matter of public record. For the purposes of this section, if the tax roll has not been prepared for the tax year in which the purchase occurred, taxes levied or to be levied for the tax year of purchase are taxes which are a matter of public record. A bona fide purchaser is an individual purchaser of a fee simple interest in a single property, who acquires the property in good faith, in an arm’s-length transaction and for fair market value and adequate consideration. [Formerly 311.220]

      (3) The tax collector shall not be liable for failure to deliver or mail the tax statements by October 25 as provided in subsection (1) of this section if such failure was caused by not receiving the tax roll from the assessor by the time provided by law or by reason of any other circumstance beyond the control of the tax collector. In such case the tax collector shall deliver or mail the statements as soon as possible.

      (4) Where, for any reason the taxes due on any property on the assessment roll in any year cannot be ascertained from the tax roll by November 5 of that year, within 15 days thereafter the owner or other person liable for or desiring to pay the taxes on such property may tender to the tax collector, and the tax collector may collect, a payment of all or part of the taxes estimated by the tax collector to be due on such property. Immediately after the taxes are actually extended on the tax roll, the tax collector shall credit the amount paid as provided by law, allowing the discount under ORS 311.505 and not charging interest for the amount of taxes satisfied by such payment. Where there has been an underpayment, additional taxes shall be collected, and where there has been an overpayment, refund shall be made as otherwise provided by law.

      (5) The tax statement described in this section shall be designed by the Department of Revenue and shall contain such information as the department shall prescribe by rule including:

The request by the mortgagee for the sending of the copy shall be made to the tax collector on or before October 1 of each year and shall state that the mortgagee has the duty or is authorized to pay the taxes for the owner of the property.

      (2) The tax collector and any mortgagee referred to in subsection (1) of this section may agree that a computer record containing the information required by the Department of Revenue may be delivered to the mortgagee instead of a copy of the tax statement required by subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) For the purposes of this section, the holder of a perfected security interest in a manufactured structure or a floating home is considered a “mortgagee” and the perfected security interest is considered a “mortgage.” [1967 c.568 §4; 1971 c.379 §1; 1971 c.529 §35; 1971 c.752 §1; 1973 c.82 §1; 1981 c.804 §87; 1983 s.s. c.5 §21; 1987 c.313 §2; 1991 c.459 §239; 1993 c.313 §1; 1997 c.541 §287; 2003 c.108 §3; 2015 c.31 §4; 2019 c.360 §3]

 

      311.253 Use of computer record to comply with ORS 311.250; agreement to use record instead of tax statements; rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 311.250, if to meet the requirements of ORS 311.250, the tax collector must deliver or mail multiple tax statements to the same person, as defined in ORS 311.605, the tax collector may, at the request of the person made in writing, in lieu of the required tax statements, deliver or mail to the person a computer record that contains the name and last-known address of the person, and for each of the properties for which an individual tax statement would otherwise be required, such information as the Department of Revenue may prescribe by rule and any other information mutually agreed to by the tax collector and the person.

      (2) Any request made under this section must be made to the tax collector by the person on or before October 1 of each year. If upon mutual agreement of the parties, the tax collector complies with the request in accordance with the agreement, the tax collector is relieved of responsibility of delivering or mailing tax statements in any other manner.

      (3) Any information required by ORS 311.250 to appear on a tax statement that is not included in the computer record authorized by this section shall appear on the face of the tax receipt given under ORS 311.361. This section shall not apply to a mortgagee required or authorized to pay ad valorem taxes to which ORS 311.252 applies.

      (4) As used in this section and ORS 311.252, “computer record” means information stored by any means of electronic storage or paper on which is printed information retrieved from a computer or other form of electronic storage. [1981 c.364 §1; 1997 c.541 §288; 2003 c.108 §1]

      (2) No taxing district may separately charge or collect any tax on property that is imposed upon property subject to ad valorem taxation certified under ORS 310.060, in advance or otherwise.

      (3) Charges of a water improvement company organized under ORS 554.005 to 554.340 shall be collected in the same manner as taxes under subsection (1) of this section if the charges are certified to the assessor by the company board of directors under ORS 554.130. [Amended by 1965 c.344 §20; 1991 c.459 §240; 1997 c.541 §289; 1997 c.819 §16]

The tax collector shall not accept from any taxpayer warrants in a larger amount than the particular tax or part of a tax such taxpayer may be entitled to pay in such warrants.

      (2) The tax collector shall note on each tax receipt and copy thereof the number and amount of each warrant the tax collector receives and shall write or stamp across the face of each warrant the date of receipt and the words “Received for taxes.” No warrant received in payment of taxes shall draw interest after the date of receipt.

      (3) This section does not apply to special assessments, appearing on the tax roll, levied by an irrigation, drainage or water supply district.

 

      311.270 Discounting county orders prohibited. No county officer shall purchase or receive in payment of taxes or in exchange, or otherwise, any county orders or any demand against the county of the county officer for a claim allowed by the proper officer to allow the claim during the term of office of the county officer, for an amount less than that expressed on the face of the order or demand.

 

      311.275 Grantor and grantee or buyer and seller proportionally liable. As between the grantor and the grantee of real property or the buyer and seller of personal property, when there is no express agreement as to payment of the taxes on the property becoming due and payable for the fiscal year in which the sale occurs, the grantor or seller is liable for the same proportion of the taxes as the part of the fiscal year prior to the day of the sale of the property bears to the whole of the fiscal year, and the grantee or buyer is liable for the remainder of the taxes. [Amended by 1977 c.718 §5]

 

      311.280 Payment of taxes on part of property assessed as one parcel; division; when division not allowed; division between manufactured structure and parcel. (1) Any person desiring to pay taxes on any part of any real estate assessed as one parcel or tract may do so by applying to the county assessor or deputy county assessor. The county assessor shall determine the relative or proportionate value such part bears to the value of the whole tract assessed, and shall file a statement thereof with the tax collector, on which basis the assessment shall be divided and taxes shall be collected accordingly.

      (2) The assessor or tax collector shall not divide an assessment under this section unless the person calling for the division of assessment owns, or holds a mortgage or other lien on that part only of such area on which the person desires to pay the taxes, and has filed with the assessor a true copy of the deed, contract of sale, mortgage or other instrument evidencing the interest in the part; provided that whenever such instrument is otherwise recorded in the county records, such filing shall not be required.

      (3) The assessor or tax collector shall not divide an assessment under this section unless all ad valorem taxes, fees and other charges required to be placed upon the tax roll that have been certified for collection under ORS 311.105 and 311.110 and become a lien upon the entire parcel of property have been paid. However, if the applicant for the division is a public body, only the portion of such taxes, fees and other charges apportionable to the part of the real estate owned by the public body, or on which the public body holds a mortgage or other lien, need be paid. As used in this subsection, “public body” means the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities, the state, a county, city, school district, irrigation or drainage district, a port, a water district and all other public or municipal corporations in the state exempt from tax under ORS 307.040 or 307.090.

      (4) In the case of a parcel or tract of real estate which is being assessed under one of the special assessment laws listed in ORS 308A.733 (2) or under ORS 358.480 to 358.545, the assessor or tax collector shall not divide the assessment unless the portion of any additional taxes or penalty apportionable to the part of the property disqualified from special assessment is paid.

      (5) In the case of property within the jurisdiction of a city or county which has adopted minor land partition regulations pursuant to ORS 92.046, the assessor shall not divide an assessment unless the person calling for the division of assessment has filed with the assessor evidence that the division has been approved as required by such regulations.

      (6) Whenever a manufactured structure is assessed as real property under ORS 308.875, and the security interest holder of the manufactured structure is a person different from the owner of the parcel of land upon which it is situated, the security interest holder may apply to the assessor for a division of the value of the entire parcel between the value of the manufactured structure and the value of the remainder of the parcel. Using this value division, the tax collector shall allocate the taxes between the manufactured structure and the remainder of the parcel, and the security interest holder of the manufactured structure may pay the taxes on the value attributable to the manufactured structure and thereby free the manufactured structure from the lien of those taxes. If a division is made and taxes and special assessments are paid on the value attributable to the manufactured structure, the county may reclassify the manufactured structure as personal property, forward the ownership document application information to the Department of Consumer and Business Services and allow the structure to be moved as provided in ORS 446.631 without payment of the taxes and special assessments attributable to the remainder of the parcel.

      (7) If protest is filed to the division, the matter shall be heard by the county commissioners or the county court (as defined in ORS 306.005) at its next regular session for transaction of county business, who shall make a final division of the assessment, and the tax collector shall collect and receipt for the taxes as so determined and ordered.

      (8) No person shall apply in any year under this section for a division of the assessment of a subdivision made on the assessment roll prepared as of January 1 of the year in which the subdivision is finally approved.

      311.285 Rights of occupant or tenant paying tax. If any tax on any real estate is paid by or collected from an occupant or tenant when there is some other person who, by agreement or otherwise, ought to pay the tax, or any part thereof, the occupant or tenant shall be entitled to recover by action the amount which the person should have paid with interest thereon, or the occupant or tenant may retain the same out of any rent due or accruing from the occupant or tenant to such person for real estate on which the tax is so paid.

      (2) If a tax collector neglects or refuses to pay over all moneys received for taxes to the county treasurer, the tax collector shall, in addition to the criminal penalty provided for in ORS 311.990 (6), be liable to pay damages in an amount equaling 10 percent of the amount not paid over, plus 12 percent interest per year on the damages from the day payment should have been made.

      (3) The moneys, damages and interest authorized to be collected under this section may be collected by suit upon the bond of the tax collector for the recovery of the same.

      (4) If a county treasurer neglects or refuses to distribute moneys in the unsegregated tax collections account as required by ORS 311.395 (6), the county treasurer shall be liable to pay damages in an amount equaling 10 percent of the amount not distributed as required by ORS 311.395, plus 12 percent interest per year on the damages from the day distribution should have been made.

      (a) First, to the payment of any taxes assessed against and due on the property for which the payment was made, paying first the earliest such taxes due on that property; and

      (b) Second, to the payment of taxes assessed on any other property which have by any means become a lien against the property for which the payment was made.

      (3)(a) Payments of property taxes made by the state on behalf of tax-deferred homestead property under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 shall be credited to the current tax year.

      (b) At the election of the taxpayer, payments of property taxes made by the taxpayer on behalf of tax-deferred homestead property under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 shall be credited as provided in subsection (2) of this section, except that the payments shall be credited first to the payment of taxes that are not qualified to be deferred under ORS 311.688 (1) or as a result of a determination of ineligibility made pursuant to ORS 311.689, paying first the earliest of such taxes due on that property.

      (c) Notwithstanding any contrary direction from the taxpayer, the tax collector shall credit payments of property taxes to the latest year for which taxes are due on the property for which payment is made if:

      (A) The payment is made by a payer who is a mortgagee, beneficiary under a deed of trust or vendor under a land sales contract and who pays taxes on behalf of any taxpayer; and

      (B) The mortgagee, beneficiary or vendor directs that the payment be credited to the latest year for which taxes are due on the property; and

      (4) The tax collector may, for convenience, divide the tax roll, as payments are made, into two portions, and file each separately, one portion containing the paid accounts and another portion containing the unpaid accounts. From time to time, and no later than the receipt of the next year’s tax roll, the tax collector shall compute and indicate on the tax roll the unpaid balance of taxes for each property assessment. [1965 c.344 §23 (enacted in lieu of 311.355); 1985 c.162 §6; 1987 c.219 §1; 1987 c.529 §3; 1989 c.601 §1; 1993 c.313 §2; 1999 c.22 §2; 2011 c.723 §20; 2012 c.13 §2; 2015 c.309 §9]

The tax collector shall keep a stub receipt or a copy of each receipt or a computer record of the same information on each receipt issued and such stub receipt, copy or computer record shall be a public record. The receipts shall be numbered consecutively except that if more than one validating machine is used in validating and numbering the receipts, a consecutive number series may be used for each machine if the series is identified by a machine number or letter. The stubs or copies of the receipts, or the computer record, shall contain the post-office or residence address of the taxpayer, which may be ascertained and entered at the time of the payment. Preparation of a microfilm, a microfiche or an electronically stored record of the receipts constitutes a computer record.

      (2) If the tax statement has been sent to the taxpayer with a copy to be retained by the taxpayer, no copy of the receipt need be given or sent to the taxpayer unless the taxpayer requests one.

      (3) A temporary or interim receipt may be issued on payment of any installment of less than one-quarter of a particular tax account, each such receipt to be entered in the records of the tax collector’s office.

      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the tax collector’s copy of the tax receipt may be destroyed when seven years have elapsed from the date the receipt was issued. [1965 c.344 §24 (enacted in lieu of 311.355); 1979 c.701 §1; 1993 c.6 §9; 2003 c.108 §2]

      311.370 Receipts for taxes collected in advance of extension on the tax roll; entries in assessment roll; deposit of moneys in special account; posting payments; excess collections or deficiencies; reimbursement for refunds. (1)(a) For all taxes, penalties and other charges collected by the tax collector under, including, but not limited to, ORS 92.095, 100.110, 285C.050 to 285C.250, 308.260, 308.865, 308A.119, 308A.324, 308A.700 to 308A.733, 311.165, 311.206, 311.229, 311.405 (4) or (5), 311.411, 311.415, 311.465, 354.690, 358.525, 446.631 and 454.225, the tax collector shall issue receipts similar in form to the receipts issued on payment of taxes regularly charged on the tax roll.

      (b) The assessor shall enter all assessments of property to which paragraph (a) of this subsection applies in the assessment roll and shall make proper entries showing the extension of the taxes in the usual manner and as though no payment to the tax collector had been made.

      (2) Upon receipt, the tax collector shall deposit with the county treasurer all money collected by the tax collector under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Upon delivery of the assessment roll pursuant to ORS 311.115, the tax collector shall post the payments evidenced by the receipts, and the amount of any underpayment or overpayment. The tax collector shall then make a statement to the county treasurer specifying the amount to be retained in the special account to make the refunds required under subsection (4) of this section. The tax collector shall direct the county treasurer to transfer the balance in the special account to the unsegregated tax collections account described in ORS 311.385.

      (4) Any sum collected by the tax collector that exceeds the amount extended on the tax roll as provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section by more than $10 shall be refunded to the taxpayer by the county treasurer upon receiving instructions for doing so from the tax collector. If an amount remains that cannot be refunded by June 30 of the next calendar year, the tax collector shall instruct the treasurer to transfer the amount to the unsegregated tax collections account described in ORS 311.385.

      (5) If a sum less than the tax charged on the tax roll has been collected, the deficiency shall be canceled by the tax collector if the deficiency is $10 or less, and the tax collector shall note upon the tax roll opposite the appropriate account, “Tax deficiency canceled pursuant to ORS 311.370.” Otherwise, the deficiency shall be collected as provided by law.

      (6) If an appeal that is perfected under ORS 311.467 for taxes collected under ORS 311.465 results in a refund under ORS 311.806, the reimbursement for the refund to the unsegregated tax collections account shall be made from the account provided for in subsection (2) of this section.

TAX DISTRIBUTION PROCEDURE

 

      311.375 Forwarding state taxes by county treasurers. (1) On or before December 1 in each year each county treasurer shall pay over to the State Treasurer one-half of the amount of state taxes charged to the county of the county treasurer for the fiscal year then current. In similar manner the county treasurer shall pay over one-quarter of such taxes on or before March 1, and the remainder of such taxes on or before June 1, of the fiscal year.

      (2) Each such payment of state taxes shall be made without deduction for any cause out of the first moneys collected and paid into the county treasury over which the county has control.

      (3) If a county fails to pay to the State Treasurer its entire apportionment of the taxes within 30 days after the dates prescribed in subsection (1) of this section, the unpaid balance shall be deemed delinquent, and is a debt due and owing by the county to the state and the county shall pay the legal rate of interest thereon from such date until paid. The payment of such interest shall not relieve the county treasurer from any penalty imposed by law for failure to pay such taxes as required by law.

      (4) If a county treasurer fails to pay to the State Treasurer any money in the hands of the county treasurer for the payment of the amount of state taxes charged to the county at the time prescribed in subsection (1) of this section, the county treasurer shall, in addition to other penalties, be liable to the following:

      (a) If the county treasurer fails for a period of 10 days after the time prescribed, the county treasurer shall forfeit to the state 20 percent on the amount withheld.

      (b) If the county treasurer fails for a period of 30 days after the time prescribed, the county treasurer shall forfeit the office as treasurer and is a public defaulter. [Amended by 1991 c.220 §4]

 

      311.385 Deposit of property tax moneys in unsegregated tax collections account; time requirements. (1) The tax collector shall deposit all property tax moneys with the county treasurer no later than:

      (a) One business day after:

      (A) Payment of the moneys is made in person at the office of the tax collector; or

      (B) The tax collector receives moneys collected by a financial institution or other collection agency; or

      (b) Thirty calendar days after the payment arrives by mail in the county mail receptacle.

      (2) The tax collector shall take a receipt for all moneys deposited with the county treasurer.

      (3) Property tax moneys shall not be deposited in any account other than the unsegregated tax collections account, except as provided in ORS 311.370, 311.484 and 311.508.

      (4) No later than one business day after receiving notice of collection of tax moneys by a financial institution or other collection agency, the tax collector shall notify the county treasurer of the collection of those tax moneys.

      (5) Except as provided in ORS 311.370, 311.484 and 311.508, the county treasurer shall deposit all property tax moneys to an account in the records of the county treasurer designated as the unsegregated tax collections account. Only those moneys that will be distributed under ORS 311.390 and interest earned from the investment of those moneys shall be deposited to the unsegregated tax collections account.

      (6) As used in this section, “property tax moneys” includes all ad valorem taxes and all taxes on property, as defined in ORS 310.140, and all other amounts specifically authorized by law to be included on the assessment and tax roll, that are certified for collection under ORS 310.060 or other law and any interest on those taxes. [1963 c.606 §2; 1967 c.105 §5; 1969 c.595 §6; 1971 c.737 §4; 1985 c.162 §1; 1989 c.796 §13; 1991 c.459 §244; 1995 c.79 §147; 1997 c.631 §449; 2003 c.190 §§8,9; 2007 c.537 §3]

 

      311.388 Additional taxes or penalties; deposit; distribution. (1) Additional taxes or penalties collected because of the disqualification of property from special assessment or exemption shall be deposited in the unsegregated tax collections account in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes.

      (2) For purposes of completing the percentage distribution schedule under ORS 311.390, the tax collector shall treat any additional taxes or penalties charged because of the disqualification of property from special assessment or exemption as having been imposed by the districts within which the property subject to the additional taxes or penalties is located. The amount of additional taxes or penalties attributable to each district shall be determined based on the percentage that the total ad valorem property tax rate of the district bears to the total rate for the property in the year in which the additional taxes or penalties were added to the roll. [1991 c.459 §246; 1997 c.541 §291]

 

      311.390 Tax and interest distribution percentage schedule; deduction of certain amounts distributable to municipal corporations; changed or additional levies. (1)(a) When the tax collector receives the assessor’s certificate pursuant to ORS 311.115, the tax collector shall prepare and file with the county treasurer a percentage schedule of the ratio of taxes on property, as defined in ORS 310.140, and other amounts to be collected, after reductions necessary to comply with section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, after making adjustments in accordance with ORS 311.105 (1)(c), for each governmental unit as shown in such certificate, compared to the total of each of those amounts.

      (b) If a tax supervising and conservation commission has submitted to the tax collector a list of municipal corporations subject to proration and the amounts prorated under ORS 294.632, before the tax collector calculates the ratio of taxes on property under this subsection, the tax collector shall deduct the amounts submitted by the tax supervising and conservation commission from the amounts scheduled for distribution under this section for municipal corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the tax supervising and conservation commission. The amount deducted from the distribution to the municipal corporations shall be added to the amount distributed to the county.

      (c) The schedule shall be approved by the county accountant, if one exists in the county, or by the county clerk before filing. Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the distribution of collections by the tax collector shall be made on the basis of the ratios computed pursuant to this section. The ratios computed pursuant to this section for a given fiscal year shall be used for the distribution of all taxes on property or penalties that have been imposed, collected and received for that fiscal year, regardless of the actual date of receipt, except for moneys retained by a county to pay bankruptcy costs under ORS 311.484. Interest earned on moneys in the unsegregated tax collections account shall be distributed according to the ratio applicable to the year in which the moneys are distributed.

      (2) If, after the ratios are computed pursuant to this section, the amount of a levy or other tax on property is changed, or a levy or other tax on property is filed with the assessor pursuant to ORS 310.060 that had not been included in the tax distribution schedule for that year, the tax collector shall revise the percentages provided in subsection (1) of this section to reflect the corrected or added levy or tax and shall adjust the amounts previously distributed and to be distributed thereafter to reflect the revision in percentages.

      (3) If, in the opinion of the tax collector, it is not feasible to make the revisions described in subsection (2) of this section, the tax collector shall treat the amount of the change in levy or tax or the additional levy or tax as a separate tax collection and segregate the moneys collected for the particular district or districts in the periodic statement of tax collections given to the county treasurer pursuant to ORS 311.395.

      (4) If the percentage schedule is revised, a copy shall be filed with the county treasurer after approval by the county accountant, if one exists in the county, or by the county clerk.

      (5) If, after the ratios are computed under this section, a levy or tax is changed or a levy or tax is filed with the assessor pursuant to ORS 310.060, that was not included in the tax distribution schedule for that year, future distributions of interest shall be based on the revised percentages that reflect the corrected or added levy or tax. No adjustments shall be made for previously distributed interest. [1963 c.606 §3; 1965 c.492 §2; 1967 c.105 §6; 1969 c.595 §7; 1983 c.310 §18; 1985 c.162 §2; 1991 c.459 §247; 1997 c.541 §292; 2001 c.114 §28; 2003 c.190 §§10,11; 2007 c.537 §4; 2009 c.596 §10]

 

      311.391 Notice to taxing districts of amount of property taxes. No later than five working days after the tax collector files with the county treasurer the percentage schedule required under ORS 311.390, the tax collector shall notify each taxing district of the amount of taxes on property imposed for each district for that fiscal year. [1991 c.459 §247a]

 

      311.392 County’s option to advance to municipalities taxes levied prior to collection. (1) If, in the discretion of the county court, it is more economical to advance to those municipalities from the general fund of the county the total amount of taxes, assessments or other charges levied against property in the county, the county court may advance from the general fund of the county the full amount of the taxes, assessments and charges levied by those subdivisions and the county court may order the county tax collector to revise the tax distribution schedule provided by ORS 311.390 so that all taxes, assessments and charges advanced by the county will be allocated to the county. If the county makes the payments provided in this section, it shall have no recourse against the political subdivision for recovery of the shrinkage in collections from that anticipated at the time the payment was made.

      (2) If the county advances taxes under this subsection, before December 1 of each year, it may deduct from the levy the three percent discount which would have been given by the district had all of the taxes been paid by November 15 and turned over to the district on or before December 1 of each year. If the payment is made after December 1, no discount shall be taken by the county. [1965 c.492 §4; 1969 c.595 §8]

 

      311.395 Periodic statements of tax collections; crediting to funds; distribution to taxing units. (1) The tax collector shall make statements of the exact amounts of property tax moneys in cash and warrants collected as follows:

      (a) For the period beginning on the first Monday following the last Friday in October through the last Friday in November, the tax collector shall make weekly statements of those taxes that are collected for the current tax year.

      (b) For the period beginning the first Monday following the last Friday of November through the last Friday of October of the ensuing year, the tax collector shall make quarterly statements of those taxes that are collected for the current tax year.

      (c) The tax collector shall make quarterly statements of taxes collected for prior years.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection, if the balance in the unsegregated tax collection account as of the close of any month for any tax year (the current tax year or any prior tax year) exceeds $10,000 or if requested by any taxing district, and if weekly statements are not required, then the tax collector shall make a statement for the period since the last statement for the tax year.

      (e) If the processing of tax payments for the current tax year received or postmarked on or before the November 15 due date (or if the due date is extended under ORS 311.507, the due date pursuant to the extension) is not substantially completed as of the last Friday in November, the tax collector shall continue to make weekly statements until the end of a week when the processing is substantially completed.

      (2)(a) Each statement shall be of taxes collected during the weekly, monthly, quarterly or other period for which the statement is required.

      (b) The statements prepared under subsection (1) of this section shall specify the tax years for which the payments of taxes were made.

      (c) A copy of each statement shall be filed with the county clerk and a copy shall be filed with the county treasurer no later than the fifth business day after the last business day of the period for which the statement is prepared. A copy of each statement shall be retained in the office of the tax collector.

      (3) For the purposes of this section, property tax moneys are collected when:

      (a) Payment is made in person at the office of the tax collector;

      (b) The tax collector receives tax moneys or notice of tax moneys collected by a financial institution or other collection agency;

      (c) The tax collector receives payment or notice of payment of tax moneys by the state; or

      (d) The tax collector has posted a payment that arrived by mail in the county mail receptacle.

      (4) Each statement required under subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall separately state the amount deposited into the property tax bankruptcy account under ORS 311.484 for the period covered by the statement.

      (5) The statements required under subsections (1) and (2) of this section may be made more often and for shorter periods if the tax collector so desires but one of the statements so filed shall cover a period coinciding with the last business day of the particular calendar month or quarter during the period.

      (6) The county treasurer shall credit the total amount of moneys set out in the statements prepared under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, except for the amount deposited into the property tax bankruptcy account under ORS 311.484, to the several funds for which the moneys were respectively received in accordance with the schedule provided in ORS 311.390. The county treasurer shall keep the moneys and warrants received from the tax collector in their respective funds.

      (7) Within five business days of receiving a statement required by subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the county treasurer shall distribute the amount of money set out in the statement, except for the amount deposited into the property tax bankruptcy account under ORS 311.484, to the several taxing units according to the ratios provided in ORS 311.390. The county treasurer shall distribute interest earned on moneys in the unsegregated tax collections account at least as often as the treasurer receives a statement from the tax collector under subsection (1)(b) or (d) of this section. When statements are received under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the county treasurer shall distribute interest at least once a calendar month.

[Amended by 1953 c.707 §2; 1955 c.720 §3; 1981 c.346 §1; 1985 c.794 §1; 1991 c.459 §249; 1991 c.903 §4; 1997 c.541 §293; 2001 c.42 §1; 2001 c.229 §1; 2011 c.113 §1; 2012 c.30 §6]

 

      311.410 Effect of property transfer or lease termination on lien and on taxability of property. (1) Real property or personal property that is subject to taxation on July 1 shall remain taxable and taxes levied thereon for the ensuing tax year shall become due and payable, notwithstanding any subsequent transfer of the property to an exempt ownership or use. Taxes that are unpaid as of the termination of a lease, lease purchase agreement or other instrument resulting in the taxation of the property shall remain a lien on the property as of the day prior to the termination of the lease, lease purchase agreement or other instrument. Real or personal property exempt from taxation on July 1 shall remain exempt for the ensuing tax year, notwithstanding any transfer within the tax year to a taxable ownership or use.

      (2) A sale or transfer of personal property or any part of personal property does not affect the lien under ORS 311.405 (3)(a)(A), (4) or (5). Taxes on personal property transferred from a tax exempt to a taxable ownership or use shall be a lien on any and all of the personal property assessed to the person and on any and all of the taxable personal property of the person assessed from and including the date of transfer until paid. The liens shall be subject to this section and ORS 311.405.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 311.405 (4) or (5), real or personal property is exempt for the ensuing tax year if the property is transferred or changed from a taxable to an exempt ownership or use at any time before July 1 of any year. However, if the property is exempt under a provision of ORS chapter 307 that requires the filing of a claim for exemption, the transfer does not operate to render the property exempt from taxation for the ensuing tax year unless the required claim for exemption is filed on or before the date specified in the applicable statute or within 30 days after the date of acquisition or, if relevant under the applicable exemption statute, the change of use of the property, whichever is later. This section does not limit other statutes that prescribe filing dates for claiming an exemption.

      (4) Real or personal property is taxable for the ensuing tax year if the property is transferred or changed at any time before July 1 of any year from an exempt ownership to a taxable ownership or taxable use. Transfer of real or personal property from a tax-exempt use to a taxable use at any time between January 1 and June 30 of any year constitutes notice to the transferee, owner or person in control of the property that the property will be subject to taxation for the ensuing tax year. In the case of real property, the transferee, owner or person in control of the property shall advise the county assessor of the transfer. In the case of personal property, the transferee, owner or person in control of the property shall make a return of the property that lists the information required by ORS 308.290 within 30 days after the transfer.

      (5) Real property that is the subject of eminent domain proceedings instituted by a public body shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been transferred as of the date of payment therefor, the date of entry into possession by the public body or the date of entry of judgment in the eminent domain proceedings, whichever is earlier. [Amended by 1953 c.707 §2; 1963 c.233 §1; 1969 c.237 §2; 1973 c.402 §16; 1977 c.884 §18; 1979 c.692 §11; 1979 c.704 §2; 1981 c.346 §2; 1987 c.756 §9; 1991 c.459 §250; 1993 c.270 §59; 1995 c.513 §3; 1997 c.819 §13; 2001 c.42 §2; 2001 c.229 §2; 2005 c.94 §63; 2007 c.524 §1]

      (e) “Conveyance” means the transfer of, or a contract to transfer, fee title to any real property located in this state to a transferee whose property is exempt from taxation under ORS 307.040 or 307.090. “Conveyance” does not include a transfer of fee title of less than an entire parcel of property for state highway, county road or city street purposes.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 205.130, a county clerk may not record or cause to be recorded an instrument conveying or contracting to convey fee title to real property to an entity whose property is exempt from taxation under ORS 307.040 or 307.090 unless the instrument is accompanied by a certificate issued by the assessor of the county in which the real property is located attesting that all charges against the real property as of the date of the recording have been paid.

      (3)(a) On or after July 1 of any year, and before the date on which the assessor makes a certificate pursuant to ORS 311.105, a person seeking to record an instrument described in subsection (2) of this section shall pay to the tax collector of the county:

      (A) If the exact amount of charges against the real property can be computed by the county assessor, the exact amount.

      (b) Amounts withheld pursuant to this subsection are held in trust for the taxing districts within the county in which the real property is located and shall be paid to the county tax collector before the consideration, net of the amounts withheld, may be paid to the transferor.

      (5)(a) If all charges against the real property as of the date of the recording have been paid, the county assessor shall issue the certificate described in subsection (2) of this section and may not unreasonably withhold delivery of the certificate.

      (b) The certificate shall be in a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue.

      (6) Any deficiency in the amount required to be paid under this section:

The real property acquired by the state or any political subdivision thereof shall be free and clear of any liens or liability for such property taxes.

      (2) In the event the real property acquired by the state or any political subdivision thereof was a part of a larger parcel upon which property taxes for any year or years prior to the fiscal year of such acquisition have become a lien, only such proportion of such taxes as the assessed value of the part acquired by the state or the political subdivision thereof bears to the assessed value of the said larger parcel shall be transferred to and paid out of the award of the jury given in said proceedings, and the remainder of such taxes shall continue a lien upon the remainder of said larger parcel.

(1) Whenever, by eminent domain proceedings, the State of Oregon or any political subdivision thereof acquires title to any real property upon which property taxes have been levied for the fiscal year in which such property is acquired, the state or the political subdivision thereof shall pay such proportion of said taxes as the period from the date of acquisition until the end of the fiscal year bears to the entire fiscal year. The remainder of said taxes shall become a lien upon and shall be paid out of the award of the jury given in said eminent domain proceedings.

      (2) In the event the real property acquired by the state or any political subdivision thereof is a part of a larger parcel upon which property taxes have been levied for the fiscal year of such acquisition, only such proportion of said taxes as the assessed value of the part acquired by the state or a political subdivision thereof bears to the assessed value of said larger parcel shall be paid by the state or the political subdivision thereof or become a lien and be paid out of the award of the jury as provided in this section, and the remainder of such taxes shall continue a lien upon the remainder of said larger parcel.

      (a) The county assessor discovers personal property subject to assessment for taxation in any year and taxes imposed on the property in a prior year are delinquent; or

      (b) In the opinion of the assessor it seems probable that personal property may be removed from the county, sold, dissipated or destroyed before the taxes on the property otherwise become due and payable and it further appears that the owner or person liable for the taxes had no property subject to taxation in the county during either of the two preceding tax years, or was delinquent in the payment of any tax imposed during the two preceding tax years in respect to property in any jurisdiction, whether within or without the state, or is not financially responsible or intends to depart from the state before the taxes become due.

      (2) The assessor may, immediately after listing and valuing the personal property for assessment and taxation, levy, demand and collect for remittance to the tax collector, or the tax collector may collect, the taxes on the property as follows:

      (a) If the assessor is able to compute the exact amount of taxes, special assessments, fees and charges, such amount shall be paid to the assessor for remittance to the tax collector or directly to the tax collector; or

      (b) If the assessor is unable to compute the exact amount at the time, either:

      (A) There shall be paid the amount that the assessor estimates is needed to pay the taxes, special assessments, fees and other charges to become due; or

      (B) There shall be deposited with the tax collector a bond with a good and sufficient undertaking in the amount that the assessor considers adequate to ensure payment of the taxes to become due.

If the tax court, upon review, orders a refund, the county treasurer shall make the refund from the special account within three days after entry of the department’s order.

      (4) If the owner or person liable for the taxes on the personal property fails to pay the tax on demand by the assessor, the assessor shall certify the assessment and tax levies made under this section to the tax collector of the county. The taxes thereupon shall be collected by the tax collector in the manner of collecting delinquent taxes on personal property. The taxes when so certified by the assessor are delinquent and subject to the provisions of law for the collection of delinquent taxes on personal property. [Amended by 1955 c.710 §2; 1975 c.780 §12; 1979 c.350 §14; 1981 c.804 §89; 1995 c.650 §67; 1999 c.21 §29]

      (2) The review shall be governed by the provisions of ORS chapter 305, in so far as such provisions are applicable and not in conflict with this section.

      (3) The tax court magistrate shall complete its review and determination within 20 days after its receipt of the petition for review and shall either affirm the action taken by the assessor or order a refund of the taxes paid. The decision of the tax court magistrate shall be final. No rehearing shall be had except on the tax court magistrate’s own motion; and the decision shall not be appealable under ORS 305.501. Any costs incident to the hearing shall be assessed by the tax court magistrate against the losing party. [1955 c.710 §1; 1973 c.343 §2; 1977 c.870 §38; 1995 c.650 §68]

The tax collector shall cause such property to be sold or sell such property in the manner provided in ORS 311.644. [Amended by 1973 c.305 §7; 1981 c.346 §8; 2001 c.41 §1]

 

      311.473 Foreclosure sale of property to be removed from county; required notice by financial institution; recourse for failure to give notice. (1) Any financial institution, as defined in ORS 317.010, or agent or representative of a financial institution, that, in the process of foreclosing any security interest or other lien on taxable personal property, including property classified as real property machinery and equipment, or after the lien is foreclosed, causes the property to be removed, or is knowledgeable that the property will be removed by another after the foreclosure sale, from the county in which the property is assessed or seized, shall notify the tax collector of that county prior to the removal. The notice shall be mailed to the tax collector, return receipt requested, and shall contain a description of the property that is the subject of the foreclosure, together with the name and address of the owner or owners of the property.

      (2) Failure to give the notice required under subsection (1) of this section shall not affect the foreclosure, but the tax collector shall have recourse against the financial institution on behalf of the taxing units for any damages sustained on account of failure to mail the notice.

The statement shall contain a transcript of so much of the tax roll as relates to the property and the owner thereof. The tax collector receiving the certified statement shall have the same power to collect the taxes, with interest, penalties and costs thereon, as the tax collector has to collect taxes levied on personal property assessed in the tax collector’s own county. The tax collector making the collection immediately shall remit the amount collected, less the costs, to the tax collector from whom the statement and certified transcript was received, together with a statement showing in detail the respective amounts of taxes, interest, penalties and costs collected. [Amended by 2001 c.41 §3]

(1) As used in this section, “property” is limited to personal property and machinery and equipment that is characterized by the county assessor as real property machinery and equipment and that is described in ORS 308.115 (3).

      (2)(a) Each year, the tax collector may collect taxes on property that are delinquent by seizure and sale of any of the following property:

      (A) The property assessed.

      (B) The taxable property belonging to or in the possession or control of the person assessed.

      (b) No property that is subject to taxation shall be exempt from seizure and sale for the payment of property taxes imposed on personal property or real property machinery and equipment.

      (3)(a) Immediately upon taking the property into possession, the tax collector shall:

      (A) Notify, by mail, the owner, or person in possession or control of the property at the time of the seizure. If the name and address of the owner or the person in control or possession of the property is unknown to the tax collector, the tax collector shall notify the person to whom the property was assessed at the address noted upon the tax roll. If the property was not assessed, and the owner or person in possession or control of the property at the time of the seizure is unknown to the tax collector, no notice need be given under this subparagraph.

      (B) Notify, by mail, all security interest holders and other encumbrancers of record, at their addresses as shown in the records of encumbrance. If no addresses appear in the records of encumbrance, no mailing is required under this subparagraph.

      (C) Advertise the seized property for sale by posting written or printed notices of the time and place of sale in three public places in the county not less than 10 days prior to the sale. Failure to give or post the notices required by this paragraph shall not invalidate the sale. However, the owner, encumbrancer or other injured person shall have recourse against the tax collector for damages.

      (D) State either that the property seized is the property assessed or is property assessed as the same category, or that the property seized is distrained under ORS 311.405 (3)(a)(B).

      (c) If payment of the property taxes, interest, penalties and costs is made before the time fixed for sale, the tax collector shall release the seized property.

      (d) If any person disputes the statements contained in the notice described in this subsection or the property tax lien priority, the burden of proving the statements contained in the notice or the priority of the property tax lien shall be on the tax collector.

      (e) If it is determined that the seized property is exempt or nontaxable or that the taxpayer has no interest in the property, or that the taxes on that property have been paid, the tax collector shall release the property. However, if it is determined that the taxpayer has an interest in the property and that the property is taxable and is not exempt from seizure and sale, the tax collector shall proceed to sell the property at public vendue unless the taxes are paid as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (4) At the sale the person offering to pay the amount of taxes, interest and penalties due on the property for the least quantity of the property shall be the purchaser of that quantity, and the remainder of the property shall be discharged from the lien. If no bidder at the sale offers to pay the amount due against the property at the time set for the sale or at any adjournment of the sale, title to the property shall immediately vest in the county free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. Thereafter, the county governing body may sell the property, or any part of the property, at private sale, without further notice, for a price and on such terms as the governing body considers reasonable.

However, if the property is subject to a judgment, mortgage, security interest or other lien or encumbrance of record, the excess shall be paid over to the holder or holders of the judgment, mortgage, security interest or other lien or encumbrance as the interest of the holder or holders may appear. [Formerly 311.640]

 

      311.645 Charging personal property taxes against real property. (1) Whenever, after delinquency, in the opinion of the tax collector, it becomes necessary to charge taxes on personal property against real property in order that the personal property taxes may be collected, the tax collector shall select for the purpose some particular tract or lots of real property owned by the person, firm, corporation or association owing the personal property taxes and shall note on the tax roll opposite the tract or lots selected the taxes on the personal property. Thereafter, the personal property taxes shall be a lien on the real property selected and shall be enforced in the same manner as other tax liens on real property. The notation of the lien, with the date thereof, shall be entered on the tax roll. Unless the notation and date are entered on the roll, the lien shall be of no force or effect.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section shall not be applicable to real property as to which all of the following conditions exist:

The notice shall be mailed to the tax collector, return receipt requested, and shall contain a list of the personal property or real property machinery and equipment to be sold, together with the name and address of the owners of the property. Failure to mail or deliver the notice shall not invalidate the sale, but the tax collector shall have recourse against the secured party on behalf of the taxing units for any damages sustained on account of failure to mail or deliver the notice.

      (2) Upon receipt of the notice under subsection (1) of this section, the tax collector shall determine if the owner of the property has paid the property taxes and if the tax collector finds that the taxes are due and owing, the tax collector, unless the taxes are paid upon demand, shall distrain the property under ORS 311.644, or so much of the property as may be necessary to pay the taxes, interest, penalties and costs. No transfer of personal property or real property machinery and equipment to the secured party or to the holder of a lien on the property in any way shall affect the lien for property taxes assessed against the property.

      (3) The department shall create and maintain a list of homesteads determined to be eligible under this section for reactivation for deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701. Homesteads shall appear on the list in the order in which the individuals who own the homesteads file a claim for deferral in the manner prescribed in ORS 311.672 on or after October 7, 2013.

      (4) A determination of eligibility under this section has the effect of reactivating the homestead for deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 beginning with the first property tax year that begins after the date on which the determination of eligibility is made and continuing for all subsequent property tax years for which the homestead and the individuals who own the homestead remain eligible for the deferral.

      (5)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, for the property tax year beginning on July 1, 2014, the maximum number of homesteads appearing on the list created pursuant to subsection (3) of this section that may be reactivated for deferral under this section is 700.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, deferral may not be granted under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 with respect to a claim if, at the time the claim is filed, property taxes imposed on the homestead of any individual filing the claim have been deferred and are delinquent or have been canceled.

      (b) The claim for deferral must be filed with the assessor of the county in which the homestead is located, after January 1 and on or before April 15 immediately preceding the property tax year for which deferral is claimed.

      (2) The county assessor shall forward each claim filed under this section to the department, and the department shall determine whether the property is eligible for the deferral.

      (3) If the taxpayers and the homestead are determined to be eligible under ORS 311.668 and 311.670, respectively, a timely claim for deferral has the effect of:

      (a) Deferring the payment of the property taxes levied on the homestead for the property tax year beginning on July 1 of the year in which the claim is filed.

      (b) Continuing the deferral of the payment by the taxpayers of any property taxes deferred under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 for previous years that have not become delinquent under ORS 311.686.

      (c) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 311.689, continuing the deferral of the payment by the taxpayers of any future property taxes for as long as the homestead remains eligible for, and the taxpayers remain eligible to claim, the deferral.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section:

      (A) For the property tax year beginning on July 1, 2012, the maximum number of claims for deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 that may be granted to taxpayers who have not previously been granted deferral is the number of such claims granted for the property tax year beginning on July 1, 2011, multiplied by 105 percent.

      (B) For each property tax year beginning after July 1, 2012, the maximum number of claims for deferral that may be granted to taxpayers who have not previously been granted deferral is the maximum number determined under this subsection for the immediately preceding property tax year multiplied by 105 percent.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, spouses who continue deferral under ORS 311.688 are not considered taxpayers who have not previously been granted deferral.

      (c) If the number of eligible claims described in paragraph (a) of this subsection exceeds the maximum number determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection, claims shall be granted in ascending order based on the ratio that is equal to the real market value of the homestead entered on the last certified assessment and tax roll divided by the county median RMV of the homestead determined under ORS 311.670 (6), until the maximum number determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection is reached.

      (5) Any taxpayer aggrieved by the denial of a claim for, or discontinuation of, deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 may appeal in the manner provided by ORS 305.404 to 305.560. [1963 c.569 §10; 1977 c.160 §4; 1983 c.550 §4; 1989 c.948 §15; 1993 c.19 §12; 1995 c.803 §2; 1999 c.1097 §3; 2011 c.723 §4; 2013 c.31 §3; 2013 c.494 §2; 2015 c.309 §4]

 

      311.673 State liens against tax-deferred property. (1) The Department of Revenue shall have a lien against tax-deferred property for payment of deferred taxes plus interest on the deferred taxes and any fees paid by the department in connection with the filing, recording, release or satisfaction of the lien. The liens for deferred taxes shall attach to the property on July 1 of the year in which the taxes were assessed. The deferred property tax liens shall have the same priority as other real property tax liens except that the lien of mortgages, trust deeds or security interests that is filed, recorded or noted on any certificate of title or in any record maintained by the Department of Consumer and Business Services pursuant to ORS 446.566 to 446.646 prior in time to the attachment of the lien for deferred taxes shall be prior to the liens for deferred taxes.

      (2) The deferred property tax lien may be foreclosed by the department as if it were a purchase money mortgage under ORS chapter 88. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the department if the department prevails in a foreclosure action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in a foreclosure action under this section if the court determines that the department had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

      (3) Receipts from foreclosure proceedings shall be credited in the same manner as other repayments of deferred property taxes under ORS 311.701.

      (4) This section applies only to deferred property tax liens arising prior to October 3, 1989. [1977 c.160 §15; 1981 c.897 §47; 1983 c.550 §13; 1985 c.140 §1; 1989 c.948 §1; 1995 c.526 §1; 1995 c.696 §20; 2007 c.363 §1]

 

      311.674 Listing of tax-deferred property; interest accrual. (1) If eligibility for deferral of homestead property is established as provided in ORS 311.666 to 311.701, the Department of Revenue shall notify the county assessor and the county assessor shall show on the current ad valorem assessment and tax roll that the property is tax-deferred property by an entry clearly designating the property as tax-deferred property.

      (2) When requested by the department, the tax collector shall send to the department the tax statement for each tax-deferred property as soon as the taxes are extended upon the roll.

      (3) Interest shall accrue on the actual amount of taxes advanced to the county for the tax-deferred property at the rate of six percent per annum.

      (4)(a) For property taxes deferred after October 3, 1979, the state liens provided by ORS 311.673 and 311.679 and recorded under ORS 311.675 shall be for the actual amount of taxes advanced to the counties and not for the gross amount of taxes for which the property would be liable as shown on the tax statement for each tax-deferred property.

      (b) For taxes deferred prior to October 3, 1979, the lien under ORS 311.673 is for the gross amount of taxes extended upon the tax roll against each tax-deferred property and interest shall continue to accrue on the gross amount of taxes rather than on the actual amount of taxes paid to the county. [1963 c.569 §11; 1971 c.572 §1; 1977 c.160 §5; 1979 c.678 §1; 1989 c.948 §4; 2011 c.723 §5; 2014 c.41 §1]

 

      311.675 Recording liens; recording constitutes notice of state lien. (1) In each county in which there is tax-deferred property, the Department of Revenue shall cause to be recorded in the mortgage records of the county a list of tax-deferred properties that lie in the county. The list shall contain a description of the property as listed on the assessment roll together with the name of the owner as listed on the assessment roll.

      (2)(a) The recording of tax-deferred properties under subsection (1) of this section is notice that the Department of Revenue claims a lien against those properties in the amount of the deferred taxes plus interest on the deferred taxes, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and any fees paid by the department in connection with the filing, recording, release or satisfaction of the lien.

      (b) If the recording of tax-deferred properties under subsection (1) of this section occurred prior to January 1, 1990, the recording is notice that the department claims a lien against those properties in the amount of the deferred taxes plus interest on the deferred taxes, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and any fees paid by the department in connection with the filing, recording, release or satisfaction of the lien, whether or not the amount of taxes and interest on the deferred taxes, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) or fees is listed.

      (3)(a) When an ownership document is issued under ORS 446.566 to 446.646, or issuance of the document is pending, for a tax-deferred manufactured structure assessed as personal property under ORS 308.875, the Department of Revenue shall file with the Department of Consumer and Business Services an application for notation of the deferred property tax lien as a security interest on behalf of the State of Oregon. The Department of Consumer and Business Services shall note the lien as a security interest in the same manner as other security interests in manufactured structures. A lien noted as a security interest in records maintained by the Department of Consumer and Business Services pursuant to ORS 446.566 to 446.646 shall have the same legal effect as other security interests in manufactured structures.

      (b) For any other tax-deferred homestead assessed as personal property, the Department of Revenue may file notice of the deferred property tax lien as a security interest on behalf of the State of Oregon with the office of the Secretary of State or with any other designated filing office pursuant to ORS chapter 79.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 182.040 to 182.060 and 205.320 relating to the time and manner of payment of fees to the county clerk, the department shall not be required to pay any filing, indexing or recording fees to the county in connection with the filing, recording, release or satisfaction of liens against tax-deferred properties of that county in advance or at the time entry is made. The manner of payment of the fees shall be as provided in ORS 205.395 for the payment of fees for filing, recording and making entry of warrants or orders in the County Clerk Lien Record.

      (b) The Department of Revenue shall pay filing fees for any application for notation of the deferred property tax lien as a security interest in tax-deferred properties to the Department of Consumer and Business Services as provided in ORS 446.646 or in rules adopted under ORS 446.646.

      (c) If the Department of Revenue files notice of the deferred property tax lien as a security interest on behalf of the State of Oregon with the office of the Secretary of State or with any other designated filing office under subsection (3) of this section, the department shall pay filing fees to the Secretary of State or to the other filing office pursuant to ORS chapter 79.

      311.676 State to pay counties amount equivalent to deferred taxes. (1) Upon determining the amount of deferred taxes on tax-deferred property for the tax year, subject to available funds, the Department of Revenue shall pay to the respective county tax collectors an amount equivalent to the deferred taxes, less three percent, from the revolving account established under ORS 311.701.

      (2) The department shall maintain accounts for each deferred property and shall accrue interest only on the actual amount of taxes advanced to the county. [1963 c.569 §24; 1967 c.335 §35; 1967 c.494 §1; 1971 c.572 §2; 1977 c.160 §6; 1979 c.678 §2; 1980 c.19 §8; 1983 c.550 §14; 1999 c.1097 §4; 2001 c.184 §2; 2001 c.753 §27; 2011 c.723 §6]

      311.678 Annual notice to taxpayer claiming deferral in current tax year. (1) On or before December 15 of each year, the Department of Revenue shall send a notice to each taxpayer who has claimed deferral of property taxes for the current tax year. The notice shall:

      (a) Inform the taxpayer that the property taxes have or have not been deferred in the current year.

      (b) Show the total amount of deferred taxes remaining unpaid since initial application for deferral and the interest accruing therein to November 15 of the current year.

      (c) Inform the taxpayer that voluntary payment of the deferred taxes may be made at any time to the Department of Revenue.

      (d) Contain any other information that the department considers necessary to facilitate administration of the homestead deferral program.

(1)(a) At the time that property taxes are deferred under ORS 311.666 to 311.701, or if property taxes were deferred prior to July 1, 1990, the Department of Revenue shall estimate the amount of property taxes deferred for tax years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, interest on the deferred taxes, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and any fees paid by the department in connection with lien filing, recording, release or satisfaction.

      (b) The department shall have a lien in the amount of the estimate.

      (2) If during the period of deferral the amount of taxes and interest on the deferred taxes, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and fees exceeds the estimate under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall have a lien for the amount of the excess.

      (3)(a) A lien created under subsection (1) of this section attaches to the homestead to which the deferral relates on July 1 of the first tax year of deferral or on July 1, 1990, as applicable.

      (b) A lien for the excess created under subsection (2) of this section attaches to the homestead on July 1 of the tax year in which the excess occurs.

      (4) A lien created under subsection (1) or (2) of this section has the same priority as other real property tax liens except that liens of mortgages, trust deeds or security interests that are filed, recorded or noted on a certificate of title or in any record maintained by the Department of Consumer and Business Services pursuant to ORS 446.566 to 446.646 prior in time to the attachment of a lien created under subsection (1) or (2) of this section are prior to the lien created under subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

      (5)(a) The notice of lien for deferred taxes recorded as provided in ORS 311.675 (1) and (2) arising on or after October 3, 1989, shall list the amount of the estimate of deferred taxes and interest on the deferred taxes, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and fees made by the department under subsection (1) of this section. Any amendment to the notice of lien to reflect a lien for excess, as described under subsection (2) of this section, shall list the amount of the excess that the department claims as a lien.

      (b) If notice of lien with respect to any homestead has been filed or recorded as provided under ORS 311.675 (1) to (3) prior to January 1, 1990, and the lien has not been released or satisfied, the department shall cause a further notice of lien to be recorded in the mortgage records of the county. The further notice of lien shall list the amount of the estimate of deferred taxes and interest made by the department under subsection (1) of this section and any amendment to the notice to reflect a lien for excess, described under subsection (2) of this section, and shall list the amount of the excess that the department claims as lien.

      (6)(a) A lien created under this section may be foreclosed by the department as if it were a purchase money mortgage under ORS chapter 88.

      (b) In a foreclosure action under this section, a court may award:

      (A) Reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.

      (B) All costs associated with foreclosure of the lien to the department if the department prevails.

      (8)(a) By means of voluntary payment made as provided under ORS 311.690, the taxpayer may limit the amount of the lien created under this section.

      (b) If the taxpayer desires that the limit be reflected in the records of the county, the taxpayer must request, subject to any rules adopted by the department, that the department cause a partial satisfaction of the lien to be recorded in the county.

      (c) Upon receipt of such a request, the department shall cause a partial satisfaction, in the amount of the voluntary payment, to be recorded.

      (d) Nothing in this subsection affects the priority of the liens of the department, as originally created under subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

      (9)(a) Nothing in this section affects any lien arising under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 for taxes assessed before January 1, 1990.

      311.681 Request for retroactive deferral. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 311.672, if an individual (or two or more individuals jointly) who has elected to defer homestead property taxes in a prior tax year has not filed a timely claim for deferral for one or more tax years succeeding the year in which property taxes were initially deferred under ORS 311.666 to 311.701, then the individual may request that the Director of the Department of Revenue grant a retroactive deferral of property taxes on the property. A spouse who is eligible to make the election under ORS 311.688 may also request a grant of retroactive deferral under this section.

      (2) The director may, in the discretion of the director, grant or deny the retroactive deferral of property taxes. No appeal from a decision of the director under this section may be made.

      (3) The director shall not grant a retroactive deferral of property taxes if, in any intervening year between the year in which deferral was last granted to the property and the last year for which retroactive deferral is being requested, the property would not have been eligible for deferral had the claim for deferral been timely filed.

      (4) If the director grants a retroactive deferral of property taxes under this section, the department shall pay to the county tax collector an amount equal to the deferred taxes for each year, less three percent. Interest shall accrue on the actual amount of taxes advanced to the county.

      (5) The department shall have a lien against the tax-deferred property for amounts deferred under this section as provided in ORS 311.673. The lien shall attach as of July 1 of the tax year for which the payment relates. In the case of a payment representing more than one year’s property taxes, the department shall have a lien in the amount of that portion of a payment related to a particular tax year, which shall attach as of July 1 of that tax year. [1997 c.169 §2; 2011 c.723 §21]

 

      311.682 [1963 c.569 §14; repealed by 1979 c.689 §27]

 

      311.683 Continued deferral after Department of Transportation condemnation; application; requirements; rules. (1) If tax-deferred homestead property is acquired by the Department of Transportation through condemnation, the taxpayer may elect to continue to defer the payment of taxes and interest and the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) by:

      (a) Filing a written notice of intent to continue deferral with the Department of Revenue on or before 30 days after the date the Department of Transportation has acquired title to the condemned homestead; and

      (b) Filing a claim for deferral with respect to a new homestead within one year after the Department of Transportation has acquired title to the condemned homestead.

      (2) Upon receipt of a notice of intent to continue deferral of taxes attributable to a condemned homestead under subsection (1) of this section, the Department of Revenue shall prepare an estimate of the amount of taxes and interest, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and fees that have been and, if approved under subsections (3) and (5) of this section, will continue to be deferred upon the release and satisfaction of the lien on the condemned homestead and the recordation of the lien on the new homestead.

      (3) After preparing the estimate described in subsection (2) of this section, the Department of Revenue shall grant a temporary deferral of taxes with respect to the condemned homestead not to exceed the length of time described in subsection (1)(b) of this section if:

      (a) The Department of Transportation has acquired title to the condemned homestead; and

      (b) The taxpayer has a legally enforceable escrow agreement with a title company that:

      (A) Provides for an interest-bearing escrow account in which moneys are deposited that are sufficient to pay in full the amount of deferred taxes and interest, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and fees on the condemned homestead property as estimated under subsection (2) of this section;

      (B) Establishes the Department of Revenue as the beneficiary of the escrow agreement;

      (C) Provides that the moneys of the escrow account are to be released to the taxpayer upon the Department of Revenue’s approval of continued deferral under subsection (5) of this section and the recordation of the lien described in subsection (6) of this section with the county clerk; and

      (D) Provides that the full amount of the estimated deferred taxes and interest, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and fees related to the condemned homestead are to be released to the Department of Revenue if the continued deferral described in subsection (5) of this section is not granted by the Department of Revenue.

      (4) The Department of Revenue shall provide a release or satisfaction of the lien on the condemned homestead when an escrow account has been established as provided under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) Upon receipt of a claim for the deferral of taxes for a new homestead that also seeks to continue the deferral of taxes attributable to a condemned homestead for which a temporary deferral has been granted under subsection (3) of this section, the Department of Revenue shall approve the continued deferral of the taxes temporarily deferred under subsection (3) of this section if:

      (a) The taxpayer’s equity interest in the new homestead equals or exceeds in value the total of the amount of deferred taxes and interest, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and fees on the condemned homestead as estimated under subsection (2) of this section, plus $10,000;

      (b) The taxpayer is entitled to tax deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 with respect to the new homestead; and

      (c) The taxpayer consents to the continued deferral of taxes and to the lien on the new homestead property as provided in subsection (6) of this section.

      (6) Upon granting the continued deferral under subsection (5) of this section, the Department of Revenue shall have a lien on the new homestead in the amount of the estimate prepared under subsection (2) of this section plus interest and any fees incurred in connection with the recording of the lien. The lien described in this subsection shall be in addition to any other lien under ORS 311.673 that the Department of Revenue shall have with respect to the new homestead. The provisions of ORS 311.679 relating to liens shall apply to the lien described in this subsection. At the time the lien described in this subsection is recorded, the escrow account described in subsection (3) of this section shall be closed and the moneys in the account released to the taxpayer.

      (7) The Department of Revenue may prescribe such rules as are needed to implement the provisions of this section. [1997 c.169 §4; 1999 c.21 §31; 2015 c.309 §7]

 

      311.684 Events requiring payment of deferred tax and interest. All deferred property taxes, including accrued interest, become payable as provided in ORS 311.686 when:

      (1) The taxpayer who claimed deferral of property taxes on the homestead dies or, if there was more than one claimant, the survivor of the taxpayer who originally claimed deferral of property taxes under ORS 311.668 dies.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 311.683, the property with respect to which deferral of taxes is claimed is sold, or a contract to sell is entered into, or some person other than the taxpayer who claimed the deferral, including a transferee, becomes the owner of the property.

      (3) The tax-deferred property is no longer the homestead of the taxpayer who claimed the deferral, except in the case of a taxpayer required to be absent from such tax-deferred property by reason of health.

      (4) The tax-deferred property, a manufactured structure or floating home, is moved out of the state. [1963 c.569 §15; 1971 c.572 §5; 1977 c.160 §9; 1983 c.550 §5; 1997 c.169 §5; 2011 c.723 §8]

      (a) The deferral of taxes for the assessment year in which the circumstance occurs:

      (A) Shall continue for the assessment year if the circumstance occurs on or after September 1.

      (B) Shall be discontinued for the assessment year if the circumstance occurs before September 1.

      (b) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section and ORS 311.688, the amounts of deferred property taxes, including accrued interest, for all years shall be due and payable to the Department of Revenue on or before August 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the circumstance occurs.

      (2) If the circumstance listed in ORS 311.684 (4) occurs, the amount of deferred taxes is due and payable five days before the date of removal of the property from the state.

      (3) If the amounts falling due as provided in this section are not paid on or before the due date, the amounts shall be deemed delinquent as of that date and the property shall be subject to foreclosure as provided in ORS 311.673 or 311.679. [1963 c.569 §16; 1971 c.572 §6; 1977 c.160 §10; 1983 c.550 §8; 1989 c.948 §6; 2011 c.723 §9]

 

      311.687 Loss of eligibility for deferral when disability ceases; prior deferred taxes may continue deferral. (1) Property taxes imposed on the homestead of an individual are ineligible for deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701 if the basis for deferral was the disability of the individual and the individual no longer has a disability and:

      (a) Is younger than 62 years of age; or

      (b) Is 62 years of age or older and filed the claim for deferral jointly with an individual who is younger than 62 years of age and who is not a person with a disability.

      (2) The property taxes that are ineligible for deferral under subsection (1) of this section are those property taxes attributable to the homestead of the individual for tax years beginning subsequent to the loss of disability, until the individual again qualifies for deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701.

      (3) Nothing in this section shall affect the continued deferral of taxes that have been deferred for tax years beginning prior to the loss of disability. [1999 c.1097 §6a; 2007 c.70 §80]

 

      311.688 Claim by spouse to continue tax deferral. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 311.684, when one of the circumstances listed in ORS 311.684 (1) to (3) occurs, the spouse who was not eligible to or did not file a claim jointly with the taxpayer may continue the property in its deferred tax status by filing a claim in the manner prescribed under ORS 311.672 if:

      (a) The spouse of the taxpayer is or will be 60 years of age or older not later than six months from the day the circumstance listed in ORS 311.684 (1) to (3) occurs; and

      (b) The property is the homestead of the spouse of the taxpayer and meets the requirements of ORS 311.670.

      (2)(a) A spouse who does not meet the age requirements of subsection (1)(a) of this section but is otherwise qualified to continue the property in its tax-deferred status under subsection (1) of this section may continue the deferral of property taxes deferred for previous years by filing a claim in the manner prescribed under ORS 311.672.

      (b) If a spouse eligible for and continuing the deferral of taxes previously deferred under this subsection becomes 62 years of age prior to April 15 of any year, the spouse may continue the deferral of previous years’ taxes deferred under this subsection and may elect to defer the current assessment year’s taxes on the homestead by filing a claim in the manner prescribed under ORS 311.672.

      (c) After a claim is filed under paragraph (b) of this subsection, payment of the taxes levied on the homestead and deferred under this subsection and payment of taxes levied on the homestead in the current assessment year and in future years may be deferred under ORS 311.666 to 311.701.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 311.672, if the Department of Revenue determines that good and sufficient cause exists for the failure of a spouse to file a claim under this section on or before April 15, the claim may be filed within 180 days after notice of taxes due and payable under ORS 311.686 is mailed or delivered by the department to the taxpayer or spouse. [1963 c.569 §17; 1977 c.160 §11; 1983 c.550 §9; 2011 c.723 §10; 2015 c.309 §5]

 

      311.689 Certification of continuing eligibility. (1) The Department of Revenue shall certify the eligibility of each homestead granted, and the respective taxpayers claiming, deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701, not less than once every three years.

      (2) The department shall notify the taxpayers in writing of the obligation to certify eligibility under this section and the taxpayers shall respond, by the means prescribed by the department, within 65 days after the department sends the notification.

      (3) If the Department of Revenue has not received a response from the taxpayers within 35 days after sending the notification, the department shall, as soon as practicable, electronically notify an office of the Aging and Disability Resource Connection in the county in which the homestead is located or the seniors and people with disabilities division of the Department of Human Services that the taxpayers have failed to respond to the notice as required under subsection (2) of this section. The Department of Revenue may identify the taxpayers by name, address and phone number if available.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding ORS 311.672 (3)(c), a homestead shall be ineligible for deferral for the next following property tax year if:

      (A) The department receives information showing that the homestead is not eligible for, or the taxpayers are not eligible to claim, the deferral; or

      (B) The Department of Revenue has not received a response to the notice sent under subsection (2) of this section within 30 days after notifying the office of the Aging and Disability Resource Connection or the seniors and people with disabilities division of the Department of Human Services under subsection (3) of this section.

      (b) This subsection does not preclude the grant of deferral to an eligible homestead in any subsequent property tax year for which an eligible claimant files a timely application under ORS 311.672. [1989 c.948 §12; 1995 c.803 §4; 1997 c.839 §47; 1999 c.90 §36; 1999 c.1097 §7; 2001 c.660 §31; 2003 c.77 §9; 2005 c.832 §21; 2007 c.614 §9; 2008 c.45 §10; 2009 c.5 §20; 2009 c.909 §20; 2010 c.82 §20; 2011 c.723 §11; 2012 c.13 §4; 2013 c.31 §4; 2015 c.309 §3]

 

      311.690 Voluntary payment of deferred tax and interest. (1) All payments of deferred taxes shall be made to the Department of Revenue.

      (2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, all or part of the deferred taxes and accrued interest may at any time be paid to the department by:

      (a) The taxpayer or the spouse of the taxpayer.

      (b) The next of kin of the taxpayer, heir at law of the taxpayer, child of the taxpayer or any person having or claiming a legal or equitable interest in the property.

      (3) A person listed in subsection (2)(b) of this section may make payments of deferred taxes under this section only if no objection is made by the taxpayer within 30 days after the department deposits in the mail notice to the taxpayer of the fact that payment of deferred taxes has been tendered.

      (4) Any payment made under this section shall be applied first against accrued interest and any remainder against the deferred taxes. Payment of deferred taxes does not affect the deferred tax status of the property. Unless otherwise provided by law, payment of deferred taxes does not give the person paying the taxes any interest in the property or any claim against the estate, in the absence of a valid agreement to the contrary.

      (5) When the deferred taxes and accrued interest are paid in full and the property is no longer subject to deferral, the department shall prepare, file and record documents necessary to effect a release or satisfaction of deferred property tax lien. [1963 c.569 §18; 1977 c.160 §12; 2007 c.363 §4]

 

      311.691 Taxes unpaid before deferral as lien; effect on foreclosure; exceptions. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 312 to the contrary and ORS 311.696 (1), upon compliance with ORS 311.693, taxes assessed against a tax-deferred homestead for any tax year that were unpaid as of July 1 of the tax year for which homestead property tax deferral was granted under ORS 311.666 to 311.701, and that remain unpaid, shall remain a lien and shall become delinquent as otherwise provided by law, but are not subject to foreclosure under ORS chapter 312 before August 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which one of the circumstances listed in ORS 311.684 occurs.

      (2) This section does not apply if:

      (a) The tax-deferred homestead property is a manufactured structure or floating home and is moved out of state;

      (b) The tax-deferred homestead property is personal property, other than a manufactured structure or floating home; or

      (c) The owner of the tax-deferred homestead property has household income, for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which application is filed under ORS 311.693, that exceeds the amounts allowable under ORS 311.668.

      (3) If the property to which subsection (1) of this section applies has been included on a foreclosure list, or a judgment of foreclosure entered, the property shall be removed from the foreclosure list, or judgment vacated, unless the proceeding against the property involves delinquent taxes other than those described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4)(a) Upon removal from the foreclosure list, or upon vacation of the judgment, a penalty may not be imposed under ORS 312.110 or 312.120.

      (b) If the penalty has been imposed, the penalty is abated, or if the penalty has been paid, upon application made to the county assessor on or before July 1 of the year immediately following the year of vacation or removal, the penalty shall be refunded out of the unsegregated tax collections account in the manner provided in ORS 311.806.

      (5) Within 60 days after approval of an application under ORS 311.693, with respect to any property to which this section applies, the tax collector shall make the proper entries on the tax roll and shall remove the property from the foreclosure list and proceeding.

      (6) If a judgment has been entered foreclosing liens for delinquent taxes against any property which is the subject of an application filed under ORS 311.693, and the delinquent taxes include only those taxes described in subsection (1) of this section, or taxes in excess of those described in subsection (1) of this section are paid, the judgment shall be null and void and of no effect and the tax collector shall make the proper entries on the assessment and tax rolls to reflect the vacation of the judgment and to acknowledge the subsisting liens.

      (7) Nothing in this section shall remove or release property to which this section applies from the lien of any unpaid tax thereon, but the unpaid taxes shall remain valid and subsisting liens as though the foreclosure proceeding had not been instituted or as though the foreclosure proceeding had not been instituted and a judgment entered.

      (8) Nothing in this section shall affect a foreclosure proceeding instituted, or a judgment entered, to foreclose liens for delinquent taxes against properties subject to foreclosure if the delinquent taxes include taxes other than those described under subsection (1) of this section. Such foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted or continued without regard to this section and such judgment shall be of full force and effect as if this section did not exist.

      (9) Interest on taxes to which this section applies shall be determined from the same dates, in the same manner and until paid as for other property taxes remaining unpaid upon the due dates, upon preparation of the foreclosure list in accordance with ORS chapter 312 and subsection (1) of this section and upon entry and following a judgment of foreclosure.

(1)(a) Delay in foreclosure on account of delinquent taxes as provided in ORS 311.691 may not be granted unless the owner of the tax-deferred homestead files an application for the delay with the county assessor prior to the date the period of redemption expires under ORS 312.120.

      (b) An application filed under this subsection must contain or be accompanied by a verified statement of total household income of the owner for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the application is filed.

      (2)(a) Upon receipt of an application under subsection (1) of this section, the county assessor shall approve or deny the application.

      311.694 Taxes uncollected after foreclosure; reimbursement of state by taxing units. (1) At the time that the property is deeded over to the county at the conclusion of the foreclosure proceedings pursuant to ORS 312.200 the county court shall order the county treasurer to pay to the Department of Revenue from the unsegregated tax collections account the amount of deferred taxes and interest which were not collected.

      (2) Immediately upon payment, the county treasurer shall notify the tax collector of the amount paid to the department for the property which has been deeded to the county pursuant to ORS 312.200. [1963 c.569 §20; 1977 c.160 §13; 1985 c.162 §9]

 

      311.695 Joint and several liability of transferees for deferral amounts. (1) A transferee of a homestead who is ineligible to claim, or does not claim, deferral under ORS 311.666 to 311.701, or that is not an individual, is jointly and severally liable for amounts payable under ORS 311.686 to the extent of the positive amount, if any, remaining after subtracting the amount of all liens prior to the Department of Revenue’s liens for deferred taxes arising under ORS 311.673 or 311.679 from the real market value of the homestead entered on the last certified assessment and tax roll prior to the date of the transfer if the transferee:

      (a) Is occupying, leasing out or otherwise using the tax-deferred property more than 90 days following the taxpayer’s date of death and is a potential recipient of the property under intestate succession or by devise;

      (b) Received the tax-deferred property from the estate of a deceased taxpayer; or

      (c) Received a right to the tax-deferred property by gift or assignment from an insolvent taxpayer.

      (2) The department shall issue by mail a notice of liability to a transferee after deferred amounts for which the transferee is liable under this section become payable under ORS 311.686.

      (4)(a) After a conference, or, if no conference is requested, a determination of the issues raised by the written objections, the department shall mail to the transferee a conference letter affirming, canceling or adjusting the notice of liability.

      (b) Within 90 days after the date on which the conference letter is mailed to the transferee, the transferee shall pay the deferred amounts, plus interest, the cost of insurance purchased pursuant to ORS 311.670 (4)(b) and fees, or appeal to the tax court in the manner provided for an appeal from a notice of assessment.

(1) If the taxpayer who claimed the deferral of special assessment for local improvement dies, or if a spouse who continued the deferral under ORS 311.702 to 311.735 dies, the Department of Revenue may extend the time for payment of the special assessment for local improvement and interest accruing with respect to the special assessment for local improvement becoming due and payable under ORS 311.718 if:

      (a) The homestead property becomes property of an individual or individuals:

      (A) By inheritance or devise; or

      (B) If the individual or individuals are heirs or devisees, as defined under ORS 111.005, in the course of settlement of the estate;

      (b) The individual or individuals commence occupancy of the property as a principal residence on or before August 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year of death; and

      (2)(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, an extension granted under this section shall be for a period not to exceed five years after August 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year of death. The terms and conditions under which the extension is granted shall be in accordance with a written agreement entered into by the department and the individual or individuals.

      (b) An extension granted under this section shall terminate immediately if:

      (A) The homestead property is sold or otherwise transferred by any party to the extension agreement;

      (B) All of the heirs or devisees who are parties to the extension agreement cease to occupy the property as a principal residence; or

      (C) The homestead property, a manufactured structure or floating home, is moved out of the state.

      (3) If the department has reason to believe that the homestead property is not sufficient security for the deferred special assessment for local improvement and interest the department may require the individual or individuals to furnish a bond conditioned upon payment of the amount extended in accordance with the terms of the extension. The bond shall not exceed in amount double the special assessment for local improvement with respect to which extension is granted.

      (4) During the period of extension, and until paid the deferred special assessment for local improvement shall continue to accrue interest in the same manner and at the same rate as provided under ORS 311.674 (3). No interest shall accrue upon interest. [1985 c.167 §10]

      (3) Any payments made under this section shall be applied first against accrued interest and any remainder against the deferred special assessment for local improvement. A payment made pursuant to this section does not affect the deferred status of the homestead. Unless otherwise provided by law, the payment does not give the person paying the deferred special assessment any interest in the property or any claim against the estate, in the absence of a valid agreement to the contrary. [1977 c.859 §9; 1985 c.167 §13]

 

      311.725 Disposition of collected special assessments; reimbursement of state.

      (2) The tax roll shows payment of the taxes, and thereafter the property is sold to a bona fide purchaser. [1975 c.395 §2; 1989 c.297 §2; 1993 c.270 §71; 2003 c.38 §2; 2015 c.31 §5]

[1987 c.301 §2]

 

      311.814 Appeal of large amounts of value; reserve account for refunds.

After notification, the county treasurer shall set aside, if so ordered by the county governing body, from taxes collected in the current tax year, an interest bearing reserve account as provided in this section.

      (2) The reserve shall consist of an amount representing that portion of taxes paid by the petitioner attributable to the amount of value in dispute for each tax year that the appeal remains unresolved. Upon termination of the controversy, the principal amount in the account necessary to pay any refund, and any interest provided for under ORS 311.812, shall be paid to the petitioner. Any excess remaining in the reserve after termination of the controversy and payment of a refund, if any, shall be deposited in the unsegregated tax collections account in full satisfaction of the tax due on the property.

      (3) If the final resolution of the controversy results in additional taxes due on the property, the amount in the reserve account shall be deposited into the unsegregated tax collections account and shall be distributed according to the distribution percentage schedule for the current tax year prepared in accordance with ORS 311.390. The additional taxes shall be collected as provided in ORS 311.513. [1991 c.459 §265; 1993 c.270 §63; 1995 c.256 §8; 1995 c.650 §72; 1997 c.541 §§299,300; 2003 c.274 §4; 2007 c.126 §1]

 

      311.815 Abandonment of purpose for which special tax levied; refund or cancellation of tax. If a special tax to raise funds for a specified purpose is levied in a school district, road district, irrigation district or drainage district and the project or specific purpose for which the tax is levied is thereafter definitely abandoned, either wholly or in part, or the fund raised by the tax or any portion thereof remains unexpended for a period of two years, after the levy of the tax, the county court at the written request of the directors of the district may, by resolution, provide for the refunding of the tax or portion of tax so remaining unexpended to the taxpayers who paid the tax and for the cancellation of the unpaid tax or proportion of the tax that has become delinquent. The county court shall take such action by resolution spread upon its journal. Repayment shall be made by orders drawn on the county treasurer and issued to the taxpayers shown by the tax records to have originally made the payments. Cancellation of unpaid taxes shall be effected by noting the cancellation of the taxes on the tax records of the county. [Amended by 2011 c.204 §10]

      311.821 Refunds authorized in event of certain boundary changes of taxing districts; reimbursements. (1) Whenever in any year the boundaries of a taxing district have been reduced by proceedings occurring after the date provided in ORS 308.225, and whenever such changes in boundaries were not disregarded by the county assessor as required by ORS 308.225, and as a result thereof taxes have been levied and collected upon the reduced territory of such district, which taxes were not levied and extended upon the territory detached from such district, the county governing body shall refund out of the unsegregated tax collections account to the taxpayers of the territory upon which the levy was imposed and the taxes collected, the proportionate amount of money in excess of the amount that would have been collected from the territory comprising the entire district had the levy been uniform throughout the district. A written claim for refund of such collection shall be filed with the county governing body within six years from the assessment date for the fiscal year for which the taxes were collected.

      (2) Whenever in any year the boundaries of a taxing district have been reduced by boundary changes pursuant to law after the date provided in ORS 308.225, and such changes in boundaries have been disregarded by the county assessor as required by ORS 308.225, and as a result thereof taxes were levied upon property within such withdrawn area by such district and also for the same tax year by another taxing district providing the same service or services, subjecting such property to double taxation for any tax year, the county governing body shall refund out of the unsegregated tax collections account to the taxpayers of the territory upon which the levy was imposed and the tax was collected the proportionate amount of money in excess of the amount that would have been paid by such taxpayers had the withdrawal been recognized by the assessor as effective for the tax year involved; provided, all such property shall remain liable for indebtedness incurred prior to the boundary change as otherwise required by law. A written claim for refund of such tax collection shall be filed with the county governing body within two years from the assessment date for the fiscal year for which the taxes were collected.

      (3) If the claim is in proper form, the county governing body shall take action by resolution spread upon its journal, and repayments shall be made by orders drawn on the county treasurer for the several amounts and issued to the several taxpayers shown by the tax records to have made the payments originally.

      (4) Immediately upon such reimbursement the tax collector shall make the necessary correcting entries in the records of the office of the tax collector. [1965 c.344 §40 (enacted in lieu of 311.820 and 311.825); 1979 c.702 §3; 1985 c.162 §11]

PREPAYMENT OF TAXES FOR FACILITIES

 

      311.850 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that the construction of a facility may have substantial economic impact upon units of local government obligated to furnish services, buildings or other resources in the area in which the facility is being constructed. The Legislative Assembly further finds that this impact may occur in advance of the time when sufficient real market value occasioned by construction of the facility is added to the assessment and tax roll to bear the facility’s portion of the costs of the governmental services, buildings or other resources that the facility’s construction necessitates. The purposes of ORS 311.850 to 311.870 is to provide a method for prepaying ad valorem property taxes during the period of planning and construction of the facility, in order that units of local government may provide the services, buildings or other resources necessitated without imposing an undue burden upon other properties subject to taxation within the unit, and to provide for repayment of the amounts prepaid. [1975 c.563 §1; 1991 c.459 §261; 2005 c.94 §66]

 

      311.855 Definitions for ORS 311.850 to 311.870. As used in ORS 311.850 to 311.870, unless the context requires otherwise, “facility” means:

      (1) A thermal power plant, as defined in ORS 469.300.

      (2) A hydroelectric power project, as described in ORS 543.010.

      (3) Any building or improvement that is suitable for use for industrial, commercial, manufacturing or warehousing purposes. [1975 c.563 §2]

 

      311.860 Agreement for prepayment; contents; filing; certificate of payment. (1) Any person proposing to construct a facility who has applied for and obtained the necessary preliminary construction permits or certificates and the governing body of any taxing unit obligated to furnish services, buildings or other resources in the area in which the construction is to take place may enter into an agreement to carry out the purposes of ORS 311.850. An agreement entered into under this section shall contain provisions pertaining to and in accordance with the following:

      (a) The payment of moneys to the taxing unit by the person proposing to construct the facility. The person shall make the payment prior to or during the period of the construction.

      (b) The amounts of the payments to be made by the person proposing to construct the facility and the dates for making the payments.

      (c) A reduction in real market value for the facility for purposes of computing the rate of levy of the taxing unit entering into the agreement for each year of a period of years, not to exceed 10, commencing on or in the course of completion of the construction of the facility. The amount of reduction allowed by the agreement shall be a percentage amount, not to exceed 50 percent, of the real market value of the facility as of any assessment date affected by the reduction, and may be fixed or graduated over the period of years for which the reduction is allowed. The total reduction allowed by the agreement shall result in a tax benefit for the facility that is estimated to be equivalent to the total amount of payments made under the agreement to the taxing unit, plus interest at the maximum rate of eight percent per annum from the date of each payment. In no event, however, shall the total reduction in real market value during the period of years of reduction cause a total reduction in taxes that exceeds the total amount of moneys previously paid plus interest.

      (2) A copy of an agreement entered into under this section shall be filed with the county assessor of each county in which a taxing unit that is a party to the agreement is located.

      (3) Prior to April 1 preceding the first tax year for which the exemption granted by ORS 311.865 applies, the governing body of the taxing unit that is a party to the agreement may certify to the county assessor that all payments have been made to the taxing unit in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The county assessor may not grant the exemption for any year unless the county assessor has received such certificate. Review of denial of an exemption under this section shall be as provided by ORS 305.275. [1975 c.563 §3; 1979 c.772 §18; 1991 c.459 §262; 2005 c.94 §67]

 

      311.865 Exemption; amount; termination. There shall be exempt from the levy of the taxing unit that is the party to an agreement entered into under ORS 311.860 for each tax year indicated in the agreement, the percentage amount of real market value, allocable to or within the taxing unit, of the facility specified in the agreement for that tax year. The assessor shall modify the amount of the exemption or terminate the exemption at such time as the assessor determines that the monetary value of the exemption has equaled the amount of moneys paid by the facility under the agreement plus interest. [1975 c.563 §4; 1991 c.459 §263]

 

      311.870 Characterization of prepaid taxes. Moneys received by a taxing unit pursuant to an agreement entered into under ORS 311.850 to 311.870 shall be considered a budget resource and shall not be offset against the levy of the taxing unit. [1975 c.563 §5]
