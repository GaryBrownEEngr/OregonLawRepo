      (2) As used in this chapter:

      (a) Any term has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes, unless a different meaning is clearly required or the term is specifically defined in this chapter.

      (b) Except where the Legislative Assembly has provided otherwise, a reference to the laws of the United States or to the Internal Revenue Code refers to the laws of the United States or to the Internal Revenue Code as they are amended and in effect:

      (A) On December 31, 2016; or

      (B) If related to the definition of taxable income, as applicable to the tax year of the taxpayer.

Nothing contained in this section limits the right or duty of the department to audit the return of any taxpayer or to determine any fact relating to the tax liability of any taxpayer.

      (4) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section refer to rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, then such rules or regulations shall be regarded as rules adopted by the department under and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, whenever they are prescribed or amended.

      (5)(a) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section are later corrected by an Act or a Title within an Act of the United States Congress designated as an Act or Title making technical corrections, then notwithstanding the date that the Act or Title becomes law, those portions of the Internal Revenue Code, as so corrected, shall be the portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section and shall take effect, unless otherwise indicated by the Act or Title (in which case the provisions shall take effect as indicated in the Act or Title), as if originally included in the provisions of the Act being technically corrected.

      (a) In case the amount of the adjustment would be credited or refunded in the same manner as an overpayment under ORS 314.135, there is adopted in the determination a position maintained by the Department of Revenue; or

      (b) In case the amount of the adjustment would be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency under ORS 314.135, there is adopted in the determination a position maintained by the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made, and the position maintained by the department in the case described in paragraph (a) of this subsection or maintained by the taxpayer in the case described in this paragraph is inconsistent with the erroneous inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be.

      (3) In the case of a determination described in ORS 314.125 (3)(b) (relating to certain exclusions from income), adjustment shall be made under this section only if assessment of a deficiency for the taxable year in which the item is includable or against the related taxpayer was not barred, by any law or rule of law, at the time the department first maintained, in a notice of deficiency sent pursuant to ORS 305.265 or before the Oregon Tax Court, that the item described in ORS 314.125 (3)(b) should be included in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year to which the determination relates.

      (4) In the case of a determination described in ORS 314.125 (4) (relating to disallowance of certain deductions and credits), adjustment shall be made under ORS 314.105 to 314.135 only if credit or refund of the overpayment attributable to the deduction or credit described in ORS 314.125 that should have been allowed to the taxpayer or related taxpayer was not barred, by any law or rule of law, at the time the taxpayer first maintained before the department or before the Oregon Tax Court, in writing, that the taxpayer was entitled to such deduction or credit for the taxable year to which the determination relates.

      (5) In case the amount of the adjustment would be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency (except for cases described in ORS 314.125 (3)(b)), the adjustment shall not be made with respect to a related taxpayer unless the related taxpayer stands in such relationship to the taxpayer at the time the latter first maintains the inconsistent position in a return, claim for refund, or complaint in the Oregon Tax Court for the taxable year with respect to which the determination is made, or if such position is not so maintained, then at the time of determination. [1971 c.248 §3; 1979 c.689 §24; 1997 c.325 §33; 2005 c.94 §76]

 

      314.120 [1953 c.702 §2; repealed by 1971 c.248 §6]

 

      314.125 When adjustment may be made. The circumstances under which the adjustment provided in ORS 314.115 is authorized are as follows:

      (1) The determination requires the inclusion in gross income of an item that was erroneously included in the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year or in the gross income of a related taxpayer.

      (2) The determination allows a deduction or credit that was erroneously allowed to the taxpayer for another taxable year or to a related taxpayer.

      (3)(a) The determination requires the exclusion from gross income of an item included in a return filed by the taxpayer or with respect to which tax was paid and that was erroneously excluded or omitted from the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year, or from the gross income of a related taxpayer; or

      (b) The determination requires the exclusion from gross income of an item not included in a return filed by the taxpayer and with respect to which the tax was not paid but that is includable in the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year or in the gross income of a related taxpayer.

      (4) The determination disallows a deduction or credit that should have been allowed to, but was not allowed to, the taxpayer for another taxable year, or to a related taxpayer.

      (5) The determination allows or disallows any of the additional deductions allowable in computing the taxable income of estates or trusts, or requires or denies any of the inclusions in the computation of taxable income of beneficiaries, heirs or legatees, specified in sections 641 to 679 of the Internal Revenue Code, or corresponding provisions of subsequent internal revenue laws, and the correlative inclusion or deduction, as the case may be, has been erroneously excluded, omitted or included, or disallowed, omitted or allowed, as the case may be in respect of the related taxpayer.

      (6) The determination allows or disallows a deduction (including a credit) in computing the taxable income (or, as the case may be, net income, normal tax net income or surtax net income) of a corporation, and a correlative deduction or credit has been erroneously allowed, omitted or disallowed, as the case may be, in respect of a related taxpayer described in ORS 314.105 (2)(g).

      (7)(a) The determination determines the basis of property, and in respect of any transaction on which such basis depends, or in respect of any transaction that was erroneously treated as affecting such basis, there occurred, with respect to a taxpayer described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, any of the errors described in paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (b) The taxpayer with respect to whom the erroneous treatment occurred must be:

      (A) The taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made;

      (B) A taxpayer who acquired title to the property in the transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title; or

      (C) A taxpayer who had title to the property at the time of the transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title, if the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made is determined under section 1015(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (c) With respect to a taxpayer described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, there was an erroneous inclusion in, or omission from, gross income, there was an erroneous recognition, or nonrecognition, of gain or loss, or there was an erroneous deduction of an item properly chargeable to capital account or an erroneous charge to capital account of an item properly deductible. [1971 c.248 §4; 1983 c.162 §50; 1987 c.293 §52; 2005 c.94 §77]

 

      314.130 [1953 c.702 §3; repealed by 1971 c.248 §6]

 

      314.135 Computation; method of adjustment; credit or setoff limited; recovery after payment limited. (1)(a) In computing the amount of an adjustment under ORS 314.105 to 314.135 there shall first be ascertained the tax previously determined for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount of the tax previously determined shall be the excess of:

      (A) The sum of the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer on the return of the taxpayer, if a return was made by the taxpayer and an amount was shown as the tax by the taxpayer thereon, plus the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency, over

      (B) The amount of refunds (as defined in ORS 314.415) made.

      (b) There shall then be ascertained the increase or decrease in tax previously determined which results solely from the correct treatment of the item in the computation of gross income, taxable income, and other matters under ORS 316.317 or ORS chapter 317 or 318. A similar computation shall be made for any other taxable year affected, or treated as affected, by an Oregon net loss for prior years (as provided by ORS 317.476 or 317.478 and section 45b, chapter 293, Oregon Laws 1987), by a net operating loss deduction (as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code) or by a capital loss carryback or carryover (as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code) determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount so ascertained (together with any amounts wrongfully collected as additions to the tax or interest, as a result of such error) for each taxable year shall be the amount of the adjustment for that taxable year.

      (2) The adjustment authorized in ORS 314.115 (1) shall be made by assessing and collecting, or refunding or crediting, the amount thereof in the same manner as if it were a deficiency determined by the Department of Revenue with respect to the taxpayer as to whom the error was made or an overpayment claimed by such taxpayer, as the case may be, for the taxable year or years with respect to which an amount is ascertained under subsection (1) of this section and as if on the date of the determination one year remained before the expiration of the periods of limitation upon assessment or filing claim for refund for such taxable year or years. If, as a result of a determination described in ORS 314.105 (1)(d), an adjustment has been made by the assessment and collection of a deficiency of the refund or credit of an overpayment, and subsequently such determination is altered or revoked, the amount of the adjustment ascertained under subsection (1) of this section shall be redetermined on the basis of such alteration or revocation and any overpayment or deficiency resulting from such redetermination shall be refunded or credited, or assessed and collected, as the case may be, as an adjustment under this part. In the case of an adjustment resulting from an increase or decrease in a net operating loss or net capital loss which is carried back to the year of adjustment, interest shall not be collected or paid for any period prior to the close of the taxable year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises.

      (3) The amount to be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency, or to be refunded or credited in the same manner as an overpayment, under ORS 314.105 to 314.135, shall not be diminished by any credit or setoff based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment. The amount of the adjustment under ORS 314.105 to 314.135, if paid, shall not be recovered by a claim or suit for refund or suit for erroneous refund based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment. [1971 c.248 §5; 1983 c.162 §51; 1987 c.293 §52a]

 

      314.140 Adjustment of returns of related taxpayers after reallocation of income or deduction on federal return. (1) Whenever there has been an adjustment of federal income tax liability involving a reallocation of any item of income or deduction between related taxpayers, and when such adjustment results in the assessment of a tax deficiency or the issuance of a refund check or both, then for Oregon income tax purposes, whether or not the Department of Revenue effects a similar reallocation of income or deduction for the same tax year, said federal tax deficiency and additions thereto shall be deducted (to the extent otherwise provided by law) by the taxpayer paying the same, and said federal tax refund, including interest thereon, shall be returned (to the extent otherwise required by law) by the taxpayer receiving the same.

      (2) If, however, the related taxpayers involved (or their authorized representatives) so elect in accordance with subsection (3), then the refund of one, with interest thereon, shall be treated as a reduction of the deficiency of the other, including additions thereto, so that only the net amount of deficiency shall be deducted or the net amount of refund shall be returned, as the case may be.

      (3) An election under subsection (2) shall be in writing, signed by each related taxpayer or authorized representative, and filed with the department prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitation with respect to the adjustment of the last open state return of either related taxpayer affected by the federal tax deficiency or refund. Such election shall constitute a waiver of any statute of limitations to permit the adjustment of all returns of the related taxpayers for the purpose only of effecting a reallocation of income or deductions similar to that made by the federal tax authorities and to adjust the federal income tax deductions resulting therefrom.

(1) Upon receipt of notice of the revocation of a certification of a pollution control facility pursuant to ORS 468.185 (1), the Department of Revenue immediately shall collect any taxes due by reason of such revocation, and shall have the benefit of all laws of this state pertaining to the collection of income and excise taxes. No assessment of such taxes shall be necessary and no statute of limitation shall preclude the collection of such taxes.

      (2) No tax relief shall be allowed under ORS 307.405 or 315.304 for any pollution control facility constructed or used by or for the benefit of any governmental or quasi-governmental body or public corporation or form thereof, except where such facilities are used for resource recovery.

      314.256 Lobbying expenditures; proxy tax; rules. (1) If a tax is imposed upon an organization under section 6033(e) of the Internal Revenue Code (proxy tax on lobbying expenditures) for any tax year, a like tax is imposed for the tax year upon the same amount as taxed for federal tax purposes, as allocated or apportioned to Oregon. The rate of the tax shall be the rate specified in ORS 317.061. The tax shall be assessed and collected under the applicable provisions of this chapter and ORS chapter 305.

      (2) Any organization that is required to include on a federal return the information described in section 6033(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code shall file a copy of the federal return containing the information with the Department of Revenue.

      (3) The department may determine by rule the method by which the tax described in subsection (1) of this section is allocated and apportioned to Oregon.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section dealing with the apportionment of income earned from sources both within and without the State of Oregon are designed to allocate to the State of Oregon on a fair and equitable basis a proportion of such income earned from sources both within and without the state. Any taxpayer may submit an alternative basis of apportionment with respect to the income of the taxpayer and explain that basis in full in the return of the taxpayer. If approved by the department that method will be accepted as the basis of allocation.

The report may be treated by the department as a claim for refund pursuant to ORS 314.415 if the department determines that the taxpayer’s correct Oregon tax liability is a reduction from the taxpayer’s Oregon tax liability prior to the filing of the report. Notwithstanding the limitations of ORS 314.415, a claim for refund under this paragraph shall be deemed timely if received by the department within two years after the federal or other state correction was made.

[1957 c.632 §11 (enacted in lieu of 316.565 and 317.380); 1963 c.509 §1; 1985 c.602 §3; 1989 c.414 §7; 1997 c.100 §2; 1999 c.74 §1; 2001 c.9 §4]

 

      314.385 Form of returns; time for filing; alternative filing formats; rules. (1)(a) For purposes of ORS chapter 316, returns shall be filed with the Department of Revenue on or before the due date of the corresponding federal return for the tax year as prescribed under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

      (b) For purposes of ORS chapters 317 and 318, returns shall be filed with the department on or before the 15th day of the month following the due date of the corresponding federal return for the tax year, as prescribed under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

      (c) The department may allow further time for filing returns equal in length to the extension periods allowed under the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations.

      (d) If no return is required to be filed for federal income tax purposes, the due date or extension period for a return shall be the same as the due date, or extension period, would have been if the taxpayer had been required to file a return for federal income tax purposes for the tax year. However, the due date for returns filed for purposes of ORS chapter 317 or 318 shall be on or before the 15th day of the month following what would have been the federal return due date for the tax year.

      (2) There shall be annexed to the return a statement verified as provided under ORS 305.810 by a declaration of the taxpayer making the return to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.

      (3) Returns shall be in the form the department may, from time to time, prescribe. The department shall prepare blank forms for the returns and distribute them throughout the state. The forms shall be furnished the taxpayer upon request, but failure to receive or secure a form does not relieve the taxpayer from the obligation of making any return required by law.

      (4)(a) The department may by rule authorize the filing of a return in alternative formats to those described in subsection (3) of this section and may prescribe the conditions, requirements and technical standards for a filing under this subsection.

      (b) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3) of this section, the department may by rule prescribe a different due date for a return filed in an alternative format.

      (c) The policy of the Legislative Assembly in granting the department rulemaking authority under paragraph (b) of this subsection is to have the department prescribe due dates that mirror the due dates that apply to federal returns filed in alternative formats for federal tax purposes. [1957 c.632 §12 (enacted in lieu of 316.545 and 317.355); 1959 c.156 §1; last sentence of subsection (1) derived from 1959 c.156 §3; 1963 c.281 §1; 1987 c.293 §59a; 1989 c.625 §55; 1991 c.457 §17a; 1997 c.84 §1; 1997 c.839 §56; 2003 c.77 §10a; 2016 c.33 §17a]

 

      314.395 Time for payment of tax; interest on delayed return. (1) The tax shall be paid to the Department of Revenue at the time fixed by ORS 314.385 for filing the return without regard to extensions.

      (2) When the time for filing a return of income is extended at the request of the taxpayer, interest at the rate established under ORS 305.220, from the time the return was originally required to be filed to the time of payment, shall be added and paid. [1969 c.166 §2; 1971 c.354 §3; 1973 c.402 §17; 1975 c.593 §13; 1980 c.20 §24; 1982 s.s.1 c.16 §6; 1987 c.293 §59b; 2017 c.278 §7]

 

      314.397 Manner of payment. The tax may be paid with uncertified check under any rules as the Department of Revenue shall adopt, but if a check so received is not paid by the financial institution on which it is drawn, the taxpayer by whom the check is tendered remains liable for the payment of the tax and for all legal penalties the same as if the check had not been tendered. [1989 c.625 §61 (enacted in lieu of 316.407); 1997 c.631 §451]

 

      314.400 Penalty for failure to file report or return or to pay tax when due; interest; limitation on penalty. (1) If a taxpayer fails to file a report or return or fails to pay a tax by the date on which the filing or payment is due, the Department of Revenue shall add to the amount required to be shown as tax on the report or return a delinquency penalty of five percent of the amount of the unpaid tax.

      (2) In the case of a report or return that is required to be filed annually or for a one-year period, if the failure to file the report or return continues for a period in excess of three months after the due date:

      (a) There shall be added to the amount of tax required to be shown on the report or return a failure to file penalty of 20 percent of the amount of the tax; and

      (b) Thereafter the department may send a notice and demand to the person to file a report or return within 30 days of the mailing of the notice. If after the notice and demand no report or return is filed within the 30 days, the department may determine the tax according to the best of its information and belief, assess the tax with appropriate penalty and interest plus an additional penalty of 25 percent of the tax deficiency determined by the department and give written notice of the determination and assessment to the person required to make the filing.

      (3) In the case of a report or return that is required to be filed more frequently than annually and the failure to file the report or return continues for a period in excess of one month after the due date:

      (a) There shall be added to the amount of tax required to be shown on the report or return a failure to file penalty of 20 percent of the amount of the tax; and

      (b) Thereafter the department may send a notice and demand to the person to file a report or return within 30 days of the mailing of the notice. If after the notice and demand no report or return is filed within the 30 days, the department may determine the tax according to the best of its information and belief, assess the tax with appropriate penalty and interest plus an additional penalty of 25 percent of the tax deficiency determined by the department and give written notice of the determination and assessment to the person required to make the filing.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if a taxpayer is required to file a federal income tax return for a period of less than 12 months under section 443 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Oregon personal income or corporate excise or income tax return required to be filed for that period shall be subject to subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) If a report or return that is subject to a failure to file penalty described in subsection (2) or (3) of this section is filed before a notice of determination and assessment is issued by the department, the failure to file penalty referred to in subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a) of this section shall be added to the amount of tax shown on the report or return.

      (6) A penalty equal to 100 percent of any deficiency determined by the department shall be assessed and collected if:

      (a) There is a failure to file a report or return with intent to evade the tax; or

      (b) A report or return was falsely prepared and filed with intent to evade the tax.

      (7) Interest shall be collected on the unpaid tax at the rate established under ORS 305.220 for the period the tax remains unpaid.

      (8) Each penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other penalty imposed under this section. However, the total amount of penalty imposed under this section and ORS 305.265 (13) with respect to any deficiency shall not exceed 100 percent of the deficiency.

      (9) For purposes of subsections (1) to (3) of this section, the amount of tax required to be shown or that is shown on the report or return shall be reduced by the amount that is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax that is claimed on the report or return. If the amount required to be shown as tax on the report or return is less than the amount that is actually shown as tax on the report or return, this subsection shall be applied by substituting the lower amount.

      (10) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the five percent penalty for failure to file a report or return or pay a tax at the time the tax becomes due may not be imposed if:

      (a) The taxpayer pays the full amount of the tax plus accrued interest within 30 days of the date shown on the department’s notice sent to the taxpayer; and

      (b)(A) The taxpayer had filed an amended individual tax return or an amended corporate return of income or excise tax accompanied by less than full payment of the tax shown on the return plus accrued interest; or

      (B) The department issues a notice of tax deficiency to the taxpayer under ORS 305.265. [1971 c.354 §2; 1975 c.593 §14; 1977 c.870 §41; 1980 c.7 §25; 1981 c.724 §4; 1982 s.s.1 c.16 §7; 1985 c.602 §4; 1987 c.158 §48a; 1993 c.726 §13; 1995 c.780 §5; 1997 c.170 §26; 2005 c.335 §1; 2007 c.322 §1; 2015 c.348 §21; 2017 c.278 §8]

 

      314.401 De minimis tax payment not required. Notwithstanding ORS 314.395 and 314.400, if the balance of tax due as shown on the report or return filed by the taxpayer for the tax year is less than $1, payment of the amount shown shall not be required. [1999 c.73 §2]

 

      314.402 Understatement of net tax; penalty; cost-of-living adjustment; waiver of penalty. (1) If the Department of Revenue determines that there is a substantial understatement of net tax for any tax year under any law imposing a tax on or measured by net income, there shall be added to the amount of tax required to be shown on the return a penalty equal to 20 percent of the amount of any underpayment of tax attributable to the understatement.

      (2) A substantial understatement of net tax exists for any tax year if the amount of the understatement for the tax year exceeds:

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, $2,400.

      (b) In the case of a corporation other than an S corporation, as defined in section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code, or a personal holding company, as defined in section 542 of the Internal Revenue Code, $3,500.

      (c)(A) For a calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2017, the Department of Revenue shall make a cost-of-living adjustment to the net tax threshold amounts described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.

      (B) The cost-of-living adjustment for a calendar year is the percentage by which the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year exceeds the monthly averaged index for the period beginning September 1, 2015, and ending August 31, 2016.

      (C) As used in this paragraph, “U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index” means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.

      (D) If any adjustment determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is not a multiple of $50, the adjustment shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $50.

      (E) The adjustment shall apply to all tax years beginning in the calendar year for which the adjustment is made.

      (3) In the case of any item attributable to an abusive tax shelter:

      (a) No reduction of the amount of the understatement shall be made with regard to that item regardless of the existence of substantial authority for the treatment of the item by the taxpayer.

      (b) No reduction of the amount of the understatement shall be made with regard to that item regardless of the disclosure of the facts affecting the tax treatment of the item unless, in addition to the disclosure, the taxpayer reasonably believed that the tax treatment of the item was more likely than not the proper treatment.

      (4) As used in this section:

      (a) “Abusive tax shelter” means any partnership, corporation or other organization or entity, any investment plan or arrangement or any other plan or arrangement, which has as its principal purpose the evasion or improper avoidance of federal or state income tax. “Abusive tax shelter” includes any investment or activity in connection with which tax benefits derived by investors are not clearly intended under the tax laws or any investment or activity that involves little or no economic reality, making use of unrealistic allocations of income or expenses, inflated appraisals of asset values, losses substantially in excess of investment, mismatching of income and expenses, financing techniques that do not conform to standard commercial business practice or mischaracterization of the substance of the investment or activity.

      (b) “Understatement” means the excess of the amount of the net tax required to be shown on the return for the tax year over the amount of the net tax shown on the return, reduced by any portion of the understatement that is attributable to:

      (A) The tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment; or

      (B) Any item with respect to which:

      (i) The relevant facts affecting the item’s tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return; and

      (ii) There is a reasonable basis for the tax treatment of the item by the taxpayer.

      (5) The penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other penalty imposed by law. A penalty imposed under this section shall be treated for all purposes as an additional deficiency subject to the provisions of ORS 305.265, but shall not bear interest.

      (6) The department may waive all or any part of the penalty imposed under this section on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement, or any portion thereof, and that the taxpayer acted in good faith. [1987 c.843 §9; 1995 c.556 §25a; 2015 c.32 §1]

 

      314.403 Listed transaction understatement; penalty. (1) If a taxpayer has a listed transaction understatement for a tax year, there shall be added to the tax liability of the taxpayer for the tax year a penalty equal to 60 percent of the amount of the understatement.

      (2) The penalty imposed under this section applies to listed transaction understatements discovered or reported on or after January 1, 2008, and is in addition to and not in lieu of any other penalty.

      (3) As used in this section, “listed transaction understatement” means the sum of:

      (a) The amount determined by multiplying the highest rate of tax imposed on the taxpayer under ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318, by any net increase in taxable income that results from a difference between the proper tax treatment of a listed transaction and the treatment of the transaction on the return of the taxpayer; and

      (b) The amount of any decrease in the aggregate amount of credits determined for purposes of ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, for purposes of ORS chapter 317 or 318, that results from the taxpayer’s treatment of a listed transaction and the proper tax treatment of that transaction.

      (4) The Department of Revenue may by rule further define “listed transaction understatement” consistent with ORS 314.307 and subsection (3) of this section. [2007 c.568 §8]

 

      314.404 Penalty for failure to report reportable transaction. (1) If a taxpayer fails to report to the Department of Revenue a reportable transaction as required by ORS 314.308, there shall be added to the tax liability of the taxpayer for the tax year a penalty as follows:

      (a) Individual taxpayers, $3,300.

      (b) Corporation taxpayers, $16,700.

      (2) If the reportable transaction is a listed transaction, in lieu of the penalty provided in subsection (1) of this section, the penalty shall be as follows:

      (a) Individual taxpayers, $33,000.

      (b) Corporation taxpayers, $66,000.

      314.406 Penalty for promotion of abusive tax shelter. (1) A penalty shall be imposed on a person who promotes a tax shelter if:

      (a) The person is or would be subject to a penalty for promoting an abusive tax shelter under section 6700 of the Internal Revenue Code; and

      (b) The tax shelter satisfies any of the following conditions:

      (A) The tax shelter is organized in this state.

      (2) The amount of the penalty shall equal 100 percent of the amount of gross income derived by the person in promoting the tax shelter.

      (3) A penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other penalty. [2007 c.568 §12]

 

COLLECTING DELINQUENT TAXES; LIENS; INTEREST AND ADDITIONS TO TAX; REFUNDS

 

      314.407 Assessment of taxes owing but not submitted with return; time of assessment; recording of warrant. For the purposes of this section and ORS 314.417 to 314.423:

      (1) In the case of a return submitted to the Department of Revenue with payment of less than the amount of tax computed to be due, the difference between the tax computed to be owing by the taxpayer and the tax submitted with the return is considered as assessed on the due date of the original return (determined without regard to any extension of time granted for the filing of the return) or the date the return is filed, whichever is later.

      (2) The term “time of assessment” means:

      (a) In the case of an assessment made under ORS 305.265 and 314.410, 30 days after the date the notice of assessment is mailed to the taxpayer;

      (b) In the case of an assessment made under ORS 314.440, five days after the date the notice of assessment is mailed to the taxpayer; or

      (c) In the case of a tax assessed as described in subsection (1) of this section, the due date of the original return (determined without regard to any extension of time granted for the filing of the return) or the date the return is filed, whichever is later.

      (3) Unless a warrant has been recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record in the county in which property is located, no warrant shall be considered as a lien with respect to that property. [1971 c.215 §2; 1977 c.870 §42; 1987 c.586 §39; 1995 c.79 §154; 2017 c.23 §1]

      (3) If the department finds that a return reports or reflects the use of a listed transaction, as defined in ORS 314.307, and that use of that listed transaction results in a deficiency in tax paid, notice of that deficiency may be given at any time within nine years after the return was filed.

      (4)(a) The limitations to the giving of notice of a deficiency provided in this section do not apply to a deficiency resulting from false or fraudulent returns, or in cases where no return has been filed.

      (b)(A) If the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or other authorized officer of the federal government or an authorized officer of another state’s taxing authority makes a change or correction as described in ORS 314.380 (2)(a)(A) and, as a result of the change or correction, an assessment of tax or issuance of a refund is permitted under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or applicable law of the other state, or pursuant to an agreement between the taxpayer and the federal or other state taxing authority that extends the period in which an assessment of federal or other state tax may be made, then notice of a deficiency under any Oregon law imposing tax upon or measured by income for the corresponding tax year may be mailed within two years after the department is notified by the taxpayer or the commissioner or other tax official of the correction, or within the applicable period prescribed in subsections (1) to (3) of this section, whichever period expires later.

      (B) A notice of deficiency mailed pursuant to this paragraph may assert any adjustment necessary to arrive at the correct amount of Oregon taxable income and Oregon tax liability for the tax year for which the federal or other state change or correction is made.

      (c) If the taxpayer files an original or amended federal or other state return as described in ORS 314.380 (2)(a)(B), the department may reduce any claim for refund as a result of a change in Oregon tax liability related to the original or amended federal or other state return, but may not give notice of a deficiency for an adjustment to Oregon tax liability following the expiration of the applicable period prescribed in subsections (1) to (3) of this section and paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (a) The cost of purchasing the new residence which the taxpayer claims results in nonrecognition of any part of such gain;

      (b) The taxpayer’s intention not to purchase a new residence; or

      (c) A failure to purchase a new residence within the period prescribed in section 1034 of the Internal Revenue Code (as in effect prior to the repeal of section 1034 of the Internal Revenue Code by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34)).

      (7) If, prior to the expiration of any period of time prescribed in this section for giving of notice of deficiency or of assessment, the department and the taxpayer consent in writing to the notice of deficiency being mailed or deficiency being assessed after the expiration of such prescribed period, notice of such deficiency may be mailed or the deficiency assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period agreed upon.

      (8) In the case of a deficiency attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback, notice of such deficiency may be mailed at any time before the expiration of the period within which notice of a deficiency for the taxable year of the net operating loss which results in such carryback may be mailed.

      (9) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if any taxpayer agreed with the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the taxing authority of another state for an extension, or renewals thereof, of the period for giving notices of deficiencies and assessing deficiencies in income tax for any year, the period for mailing notices of deficiencies of tax for such years and the period for filing a claim for refund under ORS 314.380 (2)(b) shall expire on the later of:

      (a) The expiration of an applicable period described in subsections (1) to (8) or (10) of this section; or

      (b) Six months after the date of the expiration of the agreed period for assessing a deficiency.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “pass-through entity” means any entity that is recognized as a separate entity for federal income tax purposes, for which the owners are required to report income, gains, losses, deductions or credits from the entity for federal income tax purposes. [1957 c.632 §14 (enacted in lieu of 316.610 and 317.410); 1959 c.212 §2; 1959 c.591 §20; subsection (8) derived from 1959 c.212 §3 and 1959 c.591 §21; 1963 c.509 §2; 1963 c.627 §1 (referred and rejected); 1969 c.405 §1; 1969 c.493 §§88,88a; 1971 c.507 §1; 1977 c.870 §43; 1983 c.162 §53; 1985 c.602 §5; 1993 c.726 §14; 1997 c.100 §3; 1999 c.74 §3; 1999 c.90 §4a; 2001 c.9 §5; 2005 c.54 §1; 2007 c.568 §18]

 

      314.412 Issuing of notice of deficiency attributable to involuntary conversion; time limit. Notwithstanding ORS 314.410, the period for issuing any notice of deficiency attributable to any part of the gain realized upon an involuntary conversion as provided in the federal Internal Revenue Code which applies to the Personal Income Tax Act of 1969 or as provided in the corporate excise tax or corporate income tax laws, shall not expire prior to the expiration of three years from the date the Department of Revenue is notified by the taxpayer of:

      (1) The replacement of the converted property which the taxpayer claims results in nonrecognition of any part of such gains; or

      (2) The taxpayer’s intention not to replace such property; or

      (3) A failure of the taxpayer to replace the property within the period prescribed in the federal Internal Revenue Code which applies to the Personal Income Tax Act of 1969, in the corporation excise tax laws or in the corporation income tax laws, whichever is applicable. [1975 c.705 §2; 1989 c.626 §3]

 

      314.415 Refunds; interest; credits. (1) If the Department of Revenue determines pursuant to ORS 305.270 that the amount of the tax due is less than the amount theretofore paid, the excess shall be refunded by the department with interest at the rate established under ORS 305.220 for a period beginning 45 days after the due date of the return or on the date the tax was paid, or, in the case of a return filed under ORS 118.100, the date that the return is filed, whichever is later, and ending at the time the refund is made.

      (2)(a) The department may not allow or make a refund after three years from the time the return was filed, or two years from the time the tax (or a portion of the tax) was paid, whichever period expires later, unless before the expiration of this period a claim for refund is filed by the taxpayer in compliance with ORS 305.270. In any case, if the original return is not filed within three years of the due date, excluding extensions, of the return, the department may allow or make a refund only of amounts paid within two years from the date of the filing of the claim for refund. If a refund is disallowed for the tax year during which excess tax was paid for any reason set forth in this subsection, the department may not allow the excess as a credit against any tax occurring on a return filed for a subsequent year.

      (b) The department may not make a refund if the tax owed after offsets for all amounts owed the state, or a county pursuant to a judgment obtained under ORS 169.151, is less than $1.

      (c) If a taxpayer would qualify under section 6511(h) of the Internal Revenue Code for a suspension of the running of the periods specified for filing a claim for refund of federal income tax, the period specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall also be suspended.

      (d) The department may not pay an employee interest on a refund of a tax withheld by an employer if the interest would be for any period prior to the time the employee files a personal income tax return for the tax year involved or for any period prior to the day that is 45 days after the date when the employee’s annual return for that year was filed or was due, whichever is later.

      (e) The department may not pay interest on a refund of estimated tax paid under ORS 314.505 to 314.525 or 316.557 to 316.589 if the interest would be for any period prior to the time the taxpayer files a tax return for the tax year involved or for any period prior to the day that is 45 days after the date when the tax return for that year was filed or was due, whichever is later.

      (f) The amount of the refund, exclusive of interest on the refund, may not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the period preceding the filing of the claim or, if no claim is filed, then during the period preceding the allowance of the refund during which a claim might have been filed. Where there has been an overpayment of any tax imposed, the amount of the overpayment and interest on the overpayment shall be credited against any tax, penalty or interest then due from the taxpayer, and only the balance shall be refunded.

      (g) Except as provided in ORS 305.265 (12), if, pursuant to a notice of deficiency or assessment, the taxpayer pays the amount specified in the notice, or any part thereof, and if, upon appeal, the Oregon Tax Court or the Oregon Supreme Court orders that all or any part of the deficiency amount specified in the notice and paid by the taxpayer be refunded, the amount so ordered to be refunded shall bear interest at the rate established for refunds in ORS 305.220. Interest shall be computed from the date of payment to the department. Nothing in this subsection shall require that interest be paid upon any amount for any period for which interest upon the same amount for the same period is required to be paid under ORS 305.419.

      (3)(a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in ORS 305.265 or 305.270 or subsection (1) or (2) of this section, if, prior to the expiration of the period prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the department and the taxpayer consent in writing to the refund of tax after the expiration of the period prescribed:

      (A) The department shall make the refund prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon; and

      (B) The department may not make or allow a refund after the expiration of the period agreed upon unless a claim for refund is filed by the taxpayer before the expiration of the period agreed upon in compliance with the manner prescribed by the department. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.

      (b) The department may consent to extend the period during which a refund may be made only if the taxpayer has consented to the assessment of additional tax, if additional taxes are determined upon audit, after the expiration of the applicable period prescribed in ORS 314.410 (1) to (3).

      (4)(a) If the claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment on account of the deductibility by the taxpayer, or by a partnership, of the worthlessness of a share of stock in a corporation, of the right to subscribe for or to receive a share of stock in a corporation, or of a debt, in lieu of the three-year period of limitation prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the period shall be seven years from the date prescribed by law for the filing of the return for the year with respect to which the claim is made.

      (b) If the claim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection is made after the expiration of the three-year period prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the department may not allow interest with respect to any credit or refund determined to be due upon the claim for the period beginning at the close of the three-year period prescribed in subsection (2) of this section and ending at the expiration of six months after the date on which the claim is filed.

      (5)(a) If the claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a net capital loss carryback, in lieu of the three-year period of limitation prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the period shall be the period that ends three years after the time prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions) for the taxable year of the net operating loss or net capital loss that results in such carryback. In the case of such a claim, the amount of the credit or refund may exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period provided in subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section, whichever is applicable, to the extent of the amount of the overpayment attributable to the carryback. If the allowance of a credit or refund of an overpayment of tax attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a net capital loss carryback is otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law other than ORS 305.150, relating to closing agreements, the credit or refund may be allowed or made if the claim for credit or refund is filed within the period provided in this subsection. To the extent that the carryback was not an issue in any proceeding in which the determination of a court, including the Oregon Tax Court, has become final, the claimed credit or refund applicable to that carryback may be allowed or made under this subsection.

      (b) For purposes of subsection (1) or (2) of this section, if any overpayment of tax results from a carryback of a net operating loss or net capital loss, the overpayment shall be deemed not to have been made prior to the later of:

      (A) The due date of the return for the taxable year in which such net operating loss or net capital loss arises;

      (B) The date the return for the year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises is filed; or

      (C) The date of filing of the return for the year to which the net operating loss or net capital loss is carried back.

      (6) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in ORS 305.265 or 305.270 or this section, if the taxpayer has agreed with the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue for an extension, or a renewal of an extension, of the period for proposing and assessing deficiencies in federal income tax for any year, the period within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed or credit or refund allowed or made if no claim is filed shall be the period provided within subsections (1) to (5) of this section or six months after the date of the expiration of the agreed period for assessing deficiency in federal income tax, whichever period expires later.

      (7) If a joint return is filed, the department may make separate refunds at the request of either spouse. The separate refunds shall bear the same proportion to the total refund as the adjusted gross income of each spouse bears to the adjusted gross income of both spouses, or as otherwise determined by the department.

      (8) If a taxpayer entitled to a refund under subsection (1) of this section dies, the department may issue a draft for payment of such refund under the terms and conditions set out in ORS 293.490 to 293.500 exercising the same powers and subject to the same restrictions pursuant to which the State Treasurer is authorized to pay the amounts of warrants, checks or orders under those statutes. [1957 c.632 §15 (enacted in lieu of 316.615 and 317.415); 1969 c.166 §4; 1969 c.405 §2; 1971 c.354 §5; 1971 c.507 §2; 1975 c.593 §16; 1977 c.870 §44; 1982 s.s.1 c.16 §8; 1983 c.162 §54; 1985 c.61 §3; 1985 c.602 §6; 1985 c.603 §1; 1985 c.802 §19; 1987 c.293 §60; 1987 c.647 §1; 1989 c.626 §4; 1991 c.457 §17b; 1993 c.726 §16; 1995 c.650 §32; 1999 c.73 §4; 1999 c.90 §1a; 2001 c.641 §3; 2005 c.48 §1; 2005 c.210 §2; 2007 c.568 §20; 2011 c.526 §25; 2017 c.278 §9]

 

      314.417 Unpaid tax or withholding lien at time of assessment. If any person neglects or refuses to pay an income tax at the time of assessment, or fails to pay to the Department of Revenue any amount required to be withheld under ORS 316.167 and 316.172, the amount of the unpaid tax including interest and penalty thereon shall be a lien in favor of the State of Oregon upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to the person. The lien shall arise at the time of assessment or the time the amount withheld is to be paid to the department and the lien shall continue until the liability for the taxes, with interest and penalty, is satisfied. [1971 c.215 §3; 1981 c.546 §1]

 

      314.419 Foreclosure of lien. In addition to any other remedy provided by law the lien created by ORS 314.417 may be foreclosed in the following manner:

      (1) The Director of the Department of Revenue shall issue an order directed to the sheriff of the county in which the property or interest in property subject to the lien is located, describing the property subject to the lien, and commanding the sheriff to seize the property specified and sell it to pay the amount shown on the order to be due. In the discretion of the director an order of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any agent authorized to collect income taxes, and in the execution thereof the agent shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (2) If the property seized by the sheriff is personal property the sheriff shall utilize the procedures under ORS 311.644 to effect collection of the amount due.

      (3) If the property seized by the sheriff is real property the sheriff shall proceed to sell the real property in the same manner that real property is sold under a writ of execution.

      (4) Any property which has been sold under this section may be redeemed from the purchaser by the taxpayer or any junior lienor within 120 days from the date of the sale by paying to the purchaser the full purchase price paid plus an additional 20 percent of the purchase price.

      (5) In any proceeding under this section to sell property to foreclose a lien, the taxpayer may claim any exemption to which the taxpayer is entitled under the laws of this state relating to property exempt from execution. [1971 c.215 §4]

 

      314.420 [1957 c.632 §16 (enacted in lieu of 316.620, 317.370 and 317.420); 1969 c.166 §5; repealed by 1971 c.354 §7]

 

      314.421 When lien valid. The lien imposed by ORS 314.417 shall not be valid as against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic’s lienor or judgment creditor until a warrant is issued and recorded under ORS 314.430. [1971 c.215 §5; 1987 c.586 §40]

 

      314.423 Status of lien. (1) After a warrant has been recorded under ORS 314.430, the lien imposed by ORS 314.417 shall be subordinate to:

      (a) Any interest in real property to the same extent that a judgment recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record under ORS 18.152 at the same time the warrant was recorded would be subordinate to the interest; and

      (b) Any interest in personal property to the same extent that a security agreement filed under the Uniform Commercial Code at the same time the warrant was filed would be subordinate to the interest.

      (2) After a warrant has been recorded under ORS 314.430, the lien imposed by ORS 314.417 shall not be valid as to a purchaser, security interest holder or lienholder in a sale, security agreement or lien arising out of the following types of property or property transactions unless the purchaser, security interest holder or lienholder had actual knowledge of the lien:

      (a) Securities as defined in ORS 78.1020;

      (b) Retail purchases in the ordinary course of business;

      (c) Casual sales of personal property;

      (d) Attorney’s liens;

      (e) Insurance contract loans; or

      (f) Passbook loans. [1971 c.215 §§6,7; 1987 c.586 §41; 1997 c.325 §36; 2003 c.576 §230]

 

      314.425 Examining books, records or persons. (1) The Department of Revenue, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return or for the purpose of making an estimate of the taxable income of any taxpayer, may examine or cause to be examined by an agent or representative designated by it for the purpose, any books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the matter required to be included in the return, and may require the attendance of the taxpayer or officer or agent or any other person having knowledge in the premises, and may take testimony and require proof material for the information, with power to administer oaths to such persons. The department shall have authority, by order or subpoena to be served with the same force and effect and in the same manner that a subpoena is served in a civil action in the tax court, to require the production at any time and place it may designate of any books, papers, accounts or other information necessary to the carrying out of any law imposing tax on or measured by net income.

      (2) If any person fails to comply with any subpoena or order of the department or to produce or permit the examination or inspection of any books, papers or documents pertinent to any investigation or inquiry under this section, or to testify to any matter regarding which the person may be lawfully interrogated, the department may apply to the tax court for the county in which the person resides for an order to the person to attend and testify, or otherwise comply with the demand or request of the department. The application to the court shall be by ex parte motion upon which the court shall make an order requiring the person against whom it is directed to comply with the request on demand of the department within 10 days after service of the order (or such further time as the court may grant) or to justify the failure within that time. The order shall be served upon the person to whom it is directed in the manner required by this state for service of process, which service shall be required to confer jurisdiction upon the court. Failure to obey any order issued by the court under this section is contempt of court. The remedy provided by this section shall be in addition to other remedies, civil or criminal, existing under the tax laws or other laws of this state. [1957 c.632 §17 (enacted in lieu of 316.625 and 317.425); 1995 c.650 §33]

 

      314.430 Warrant for collection of taxes. (1) If any tax imposed under ORS chapter 118, 316, 317 or 318 or any portion of the tax is not paid within 30 days after the date that the written notice and demand for payment required under ORS 305.895 is mailed (or within five days after the tax becomes due, in the case of the termination of the tax year by the Department of Revenue under the provisions of ORS 314.440), or any amount payable by a transferee under ORS 311.695 is not paid as required under ORS 311.686, and no provision is made to secure the payment thereof by bond, deposit or otherwise, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the department, the department may issue a warrant for the payment of the amount of the tax or amount payable under ORS 311.695, with the added penalties, interest and any collection charge incurred. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed or delivered to the taxpayer or transferee by the department at the taxpayer’s or transferee’s last-known address.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer or transferee found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the taxpayer or transferee found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect taxes, and in the execution of the warrant the agent has all of the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (4) Until a warrant issued under this section is satisfied in full, the department has the same remedies to enforce the claim for taxes against the taxpayer or for amounts payable by the transferee as if the state had recovered judgment against the taxpayer for the amount of the tax or against the transferee for the amount payable under ORS 311.695. [1957 c.632 §18 (enacted in lieu of 316.630 and 317.430); 1959 c.74 §1; 1959 c.234 §1; 1975 c.593 §17; 1983 c.696 §12; 1985 c.85 §12; 1985 c.761 §15; 1987 c.586 §42; 1989 c.625 §62; 1997 c.99 §52; 2011 c.389 §1; 2011 c.723 §29]

      314.440 Tax as debt; termination of taxable period and immediate assessment of tax. (1) Every tax imposed by any law imposing a tax upon or measured by net income, and all increases, interest and penalties thereon shall become, from the time such liability is incurred, a personal debt, due the State of Oregon, from the person or persons liable therefor.

      (2) If the Department of Revenue finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from the state or to remove the property of the taxpayer therefrom, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partially ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax for any past tax year or the tax year then current unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the department shall declare the current taxable period for such taxpayer immediately terminated and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be given the taxpayer. Simultaneously, the department, on the basis of the best information available to it, shall assess a tax for such terminated period and for the preceding tax year (if no return has been filed therefor, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by law for filing such return and paying the tax has expired), and shall assess additional tax for any years open to assessment under the provisions of the applicable law. The department shall give notice to the taxpayer of all taxes so assessed. Such taxes shall thereupon become immediately due and payable as soon as the notice and findings are issued to the taxpayer or mailed to the last-known address of the taxpayer. In any proceeding in court brought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this section the findings of the department, made as provided in this section, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of the taxpayer’s design and the certificate of the department of the mailing or issuing of the notice and findings specified in this section is presumptive evidence that the notice and findings were mailed or issued.

ESTIMATED TAX PROCEDURE

 

      314.505 Estimate of tax liability by corporations; rules. (1) Every corporation expecting to have a tax liability under either ORS chapter 317 or 318 of $500 or more shall make an estimate of tax liability for the corporation’s tax year and pay the amount of tax determined as provided in ORS 314.515.

      (2) The Department of Revenue shall by rule provide for the payment of estimated tax liability by a group of affiliated corporations filing a consolidated return.

      (3) As used in ORS 314.505 to 314.525, the term “estimated tax liability” means the tax computed under ORS chapter 317 or 318 less the credits allowed for purposes of ORS chapter 317 or 318. [1973 c.292 §1; 1984 c.1 §16; 1993 c.730 §41; 1997 c.299 §5]

 

      314.515 Installment schedule for payment of estimated tax. (1) A corporation required under ORS 314.505 to make payments of estimated tax shall make the payments to the Department of Revenue in installments as follows:

      (a) One-quarter or more of the estimated tax shall be paid on or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the taxable year.

      (b) One-quarter or more of the estimated tax shall be paid on or before the 15th day of the sixth month of the taxable year.

      (c) One-quarter or more of the estimated tax shall be paid on or before the 15th day of the ninth month of the taxable year.

      (d) The balance of the estimated tax shall be paid on or before the 15th day of the 12th month of the taxable year.

      (2) Any payment of estimated tax received by the department for which the corporation has made no designation of the quarterly installment to which the payment is to be applied, shall first be applied to underpayments of estimated tax due for any prior quarter of the taxable year. Any excess amount shall be applied to the installment that next becomes due after the payment was received. [1973 c.292 §2; 1981 c.678 §4; 1985 c.603 §2]

 

      314.518 Estimated tax payments by electronic funds transfer; phase-in; rules. (1) A corporation required to make a payment of estimated tax under ORS 314.505 to 314.525 shall make the payment by means of electronic funds transfer if:

      (a) For payment periods beginning on or after July 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2002, the corporation’s annual total amount of estimated tax liability exceeds $50,000.

      (b) For payment periods beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the corporation is required to make federal estimated tax payments electronically.

      (2) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules that provide exemptions from the requirement that estimated tax be paid by electronic funds transfer when the taxpayer is disadvantaged by required payment by electronic funds transfer.

      (3) The Department of Revenue may accept electronically filed payments voluntarily submitted by a corporation that is not required to pay by means of electronic funds transfer.

      (4) As used in this section, “electronic funds transfer” has the meaning given that term in ORS 293.525. [1997 c.299 §4; 1999 c.21 §35; 2001 c.28 §5; 2001 c.114 §30]

 

      314.520 State agency authority over certain electronic funds transfer payments. ORS 314.505, 314.518 and 316.198 do not alter the authority under ORS 293.525 of a state agency to require by rule that certain payments to the agency be made by electronic funds transfer. [1997 c.299 §6; 2001 c.114 §39; 2005 c.28 §2]

 

      Note: 314.520 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 314 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      314.525 Underpayment of estimated tax; interest; nonapplicability of penalties. (1) An underpayment of estimated tax under ORS 314.505 to 314.525 will be considered to have occurred if the estimated tax is not paid as required.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, there shall be no underpayment of estimated tax if the estimated tax paid equals or exceeds the amount described in any one of the following paragraphs:

      (a) The amount which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax liability were equal to 100 percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or, if no return was filed, 100 percent of the tax for such taxable year.

      (b) The amount which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax liability were equal to 100 percent of the tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, and the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of 12 months.

      (c)(A) An amount equal to 100 percent of the tax for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income:

      (i) For the first three months of the taxable year, in the case of the installment required to be paid in the fourth month;

      (ii) For the first three months or for the first five months of the taxable year, in the case of the installment required to be paid in the sixth month;

      (iii) For the first six months or for the first eight months of the taxable year in the case of the installment required to be paid in the ninth month; and

      (iv) For the first nine months or for the first 11 months of the taxable year, in the case of the installment required to be paid in the 12th month of the taxable year.

      (B) For purposes of this paragraph the taxable income shall be placed on an annualized basis by:

      (i) Multiplying by 12 the taxable income referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and

      (ii) Dividing the resulting amount by the number of months in the taxable year (3, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 11, as the case may be) referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

      (d) An amount equal to 100 percent of the amount obtained by applying section 6655(e) (3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code to Oregon taxable income.

      (e) An election made under section 6655(e) (2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to annualization periods) for federal tax purposes shall also apply for purposes of estimated tax under ORS 314.505 to 314.525.

      (3) Interest shall accrue on the underpayment of estimated tax under ORS 314.505 to 314.525 at the rate established under ORS 305.220 for the period the estimated tax or any installment thereof remains unpaid. The penalty provisions contained in this chapter and ORS chapters 317 and 318 for underpayment of tax shall not apply to underpayments of estimated tax under ORS 314.505 to 314.525.

      (4) For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the underpayment of estimated tax shall be the excess of:

      (a) The amount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to the lowest of the payments required under subsection (2) of this section (and allowed to be made by the taxpayer under subsection (5) of this section), over

      (b) The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment.

      (5) In the case of a large corporation, subsection (2)(b) of this section shall apply only to determine the amount of the first required installment for any taxable year. Any reduction in the first installment by reason of this subsection shall be added to the amount of the next required installment determined without regard to subsection (2)(b) of this section. For purposes of this subsection, a “large corporation” is any corporation that had federal taxable income, determined without regard to any amount carried to any of the three taxable years under section 172 or 1212(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, of $1 million or more in any of the three taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year involved.

      (6) The application of this section to taxable years of less than 12 months shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of Revenue.

      (3) The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year.

      (4) Gain or loss from the sale of a partnership interest is allocable to this state in the ratio of the original cost of partnership tangible property in the state to the original cost of partnership tangible property everywhere, determined at the time of the sale. In the event that more than 50 percent of the value of a partnership’s assets consists of intangibles, gain or loss from the sale of the partnership interest shall be allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full tax year immediately preceding its tax year during which the partnership interest was sold. [1965 c.152 §7; 1989 c.625 §64]

(Apportionment of Income)

 

      314.647 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares it to be the policy of this state to carry out a comprehensive review of income apportionment whenever federal legislation changes the nexus standard for state imposition of taxes based on business activity within state borders. [2001 c.793 §12; 2017 c.43 §3]

 

      Note: 314.647 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 314 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      314.650 Apportionment of income. All apportionable income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by the sales factor. [1965 c.152 §10; 1989 c.626 §5; 1989 c.1088 §1; 1995 c.79 §156; 2001 c.793 §1; 2003 c.739 §§1,5; 2005 c.832 §§48,49; 2009 c.842 §1; 2017 c.43 §4]

 

      314.655 Determination of property factor. (1) For purposes of ORS 317.391, the property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.

      (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals.

      (3) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the Department of Revenue may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer’s property. [1965 c.152 §§11,12,13; 2001 c.793 §3; 2001 c.933 §2; 2009 c.842 §2]

 

      314.660 Determination of payroll factor. (1) For purposes of ORS 317.391, the payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.

      (2) Compensation is paid in this state if:

      (a) The individual’s service is performed entirely within the state;

      (b) The individual’s service is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the individual’s service within the state; or

      (c) Some of the service is performed in the state and (A) the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state, or (B) the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual’s residence is in this state. [1965 c.152 §§14,15; 2001 c.793 §4; 2001 c.933 §3; 2009 c.842 §3]

 

      314.665 Determination of sales factor; use of market sourcing; inclusions and exclusions; definitions. (1) As used in ORS 314.650, the sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.

      (2) Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if:

      (a) The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States Government, within this state regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or

      (b) The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in this state and the purchaser is the United States Government or the taxpayer is not taxable in the state of the purchaser. For purposes of this paragraph:

      (A) The sale of goods shipped from a public warehouse is not considered to take place in this state if:

      (i) The taxpayer’s only activity in Oregon is the storage of the goods in the public warehouse prior to shipment; or

      (ii) The taxpayer’s only activities in Oregon are the storage of the goods in the public warehouse prior to shipment and the presence of employees within this state solely for purposes of soliciting sales of the taxpayer’s products; and

      (B) “Taxpayer” means a taxpayer as defined in section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code, an affiliate of the person storing goods in a public warehouse or a person that is related under section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code to the person storing goods in a public warehouse.

      (3) Subsection (2)(b) of this section does not apply to sales of tangible personal property if:

      (a) The sales are included in the numerator of a formula used to apportion income to another state of the United States, a foreign country or the District of Columbia; and

      (b) The other state, a foreign country or the District of Columbia has imposed a tax on or measured by the apportioned income.

      (4) Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if the taxpayer’s market for sales is in this state, as determined under ORS 314.666.

      (5) Where the sales apportionment factor is determined by administrative rule pursuant to ORS 314.682, 314.684 or 317.660 or other law, the Department of Revenue shall adopt rules that are consistent with the determination of the sales factor under this section.

      (6) The department may determine that a warehouse that meets the definition of “public warehouse” under this section may not be treated as a public warehouse if the warehouse is being used primarily for tax avoidance purposes or if transactions related to the use of the warehouse are primarily for tax avoidance purposes.

      (7) As used in this section, “public warehouse”:

      (a) Means a warehouse owned or operated by a person that does not own the goods stored in the warehouse; and

      (b) Does not include a warehouse that is owned by a person that is related to the person that owns goods that are stored in the warehouse, as determined under section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code, or an affiliate of the person that owns goods that are stored in the warehouse. [1965 c.152 §§16,17,18; 1993 c.813 §4; 1995 c.176 §1; 1999 c.143 §8; 2001 c.793 §5; 2001 c.933 §4; 2005 c.832 §3; 2017 c.43 §5; 2017 c.549 §3; 2017 c.622 §3]

 

      314.666 Market for sales in this state. (1) A taxpayer’s market for sales is in this state:

      (a) In the case of the sale, rental, lease or license of real property, if and to the extent the property is located in this state.

      (c) In the case of the sale of a service, if and to the extent the service is delivered to a location in this state.

      (2) A taxpayer’s market for sales is in this state in the case of intangible property that is rented, leased or licensed, if and to the extent the property is used in this state. Intangible property utilized in marketing a good or service to a consumer is deemed to be used in this state if that good or service is purchased by a consumer that is in this state.

      (3) A taxpayer’s market for sales is in this state in the case of intangible property that is sold, if and to the extent the property is used in this state. Under this subsection:

      (a) A contract right, government license or similar intangible property that authorizes the holder to conduct a business activity in a specific geographic area is deemed to be used in this state if the geographic area includes all or part of this state.

      (b) Intangible property sales that are contingent on the productivity, use or disposition of the intangible property shall be treated as the rental, lease or licensing of such intangible property under subsection (2) of this section.

      (c) All other intangible property sales shall be excluded from the sales factor.

      (4) If the state or states of assignment under subsections (1) to (3) of this section cannot be determined, the state or states of assignment shall be reasonably approximated. [2017 c.549 §2]

 

      Note: 314.666 was added to and made a part of 314.605 to 314.675 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

(Procedure Where Ordinary Determination Not Satisfactory)

 

      314.667 Additional methods to determine extent of business activity in this state; rules. (1) If the application of the allocation and apportionment provisions of ORS 314.605 to 314.675 do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for and the Department of Revenue may permit, or the department may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity:

      (a) Separate accounting;

      (b) The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

      (6) If a taxpayer that has executed a qualifying investment contract files a report or return with the Department of Revenue for a tax year ending during the term of the qualifying investment contract and reporting personal income taxes or corporate excise or income taxes imposed under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318, that are determined in whole or part by apportioning income using the single sales factor method, the department may not assess a deficiency against the taxpayer that is attributable to the use of a different method of apportionment.
