GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      315.004 Definitions; adoption of parts of Internal Revenue Code and application of federal laws and regulations; technical corrections. (1) Except when the context requires otherwise, the definitions contained in ORS chapters 314, 316, 317 and 318 are applicable in the construction, interpretation and application of the personal and corporate income and excise tax credits contained in this chapter.

      (2)(a) For purposes of the tax credits contained in this chapter, any term has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes, unless a different meaning is clearly required or the term is specifically defined for purposes of construing, interpreting and applying the credit.

      (b) With respect to the tax credits contained in this chapter, any reference to the laws of the United States or to the Internal Revenue Code means the laws of the United States relating to income taxes or the Internal Revenue Code as they are amended on or before December 31, 2018, even when the amendments take effect or become operative after that date.

      (3) Insofar as is practicable in the administration of this chapter, the Department of Revenue shall apply and follow the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law. When a provision of the federal income tax law is the subject of conflicting opinions by two or more federal courts, the department shall follow the rule observed by the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue until the conflict is resolved. Nothing contained in this section limits the right or duty of the department to audit the return of any taxpayer or to determine any fact relating to the tax liability of any taxpayer.

      (4) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section refer to rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, then such rules or regulations shall be regarded as rules adopted by the department under and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, whenever they are prescribed or amended.

      (5)(a) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section are later corrected by an Act or a Title within an Act of the United States Congress designated as an Act or Title making technical corrections, then notwithstanding the date that the Act or Title becomes law, those portions of the Internal Revenue Code, as so corrected, shall be the portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section and shall take effect, unless otherwise indicated by the Act or Title (in which case the provisions shall take effect as indicated in the Act or Title), as if originally included in the provisions of the Act being technically corrected. If, on account of this subsection, any adjustment is required to an Oregon return that would otherwise be prevented by operation of law or rule, the adjustment shall be made, notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, in the manner provided under ORS 314.135.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “Act or Title” includes any subtitle, division or other part of an Act or Title.

      (a) The approval was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation;

      (b) The approval was obtained by mistake or miscalculation; or

      (c) The taxpayer otherwise violates or has violated a condition or requirement for eligibility for the tax credit.

      (2) As soon as an order of revocation under this section becomes final, the director shall notify the Department of Revenue and the person that received the tax credit certification, or other approval, of the order of revocation. Upon notification, the Department of Revenue immediately shall proceed to collect:

      (a) If no portion of a credit has been transferred, those taxes not paid by the holder of the certificate or other approval as a result of the tax credits provided to the holder under the revoked approval, from the holder or a successor in interest to the business interests of the holder. All tax credits provided to the holder and attributable to the fraudulently or mistakenly obtained approval or portion of the approval shall be forfeited.

      (b) If all of a credit has been transferred, an amount equal to the amount of the tax credits allowable to the transferee under the revoked approval, from the transferor.

      (c) If a portion of a tax credit has been transferred, those taxes not paid by the transferor as a result of the tax credits provided to the transferor pursuant to the revoked approval, from the transferor or a successor in interest to the business interests of the transferor, and an amount equal to the amount of the tax credits allowable to the transferee pursuant to the revoked approval, from the transferor.

      (3)(a) The Department of Revenue shall have the benefit of all laws of the state pertaining to the collection of income and excise taxes and may proceed to collect the amounts described in subsection (2) of this section from the person that obtained approval or a successor in interest to the business interests of that person. An assessment of tax is not necessary and the collection of taxes described in this subsection is not precluded by any statute of limitations.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, a lender, bankruptcy trustee or other person that acquires an interest through bankruptcy or through foreclosure of a security interest is not considered to be a successor in interest to the business interests of the person that obtained approval.

      (4) If the approval is ordered revoked pursuant to this section, the holder of the certificate or other approval shall be denied any further relief in connection with the credit from and after the date that the order of revocation becomes final.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (4) of this section, a certificate or portion of a certificate held by a transferee may not be considered revoked for purposes of the transferee, the tax credit allowable to the transferee may not be reduced and a transferee is not liable under this section.

      (6) Interest under this section shall accrue at the rate established in ORS 305.220 beginning the day after the due date of the return on which the credit may first be claimed.

      (7) The Department of Revenue may collect amounts owed under this section by a partnership from the partnership. [2019 c.483 §4]

      (2) The credit shall be allowed under this section only if the taxpayer’s federal tax liability is determined under section 1341(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (3) The amount of the credit shall equal the difference between:

      (a) The taxpayer’s actual Oregon state tax liability for the tax year for which the claim of right income was included in gross income for federal tax purposes; and

      (b) The taxpayer’s Oregon state tax liability for that tax year, had the claim of right income not been included in gross income for federal tax purposes.

      (4) A credit under this section shall be allowed only for the tax year for which the taxpayer’s federal tax liability is determined under section 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code for federal tax purposes.

      (5) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as a payment of tax under ORS 314.505 to 314.525, 316.187 and 316.583, other payments of tax and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 to 318 (reduced by any nonrefundable credits allowed for the tax year), the excess shall be treated as an overpayment of tax and shall be refunded or applied in the same manner as other tax overpayments.

      (6) As used in this section, “claim of right income” means:

      (a) An item included in federal gross income for a prior tax year because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to the item; and

      (b) An item for which the taxpayer’s federal tax liability is adjusted under section 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code because the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to the item of gross income. [1999 c.1007 §2; 2001 c.660 §19]

      315.104 Reforestation; rules. (1) A credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 (or if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318) shall be allowed in an amount equal to 50 percent of reforestation project costs actually paid or incurred to reforest underproductive Oregon forestlands. Such costs include, but are not limited to, any fees established by the State Forester under ORS 315.106 (4), site preparation, tree planting and other silviculture treatments considered necessary by the State Forester to establish commercial, hardwood or softwood stands on appropriate sites. Subject to subsection (5) of this section:

      (a) One-half of the credit shall be taken in the tax year for which the State Forester, after physical inspection of the forestland, issues a preliminary certificate under ORS 315.106 certifying that the land qualifies as underproductive Oregon forestland and that the reforestation project undertaken meets the requirements of this section and the specifications established by the State Forester and the costs appear to be reasonable; and

      (b) One-half of the credit shall be taken in the tax year for which the State Forester, after further physical inspection of the land and project, certifies that the new forest is established in accordance with the specifications of the State Forester.

      (2) No credit shall be allowed under either subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section unless written certification containing the following statements accompanies the claim for the credit or is otherwise filed with the Department of Revenue:

      (a) A preliminary certificate issued by the State Forester under ORS 315.106 that the land and project meet the preliminary specifications established by the State Forester or that the new forest is established, whichever is applicable at the time.

      (b) A statement by the landowner or person in possession of the land that the land within the project area will be used for the primary purpose of growing and harvesting trees of an acceptable species.

      (c) A statement that the landowner or person in possession of the land is aware that maintenance practices, including release, may be needed to insure that a new forest is established and will remain established.

      (3) For purposes of this section, reforestation project costs shall not include:

      (a) Costs paid or incurred to reforest any forestland that has been commercially logged to the extent that reforestation is required under the Oregon Forest Practices Act, except costs paid or incurred to reforest forestland following a hardwood harvest, conducted for the purposes of converting underproductive forestlands, as determined by administrative rule.

      (b) That portion of costs or expenses paid through a federal or state cost share, financial assistance or other incentive program.

      (c) Those costs paid or incurred to grow Christmas trees, ornamental trees, shrubs or plants, or those costs paid or incurred to grow hardwood timber described under ORS 321.267 (3) or 321.824 (3).

      (d) Any costs paid or incurred to purchase or otherwise acquire the land.

      (e) The cost of purchase or other acquisition of tools and equipment with a useful life of more than one year.

      (4) To qualify for the credit:

      (a) The project must be completed to specifications approved by the State Forester.

      (b) The taxpayer’s portion of the project costs must be $500 or more.

      (c) The taxpayer must be a private individual, corporation, group, Indian tribe or other native group, association or other nonpublic legal entity owning, purchasing under recorded contract of sale or leasing at least five acres of Oregon commercial forestland.

      (d) Prior to December 31, 2012, the taxpayer must file with the State Forester a written request for preliminary certification under ORS 315.106.

      (5) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section which is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. In all cases the taxpayer must be the person who made the investment into the project.

      (6) The credit provided by this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled with respect to the reforestation project and the credit shall not affect the computation of basis for the property.

      (7) In compliance with ORS chapter 183, the Department of Revenue and the State Forestry Department may adopt rules consistent with law for carrying out the provisions of this section.

      (8) As used in this section, “underproductive Oregon forestlands” means Oregon commercial forestlands not meeting the minimum stocking standards of the Oregon Forest Practices Act.

      (9) If, for any reason other than those specified in subsection (10) of this section, a new forest is not established by the last day of the second taxable year following the taxable year for which the preliminary certificate was issued, the State Forester shall so report to the Department of Revenue. The report filed under this subsection shall be the basis for the department to recover any credit granted under subsection (1)(a) of this section. If, however, the new forest is not established within the time required by this subsection on account of the reasons specified in subsection (10) of this section, any credit allowed under subsections (1)(a) and (5) of this section shall not be recovered but no further credit as provided under subsections (1)(b) and (5) of this section shall be allowed.

      (10) Subject to requalification under this section in the manner applicable for the original claim, including obtaining a new preliminary certificate, a taxpayer may claim an additional credit or credits for reestablishing a new planting in the event that the new forest is destroyed by a natural disaster or is not established for reasons beyond the control of the taxpayer, if the measures taken in completing the original or earlier project would normally have resulted in establishing the minimum number of trees per acre anticipated by the project.

      (11) Any owner affected by a determination, regarding the reforestation tax credit made by:

      (a) The State Forester, except for a denial of a request for a preliminary certificate due to the annual reforestation credit cost limitation calculated under ORS 315.108, may appeal that determination in the manner provided for in ORS 526.475 (1).

      (b) The Department of Revenue, may appeal that determination in the manner provided for in ORS 526.475 (2). [1993 c.730 §8 (enacted in lieu of 316.094, 317.102 and 318.110); 1995 c.746 §23; 2001 c.359 §1; 2003 c.454 §122; 2003 c.621 §97a; 2007 c.883 §1; 2009 c.913 §19]

 

      Note: Section 5, chapter 605, Oregon Laws 1987, provides:

      Sec. 5. No tax credit shall be allowed under ORS 315.104 based upon reforestation project costs if the preliminary certificate is not issued on or before December 31, 2011. [1987 c.605 §5; 1989 c.887 §4; 1995 c.746 §28; 2001 c.359 §3]

      315.106 Reforestation credit preliminary certificate; application; limitation calculation; rules; fee. (1) A taxpayer claiming the credit provided under ORS 315.104 shall file a written request with the State Forester for a preliminary certificate. The request shall contain:

      (a) Information that is required by the State Forester by rule;

      (b) An estimate of the amount of the credit the taxpayer expects to claim under ORS 315.104 (1)(a); and

      (c) Payment of any fee required by the State Forester by rule adopted under subsection (4) of this section.

      (2) The State Forester shall consider requests for preliminary certificates in the chronological order in which the requests are filed with the State Forester. If the State Forester determines that the request complies with ORS 315.104 (1)(a), the State Forester shall issue the preliminary certificate to the taxpayer, to the extent the total amount of estimated claims for credit under ORS 315.104 (1)(a) for all preliminary certificates issued for the calendar year do not exceed the annual reforestation credit cost limitation calculated under ORS 315.108.

      (3) The State Forester may not issue a preliminary certificate to a taxpayer to the extent the estimated claim for credit under ORS 315.104 (1)(a) contained in the request for a preliminary certificate, when added to the total of estimated claims for credit under ORS 315.104 (1)(a) for all preliminary certificates issued by the State Forester for the calendar year, exceeds the annual reforestation credit cost limitation calculated under ORS 315.108.

      (4) The State Forester shall establish by rule a fee for filing a written request for a preliminary certificate under this section. The fee shall be adequate to recover the costs incurred by the State Forestry Department in administering the reforestation tax credit program established under this section and ORS 315.104 and 315.108.

      (5) Moneys collected from fees established by the State Forester under rules adopted under this section shall be deposited in the State Forestry Department Account to be used for the purposes of administering the reforestation tax credit program. [1995 c.746 §25; 2005 c.796 §3]

 

      Note: 315.106 is repealed January 2, 2028. See section 9, chapter 883, Oregon Laws 2007.

 

      315.108 Annual reforestation credit cost limitation. (1) On or before January 1, 1996, the State Forester shall determine an average annual amount of estimated reforestation project costs for which credit was claimed under ORS 315.104 (1)(a) during the period from July 1, 1992, to July 1, 1994.

      (2) The annual reforestation credit cost limitation shall be:

      (a) Equal to the average annual amount of estimated reforestation project costs determined under subsection (1) of this section for the calendar year beginning January 1, 1996.

      (b) Twice the average annual amount of estimated reforestation project costs determined under subsection (1) of this section for years beginning on or after January 1, 1997. [1995 c.746 §26]

 

      Note: 315.108 is repealed January 2, 2028. See section 9, chapter 883, Oregon Laws 2007.

 

      315.110 [Amended by 1953 c.665 §2; repealed by 1965 c.26 §6]

 

      315.111 Legislative declarations regarding riparian land conservation. The Legislative Assembly declares that the purpose of ORS 315.113 is to encourage taxpayers that have riparian land in farm production to voluntarily remove the riparian land from farm production and employ conservation practices applicable to the riparian land that minimize contributions to undesirable water quality, habitat degradation and stream bank erosion. [2001 c.912 §2]

 

      315.113 Voluntary removal of riparian land from farm production; rules. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Crop” means the total yearly production of an agricultural commodity, not including livestock, that is harvested from a specified area.

      (b) “Riparian land” means land in this state that:

      (A) Borders both a river, stream or other natural watercourse and land that is in farm production; and

      (B) Does not exceed a width of 35 feet between the land that is in farm production and the bank of the river, stream or other natural watercourse.

      (c) “Share-rent agreement” means an agreement in which the person who engages in farming operations and the person who owns the land where the farming operations are conducted share the crop grown on that land or the profits from that crop.

      (2) A taxpayer may claim a credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for 75 percent of the market value of crops forgone when riparian land is voluntarily taken out of farm production.

      (3) A credit under this section may be claimed only if:

      (a) The taxpayer owns the riparian land that is the basis of the credit;

      (b) The taxpayer is actively engaged in farming operations on land adjacent to the riparian land;

      (c) The riparian land was in farm production for the previous tax year or a credit under this section was claimed during the previous tax year;

      (d) The conservation practices employed on the riparian land are consistent with the agricultural water quality management plan administered by the State Department of Agriculture in the applicable river basin management area; and

      (e) The decision to remove the riparian land from farm production was a voluntary decision and not the result of a federal, state or local law or government decision requiring the riparian land to be taken out of farm production. For purposes of this paragraph, action taken by a taxpayer under an agricultural water quality management plan administered by the State Department of Agriculture is not the result of a government decision requiring the land to be taken out of farm production.

      (4)(a) The amount of the credit shall be calculated by multiplying the market value per acre of the forgone crop by the acreage of the riparian land that is not in farm production and multiplying that product by 75 percent.

      (b) For the first tax year for which a credit is claimed under this section, the forgone crop for which a value is determined under this section shall be the crop grown on the land in the previous tax year.

      (c) For a tax year following the first tax year for which a credit is claimed under this section, the forgone crop for which a value is determined under this section shall be the crop for which the value was determined for the previous tax year.

      (d) If a taxpayer does not claim a credit under this section for a tax year, any credit claimed in a subsequent tax year shall be treated as the first tax year for which a credit is claimed under this section.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section, if the riparian land that is the basis of a credit under this section is adjacent to land that is in farm production under a share-rent agreement, the taxpayer that is engaged in farming operations and the taxpayer that is the landowner may each claim a credit under this section. The amount of the credit shall be allocated to each taxpayer in the proportion that the share-rent agreement allocates crop proceeds to each of those taxpayers. The total amount of credit allowed to both taxpayers under this subsection may not exceed the amount of the credit otherwise allowable under this section if the farming operations were not subject to a share-rent agreement.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsections (3)(a) and (5) of this section, if the taxpayer is actively engaged in farming operations and pays the landowner in cash, the taxpayer may claim all of the credit available under this section.

      (7) The credit allowed in any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer.

      (8) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be used in any tax year thereafter.

      (9) In the case of a credit allowed under this section for purposes of ORS chapter 316:

      (a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as a resident. However, the credit shall be prorated using the proportion provided in ORS 316.117.

      (b) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085 or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayer’s taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085.

      (c) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117.

      (10) If a taxpayer that has claimed a credit under this section places the riparian land for which the credit is claimed back in farm production, the taxpayer may not claim a credit under this section for five tax years following the year the riparian land was placed back in farm production.

      (11) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules prescribing procedures for identifying forgone crops and for establishing the market value of forgone crops. [2001 c.912 §3; 2003 c.46 §32]

 

      Note: Section 6, chapter 913, Oregon Laws 2009, provides:

      Sec. 6. Except as provided in ORS 315.113 (8), a credit may not be claimed under ORS 315.113 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. [2009 c.913 §6]

 

      315.115 [Repealed by 1965 c.26 §6]

 

      315.117 Legislative findings and declarations regarding on-farm processing. The Legislative Assembly finds that farming and related agricultural activities make significant contributions to the economy of this state and that the contributions of family farms are important in maintaining the agricultural diversity upon which consistent economic performance is based. The Legislative Assembly further finds that changes in the marketplace and in the expectations of consumers of agricultural products have resulted in a need for greater vertical integration and on-farm processing of agricultural commodities. The Legislative Assembly declares that an income tax credit for property taxes paid on on-farm processing machinery and equipment encourages the continued operation and expansion of on-farm processing and results in a greater share of the value of agricultural products being retained by the farms in this state. The Legislative Assembly further declares that an incentive in the form of an income tax credit does not adversely impact the revenues of local governments in this state. [2001 c.725 §2]

 

      315.119 On-farm processing facilities. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Effective property tax rate” means:

      (A) The ratio of the total amount of property taxes imposed on the account that contains the machinery and equipment for which a credit is being claimed (after application of ORS 310.150 but prior to discount under ORS 311.505) over the assessed value of the property tax account; and

      (B) The ratio determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for the property tax year that begins in the income tax year for which the credit is claimed.

      (b) “Farm operator” means a person that operates a farming business as defined in section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (c) “Machinery and equipment” means machinery and equipment that meets the definition of section 1245 property in section 1245 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (d) “Processing”:

      (A) Means any activity that is directly related and necessary to clean, sort, grade, produce, prepare, manufacture, handle, package, store or ship a farm crop or livestock product after the point of harvest and before the point of sale, in a modified state or altered form.

      (B) Does not include an activity primarily associated with the promotion or retail sale of a product for personal or household use that is normally sold through consumer retail distribution.

      (e) “Qualified machinery and equipment” means machinery and equipment used in processing that meets the requirements of subsections (3) and (4) of this section for the tax year.

      (2) A taxpayer who is a farm operator may claim a credit against the taxes that are otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318 for ad valorem property taxes paid or incurred on qualified machinery and equipment.

      (3) A credit under this section may be claimed only if:

      (a) The machinery and equipment is owned by the farm operator or by a person who is related to the farm operator under section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code;

      (b) The machinery and equipment is used for processing primarily occurring on land described in subsection (4) of this section; and

      (c)(A) The farm operator has grown or raised at least one-half of the total volume of farm crop or livestock products processed with the machinery and equipment for which the credit is being claimed in three of the five previous income tax years; or

      (B)(i) The farm operator has grown or raised at least one-tenth of the total volume of farm crop or livestock products processed with the machinery and equipment for which the credit is being claimed in three of the five previous income tax years; and

      (ii) The farm operator has used the machinery and equipment to process at least one-half of the volume of the applicable farm crop or livestock products grown or raised by the farm operator in three of the five previous income tax years.

      (4) In addition to the requirements under subsection (3) of this section, a credit under this section may be claimed only if:

      (a) The machinery and equipment is located on land that is specially assessed for farm use under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 and the machinery and equipment is owned or otherwise controlled by the farm operator; or

      (b) The machinery and equipment is located on land that is contiguous to land that is specially assessed for farm use under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 and the machinery and equipment is owned or otherwise controlled by the farm operator.

      (5) A credit may be claimed under this section only for qualified machinery and equipment that was subject to assessment and property taxation for the property tax year beginning in the income tax year for which the credit is being claimed.

      (6) The amount of the credit shall be the lesser of:

      (a) The effective property tax rate multiplied by the adjusted basis of the qualified machinery and equipment; or

      (b) $30,000.

      (7) The adjusted basis of the qualified machinery and equipment shall be the adjusted basis of the qualified machinery and equipment for personal income or corporate excise or income tax purposes as of the last day of the income tax year for which the credit is being claimed, except that the adjusted basis shall be increased by the cost of any qualified machinery and equipment that the taxpayer elected to expense under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, until the qualified machinery and equipment is fully depreciated for personal income or corporate excise or income tax purposes. The adjusted basis shall reflect any depreciation allowable for the current tax year. A credit under this section may not be allowed for a tax year in which the qualified machinery and equipment is fully depreciated for personal income or corporate excise or income tax purposes.

      (8) The credit allowed under this section for any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer.

      (9) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter.

      (10) The credit allowed under this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for the tax year.

      (11) The taxpayer’s adjusted basis for determining gain or loss may not be further decreased by any amount of credit allowed under this section.

      (12) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit under this section in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117.

      (13) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed under this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117.

      (14) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayer’s taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed under this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085.

      315.208 Dependent care facilities. (1) A credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 (or, if the taxpayer is a corporation that is an employer, under ORS chapter 317 or 318) is allowed to an employer, based upon costs actually paid or incurred by the employer, to acquire, construct, reconstruct, renovate or otherwise improve real property so that the property may be used primarily as a dependent care facility.

      (2) The credit allowed under this section shall be the least of:

      (a) $2,500 multiplied by the number of full-time equivalent employees employed by the employer (on the property or within such proximity to the property that any dependents of the employees may be cared for in the facility) on any date within the two years immediately preceding the end of the first tax year for which credit is first claimed;

      (b) Fifty percent of the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, renovation or other improvement; or

      (c) $100,000.

      (3) To qualify for the credit allowed under subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) The amounts paid or incurred by the employer for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, renovation or other improvement to real property may be paid or incurred either:

      (A) To another to be used to acquire, construct, reconstruct, renovate or otherwise improve real property to the end that it may be used as a dependent care facility with which the employer contracts to make dependent care assistance payments which payments are wholly or partially entitled to exclusion from income of the employee for federal tax purposes under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code; or

      (B) To acquire, construct, reconstruct, renovate or otherwise improve real property to the end that it may be operated by the employer, or a combination of employers, to provide dependent care assistance to the employees of the employer under a program or programs under which the assistance is, under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code, wholly or partially excluded from the income of the employee.

      (b) The property must be in actual use as a dependent care facility on the last day of the tax year for which credit is claimed and dependent care services assisted by the employer must take place on the acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or improved property and must be entitled to an exclusion (whole or partial) from the income of the employee for federal tax purposes under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code on the last day of the tax year for which credit is claimed.

      (c) The person or persons operating the dependent care facility on the property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or improved must hold a certification (temporary or not) issued under ORS 329A.030 and 329A.250 to 329A.450 by the Office of Child Care to operate the facility on the property on the last day of the tax year of any tax year in which credit under this section is claimed.

      (d) The dependent care facility acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or otherwise improved must be located in Oregon. No credit shall be allowed under this section if the dependent care facility is not acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or improved to accommodate six or more children.

      (e) The employer must meet any other requirements or furnish any information, including information furnished by the employees or person operating the dependent care facility, to the Department of Revenue that the department requires under its rules to carry out the purposes of this section.

      (f) The dependent care facility, the costs of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, renovation or improvement upon which the credit granted under this section is based, must be placed in operation before January 1, 2002.

      (4) The total amount of the costs upon which the credit allowable under this section is based, and the total amount of the credit, shall be determined by the employer, subject to any rules adopted by the department, during the tax year in which the property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or otherwise improved is first placed in operation as a dependent care facility certified by the Office of Child Care under ORS 329A.030 and 329A.250 to 329A.450. One-tenth of the total credit is allowable in that tax year and one-tenth of the total credit is allowable in each succeeding tax year, not to exceed nine tax years, thereafter. No credit shall be allowed under this section for any tax year at the end of which the dependent care facility is not in actual operation under a current certification (temporary or not) issued by the Office of Child Care nor shall any credit be allowed for any tax year at the end of which the employer is not providing dependent care assistance entitled to exclusion (whole or partial) from employee income for federal tax purposes under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code for dependent care on the property. Any tax credit allowable under this section in a tax year may be carried forward in the same manner and to the same tax years as if it were a tax credit described in ORS 315.204.

      (5) Nothing in this section shall affect the computation of depreciation or basis of a dependent care facility. If a deduction is allowed for purposes of ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for the amounts paid or incurred upon which the credit under this section is based, the deduction shall be reduced by the dollar amount of the credit granted under this section.

      (6) For purposes of the credit allowed under this section:

      (a) The definitions and special rules contained in section 129(e) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply to the extent applicable.

      (b) “Employer” means a resident, part-year resident or full-year nonresident employer carrying on a business, trade, occupation or profession in this state.

      (7) The department shall require that evidence that the person operating the dependent care facility on the date that the taxpayer’s tax year ends holds a current certification (temporary or otherwise) to operate the facility accompany the tax return on which any amount of tax credit granted under this section is claimed, or that such evidence be separately furnished. If the evidence is not so furnished, no credit shall be allowed for the tax year for which the evidence is not furnished. The Office of Child Care shall cooperate by making such evidence, in an appropriate form, available to the person operating the facility, if the person is currently certified (temporary or not) so that, if necessary, it may be made available to the taxpayer.

(1) A credit against taxes imposed by ORS chapter 316 (or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318) for a pollution control facility or facilities certified under ORS 468.170 shall be allowed if the taxpayer qualifies under subsection (4) of this section.

      (2) For a facility certified under ORS 468.170, the maximum credit allowed in any one tax year shall be the lesser of the tax liability of the taxpayer or the applicable percentage of the certified cost of the facility, as determined under ORS 468.173 or 468.183, multiplied by the certified percentage allocable to pollution control, divided by the number of years of the facility’s useful life. The number of years of the facility’s useful life used in this calculation shall be the remaining number of years of useful life at the time the facility is certified but not less than one year nor more than 10 years.

      (3) To qualify for the credit the pollution control facility must be erected, constructed or installed in accordance with the provisions of ORS 468.165 (1) and must be certified for tax relief under ORS 468.155 to 468.190.

      (4) To qualify for a tax credit under this section:

      (a) The taxpayer who is allowed the credit must be:

      (A) The owner, including a contract purchaser, of the trade or business that utilizes Oregon property requiring a pollution control facility to prevent or minimize pollution;

      (B) A person who, as a lessee or pursuant to an agreement, conducts the trade or business that operates or utilizes such property; or

      (C) A person who, as an owner, including a contract purchaser, or lessee, owns or leases a pollution control facility that is used:

      (i) In a business that is engaged in a production activity described in 40 C.F.R. 430.20 (as of July 1, 1998); or

      (ii) For recycling, material recovery or energy recovery as defined in ORS 459.005; and

      (b) The facility must be owned or leased during the tax year by the taxpayer claiming the credit and must have been in use and operation during the tax year for which the credit is claimed.

      (5) Regardless of when the facility is erected, constructed or installed, a credit under this section may be claimed by a taxpayer:

      (a) For a facility qualifying under ORS 468.165 (1)(a) or (b), only in those tax years which begin on or after January 1, 1967.

      (b) For a facility qualifying under ORS 468.165 (1)(c), in those tax years which begin on or after January 1, 1973.

      (c) For a facility qualifying under ORS 468.165 (1)(d), in those tax years which begin on or after January 1, 1984.

      (6) For a facility certified under ORS 468.170, the maximum total credit allowable shall not exceed one-half of the certified cost of the facility multiplied by the certified percentage allocable to pollution control.

      (7) The credit provided by this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction for the facility to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for such year.

      (8) Upon any sale, exchange or other disposition of a facility, notice thereof shall be given to the Environmental Quality Commission who shall revoke the certification covering such facility as of the date of such disposition. Notwithstanding ORS 468.170 (4)(c), the transferee may apply for a new certificate under ORS 468.170, but the tax credit available to such transferee shall be limited to the amount of credit not claimed by the transferor. The sale, exchange or other disposition of shares in an S corporation as defined in section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code or of a partner’s interest in a partnership shall not be deemed a sale, exchange or other disposition of a facility for purposes of this subsection.

      (9) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section which is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. Credits may be carried forward to and used in a tax year beyond the years specified in ORS 468.170.

      (10) The taxpayer’s adjusted basis for determining gain or loss shall not be further decreased by any tax credits allowed under this section.

If more than one person has an interest under subsection (4)(a)(C) of this section in the facility, only one person may claim the credit allowed under this section. However, portions of the facility may be certified separately in the same manner as provided in ORS 468.170 (8) if ownership of the portions is in more than one person. The person claiming the credit as between an owner, including a contract purchaser, and lessee under this subsection shall be designated in a written statement signed by both the lessor and lessee of the facility. This statement shall be filed with the Department of Revenue not later than the final day of the first tax year for which a tax credit is claimed.

      (12)(a) A taxpayer may not be allowed a tax credit under this section for any tax year during which the taxpayer is convicted of a felony under ORS 468.922 to 468.956 that is related to the facility for which the tax credit would otherwise be claimed, or for the four tax years succeeding the tax year during which the taxpayer is convicted.

      (b) The amount of any tax credit that is otherwise allowable under this section but for paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be considered to be claimed by the taxpayer for purposes of determining the amount of tax credit that may be claimed in a tax year in which paragraph (a) of this subsection permits the taxpayer to claim the credit. [1993 c.730 §30 (enacted in lieu of 316.097 and 317.116); 1993 c.560 §110a; 1995 c.746 §1; 1997 c.99 §5; 1997 c.325 §39; 1999 c.1101 §1; 2001 c.928 §4]

If the facility is in use and operation during the tax year immediately following the fourth succeeding tax year, any credit under ORS 315.304 remaining unused may be carried forward to that fifth succeeding tax year. If the facility is in use and operation during the tax year immediately following the fifth succeeding tax year, any credit under ORS 315.304 remaining unused may be carried forward to that sixth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward to any tax year thereafter.

      (2) For purposes of this section, unexpired tax credits include credits claimed pursuant to ORS 315.304 (2) and credits carried over from previous tax years pursuant to ORS 315.304 (9). [2001 c.928 §3]

      (B) Maximize income and excise tax revenues that are retained by the State of Oregon for state operations; and

      (C) Provide the necessary financial incentives for taxpayers to make contributions, taking into consideration the impact of granting a credit upon a taxpayer’s federal income tax liability.

      (3) Contributions made under this section shall be deposited in the Renewable Energy Development Subaccount, established in ORS 470.805, of the Clean Energy Deployment Fund established in ORS 470.800.

      (4)(a) Upon receipt of a contribution, the State Department of Energy shall, except as provided in ORS 315.329, issue to the taxpayer written certification of the amount certified for tax credit under this section to the extent the amount certified for tax credit, when added to all amounts previously certified for tax credit under this section, does not exceed $1.5 million for the fiscal year in which certification is made.

      (b) The State Department of Energy and the Department of Revenue are not liable, and a refund of a contributed amount need not be made, if a taxpayer who has received tax credit certification is unable to use all or a portion of the tax credit to offset the tax liability of the taxpayer.

      (5) The tax credit allowed under this section for any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer.

      (6) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter.

      (7) If a tax credit is claimed under this section by a nonresident or part-year resident taxpayer, the amount shall be allowed without proration under ORS 316.117.

      (4) “Qualified active low-income community business” has the meaning given that term in section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code. “Qualified active low-income community business” does not include a business that derives or projects to derive 15 percent or more of its annual revenue from the rental or sale of real estate, unless the business is controlled by, or under common control with, another business that:

      (a) Does not derive or project to derive 15 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from the rental or sale of real estate; and

      (b) Is the primary tenant of real estate leased from the controlled business.

      (5) “Qualified community development entity” has the meaning given that term in section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code, provided that the entity has entered into, or is controlled by an entity that has entered into, an allocation agreement with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury with respect to credits authorized by section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code, and the State of Oregon is included within the service area set forth in the allocation agreement.

      (a) Is acquired at its original issuance solely in exchange for cash after July 1, 2012, unless it was a qualified equity investment in the hands of a prior holder; and

      (b) Has at least 85 percent of its cash purchase price used by the issuer to make qualified low-income community investments in qualified active low-income community businesses located in this state.

      (7) “Qualified low-income community investment” means any capital or equity investment in, or loan to, any qualified active low-income community business made after July 1, 2012. [2011 c.732 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 315.526.

 

      315.530 [Repealed by 1965 c.26 §6]

 

      315.533 Qualified equity investments. (1) As used in this section, “applicable percentage” means zero percent for each of the first two credit allowance dates, seven percent for the third credit allowance date and eight percent for the next four credit allowance dates.

      (2) A person that makes a qualified equity investment shall, at the time of investment, earn a vested credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the person is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318.

      (3)(a) The total amount of the tax credit available to a taxpayer under this section shall equal 39 percent of the purchase price of the qualified equity investment.

      (b) The taxpayer that holds a qualified equity investment on a particular credit allowance date of the qualified equity investment may claim a portion of the tax credit against its tax liability for the tax year that includes the credit allowance date equal to the applicable percentage for that credit allowance date multiplied by the purchase price of the qualified equity investment.

      (4) The credit allowed under this section may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer for the tax year in which the credit is claimed.

      (5) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be used in any tax year thereafter.

      (6) The following conditions must exist for a taxpayer to be eligible for the credit allowed under this section:

      (a) A qualified community development entity that issues a debt instrument may not make cash interest payments on the debt instrument during the period commencing with its issuance and ending on its final credit allowance date in excess of the sum of the cash interest payments and the cumulative operating income, as defined in the regulations promulgated under section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code, of the qualified community development entity for the same period. Neither this paragraph nor the definition of “long-term debt security” provided in ORS 315.529 in any way limits the holder’s ability to accelerate payments on the debt instrument in situations where the qualified community development entity has defaulted on covenants designed to ensure compliance with this section or section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (b) A business shall be considered a qualified active low-income community business for the duration of a qualified community development entity’s investment in or loan to the business, if it is reasonable to expect that at the time of the qualified community development entity’s investment in or loan to a qualified active low-income community business, the business will continue to satisfy the requirements for being a qualified active low-income community business throughout the entire period of the investment or loan.

      (c) A qualified equity investment must be designated by the issuer as a qualified equity investment and be certified by the Oregon Business Development Department as not exceeding the limitation in ORS 285C.653. The qualified community development entity must keep sufficiently detailed books and records with respect to the investments made with the proceeds of the qualified equity investments to allow the direct tracing of proceeds into qualified low-income community investments in qualified active low-income community businesses in this state.

      (d) The qualified community development entity shall report annually to the department:

      (A) The number of employment positions created and retained as a result of qualified low-income community investments by the qualified community development entity;

      (B) The average annual salary of positions described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and

      (C) The number of positions described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that provide health benefits.

      (e) The maximum amount of qualified low-income community investments that may be made in a qualified active low-income community business and all of its affiliates, with the proceeds of qualified equity investments that have been certified under ORS 285C.650, shall be $8 million, whether made by one or several qualified community development entities.

      (f) A qualified equity investment must be made before July 1, 2016. Nothing in this paragraph precludes an entity that makes a qualified equity investment prior to July 1, 2016, from claiming a tax credit relating to that qualified equity investment for each applicable credit allowance date.

      (7) A taxpayer claiming a credit under this section may not claim any other credit under this chapter or ORS chapter 285C during the same tax year based on activities related to the same qualified active low-income community business. [2011 c.732 §4; 2013 c.744 §1]

 

      315.535 [Repealed by 1965 c.26 §6]

 

      315.536 Transferability of credit. A tax credit allowed under ORS 315.533 may not be sold or transferred, with the exception that tax credits that a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation or other pass-through entity is entitled to claim may be allocated to the partners, members or shareholders of the entity for their direct use in accordance with the provisions of any agreement among the partners, members or shareholders.

A taxpayer who makes contributions to both types of account may claim the credit for the amounts listed in subsection (2) of this section for each type of account.

      (3)(a) The Department of Revenue shall annually adjust the maximum credit amounts allowable under this section according to the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. The department shall first make this adjustment for a joint return by multiplying the maximum credit amount in subsection (2) of this section by the percentage (if any) by which the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year exceeds the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31, 2018.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index” means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.

      (c) If any adjustment to the maximum credit amount for a joint return, as determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection, is not a multiple of $20, the adjustment shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $20. The department shall then adjust the maximum credit amount for all other types of returns so that it is half the maximum credit amount for a joint return.

      (4) A credit under this section is allowed for a preceding tax year for amounts contributed to a savings network account for higher education or to an ABLE account if the contribution is made before the taxpayer files a return or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the closing of the taxpayer’s tax year, whichever is earlier.

      (5) A credit is not allowed under this section for any amount that has been transferred into a savings network account for higher education from an individual development account, through a rollover, as provided in ORS 458.685 (4)(a)(A).

      (6) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as payment of tax under ORS 316.187 (withholding), ORS 316.583 (estimated tax), other tax prepayment amounts and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 and 316 for the tax year (reduced by any nonrefundable credits allowable for purposes of ORS chapter 316 for the tax year), the amount of the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer as provided in ORS 316.502.

      (7) The credit shall be claimed on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue that contains the information required by the department.

      (8) Spouses in a marriage who file separate returns for a taxable year may each claim a share of the tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return in proportion to the adjusted gross income of each.
