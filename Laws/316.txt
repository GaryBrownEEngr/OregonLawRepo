GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      316.002 Short title. This chapter may be cited as the Personal Income Tax Act of 1969. [1969 c.493 §1; 1995 c.79 §164]

 

      316.003 Goals. (1) The goals of the Legislative Assembly are to achieve for the people of this state a tax system that recognizes:

      (a) Fairness and equity as its basic values; and

      (b) That the total tax system should use seven guiding principles as measures by which to evaluate tax proposals.

      (2) Those guiding principles are:

      (a) Ability to pay;

      (b) Fairness;

      (c) Efficiency;

      (d) Even distribution;

      (e) The tax system should be equitable where the minimum aspects of a fair system are:

      (A) That it shields genuine subsistence income from taxation;

      (B) That it is not regressive; and

      (C) That it imposes approximately the same tax burden on all households earning the same income;

      (f) Adequacy; and

      (g) Flexibility.

      (3) To meet those goals of Oregon’s tax system, any tax must be considered in conjunction with the effects of all other taxes on Oregonians. [1991 c.457 §1a; 2017 c.315 §22]

 

      Note: 316.003 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 316 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      316.005 [1953 c.304 §1; repealed by 1969 c.493 §99]

 

      316.007 Policy. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly, by the adoption of this chapter, insofar as possible, to:

      (1) Make the Oregon personal income tax law identical in effect to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the measurement of taxable income of individuals, estates and trusts, modified as necessary by the state’s jurisdiction to tax and the revenue needs of the state;

      (2) Achieve this result by the application of the various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the definition of income, exceptions and exclusions therefrom, deductions (business and personal), accounting methods, taxation of trusts, estates and partnerships, basis, depreciation and other pertinent provisions relating to gross income as defined therein, modified as provided in this chapter, resulting in a final amount called “taxable income”; and

      (3) Impose a tax on residents of this state measured by taxable income wherever derived and to impose a tax on the income of nonresidents that is ascribable to sources within this state. [1969 c.493 §2; 1971 s.s. c.4 §1; 1987 c.293 §1; 1989 c.625 §1; 2003 c.46 §34]

 

      316.010 [1953 c.304 §2; 1953 c.552 §1; repealed by 1969 c.493 §99]

 

      316.012 Terms have same meaning as in federal laws; federal law references. Any term used in this chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes, unless a different meaning is clearly required or the term is specifically defined in this chapter. Except where the Legislative Assembly has provided otherwise, any reference in this chapter to the laws of the United States or to the Internal Revenue Code refers to the laws of the United States or to the Internal Revenue Code as they are amended and in effect:

      (1) On December 31, 2018; or

      (2) If related to the definition of taxable income, as applicable to the tax year of the taxpayer. [1969 c.493 §3; 1971 s.s. c.4 §2; 1975 c.672 §3; 1983 c.162 §59; 1985 c.802 §1; 1987 c.293 §2; 1989 c.625 §2; 1991 c.457 §1; 1993 c.726 §27; 1995 c.556 §1; 1997 c.839 §1; 1999 c.224 §7; 2001 c.660 §35; 2003 c.77 §14; 2005 c.519 §9; 2005 c.832 §27; 2007 c.614 §12; 2008 c.45 §13; 2009 c.5 §23; 2009 c.909 §§24,25; 2010 c.82 §§24,25; 2011 c.7 §23; 2012 c.31 §22; 2013 c.377 §22; 2014 c.52 §24; 2015 c.442 §16; 2016 c.33 §19; 2017 c.527 §20; 2018 c.101 §20; 2019 c.319 §20]

      316.028 Determination of net operating loss, carryback and carryforward. (1) In the computation of state taxable income the net operating loss, net operating loss carryback and net operating loss carryforward shall be the same as that contained in the Internal Revenue Code as it applies to the tax year for which the return is filed and shall not be adjusted for any changes or modifications contained in this chapter or by the case law of this state.

      (2) In the case of a nonresident, the net operating loss deduction, net operating loss carryback and net operating loss carryforward shall be that described in subsection (1) of this section which is attributable to Oregon sources.

      (3) If any provision in ORS 316.047 or 316.127 appears to require an adjustment to a net operating loss, net operating loss carryback or net operating loss carryforward contrary to the provisions of this section, that adjustment shall not be made. [Formerly 316.014]

      316.029 Disallowance of subtraction for amounts included in calculation of net operating loss. Notwithstanding ORS 316.739, a subtraction from federal taxable income is not allowed for amounts included in the calculation of an Oregon net operating loss under ORS 316.028. [2011 c.685 §2]

If, on account of this subsection, any adjustment is required to an Oregon return that would otherwise be prevented by operation of law or rule, the adjustment shall be made, notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, in the manner provided under ORS 314.135.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “Act or Title” includes any subtitle, division or other part of an Act or Title. [1969 c.493 §10; 1985 c.802 §1a; 1987 c.293 §5; 1997 c.839 §3]

______________________________________________________________________________

      (b) For tax years beginning in each calendar year, the Department of Revenue shall adopt a table that shall apply in lieu of the table contained in paragraph (a) of this subsection, as follows:

      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each bracket for which a tax is imposed shall be increased by the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year.

      (B) The rate applicable to any rate bracket as adjusted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may not be changed.

      (C) The amounts setting forth the tax, to the extent necessary to reflect the adjustments in the rate brackets, shall be adjusted.

      (D) The rate brackets applicable to taxable income in excess of $125,000 may not be adjusted.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection, the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year exceeds the monthly averaged index for the second quarter of the calendar year 1992.

      (d) As used in this subsection, “U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index” means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.

      (e) If any increase determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection is not a multiple of $50, the increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $50.

      (2) A tax is imposed for each taxable year upon the entire taxable income of every part-year resident of this state. The amount of the tax shall be computed under subsection (1) of this section as if the part-year resident were a full-year resident and shall be multiplied by the ratio provided under ORS 316.117 to determine the tax on income derived from sources within this state.

      (3) A tax is imposed for each taxable year on the taxable income of every full-year nonresident that is derived from sources within this state. The amount of the tax shall be determined in accordance with the table set forth in subsection (1) of this section.

      316.042 Amount of tax where joint return used. In the case of a joint return of spouses in a marriage, pursuant to ORS 316.122 or pursuant to ORS 316.367, the tax imposed by ORS 316.037 shall be twice the tax which would be imposed if the taxable income were cut in half. For purposes of this section, a return of a head of household or a surviving spouse, as defined in subsections (a) and (b) of section 2 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be treated as a joint return of spouses in a marriage. [1969 c.493 §12; 1975 c.674 §2; 1987 c.293 §7; 1987 c.647 §10; 2015 c.629 §40]

 

      316.043 Tax rates allowed for certain qualifying income; conditions; election. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Material participation” has the meaning given that term in section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (b) “Nonpassive income” means income other than income from passive activity as determined under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code. “Nonpassive income” does not include wages, interest, dividends or capital gains.

      (c) “Nonpassive loss” means loss other than loss from passive activity as determined under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (d) “Qualifying income” means a taxpayer’s net income that meets the conditions of subsection (6) of this section, as reported on the taxpayer’s return, and that is computed by taking the sum of the taxpayer’s:

      (A) Nonpassive income after reduction for nonpassive losses; and

      (B) Business income or loss as a sole proprietor.

      (2) If a taxpayer that meets the conditions of subsection (6) of this section has nonpassive income attributable to any partnership or S corporation after reduction for nonpassive losses or does business as a sole proprietorship, that portion of the taxpayer’s income that is qualifying income shall be taxed at:

      (a) The rate applicable under ORS 316.037; or

      (b) At the election of the taxpayer, a rate of:

      (A) Seven percent of the first $250,000 of taxable income, or fraction thereof;

      (B) Seven and two-tenths percent of taxable income exceeding $250,000 but not exceeding $500,000;

      (4) A taxpayer shall use the subtractions, deductions or additions otherwise allowed under this chapter in the calculation of income that is taxed at the rates otherwise applicable under ORS 316.037. The only addition or subtraction allowed in the calculation of qualifying income for which the taxpayer uses the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be any depreciation adjustment directly related to the partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship.

      (5) The election under subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be irrevocable and shall be made on the taxpayer’s original return. If the taxpayer uses the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section, the calculation of income shall be substantiated on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue and filed with the taxpayer’s tax return for the tax year or at such other time and manner as the department may prescribe by rule. A taxpayer who uses the reduced rates available under subsection (2)(b) of this section may not join in the filing of a composite return under ORS 314.778.

      (6) The rates listed in subsection (2)(b) of this section apply to income attributable to a partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship only if:

      (a) The taxpayer materially participates in the trade or business;

      (b) The partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship employs at least one person who is not an owner, member or limited partner of the partnership or S corporation or who is not the sole proprietor; and

In determining whether this requirement is met, only hours worked in a week in which a worker works at least 30 hours may be considered.

      (7)(a) A nonresident may apply the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section only to income earned in Oregon.

      (b) A part-year resident shall calculate the tax due using the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section by first applying those rates to the taxpayer’s qualifying income, and then multiplying that amount by the ratio of the taxpayer’s income in Oregon divided by income from all sources.

      316.044 Estimates by Legislative Revenue Officer; reports; adjustment of rates. (1)(a) As soon as practicable, the Legislative Revenue Officer, after consultation with the Department of Revenue, shall prepare estimates of projected use by taxpayers of the reduced rates provided in ORS 316.043 (2). The estimates shall include the projected use of the reduced rates in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and before January 1, 2017, and in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and before January 1, 2021. The estimates shall express as a ratio the revenue loss anticipated as a result of the reduced rates of taxation in ORS 316.043 (2), divided by projected total income in this state, for those tax years.

      (b) Not later than July 1, 2018, the Legislative Revenue Officer shall report to an interim committee of the Legislative Assembly related to revenue regarding the use of the reduced rates provided in ORS 316.043 (2). The report shall express as a ratio, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and before January 1, 2017, the actual revenue loss resulting from the allowance of reduced rates of taxation provided in ORS 316.043 (2) divided by actual total income in this state for those tax years. If the ratio exceeds the ratio calculated under paragraph (a) of this subsection by more than 15 percent, the rates listed in ORS 316.043 (2) shall be proportionately adjusted to achieve a ratio of approximately 105 percent of the ratio calculated in subsection (1)(a) of this section for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and before January 1, 2017, but may in no event exceed 9.9 percent of taxable income or be reduced to less than the original rate provided in ORS 316.043 (2).

      (c) The adjusted rates provided under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

      (2)(a) Not later than July 1, 2022, the Legislative Revenue Officer shall report to an interim committee of the Legislative Assembly related to revenue regarding the use of the reduced rates provided in ORS 316.043 (2). The report shall express as a ratio, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and before January 1, 2021, the actual revenue loss resulting from the allowance of reduced rates of taxation provided in ORS 316.043 (2) divided by actual total income in this state for those tax years. If the ratio exceeds the ratio included in the estimate required under subsection (1)(a) of this section for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and before January 1, 2021, by more than 25 percent, the rates listed in ORS 316.043 (2) shall be proportionately adjusted to achieve a ratio of approximately 115 percent of the ratio calculated in subsection (1)(a) of this section for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and before January 1, 2021. If the ratio is less than 75 percent of the ratio included in the estimate required under subsection (1)(a) of this section for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and before January 1, 2021, the rates listed in ORS 316.043 (2) shall be proportionately adjusted to achieve a ratio of approximately 85 percent of the ratio calculated in subsection (1)(a) of this section for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and before January 1, 2021. The adjusted rates under this subsection may in no event exceed 9.9 percent of taxable income or be reduced to lower than the original rate provided in ORS 316.043 (2).

      (b) The adjusted rates provided under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. [2013 s.s. c.5 §13]

 

      316.045 Tax rate imposed on certain long-term capital gain from farming; requirements. (1) As used in this section:

      (B) Feeding, breeding, managing or selling livestock, poultry, fur-bearing animals or honeybees or the produce thereof;

      (C) Dairying and selling dairy products;

      (D) Stabling or training equines, including but not limited to providing riding lessons, training clinics and schooling shows;

      (E) Propagating, cultivating, maintaining or harvesting aquatic species and bird and animal species to the extent allowed by the rules adopted by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission;

      (F) On-site constructing and maintaining equipment and facilities used for the activities described in this subsection;

      (G) Preparing, storing or disposing of, by marketing or otherwise, the products or by-products raised for human or animal use on land employed in activities described in this subsection; or

      (H) Any other agricultural or horticultural activity or animal husbandry, or any combination of these activities, except that “farming” does not include growing and harvesting trees of a marketable species other than growing and harvesting cultured Christmas trees or certain hardwood timber described in ORS 321.267 (3) or 321.824 (3).

      (b) “Section 1231 gain” has the meaning given that term in section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 316.037, taxable income that consists of net long-term capital gain shall be subject to tax under this chapter at a rate of five percent if all of the following conditions apply:

      (a) The gain is:

      (A) Derived from the sale or exchange of capital assets consisting of ownership interests in a corporation, partnership or other entity in which, prior to the sale or exchange, the taxpayer owned at least a 10 percent ownership interest; or

      (B) Section 1231 gain.

      (b) The property that was sold or exchanged consisted of:

      (A) Ownership interests in a corporation, partnership or other entity that is engaged in the trade or business of farming; or

      (c) The sale or exchange is to a person who is not related to the taxpayer under section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (d) The sale or exchange constitutes a substantially complete termination of all of the taxpayer’s ownership interests in a trade or business that is engaged in farming or a substantially complete termination of all of the taxpayer’s ownership interests in property that is employed in the trade or business of farming. Ownership of a farm dwelling or farm homesite does not constitute ownership of property employed in the trade or business of farming.

      (3) If the taxpayer has net long-term capital gain derived in part from the sale or exchange of property described in subsection (2)(b) of this section and in part from the sale or exchange of all other property, the net long-term capital gain that is subject to tax under this section shall be determined as follows:

      (a) Compute the net long-term capital gain derived from all property described in subsection (2)(b) of this section that was sold or exchanged during the tax year.

      (b) Compute the net capital gain or loss from the sale or exchange of all other property during the tax year.

      (c) If the amount determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection is a net capital gain, the gain that is subject to tax under subsection (2) of this section shall be the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (d) If the amount determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection is a net capital loss, the gain that is subject to tax under subsection (2) of this section shall be the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection minus the amount determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      316.047 Transitional provision to prevent doubling income or deductions. If any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or of this chapter requires that any amount be added to or deducted from federal gross income or the net income taxable under this chapter that previously had been added to or deducted from net income taxable under the Oregon law in effect prior to the taxpayer’s taxable year as to which this chapter is first effective, then, in such event, appropriate adjustment shall be made to the net income for the year or years subject to this chapter so as to prohibit the double taxation or the double deduction of any such amount that previously had entered into the computation of taxable income. Differences such as the difference in basis of property used by the taxpayer for federal and Oregon income tax returns and on account of the treatment of operating losses shall be resolved by application of this principle. However, the Department of Revenue, in its audit of a return, shall not apply any adjustment under this section which, in its opinion, if applied would result in an increase or decrease of tax liability of less than $25. [1969 c.493 §13; 1987 c.293 §8]

 

      316.048 Taxable income of resident.

      (2) The credit provided under this section shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this chapter that the amount of the modified adjusted gross income of the taxpayer derived from sources in the other state bears to the entire modified adjusted gross income of the taxpayer.

      (B) Permits a deduction for the cost of goods sold and the cost of services rendered. [1969 c.493 §17; 1981 c.801 §3; 1987 c.647 §11; 1991 c.838 §6; 1993 c.726 §28a; 1995 c.54 §7; 1999 c.74 §5; 2001 c.9 §1]

      (b) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayer’s taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085.

[1969 c.493 §24; 1971 c.690 §1; 1973 c.229 §1; 1977 c.604 §1; 1981 c.705 §3; 1985 c.87 §3; 1989 c.762 §2; 1997 c.839 §15; 1999 c.21 §42; 1999 c.90 §13; 1999 c.580 §9; 2001 c.660 §40; 2003 c.77 §16; 2003 c.704 §6; 2005 c.533 §7; 2019 c.134 §1]

 

      316.164 When surety bond or letter of credit required of employer; enforcement. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, if the Department of Revenue makes the findings required under subsection (2) of this section, the department may require any employer subject to ORS 316.162 to 316.221, except the state or its political subdivisions, to post a surety bond, or irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, with the department, to secure future payment of amounts required to be withheld and paid over to the department under ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550. The bond or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to the amounts required to be withheld upon the wages paid or estimated to be paid by the employer for a period of four calendar quarters. The bond or letter of credit shall be in a form acceptable to the department. Posting of the bond or letter of credit shall not relieve the employer from withholding and paying over amounts based on wages paid by the employer under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550. The department may, in its discretion, at any time apply such bond or letter of credit or part thereof to the delinquencies or indebtedness of the employer arising under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550 and accruing after the date the bond or letter of credit was posted. Appeal of an action of the department under this section shall not relieve an employer of the requirement during the pendency of the appeal.

      (2) Before requiring an employer to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall determine that the employer has failed to make payment to the department of amounts required to be withheld and paid over under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550 for at least three calendar quarters, and the total amount of delinquent payments exceeds $2,500, exclusive of interest or penalties. For purposes of this subsection, a payment shall not be considered delinquent if the employer’s liability to withhold is subject to appeal to the tax court.

      (3) The department shall not require a bond or irrevocable letter of credit to be posted under this section if the employer elects to notify the department of the times of payment of wages to the employees of the employer, and, notwithstanding ORS 316.197, to pay over amounts withheld within three banking days after the dates the wages were paid.

      (4) Before requiring an employer to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit or make payment of amounts required to be withheld in the manner prescribed in subsection (3) of this section, the department shall attempt to obtain payment of delinquent amounts through other methods of collection, however, the department is not required to seize or sell real or personal property in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection.

      (5) Any bond or irrevocable letter of credit required under subsection (1) of this section shall become the sole property of the department and shall be held by the department to guarantee payment of withholding taxes by the employer. The bond or letter of credit shall be held for the benefit of the State of Oregon, subject only to the provisions of subsection (6) of this section. The bond or letter of credit shall be prior to all other liens, claims or encumbrances and shall be exempt from any process, attachment, garnishment or execution.

      (6) If an employer ceases to be an employer subject to ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550, the department shall, upon receipt of all payments due from the employer for withheld amounts, cancel any bond or irrevocable letter of credit given under this section. Such bonds or letters of credit held for the benefit of the State of Oregon shall first be applied to any indebtedness or deficiencies due from the employer under ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550 and accruing after the date the bond or letter of credit was posted before any return is made to the employer. The employer shall have no interest in such bond or letter of credit prior to full compliance with this section and all provisions of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550.

      (7) If an employer required to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit or make payment of amounts withheld in the manner prescribed under this section makes full payment of all delinquent amounts due and owing at the time the bond, letter of credit or accelerated payment schedule was required and makes payment of amounts due under ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550 and files returns required in connection with those payments in a timely manner for the succeeding four calendar quarters, the department shall release the employer from the requirement to post the bond or letter of credit or make accelerated payments of amounts withheld.

      (8) If any employer fails to comply with subsections (1) to (7) of this section, the Oregon Tax Court, upon commencement of an action by the department for that purpose, may order the employer to post the required bond or irrevocable letter of credit or make accelerated payments of amounts withheld. The employer’s failure to obey an order of the court is punishable by contempt. If the Oregon Tax Court determines that an order of compliance enforceable by contempt proceedings will not assure the payment of withheld taxes by the employer, the court may enjoin the employer from further employing individuals in this state or continuing in business therein until the employer has complied with subsections (1) to (7) of this section.

      (2) If a lender, surety or other person who supplies funds to or for the account of an employer for the purpose of paying wages of the employees of the employer has actual notice or knowledge that the employer does not intend to or will not be able to make timely payment or deposit of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, the lender, surety or other person shall be liable to the State of Oregon in a sum equal to the taxes together with interest which are not timely paid over to the department.

The provisions of this subsection shall not relieve any employer from liability for a late payment penalty under any other provision of law. [1969 c.493 §31; 1975 c.594 §1; 1982 s.s.1 c.1 §2; 1983 c.697 §1; 1985 c.87 §4; 1989 c.901 §7; 2017 c.750 §122e]

The employer is charged with the duty of advising the employee of the amount of moneys withheld, in accordance with any regulations as the department may prescribe, using printed forms furnished or approved by the department for this purpose.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, every employer shall submit a combined quarterly return to the department on a form provided by it showing the number of payments made and the withheld taxes paid during the quarter.

Failure to file the annual report without reasonable excuse on or before the 30th day after notice has been given to the employer of failure subjects the employer to a penalty of $100. The department may by rule require additional information the department finds necessary to substantiate the annual return, including but not limited to copies of federal form W-2 for individual employees, and may prescribe circumstances under which the filing requirement imposed by this subsection is waived.

      (4) The employer shall indicate on the return required by subsection (3) of this section whether the employer offers a qualified retirement plan, as listed in ORS 178.215 (8), that would allow the employer to obtain an exemption from offering employees enrollment in the retirement plan developed under ORS 178.205. The department shall provide a means on the return by which the employer may make this indication.

      (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, employers of agricultural employees may submit returns annually showing the number of payments made and the withheld taxes paid.

      (b) A person who knowingly fails to substantiate a report required under subsection (3) of this section, or who knowingly files incomplete or incorrect substantiation, shall be subject to a penalty of $250 per federal form W-2 after the date on which the substantiation is due, up to a maximum penalty of $25,000.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding the election of a nonresident employer to employ the alternate method established by the department under this section, a qualifying nonresident employee may elect to report and pay Oregon personal income tax on income earned by the employee in connection with the employee’s performance of temporary services in this state in the same manner as any other nonresident.

      (b) If a nonresident employer does not make the election permitted under subsection (3) of this section, the qualifying nonresident employees of the employer shall report and pay Oregon personal income tax on income earned in connection with their performance of temporary services within this state in the same manner as any other nonresident.

      (5) The department may adopt any rules it considers necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. [Formerly 316.216]

(Resident Estates and Trusts)

 

      316.282 Definitions related to trusts and estates; rules. (1) As used in this chapter:

      (a) “Qualified funeral trust” has the meaning given that term in section 685 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (b) “Resident estate” means an estate of which the fiduciary is appointed by an Oregon court or the administration of which is carried on in Oregon.

      (c) “Resident funeral trust” means a qualified funeral trust that, at the time of the initial funding of the trust:

      (A) Is required to be established under the laws of this state; or

      (B) Is established by a contract, the terms of which state that a service or merchandise is to be provided by a funeral home or cemetery located in this state.

      (d) “Resident trust” means a trust, other than a qualified funeral trust, of which the fiduciary is a resident of Oregon or the administration of which is carried on in Oregon. In the case of a fiduciary that is a corporate fiduciary engaged in interstate trust administration, the residence and place of administration of a trust both refer to the place where the majority of fiduciary decisions are made in administering the trust.

      (2) The taxable income of a resident estate, resident trust or resident funeral trust is its federal taxable income modified by the addition or subtraction, as the case may be, of its share of the fiduciary adjustment determined under ORS 316.287.

      (3) The Department of Revenue shall adopt rules defining “trust administration” for purposes of subsection (1)(d) of this section that include within the definition activities related to fiduciary decision making and that exclude from the definition activities related to incidental execution of fiduciary decisions.

      (4) The department shall adopt rules providing for simplified reporting of resident funeral trusts having a single trustee and of resident funeral trusts that are terminated during the tax year. [1969 c.493 §§42,43; 1997 c.100 §7; 1997 c.325 §42; 2003 c.50 §1]

      316.287 “Fiduciary adjustment” defined; shares proportioned; rules. (1) The “fiduciary adjustment” is the net amount of the modifications to federal taxable income described in this chapter (ORS 316.697 being applicable if the estate or trust is a beneficiary of another estate or trust) that relates to its items of income or deduction of an estate or trust.

      (2) The respective shares of an estate or trust and its beneficiaries (including, solely for the purpose of this allocation, nonresident beneficiaries) in the fiduciary adjustment shall be in proportion to their respective shares of federal distributable net income of the estate or trust. If the estate or trust has no federal distributable net income for the taxable year, the share of each beneficiary in the fiduciary adjustment shall be in proportion to the share of the estate or trust income of the beneficiary for such year, under state law or the terms of the instrument, that is required to be distributed currently and any other amounts of such income distributed in such year. Any balance of the fiduciary adjustment shall be allocated to the estate or trust.

      (3) The Department of Revenue may by rule authorize the use of such other methods of determining to whom the items comprising the fiduciary adjustment shall be attributed, as may be appropriate and equitable, on such terms and conditions as the department may require.

      316.292 Credit for taxes paid another state. (1) For purposes of this section, an estate or trust is considered a resident of the state which taxes the income of the estate or trust irrespective of whether the income is derived from sources within that state.

      (2) Notwithstanding the limitations contained in ORS 316.082 and 316.131, if an estate or trust is a resident of this state and also a resident of another state, the estate or trust shall be allowed a credit against the taxes imposed under this chapter for income taxes imposed by and paid to the other state, subject to the following conditions:

      (a) Credit shall be allowed only for the proportion of the taxes paid to the other state as the income taxable under this chapter and also subject to tax in the other state bears to the entire income upon which the taxes paid to the other state are imposed.

      (b) The credit shall not exceed the proportion of the tax payable under this chapter as the income subject to tax in the other state and also taxable under this chapter bears to the entire income taxable under this chapter. [1969 c.493 §45; 1985 c.802 §10; 1991 c.838 §7]

      316.298 Accumulation distribution credit. (1) A resident beneficiary of a trust whose adjusted gross income includes all or part of an accumulation distribution by such trust, as defined in section 665 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due under this chapter for all or a proportionate part of any tax, paid by the trust under this chapter for any preceding taxable year, that would not have been payable if the trust had in fact made distribution to its beneficiaries at the times and in the amounts specified in section 666 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (2) The credit under this section shall not reduce the tax otherwise due from the beneficiary under this chapter to an amount less than would have been due if the accumulation distribution or part thereof were excluded from the adjusted gross income of the beneficiary. [1969 c.493 §46; 1997 c.839 §18; 1999 c.90 §14; 2001 c.660 §43]

      (1) Items of income, gain, loss and deduction mean those derived from or connected with sources in this state.

      (2) Items of income, gain, loss and deduction entering into the definition of federal distributable net income include such items from another estate or trust of which the first estate or trust is a beneficiary.

      (3) The source of items of income, gain, loss or deduction shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Department of Revenue in accordance with the general rules in ORS 316.127 as if the estate or trust were a nonresident individual.

      (4) The income of a nonresident estate or trust consists of:

      (a) Its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction that enter into the federal definition of distributable net income;

      (b) Increased or reduced by the amount of any items of income, gain, loss or deduction that are recognized for federal income tax purposes but excluded from the federal definition of distributable net income of the estate or trust;

      (a) To the amount of items of income, gain, loss and deduction that enter into the definition of distributable net income there shall be added or subtracted, as the case may be, the modifications to federal taxable income described in this chapter to the extent they relate to items of income, gain, loss and deduction that also enter into the definition of distributable net income. No modification shall be made under this section that has the effect of duplicating an item already reflected in the definition of distributable net income.

      (b) The amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be allocated among the estate or trust and its beneficiaries (including, solely for the purpose of this allocation, resident beneficiaries) in proportion to their respective shares of federal distributable net income. The amounts so allocated have the same character as for federal income tax purposes. If an item entering into the computation of such amounts is not characterized for federal income tax purposes, it has the same character as if realized directly from the source from which realized by the estate or trust, or incurred in the same manner as incurred by the estate or trust.

      (c) If the estate or trust has no federal distributable net income for the taxable year, the share of each beneficiary in the net amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be in proportion to the beneficiary’s share of the estate or trust income for such year, under state law or the terms of the instrument, that is required to be distributed currently and any other amounts of such income distributed in such year. Any balance of such net amount shall be allocated to the estate or trust.

      (2) The Department of Revenue may by regulation establish such other method or methods of determining the respective shares of the beneficiaries and of the estate or trust in its income derived from sources in this state, and in the modifications related thereto, as may be appropriate and equitable.

      316.367 Joint return by spouses in a marriage. Spouses in a marriage may make a joint return with respect to the tax imposed by this chapter even though one of the spouses has neither gross income nor deductions, except that:

      (1) No joint return shall be made under this chapter if the spouses are not permitted to file a joint federal income tax return;

      (2) If the federal income tax liability of either spouse is determined on a separate federal return, their income tax liabilities under this chapter shall be determined on separate returns;

      (3) If the federal income tax liabilities of the spouses are determined on a joint federal return, they shall file a joint return under this chapter and their tax liabilities shall be joint and several; and

      (4) If neither spouse is required to file a federal income tax return and either or both are required to file an income tax return under this chapter, they may elect to file separate or joint returns and pursuant to such election their liabilities shall be separate or joint and several. [1969 c.493 §55; 1985 c.802 §9; 2015 c.629 §43]

 

      316.368 When joint return liability divided; showing of marital status and hardship; rules. Notwithstanding ORS 316.367, upon petition to the Director of the Department of Revenue by one spouse who has filed a joint tax return, the Department of Revenue may terminate the joint and several liability of each spouse and divide the liability equally between both spouses for the tax, penalty and interest due for the tax year that is the subject of the joint return. No petition shall be granted unless at the time of the petition, the spouses are living apart and are legally separated or divorced, and the petitioner satisfies the department that the petitioner is unable to pay the entire liability due to financial hardship. The department shall adopt rules establishing the manner in which a petitioner shall show financial hardship. [1993 c.593 §8]

 

      316.369 Circumstances where one spouse relieved of joint return liability; rules. If a joint return has been made under this chapter for a tax year, a spouse shall be relieved of liability for tax, including interest, penalties and other amounts, for the tax year:

      (1) If the Internal Revenue Service has made a determination that relieved the spouse of liability for federal taxes for the same tax year under Internal Revenue Code provisions that provide for spouse relief from liability; or

      (2) If the Internal Revenue Service has not made a determination that relieved the spouse of liability for the tax year, but the spouse qualifies to be relieved of state tax liability under rules adopted by the Department of Revenue. In adopting rules under this subsection, the department shall consider the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations issued thereunder that provide for spouse relief from liability for federal taxes.

      316.372 Minor to file return; unpaid tax assessable against parent; when parent may file for minor. (1) As used in this section, “parent” includes an individual who is entitled to the services of a minor by reason of having parental rights and duties with respect to the minor.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a minor shall file a return and include on the return all items of the minor’s income, including income attributable to personal services. Income included on the minor’s return shall not be included on the return of the parent. All expenditures by the parent or the minor attributable to the minor’s income are considered to have been paid or incurred by the minor. However, any tax assessed against the minor that is attributable to income from personal services and that is not paid by the minor is for all purposes considered to be properly assessed against the parent.

      (3) If a parent is eligible to elect and elects to include the interest and dividend income of a child on the parent’s federal income tax return under section 1(g)(7)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, the parent shall be considered to have elected to include the interest and dividend income of the child on the return filed by the parent for the same taxable period for purposes of this chapter. The child need not in such case file a return for purposes of this chapter for the taxable period to which the election applies. [1969 c.493 §56; 1989 c.625 §13a; 1991 c.457 §7a; 2015 c.480 §11]

      316.377 Individual under disability. An income tax return for an individual who is unable to make a return by reason of minority or other disability shall be made and filed by a duly authorized agent of the individual, guardian, conservator, fiduciary or other person charged with the care of the person or property of the individual other than a receiver in possession of only a part of the individual’s property.

      316.382 Returns by fiduciaries. (1) An income tax return, in the name of the decedent, for any deceased individual shall be made and filed by a personal representative or other person charged with the care of the property, and this duty extends to any unfiled return prior to decedent’s death. The tax shall be levied upon and collected from the estate. A final return of a decedent shall be due when it would have been due if the decedent had not died.

      (2) The income tax return of an estate or trust shall be made and filed by the fiduciary thereof, whether the income is taxable to the estate or trust or to the beneficiaries thereof. If two or more fiduciaries are acting jointly, the return may be made by any one of them. [1969 c.493 §58; 1975 c.705 §9]

      316.387 Election for final tax determination by personal representative; period for assessment of deficiency; discharge of personal representative from personal liability for tax. (1) In the case of any tax for which a return is required under this chapter from a decedent or a decedent’s estate during the period of administration, the Department of Revenue may give notice of deficiency as described in ORS 305.265 within 18 months after a written election for a final tax determination is made by the personal representative, administrator, trustee or other fiduciary representing the estate of the decedent. This election must be filed after the return is made and filed in the form and manner as may be prescribed by the department by rule.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, if the department finds that gross income equal to 25 percent or more of the gross income reported has been omitted from the taxpayer’s return, notice of the deficiency may be given at any time within five years after the return was filed.

      (3) The limitations to the giving of a notice of deficiency provided in this section shall not apply to a deficiency resulting from false or fraudulent returns, or in cases where no return has been filed. If the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or other authorized official of the federal government makes a correction resulting in a change of the decedent’s or the estate of the decedent’s tax for state income tax purposes, then notice of a deficiency under any law imposing tax upon or measured by income for the corresponding tax year may be mailed within one year after the department is notified by the fiduciary or the commissioner of such federal correction, or within the applicable 18-month or five-year period prescribed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, respectively, whichever period later expires.

      (4) After filing the decedent’s return, the personal representative, administrator, trustee or other fiduciary may apply in writing for discharge from personal liability for tax on the decedent’s income. After paying any tax for which the personal representative, administrator, trustee or other fiduciary is subsequently notified, or after expiration of nine months since receipt of the application and during which no notification of tax liability is made, the discharge becomes effective. A discharge under this subsection does not discharge the personal representative, administrator, trustee or other fiduciary from liability to the extent that assets of the decedent’s estate are still in the possession or control of the personal representative, administrator, trustee or other fiduciary. The failure of a personal representative to make application and otherwise proceed under this subsection shall not affect the protection available to the personal representative under ORS 116.123 and 116.213.

      (5) For the purpose of facilitating the settlement and distribution of estates held by fiduciaries, the department, on behalf of the state, may agree upon the amount of taxes at any time due or to become due from such fiduciaries under this chapter or transferees of an estate as provided in ORS 314.310 with respect to a tax return or returns of or for a decedent individual or an estate or trust, and payment in accordance with such agreement shall be in full satisfaction of the taxes to which the agreement relates.

The last day prescribed by law for filing the return or paying the tax shall be determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer by the Department of Revenue.

      (ii) A married individual entitled under ORS 316.567 to file a joint declaration with a spouse, but only if the spouse has not received wages, as defined in ORS 316.162 (2) for the taxable year; or

      (B) $10,000 in the case of a married individual entitled under ORS 316.567 to file a joint declaration with a spouse, but only if each spouse has received wages as defined in ORS 316.162 (2) for the taxable year; or

      (a) Treat the estimated tax for the year as the estimated tax of either spouse; or

      (b) Divide the estimated tax between them.

      (4) If the spouses fail to agree, or fail to notify the department of the manner in which they agree, to the treatment of estimated tax for a taxable year for which they make a joint declaration but not a joint return, the payments shall be allocated between them according to rules adopted by the department. Notwithstanding ORS 314.835, 314.840 or 314.991, the department may disclose to either spouse the information upon which an allocation of estimated tax was made under this section.

[1980 c.7 §12]

 

      316.575 [1953 c.304 §69; 1955 c.595 §1; repealed by 1957 c.586 §19]

 

      316.577 Date of filing declaration. Except as provided in ORS 316.573, declarations of estimated tax required by ORS 316.563 (1) from individuals who are neither farmers nor fishermen for the purpose of that section shall be filed on or before April 15 of the taxable year, except that if the requirements of ORS 316.563 (1) are first met:

      (1) After April 1 and before June 2 of the taxable year, the declaration shall be filed on or before June 15 of the taxable year;

      (2) After June 1 and before September 2 of the taxable year, the declaration shall be filed on or before September 15 of the taxable year; or

      (3) After September 1 of the taxable year, the declaration shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year. [1980 c.7 §11; 1981 c.678 §2; 1983 c.162 §64; 2003 c.46 §41]

      (2) If the declaration is filed on or before April 15 of the taxable year, the estimated tax shall be paid in four equal installments. The first installment shall be paid at the time of the filing of the declaration, the second and third on June 15 and September 15 of the taxable year, and the fourth on January 15 of the succeeding year.

      (3) If the declaration is filed after April 15 and not after June 15 of the taxable year, and is not required by ORS 316.577 to be filed on or before April 15 of the taxable year, the estimated tax shall be paid in three equal installments. The first installment shall be paid at the time of the filing of the declaration, the second on September 15 of the calendar year, and the third on January 15 of the succeeding taxable year.

      (4) If the declaration is filed after June 15 and not after September 15 of the taxable year, and is not required by ORS 316.577 to be filed on or before June 15 of the taxable year, the estimated tax shall be paid in two equal installments. The first installment shall be paid at the time of filing of the declaration, and the second on January 15 of the succeeding taxable year.

      (5) If the declaration is filed after September 15 of the taxable year and is not required by ORS 316.577 to be filed on or before September 15 of the taxable year, the estimated tax shall be paid in full at the time of filing of the declaration.

      (6) If the declaration is filed after the time prescribed in ORS 316.577, subsections (3) to (5) of this section shall not apply. Instead, there shall be paid at the time of filing all installments of estimated tax that would have been payable on or before such time if the declaration had been filed within the time prescribed in ORS 316.577, and the remaining installments shall be paid at the times at which, and in the amounts in which, they would have been payable if the declaration had been so filed.

      (7) If a taxpayer does not file a declaration but files a return on or before January 31 of the succeeding year and pays in full the amount stated as due on the return:

      (a) If the declaration is not required to be filed during the taxable year, but is required to be filed on or before January 15, the return shall be considered as the declaration; and

      (b) If the tax shown on the return, as reduced by the sum of the credits against the tax allowed for purposes of this chapter, is greater than the estimated tax shown in an earlier declaration, or in the last amendment thereof, the return shall be considered as the amendment of the declaration permitted by ORS 316.563 (4) to be filed on or before January 15.

      (8) In the application of this section to a taxable year beginning on any date other than January 1, there shall be substituted for the 15th or last day of the month specified in this section, the 15th or last day of the corresponding month.

      (10) Any payment of estimated tax received by the Department of Revenue shall first be applied to underpayments of estimated tax due for any prior installment due for the taxable year. Any excess amount shall be applied to the installment that next becomes due after the payment was received.

      (2) If there is an overpayment of income tax for a taxable year, the taxpayer may elect on a timely filed return for that taxable year (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing) to have the overpayment credited against an installment of estimated tax for the subsequent taxable year. The amount paid shall be credited as estimated tax on the later of the first date prescribed for payment of the estimated tax or the date that the taxpayer made the overpayment to the department.

      (3) If there is an overpayment of income taxes for a taxable year, and the taxpayer elects on a return (including an amended return) for that taxable year filed after the due date (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing) to have the overpayment credited against an installment of estimated tax for a subsequent taxable year, the overpayment shall be credited against that installment of estimated tax. The amount paid shall be credited as estimated tax on the later of the date the return was filed or the date that the taxpayer made the overpayment to the department.

      (4) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules which enable the taxpayer or department to credit against the estimated income tax the amount the taxpayer or the department determines to be an overpayment of the income tax for a preceding taxable year. [1980 c.7 §§19,21; 1993 c.726 §35; 2017 c.24 §1]

 

      316.585 [1953 c.304 §71; 1955 c.595 §3; 1957 c.586 §18; renumbered 316.770]

 

      316.587 Effect of underpayment of estimated tax; computation of underpayment; interest; when not imposed. (1) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if an individual makes an underpayment of estimated tax, interest shall accrue at the rate established under ORS 305.220 on the amount underpaid for the period the estimated tax or any installment remains unpaid. The penalty provisions contained in ORS chapter 314 for underpayment of tax shall not apply to underpayments of estimated tax under ORS 316.557 to 316.589.

      (2) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the amount of underpayment shall be the excess of the required installment over the amount (if any) of the installment paid on or before the due date for the installment.

      (3) The period of underpayment shall run from the date the installment was due to the earlier of the following dates:

      (a) The 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year; or

      (5)(a) Interest accruing under subsection (1) of this section shall not be imposed if the individual was a resident of this state throughout the preceding taxable year and had no tax liability for that year, and the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of 12 months.

      (b) Interest accruing under subsection (1) of this section shall not be imposed with respect to any underpayment of estimated tax to the extent that the Department of Revenue determines that by reason of casualty, disaster or other unusual circumstances the imposition of interest would be against equity and good conscience.

      (c) Interest accruing under subsection (1) of this section shall not be imposed with respect to any underpayment of estimated tax if the department determines that:

      (A) In the tax year the estimated tax payment was required to be made or in the tax year preceding such tax year, the taxpayer (i) retired after having attained age 62 or (ii) became disabled; and

      (B) The underpayment was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

      (d) Interest accruing under subsection (1) of this section shall not be imposed with respect to any underpayment of estimated tax attributable to the pro rata share of a shareholder of the income of an S corporation if:

      (A) The income is taxable income for an initial year for which S corporation status is elected for the corporation; and

      (B) The shareholder is a nonresident or for the preceding taxable year was a part-year resident for Oregon tax purposes.

      (6) For purposes of this section, the estimated tax shall be computed without any reduction for the amount of credit estimated to be allowed to the individual for the taxable year under ORS 316.187. The amount of the credit allowed under ORS 316.187 for the taxable year shall be considered a payment of estimated tax. An equal part of the credit shall be considered paid on each installment date for the taxable year, unless the taxpayer establishes the date on which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case the amount so withheld shall be considered payment of estimated tax on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.

      (7) For purposes of subsections (5) and (8) of this section, the term “tax” means the tax imposed by this chapter minus any credits against tax allowed for purposes of this chapter, other than the credit against tax provided by ORS 316.187.

      (8) For purposes of subsections (2) and (4) of this section, the term “required installment” means the amount of the installment that would be due if the estimated tax were equal to the least of:

      (a) Ninety percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year (or, if no return is filed, 90 percent of the tax for such year);

      (b) If the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of 12 months, the percentage of the tax shown on the return filed by the individual for the preceding taxable year that is established by the Department of Revenue by rule; or

      (c) Ninety percent of the tax for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid.

      (9) For purposes of subsection (8) of this section:

      (a) If an amended return is filed on or before the return due date (determined with regard to any extension of time granted to the taxpayer), then the term “return” means the amended return.

      (b) If during initial processing of the return the department adjusts the amount of tax due, then the term “tax shown on the return” means the tax as adjusted by the department. This paragraph shall not apply if it is ultimately determined that the adjustment was improper.

      (c) The department shall consider the provisions of section 6654 of the Internal Revenue Code. [1980 c.7 §22; 1982 s.s.1 c.16 §21; 1985 c.603 §8; 1987 c.293 §22a; 1989 c.625 §13b; 1991 c.457 §7h; 1993 c.726 §35a; 1995 c.556 §5; 1999 c.90 §18; 2001 c.660 §4; 2017 c.278 §11; 2017 c.315 §25]

 

      316.588 When interest on underpayment not imposed. (1) Interest accruing under ORS 316.587 shall not be imposed for any taxable year if the tax shown on the return for the taxable year (or, if no return is filed, the tax), minus the sum of any credits allowable for purposes of this chapter, including the credit allowable under ORS 316.187, is less than the amount established by rule adopted under ORS 316.563 (2).

      (2) For purposes of this section:

      (a) If an amended return is filed on or before the return due date (determined with regard to any extension of time granted to the taxpayer), then the term “return” means the amended return.

      (b) If during initial processing of the return the Department of Revenue adjusts the amount of tax due, then the term “tax shown on the return” means the tax as adjusted by the department. This paragraph shall not apply if it is ultimately determined that the adjustment was improper. [1987 c.293 §22c; 1993 c.726 §35b; 1999 c.90 §19; 2001 c.660 §5]

 

      316.589 Application to short tax years and tax years beginning on other than January 1. (1) The application of ORS 316.557 to 316.589 to taxable years of less than 12 months shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of Revenue.

      (2) In the application of ORS 316.557 to 316.589 to a taxable year beginning on any date other than January 1 there shall be substituted, for the months specified in ORS 316.557 to 316.589, the months which correspond thereto. [1980 c.7 §§14,15; 1985 c.603 §9]

[1985 c.738 §2; 2003 c.77 §18]

 

      316.683 State exempt-interest dividends; rules. (1) A regulated investment company, or a pool of assets managed by a fiduciary, including a financial institution, shall be qualified to pay state exempt-interest dividends, as defined in subsection (2) of this section, to its shareholders or beneficiaries.

      (2) The term “state exempt-interest dividend” means any dividend or part thereof (other than a capital gain dividend, as defined in section 852(b) of the Internal Revenue Code) paid by a regulated investment company, or any pool of assets managed by a fiduciary, including but not limited to a financial institution, and designated by it as a state exempt-interest dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders or beneficiaries not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year (including state exempt-interest dividends paid after the close of the taxable year in the manner described in section 855 of the Internal Revenue Code) is greater than the excess of (a) the amount of interest and dividends received on obligations described in ORS 316.680 (1)(a), over (b) the sum of the amount of any deductible interest on indebtedness incurred to carry such obligations and the amount of any deductible expenses incurred in the production of interest and dividend income from such obligations, the portion of such distribution which shall constitute a state exempt-interest dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated as the amount of such excess for such taxable year bears to the amount so designated. The exemption created by this section shall not exceed the portion of the dividend which is attributable to items of interest described in ORS 316.680 (1)(a).

      (3) A state exempt-interest dividend shall be treated by a shareholder or beneficiary for all purposes as an item of interest described in ORS 316.680 (1)(a). The shareholder or beneficiary shall subtract from federal taxable income the state exempt-interest dividends received with respect to the shares of a regulated investment company or any pool of assets managed by a fiduciary, including but not limited to a financial institution. However, the amount subtracted under this section shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to any deductible interest on indebtedness incurred to carry such shares multiplied by the state exempt-interest dividends and divided by the total dividends on such shares for the taxable year.

      (4) If a shareholder of a regulated investment company, or a beneficiary of a pool of assets managed by a fiduciary, including a financial institution, receives a state exempt-interest dividend with respect to any share, and the share is held by the taxpayer for six months or less, then any loss on the sale or exchange of the share shall, to the extent of the amount the state exempt-interest dividend, be disallowed. The Department of Revenue may adopt rules that reduce the holding period requirements to less than six months.

Any adjustments to the federal income tax deduction now or hereafter required by Oregon law, including but not limited to the elimination of the self-employment tax, also shall be computed and eliminated according to the accrual method of accounting.

      (b) For purposes of calculating the amount of the deduction for federal income taxes provided under ORS 316.680, the taxpayer shall not take into account any amount of the earned income credit provided under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code that reduced the amount of the taxpayer’s federal income tax liability for the tax year.

      (2) If refunds or additional assessments result from an adjustment whether initiated by the federal or state government or the taxpayer after the filing of the original return by the taxpayer, any additional federal taxes shall be deductible by the Oregon taxpayer under this section in the year in which the adjustment is finally determined or paid whichever is later. In the case of a refund the tax reduction shall be added to the taxpayer’s income in the year in which the refund is received.

      (3) For purposes of this chapter, federal income tax does not include the following:

      (a) Taxes, contributions or other payments paid by employees in pursuance of federal laws relating to Social Security, railroad retirement, unemployment compensation or old age benefits.

There shall be added to federal taxable income of a parent who makes an election under section 1(g)(7)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code any amount in excess of the standard deduction allowed for a child under ORS 316.695 (8) but not in excess of the amount described in section 1(g)(7)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code (twice the amount in effect for the taxable year under section 63(c)(5)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code). The addition under this section shall be made for each child whose income is included in the taxable income of the parent under section 1(g)(7)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (2) The deduction for foreign country income taxes provided by this section shall be limited as follows:

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the sum of foreign country income taxes deducted in computing state taxable income and the modification for federal income taxes authorized by ORS 316.680 (1)(b) as limited by ORS 316.695 (3) shall not exceed $3,000.

      (2)(a) There shall be subtracted from federal taxable income any portion of the distribution of a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus or other retirement plan, representing that portion of contributions which were taxed by the State of Oregon but not taxed by the federal government under laws in effect for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 1969, or for any subsequent year in which the amount that was contributed to the plan under the Internal Revenue Code was greater than the amount allowed under this chapter.
