      317.005 Short title. This chapter may be cited as the Corporation Excise Tax Law. [Amended by 2005 c.94 §83]

 

      317.010 Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Centrally assessed corporation” means every corporation the property of which is assessed by the Department of Revenue under ORS 308.505 to 308.674.

      (2) “Department” means the Department of Revenue.

      (3)(a) “Consolidated federal return” means the return permitted or required to be filed by a group of affiliated corporations under section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (b) “Consolidated state return” means the return required to be filed under ORS 317.710 (5).

      (4) “Doing business” means any transaction or transactions in the course of its activities conducted within the state by a national banking association, or any other corporation; provided, however, that a foreign corporation whose activities in this state are confined to purchases of personal property, and the storage thereof incident to shipment outside the state, shall not be deemed to be doing business unless such foreign corporation is an affiliate of another foreign or domestic corporation which is doing business in Oregon. Whether or not corporations are affiliated shall be determined as provided in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (5) “Excise tax” means a tax measured by or according to net income imposed upon national banking associations, all other banks, and financial, centrally assessed, mercantile, manufacturing and business corporations for the privilege of carrying on or doing business in this state.

      (6) “Financial institution” has the meaning given that term in ORS 314.610 except that it does not include a credit union as defined in ORS 723.006, an interstate credit union as defined in ORS 723.001 or a federal credit union.

      (7) “Internal Revenue Code,” except where the Legislative Assembly has provided otherwise, refers to the laws of the United States or to the Internal Revenue Code as they are amended and in effect:

      (a) On December 31, 2018; or

      (b) If related to the definition of taxable income, as applicable to the tax year of the taxpayer.

      (8) “Oregon taxable income” means taxable income, less the deduction allowed under ORS 317.476, except as otherwise provided with respect to insurers in subsection (11) of this section and ORS 317.650 to 317.665.

      (9) “Oregon net loss” means taxable loss, except as otherwise provided with respect to insurers in subsection (11) of this section and ORS 317.650 to 317.665.

      (10) “Taxable income or loss” means the taxable income or loss determined, or in the case of a corporation for which no federal taxable income or loss is determined, as would be determined, under chapter 1, Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code and any other laws of the United States relating to the determination of taxable income or loss of corporate taxpayers, with the additions, subtractions, adjustments and other modifications as are specifically prescribed by this chapter except that in determining taxable income or loss for any year, no deduction under ORS 317.476 or 317.478 and section 45b, chapter 293, Oregon Laws 1987, shall be allowed. If the corporation is a corporation to which ORS 314.280 or 314.605 to 314.675 (requiring or permitting apportionment of income from transactions or activities carried on both within and without the state) applies, to derive taxable income or loss, the following shall occur:

      (a) From the amount otherwise determined under this subsection, subtract nonapportionable income, or add nonapportionable loss, whichever is applicable.

      (b) Multiply the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection by the Oregon apportionment percentage defined under ORS 314.280, 314.650 or 314.667, whichever is applicable. The resulting product shall be Oregon apportioned income or loss.

      (c) To the amount determined as Oregon apportioned income or loss under paragraph (b) of this subsection, add nonapportionable income allocable entirely to Oregon under ORS 314.280 or 314.625 to 314.645, or subtract nonapportionable loss allocable entirely to Oregon under ORS 314.280 or 314.625 to 314.645. The resulting figure is “taxable income or loss” for those corporations carrying on taxable transactions or activities both within and without Oregon.

      (11) As used in ORS 317.122 and 317.650 to 317.665, “ insurer” means any domestic, foreign or alien insurer as defined in ORS 731.082 and any interinsurance and reciprocal exchange and its attorney in fact with respect to its attorney in fact net income as a corporate attorney in fact acting as attorney in compliance with ORS 731.458, 731.462, 731.466 and 731.470 for the reciprocal or interinsurance exchange. However, “insurer” does not include title insurers or health care service contractors operating pursuant to ORS 750.005 to 750.095. [Amended by 1953 c.385 §9; 1959 c.631 §1; 1963 c.571 §1; subsection (18) enacted as 1969 c.600 §2; 1975 c.368 §4; 1977 c.866 §2; 1983 c.162 §3; 1984 c.1 §5; 1985 c.802 §20; 1987 c.293 §31; 1989 c.625 §15; 1991 c.457 §8; 1993 c.726 §38; 1995 c.556 §12; 1995 c.786 §12; 1997 c.154 §49; 1997 c.839 §26; 1999 c.224 §8; 2001 c.660 §46; 2003 c.77 §19; 2005 c.832 §31; 2007 c.614 §14; 2008 c.45 §14; 2009 c.5 §24; 2009 c.403 §2; 2009 c.909 §§26,27; 2010 c.82 §§27,28; 2011 c.7 §24; 2012 c.31 §23; 2013 c.377 §23; 2014 c.52 §25; 2015 c.442 §17; 2016 c.33 §20; 2017 c.43 §9; 2017 c.527 §23; 2018 c.101 §23; 2019 c.319 §24]

 

      317.013 Adoption of parts of Internal Revenue Code and application of federal laws and regulations. (1) Those portions of the Internal Revenue Code, and any other laws of the United States pertaining to the determination of taxable income of corporate taxpayers, are adopted by reference as a part of this chapter. Those portions of the Internal Revenue Code and other laws of the United States have full force and effect under this chapter unless modified by other provisions of this chapter.

      (2) Insofar as is practicable in the administration of this chapter, the Department of Revenue shall apply and follow the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law. When a provision of the federal income tax law is the subject of conflicting opinions by two or more federal courts, the department shall follow the rule observed by the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue until the conflict is resolved. Nothing contained in this section limits the right or duty of the department to audit the return of any taxpayer or to determine any fact relating to the tax liability of any taxpayer.

      (3) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (1) of this section refer to rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, they are regarded as rules adopted by the department under and in accord with the provisions of this chapter, whenever they are prescribed or amended.

      (4)(a) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (1) of this section are later corrected by an Act or Title within an Act of the United States Congress designated as an Act or Title making technical corrections, then notwithstanding the date that the Act or Title becomes law, those portions of the Internal Revenue Code, as so corrected, shall be the portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in this section or ORS 317.010 or 317.018 and shall take effect, unless otherwise indicated by the Act or Title (in which case the provisions shall take effect as indicated in the Act or Title) as if originally included in the Act being technically corrected. If, on account of this subsection, any adjustment is required to an Oregon return that would otherwise be prevented by operation of law or rule, the adjustment shall be made, notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, in the manner provided under ORS 314.135.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “Act or Title” includes any subtitle, division or other part of an Act or Title. [1983 c.162 §11; 1984 c.1 §6; 1985 c.802 §32; 1987 c.293 §32; 1997 c.839 §27; 2003 c.77 §20]

 

      317.015 [Repealed by 1957 c.632 §1 (314.075 and 314.080 enacted in lieu of 316.025, 316.030, 317.015 and 317.020)]

      317.017 [1985 c.802 §48; repealed by 1997 c.839 §69]

 

      317.018 Statement of purpose. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly:

      (1) To make the Oregon corporate excise tax law, insofar as it relates to the measurement of taxable income, identical to the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as in effect and applicable for the tax year of the taxpayer, to the end that taxable income of a corporation for Oregon purposes is the same as it is for federal income tax purposes, subject to Oregon’s jurisdiction to tax, and subject to the additions, subtractions, adjustments and modifications contained in this chapter.

      (2) To achieve the results desired under subsection (1) of this section by application of the various provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code relating to the definitions for corporations, of income, deductions, accounting methods, accounting periods, taxation of corporations, basis and other pertinent provisions relating to gross income. It is not the intent of the Legislative Assembly to adopt federal Internal Revenue Code provisions dealing with the computation of tax, tax credits or any other provisions designed to mitigate the amount of tax due.

      (3) To impose on each corporation doing business within this state an excise tax for the privilege of carrying on or doing that business measured by its federal taxable income as adjusted in this chapter. [1983 c.162 §2; 1984 c.1 §7; 1985 c.802 §21; 1987 c.293 §33; 1989 c.625 §16; 1991 c.457 §9; 1993 c.726 §39; 1995 c.556 §13; 1997 c.839 §28; 2009 c.5 §30; 2009 c.909 §§33,34; 2010 c.82 §29]

 

      317.019 Application of Payment-in-kind Tax Treatment Act of 1983. The Payment-in-kind Tax Treatment Act of 1983 (P.L. 98-4, as amended by section 1061 of P.L. 98-369) shall apply in deriving Oregon taxable income under this chapter, notwithstanding that the Act is not part of the Internal Revenue Code. [1985 c.802 §44]

 

      317.020 [Repealed by 1957 c.632 §1 (314.075 and 314.080 enacted in lieu of 316.025, 316.030, 317.015 and 317.020)]

      317.022 [1983 c.162 §41; 1984 c.1 §8; repealed by 2005 c.94 §84]

 

      317.025 Omission of previously enacted savings clauses from Oregon Revised Statutes. The omission from the Oregon Revised Statutes of those statutes which were part of Acts amending the statutes that constitute the source of this chapter and which provided savings clauses for the statutes amended, is not intended as a repeal of them. Such statutes shall, in so far as they are applicable, continue to be so applicable.

 

      317.030 Effect of chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to repeal the present capital stock tax or annual corporation license fee otherwise provided for by law.

 

      317.035 Effect of subsequent repeal of chapter. In the event of repeal of this chapter, unless otherwise specifically provided in the repeal, this chapter shall remain in full force for the assessment, imposition and collection of the tax and all interest, penalty or forfeitures which have accrued or may accrue in relation to any such tax for the calendar year in which the tax is repealed.

 

      317.038 Computation of Oregon taxable history. (1) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to require a corporation to include an item of income, or to permit a corporation to deduct an expense item, more than once in computing Oregon taxable income.

      (2) The changes to the corporate excise and income tax laws by chapter 162, Oregon Laws 1983, shall not be applied to preclude a corporation from taking into account a deduction or a loss to which it otherwise would be entitled.

      (3) The changes to the corporate excise and income tax laws by chapter 162, Oregon Laws 1983, shall not be applied to preclude a corporation from including income which it otherwise would be required to include. [1983 c.162 §40; 1985 c.802 §21e]

 

      317.045 [1989 c.625 §19; repealed by 1991 c.457 §24]

      (ii) Is the subject of a rent assistance contract with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or the United States Department of Agriculture that will be maintained by the qualified borrower.

      (6) A loan made to refinance a loan that meets the criteria stated in subsection (5) of this section must be treated the same as a loan that meets the criteria stated in subsection (5) of this section.

      (8) The Housing and Community Services Department may certify qualified loans that are eligible under subsection (5) of this section if the total credits attributable to all qualified loans eligible for credits under this section and then outstanding do not exceed $25 million for any fiscal year. In making loan certifications under subsection (7) of this section, the Housing and Community Services Department shall attempt to distribute the tax credits statewide, but shall concentrate the tax credits in those areas of the state that are determined by the Oregon Housing Stability Council to have the greatest need for affordable housing.

      (10) For a qualified loan defined in subsection (1)(i)(B) of this section financed through the purchase of bonds, the interest of which is exempt from federal taxation under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of finance charge that would have been charged under subsection (2)(b) of this section is determined by reference to the finance charge that would have been charged if the federally tax exempt bonds had been issued and the tax credit under this section did not apply.

      (11) A lending institution may sell a qualified loan for which a certification has been executed to a qualified assignee whether or not the lending institution retains servicing of the qualified loan so long as a designated lending institution maintains records, annually verified by a loan servicer, that establish the amount of tax credit earned by the taxpayer throughout each year of eligibility.

      (12) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a lending institution that is a community development corporation organized under the Oregon Nonprofit Corporation Law may transfer all or part of a tax credit allowed under this section to one or more other lending institutions that are stockholders or members of the community development corporation or that otherwise participate through the community development corporation in the making of one or more qualified loans for which the tax credit under this section is allowed.

      (13) The lending institution shall file an annual statement with the Housing and Community Services Department, specifying that it has conformed with all requirements imposed by law to qualify for a tax credit under this section.

      (14) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(h) and (j) of this section, a qualified borrower on a loan to finance the construction, development, acquisition or rehabilitation of a manufactured dwelling park under subsection (5)(c) of this section must be:

      (16) The Housing and Community Services Department shall provide information to the Department of Revenue about all certifications executed under this section, if required by ORS 315.058.

Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise until the 15th succeeding tax year. The credit may not be carried forward beyond the 15th succeeding tax year.

      (3) In order to be eligible for the tax credit allowed under subsection (1) of this section, the loan shall:

      (a) Be made only to an owner of an oil-heated or wood-heated dwelling who presents the results of an energy audit pursuant to ORS 469.631 to 469.645, 469.649 to 469.659 or 469.685 that is conducted by an investor-owned utility or publicly owned utility or through the State Department of Energy, regardless of whether that utility provides the dwelling’s space heating energy.

      (b) Be subject to an annual rate not to exceed six and one-half percent and have a term not exceeding 10 years.

      (c) Not finance any materials installed in the construction of a new dwelling, additions to existing structures or remodeling that adds living space.

      (d) Finance only those energy conservation measures that are recommended as cost-effective in the energy audit, and any loan fee that is included in the body of the loan.

      (4) The credit allowed under this section may not be allowed to the extent that the loan exceeds $5,000 for a single dwelling unit, or, if the dwelling owner is a corporation described in ORS 307.375, to the extent that the loan exceeds $2,000 for a single dwelling unit.

      (5) A commercial lending institution may charge, finance and collect a nonrefundable front-end loan fee, and such a fee does not affect the eligibility of the loan for a tax credit under this section. The fee, if any, may not exceed that charged by the lending institution for nonsubsidized loans made under like terms and conditions at the time the loan for energy conservation measures is made.

      (6) Nothing in this section or in rules adopted under this section shall be construed to cause a loan to violate the usury laws of this state.

(Long Term Enterprise Zones)

 

      317.124 Long term enterprise zone facilities. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Facility” has the meaning given that term in ORS 285C.400.

      (b) “Payroll costs” means the costs of paying employee salary, wages and other remuneration in cash or property, and employee benefit costs, including but not limited to workers’ compensation, health, life or other insurance premium payments, payroll taxes and contributions to pension or other retirement plans.

      (2) A taxpayer that owns a facility that is exempt from property tax under ORS 285C.409 may claim a tax credit under this section against the taxes that are otherwise due under this chapter.

      (3) The credit may be claimed over a period of consecutive tax years elected by the taxpayer:

      (a) That must commence on or after the tax year in which the facility is placed in service and no later than the tax year beginning in the third calendar year after the year in which the facility is placed in service;

      (b) The duration of which must be at least five tax years and no more than 15 tax years; and

      (c) The duration of which must be established in writing by the Governor (pursuant to a request made by the taxpayer) prior to the date on which a return claiming the credit is filed.

      (4) The amount of the credit for a tax year shall equal 62.5 percent of the payroll costs of the taxpayer for that tax year that are attributable to employment at the facility.

      (5) The credit computed under subsection (4) of this section may be offset only against the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer, as determined under this subsection. To compute the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer:

      (a) Subtract the tax credit threshold amount determined under subsection (7) of this section from the tax liability of the taxpayer under this chapter; and

      (b) Multiply the difference determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection by the apportionment factor determined under subsection (6) of this section.

      (6)(a) The apportionment factor to be used in computing the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer under subsection (5) of this section shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is income of the facility for the fiscal year of the taxpayer that ends in the tax year for which the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer is being computed, and the denominator of which is the total Oregon income of the taxpayer for the fiscal year of the taxpayer that ends in the tax year for which the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer is being computed. For purposes of this computation, income shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be reviewed by an independent public accountant in a review that is conducted in accordance with the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

      (b)(A) If no data are prepared that meet the accounting and review standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the apportionment factor shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the intrastate payroll factor and the intrastate property factor, and the denominator of which is two.

      (B) The intrastate payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid for compensation at the qualifying facility during the tax year for which the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer is being computed, and the denominator of which is the total amount of compensation paid in this state during that tax year.

      (C) The intrastate property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average net book value of the facility for the tax year for which the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer is being computed, and the denominator of which is the average net book value of all real and tangible personal property owned or rented by the taxpayer in this state for that tax year.

      (7) The tax credit threshold amount for the tax year for which the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer is being computed equals:

      (a) $1 million; or

      (b) If the facility is one described in ORS 285C.412 (2) or (3), the lesser of $1 million or:

      (A) If the facility is one described in ORS 285C.412 (2)(c)(A), $10,000 multiplied by the number of verified full-time employees at the facility;

      (B) If the facility is one described in ORS 285C.412 (2)(c)(B), $12,500 multiplied by the number of verified full-time employees at the facility; or

      (C) If the facility is one described in ORS 285C.412 (3) but not otherwise described under this paragraph, $15,000 multiplied by the number of verified full-time employees at the facility.

      (8) A tax credit computed under this section for any one tax year may not exceed the qualified tax liability of the taxpayer for the tax year.

      (9) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayer’s qualified tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used against the taxpayer’s qualified tax liability for the second succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used against the taxpayer’s qualified tax liability for the third succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used against the taxpayer’s qualified tax liability for the fourth succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used against the taxpayer’s qualified tax liability for the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be used in any tax year thereafter.

      (10) A tax credit allowed under this section is not in lieu of any deduction for depreciation, amortization, payroll costs or any other expense to which the taxpayer may be entitled. [2001 c.292 §8]

 

      317.125 Other tax credits limited; exception. Notwithstanding any other provision of law creating a tax credit against corporate excise or income taxes, a taxpayer claiming a tax credit under ORS 317.124 may not claim any type of tax credit otherwise authorized by law against taxes that are otherwise due under this chapter that are equal to or less than the tax credit threshold amount computed under ORS 317.124 (7), to the extent the taxpayer offsets the taxpayer’s tax liability for the tax year with a credit allowed under ORS 317.124. Notwithstanding ORS 314.078, a taxpayer may forgo using a tax credit otherwise allowed under ORS 317.124 in order to use other tax credits in a tax year. [2001 c.292 §9; 2005 c.667 §4]

 

      317.127 Long Term Enterprise Zone Fund. (1) The Long Term Enterprise Zone Fund is established, separate and distinct from the General Fund.

      (2) Amounts credited to the Long Term Enterprise Zone Fund are continuously appropriated to the Department of Revenue for the purpose of making the distributions to local taxing districts described in ORS 317.131.

      (3) Amounts in the Long Term Enterprise Zone Fund remaining unexpended on June 30 of the end of a biennium are transferred to the General Fund. [2001 c.292 §11]

      317.129 Tax payments of long term enterprise zone facilities credit claimants. Notwithstanding ORS 317.850, corporate income or excise tax payments of a taxpayer allowed a tax credit under ORS 317.124 shall be deposited in the Long Term Enterprise Zone Fund established in ORS 317.127, to the extent those payments do not exceed an amount estimated by the Department of Revenue to equal 30 percent of the tax credit threshold amount determined under ORS 317.124 (7) plus 30 percent of any remaining qualified tax liability of the taxpayer under ORS 317.124 after allowance of the credit. [2001 c.292 §10]

 

      317.131 Distribution of funds to local governments. (1) For each tax year in which a taxpayer is allowed a credit under ORS 317.124, the Department of Revenue shall distribute to the local taxing districts in which the facility that is the basis of the credit is located an amount of tax payments that corresponds to the amount of payments deposited under ORS 317.129.

      (2)(a) Amounts to be distributed under subsection (1) of this section shall be distributed to the local taxing districts of the code area in which the facility is located that are not school districts, education service districts, community college districts or community college service districts.

      (b) If the facility is located in more than one code area, amounts to be distributed under subsection (1) of this section shall be allocated to each code area in which the facility is located, based on the ratio of the real market value of the facility in each code area to the total real market value of the facility.

      (c) The amount distributed to each district under subsection (1) of this section shall be the amount that bears the same proportion to the total amount to be distributed under this section as the proportion of the operating tax billing rate of the district receiving distribution bears to the total operating tax billing rate of all of the local taxing districts described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, the amount distributed to a local taxing district under subsection (1) of this section for a fiscal year may not exceed the amount of property taxes forgone by that district as a result of the exemption from property tax under ORS 285C.409 in that year.

      (3) If any moneys described in subsection (1) of this section remain following computation of the distributions to local taxing districts under subsection (2) of this section, the moneys shall be distributed to the zone sponsor.

      (4) Distributions shall be made under this section on or before June 1 of each fiscal year. [2001 c.292 §12; 2005 c.667 §6]

      (5) In computing Oregon taxable income, the amount of loss allowed as a subtraction under subsection (3) of this section shall be subtracted in any one of the 15 years succeeding the year of the loss.

      (2) If any preacquisition loss, as described in subsection (1) of this section, may not offset a recognized built-in gain by reason of section 384 of the Internal Revenue Code, such gain shall not be taken into account in determining under ORS 317.476 the amount of such loss which may be carried to other taxable years.

      (3) In any case in which a preacquisition loss, as described in subsection (1) of this section, for any taxable year is subject to limitation under subsection (1) of this section and a taxable loss from such taxable year is not subject to such limitation, taxable income shall be treated as having been offset first by the loss subject to such limitation.

      (4) The definitions contained in section 384(c) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply for purposes of this section, except that where appropriate, gain, loss and items of income shall be determined as allocated or apportioned to Oregon and with the additions, subtractions, modifications and other adjustments contained in this chapter.

      317.655 Taxable income of insurer; computation; exclusion for certain life insurance or annuity accounts. (1) For purposes of the tax imposed under ORS 317.070, the Oregon taxable income of an insurer shall be the insurer’s “net gain from operations” or “net income” determined in the manner prescribed by the Department of Consumer and Business Services on its Annual Statement Form for the taxable year, as adjusted pursuant to ORS 317.010 (11), 317.122 and 317.650 to 317.665.

      (a) Add the amount of federal and state income taxes deducted by the insurer in computing its net gain from operations.

      (b) Add penalty interest received by the insurer arising out of prepayment of loans made by the insurer.

      (d) Subtract, if the insurer so elects, additional or accelerated depreciation on real and personal property that is in excess of the depreciation deducted by the method used in computing the insurer’s net gain from operations.

      (e) Subtract that amortized portion of the contribution for past service credits made to qualified plans and exempt trusts for employees allowed as a deduction.

      (f) Add or subtract, as appropriate, increases or decreases in mandatory reserves that the insurer is required to maintain by law or by rules or directives of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the insurance director or commissioner of the state of domicile of the foreign or alien insurer, other than increases or decreases that (A) are deducted in arriving at the insurer’s net gain from operations, or (B) result from net gains or losses, realized or unrealized, in the value of the insurer’s property and investments.

      (g) Add or subtract, as appropriate, increases or decreases in reserves for policies and obligations outstanding before the beginning of the taxable year resulting from changes in the bases and methods of computing such reserves that are justified by accounting and actuarial practices applicable to or accepted by the insurance industry, commonly known as “reserve strengthening” or “reserve weakening.”

      (3) Income, expenses, gains, losses, exclusions, deductions, assets, reserves, liabilities and other items properly attributable to one or more separate accounts authorized under ORS 733.220 shall not be taken into account in determining taxable income of an insurer under ORS 317.010 (11), 317.122 and 317.650 to 317.665 until such amounts or items are returned to and reflected on the general accounts of such insurer so as to be available generally to or for the benefit of contract and policyholders of the insurer. [Formerly 317.197; 1995 c.786 §16]

 

      317.660 Allocation of net income where insurer has both in-state and out-of-state business. (1)(a) If the income of an insurer is derived from business done both within and without this state, the determination of Oregon taxable income shall be arrived at by multiplying the insurer’s net income by the insurance sales factor.

      (b) The insurance sales factor shall consist of a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of direct premiums (excluding reinsurance accepted and without deduction of reinsurance ceded) received or earned by the insurer during the tax year on policies and contracts that are allocated to this state and to other jurisdictions in which the insurer is not authorized to do business, and the denominator of which is the total of such premiums received or earned by the insurer during the tax year on policies and contracts that had been sold within and without this state.

      (2) For purposes of this section:

      (a) “Net income” means net income properly recorded in the statement of income reported in the annual statement filed by the insurer with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (b) “Premiums” means sums properly included in those schedules of the annual statement filed by the insurer with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services that appropriately allocate premiums by jurisdiction. If the exclusion of reinsurance premiums results in an insurance sales factor that does not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for and the Department of Revenue may permit, or the Department of Revenue may require, the inclusion of reinsurance premiums in the insurance sales factor. If the annual statement of the insurer does not report received premiums then the insurance sales factor shall be determined based on earned premiums.

      (3) If application of the apportionment formula described in subsection (1) of this section results in an apportionment that does not fairly and equitably represent the taxpayer’s insurance business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition the Department of Revenue for and the department may permit, or the department may require, to achieve an apportionment that fairly and equitably represents the taxpayer’s insurance business activity:

      (a)(A) The exclusion of the insurance sales factor; and

      (B) The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly and equitably represent the taxpayer’s business activity in this state;

      (b) The inclusion of the insurance sales factor and one or more additional factors that will fairly and equitably represent the taxpayer’s business activity in this state; or

      (c) The employment of any other method to achieve a fair and equitable apportionment of the taxpayer’s income. [Formerly 317.199; 1995 c.786 §17; 1999 c.143 §11; 2007 c.716 §§1,3]

 

      317.665 Oregon net losses of insurer in prior years. In computing Oregon taxable income, an insurer shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the aggregate Oregon net losses of prior years as defined in ORS 317.476. [Formerly 317.299; 1995 c.786 §18]

 

      317.667 Tax treatment of captive insurers. A captive insurer, as defined in ORS 735.150, making a valid election under section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall be afforded the same tax treatment on receipt of premiums and tax on investment earnings for state income tax purposes as exists for federal income tax purposes except that the income tax rates on taxable income of the captive insurer shall be those identified under state law rather than federal law. [2012 c.84 §24]

      (c) Whenever two or more corporations are required to file a consolidated state return under paragraph (a) of this subsection, any reference in this chapter to a corporation for purposes of deriving Oregon taxable income shall be treated as a reference to all corporations that are included in the consolidated state return.

      (d) A corporation that would not be a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated state return based solely on the application of section 1504(b)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code must be included in the consolidated state return filed by the affiliated group.

The federal return or any part thereof required to be filed with the state return is incorporated in and shall be a part of the state return.

      (7)(a) Each foreign or alien insurer and each domestic insurer owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more foreign insurers:

      (A) Shall determine its Oregon taxable income under ORS 317.650 to 317.665;

      (B) Shall make a return of the tax imposed by this chapter on a separate basis; and

      (C) May not be included in a consolidated state return.

      (b) An interinsurance and reciprocal exchange and its attorney in fact with respect to its attorney in fact net income as a corporate attorney in fact acting as attorney in compliance with ORS 731.458, 731.462, 731.466 and 731.470 for the reciprocal or interinsurance exchange may file a consolidated return under the circumstances in the manner and subject to the rules adopted by the department.

      (8) The Department of Revenue may prescribe by rule the method by which a consolidated state return shall be filed under this section. [1984 c.1 §2; 1985 c.802 §29; 1995 c.786 §21; 2009 c.401 §1; 2017 c.316 §2]

 

      317.713 Group losses as offset to income of subsidiary paying preferred dividends. If the use of group losses to offset income of a subsidiary paying dividends on preferred stock is limited under section 1503(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a like limitation shall apply for purposes of this chapter. For purposes of applying section 1503(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, “group losses” and “separately computed taxable income” shall be determined by taking into consideration only that income and loss which is allocated or apportioned to Oregon, with the additions, subtractions, modifications and other adjustments under this chapter and ORS chapter 314. [1991 c.457 §14]

 

      317.715 Tax return of corporation in affiliated group making consolidated federal return. (1) If a corporation required to make a return under this chapter is a member of an affiliated group of corporations making a consolidated federal return under sections 1501 to 1505 of the Internal Revenue Code, the corporation’s Oregon taxable income shall be determined beginning with federal consolidated taxable income of the affiliated group as provided in this section.

      (2) If the affiliated group, of which the corporation subject to taxation under this chapter is a member, consists of more than one unitary group or includes any alien, domestic or foreign insurer, as defined in ORS 731.082, that is excluded from the consolidated state return under ORS 317.710 (5) or (7), before the additions, subtractions, adjustments and modifications to federal taxable income provided for in this chapter are made, and before allocation and apportionment as provided in ORS 317.010 (10), if any, modified federal consolidated taxable income shall be computed. Modified federal consolidated taxable income shall be determined by eliminating from the federal consolidated taxable income of the affiliated group the separate taxable income, as determined under Treasury Regulations adopted under section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code, and any deductions or additions or items of income, expense, gain or loss for which consolidated treatment is prescribed under Treasury Regulations adopted under section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code, attributable to the member or members of any unitary group of which the corporation is not a member or to insurers excluded from the consolidated state return under ORS 317.710 (5) or (7).

      (3)(a) After modified federal consolidated taxable income is determined under subsection (2) of this section, the additions, subtractions, adjustments and modifications prescribed by this chapter shall be made to the modified federal consolidated taxable income of the remaining members of the affiliated group, where applicable, as if all such members were subject to taxation under this chapter. After those modifications are made, Oregon taxable income or loss shall be determined as provided in ORS 317.010 (10)(a) to (c), if necessary.

      (b) In the computation of the Oregon apportionment percentage for a corporation that is a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal return, there shall be taken into consideration only the property, payroll, sales or other factors of those members of the affiliated group whose items of income, expense, gain or loss remain in modified federal consolidated taxable income after the eliminations required under subsection (2) of this section. Those members of an affiliated group making a consolidated federal return or a consolidated state return may not be treated as one taxpayer for purposes of determining whether any member of the group is taxable in this state or any other state with respect to questions of jurisdiction to tax or the composition of the apportionment factors used to attribute income to this state under ORS 314.280 or 314.605 to 314.675. [1984 c.1 §3; 1985 c.802 §30; 1987 c.293 §46; 2013 c.707 §2; 2015 c.755 §3; 2017 c.316 §3]

 

      317.716 [2015 c.755 §2; repealed by 2018 c.101 §35]

 

      317.717 [2013 c.707 §4; 2015 c.755 §4; repealed by 2018 c.101 §35]

 

      317.720 Computation of taxable income; excess loss accounts. (1) To derive Oregon taxable income, there shall be subtracted from federal taxable income the amount of the excess loss account included under Treasury Regulations adopted under section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent that the excess losses have not offset unitary income. However, in no event shall excess losses be recaptured on account of Treasury Regulations adopted under section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of this chapter if the losses were deducted for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1986.

      (2) As used in this section, “unitary income” means income of a unitary group, as that term is defined in ORS 317.705, that includes the subsidiary to which excess losses are attributable, and a member of which is subject to taxation under this chapter. [1984 c.1 §11b; 1987 c.293 §47]

 

      317.725 Adjustments to prevent double taxation or deduction; rules. (1)(a) If any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or of ORS 317.705 to 317.715, relating to the use of consolidated federal returns, requires that any amount be added to or deducted from federal consolidated taxable income or the Oregon taxable income subject to taxation under this chapter or ORS chapter 318 that previously had been added to or deducted from income upon or with respect to which tax liability was measured under the Oregon law in effect prior to the taxpayer’s taxable year as to which ORS 317.705 to 317.715, are first effective, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to the income for the year or years subject to ORS 317.705 to 317.715, so as to prevent the double taxation or double deduction of any such amount that previously had entered into the computation of income upon or with respect to which tax liability was measured.

      (b) If it appears to the Department of Revenue that a corporation making a return under this chapter or ORS chapter 318 is required to make any adjustment to federal consolidated taxable income pursuant to ORS 317.715, that is unduly burdensome or that produces an inequitable or unreasonable result, the department, upon application by the corporation, may relieve the corporation of the requirement and may permit or require any other adjustment to be made to fairly reflect income and produce an equitable result. The department shall adopt rules prescribing the method by which a corporation may apply for relief under this paragraph.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 317.013, any regulation promulgated pursuant to sections 1501 to 1505 of the Internal Revenue Code which makes reference to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to which modifications to federal taxable income are prescribed under this chapter shall not be applied to the extent the regulation conflicts with the provisions of this chapter.

      (3) The Department of Revenue shall not make any adjustment under this section if the resulting increase or decrease in tax liability would be less than $250. [1984 c.1 §19; 1985 c.802 §31]

      (2) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, any revenue that is received as a result of a rate of tax above 7.2 percent imposed under this chapter and that is in excess of the revenue that would be received under this chapter at a rate of 7.2 percent shall be deposited into the Oregon Rainy Day Fund established by ORS 293.144.

      (3) Before the end of each biennium, beginning with the biennium ending on June 30, 2015, the Department of Revenue shall estimate the revenue described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section that is received during the biennium. An amount equal to that estimate shall be transferred into the Oregon Rainy Day Fund established by ORS 293.144 on or before June 30 of each odd-numbered year. [2009 c.747 §2; 2013 s.s. c.5 §8]

      317.930 Exceptions and limitations. In addition to the exclusions and modifications contained in section 512(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, in determining unrelated business taxable income:

      (1) There shall be excluded, in the case of any school, college or university, which rents real property to its students or faculty, all rents derived therefrom, providing that such property is actually a part of the school and that the continued presence of the students and faculty thereon is necessary to the educative function of the institution.

      (2) There shall be subtracted any amount treated as derived from the conduct of an unrelated trade or business under section 995(g) of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to distributions to DISC tax-exempt shareholders). [1959 c.356 §4; 1979 c.580 §3; 1983 c.162 §43; 1991 c.457 §14a]

These limitations to the assessment of such tax or additional tax, including penalty and interest thereon, do not apply to the assessment of additional taxes, and penalty and interest thereon, upon false or fraudulent returns or in cases where with a fraudulent intent no return has been filed. ORS 314.410 is also applicable to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this section. [1959 c.356 §6]

The clerk shall thereupon record the name of the project owner incurring the penalty and the amount of the penalty in the County Clerk Lien Record. The penalty provided in the order so recorded shall become a lien upon the title to any interest in property owned by the project owner against whom the order is entered, and execution may be issued upon the order in the same manner as execution upon a judgment of a court of record.

      (5) Civil penalties, and judgments entered thereon, due to the director under this section from any project owner shall be deemed preferred to all general claims in all bankruptcy proceedings, trustee proceedings and proceedings for the administration of estates and receiverships involving the project owner liable therefor or the property of such project owner.
