A request under this subsection by a person must be made within the statute of limitations applicable to ORS 317A.100 to 317A.158.

      317A.146 Quitting business; successor. (1) For purposes of ORS 317A.100 to 317A.158, “successor” means any person to whom another person quitting, selling out, exchanging or disposing of a business sells or otherwise conveys, directly or indirectly, in bulk and not in the ordinary course of business, a major part of the materials, supplies, merchandise, inventory, fixtures or equipment of the person. Any person obligated to fulfill the terms of a contract shall be considered a successor to any contractor defaulting in the performance of any contract as to which the person is a surety or guarantor.

      (2) If any person quits business or sells out, exchanges or otherwise disposes of a business or stock of goods, any corporate activity tax imposed under ORS 317A.116 shall become immediately due and payable. The person shall, within 45 days after the sale, exchange or disposition, make a return and pay the tax due.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 314.835, the successor is liable for the full amount of the tax and may withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due until a receipt or evidence from the Department of Revenue showing payment in full of any tax due is presented to the successor. If a receipt or other evidence is not presented to the successor within 45 days, the successor may pay the tax and the amount paid shall, to the extent paid, be considered a payment of the purchase price. If the tax paid by the successor is greater than the purchase price, the amount of the difference is a debt due to the successor from the seller or transferor.

      (4) A successor is not liable for any tax due from the person from whom the successor has acquired a business or stock of goods if the successor gives written notice to the department of the acquisition and the department does not assess a deficiency against the seller or transferor within 18 months of receipt of the notice of acquisition and mail or deliver a copy of the assessment to the successor. [2019 c.122 §73]

      (2) Any term that is not defined in ORS 317A.100 shall have the meaning given that term for the purposes of ORS chapter 305, 314, 316 or 317. [2019 c.122 §74]

The department may pay expenses for the administration, collection and enforcement of the tax imposed under ORS 317A.100 to 317A.158 out of moneys received from the corporate activity tax imposed under ORS 317A.116. Refunds, including refunds of erroneous overpayments or refunds of other moneys received in which the department has no legal interest, shall be paid out of the suspense account.

      (2) After payment of refunds, the net revenue shall be transferred to the Fund for Student Success established under ORS 327.001. A working balance of unreceipted revenue from the tax imposed under ORS 317A.100 to 317A.158 may be retained by the department for the payment of refunds, but such working balance may not at the close of any fiscal year exceed the amount of $500,000.

      (3) There are continuously appropriated to the department amounts necessary to pay the administrative expenses of the department in administering, collecting and enforcing the corporate activity tax imposed under ORS 317A.116. [2019 c.122 §76]

 

      317A.158 Local taxes preempted.

A city, county, district or other political subdivision or municipal corporation of this state may not impose, by ordinance or other law, a tax upon commercial activity or upon receipts from grocery sales.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply:

      (a) To any tax, or to subsequent amendments of the provisions of any tax, if the ordinance or other law imposing the tax is in effect and operative on April 1, 2019, or is adopted by initiative or referendum petition at an election held prior to March 1, 2019; or

      317A.161 Interest and penalties. (1) The Department of Revenue may not impose any interest or penalty that would otherwise apply to taxes due if the interest or penalty is based on underpayment or underreporting that results solely from the operation of ORS 317A.100 to 317A.158.

      (2) A taxpayer shall pay at least 80 percent of the balance due for any quarter or the department may impose a penalty as provided in ORS 314.400 (3). [2019 c.122 §77]
