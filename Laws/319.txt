      319.050 Performance bond; hearing. (1) At the time of filing the certificate and application for a dealer’s license, the Department of Transportation shall require the dealer to file with the department, in a form prepared by the department, a bond executed by the dealer as principal with a corporate surety authorized to transact business in this state. The bond shall be payable to the State of Oregon conditioned upon performance of all the requirements of ORS 319.010 to 319.430, including the payment of all taxes, penalties and other obligations of the dealer arising out of ORS 319.010 to 319.430.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 319.051, 319.052 and 319.053, a bond under subsection (1) of this section shall be in an amount that is equivalent to twice the dealer’s estimated monthly license tax, as determined by the department, or $250,000, whichever is less.

      (3) The department may reduce or increase the required amount for a bond as provided in ORS 319.051 and 319.052.

      (4) A bond given in connection with ORS 319.010 to 319.430 is a continuing instrument and covers any and all periods of time including the first and all subsequent periods for which a license may be granted in consequence of the giving of the bond. The liability of the surety on the bond for the aggregate of all claims that arise under the bond may not exceed the amount of the penalty of the bond. No recoveries on any bond or any execution of any new bond may invalidate any bond, but the total recoveries under any one bond may not exceed the amount of the bond.

      (5) A dealer required under this section to obtain a bond may demand by proper petition a hearing on the necessity of the bond or the reasonableness of the amount required. The department shall grant the petition for a hearing and shall hold the hearing within 10 days after the demand for the hearing. The decision of the department becomes final 10 days after service of the order on the dealer. The hearing is not subject to the requirements of ORS 183.413 to 183.470. [Amended by 1967 c.359 §690; 1999 c.769 §12; 2003 c.52 §1]

 

      319.051 Conditions for reduced bond amount. (1) For a dealer described in subsection (2) of this section, the bond required by the Department of Transportation under ORS 319.050 shall be in an amount that is equivalent to twice the dealer’s estimated monthly license tax, as determined by the department, or $100,000, whichever is less.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section apply to a dealer who held a valid dealer’s license on October 23, 1999, issued under ORS 319.010 to 319.430, and who, since October 23, 1999, has:

      (a) Not been required to file a bond greater than $100,000; and

      (b) Performed, as determined by the department, the requirements of ORS 319.010 to 319.430, including the payment of all taxes, penalties and other obligations of the dealer arising out of ORS 319.010 to 319.430. [2003 c.52 §3]

 

      Note: 319.051 to 319.053 were added to and made a part of 319.010 to 319.430 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      319.052 Conditions for increased bond amount; request and conditions for reduction; rules. (1) The Department of Transportation shall increase a dealer’s bond filed under ORS 319.050 to an amount that is equivalent to twice the dealer’s estimated monthly license tax, as determined by the department, or $1 million, whichever is less, if, within a 24-month period, the dealer:

      (a) Was late three or more times in filing reports or making payments to the department;

      (b) Had three or more checks or electronic funds transfers to the department dishonored for lack of funds or credit;

      (c) Failed to maintain or make available a record of all purchases, receipts, sales and distribution of motor vehicle fuel as required under ORS 319.390; or

      (d) Had a motor vehicle fuel dealer license issued in this state or another jurisdiction revoked.

      (2) The department may waive an increase in the bond amount under subsection (1) of this section if the department determines that the dealer did not intend to avoid payment of license taxes when the dealer engaged in the conduct described in subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) of this section or when the dealer engaged in the conduct that led to the license revocation described in subsection (1)(d) of this section. If the department waives an increase in the bond amount, the bond shall remain at an amount that is:

      (a) Required under ORS 319.051 for a dealer described in ORS 319.051; or

      (b) Required under ORS 319.050.

      (3) If the department increases the bond amount as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the dealer may, after 24 months, request in writing that the department reduce the bond amount. The department shall reduce the bond amount if the department determines that the dealer, in the 24 months prior to the dealer’s written request:

      (a) Filed timely reports and made timely payments;

      (b) Had no checks or electronic funds transfers to the department dishonored for lack of funds or credit;

      (c) Maintained and made available a record of all purchases, receipts, sales and distribution of motor vehicle fuel as required under ORS 319.390; and

      (d) Did not have a motor vehicle fuel dealer license issued in this state or another jurisdiction revoked.

      (4) If the department determines that the dealer met all of the requirements under subsection (3) of this section, the department shall reduce the bond required of a dealer described in ORS 319.050 or a dealer described in ORS 319.051 to an amount that is equivalent to twice the dealer’s estimated monthly license tax, as determined by the department, or $250,000, whichever is less.

      (5) If the department determines that the dealer failed to meet the requirements under subsection (3) of this section and that the failure was not due to the dealer’s intent to avoid payment of license taxes, the department may reduce the bond required of a dealer described in ORS 319.050 or a dealer described in ORS 319.051 to an amount that is equivalent to twice the dealer’s estimated monthly license tax, as determined by the department, or $250,000, whichever is less.

      (6) For purposes of this section, the department shall adopt rules establishing what constitutes evidence that a dealer did not intend to avoid payment of license taxes. [2003 c.52 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 319.051.

 

      319.053 Amount of bond when twice license tax is less than $1,000. If the amount that is equivalent to twice the amount of a dealer’s estimated monthly license tax, as determined by the Department of Transportation, is an amount that is less than $1,000, the bond amount required by ORS 319.050, 319.051 or 319.052 shall be $1,000. [2003 c.52 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 319.051.

 

      319.060 Deposit in lieu of bond. In lieu of the bond or bonds in total amount as fixed under ORS 319.050, 319.051, 319.052 or 319.053, any dealer may deposit with the State Treasurer, under such terms and conditions as the Department of Transportation may prescribe, a like amount of lawful money of the United States or bonds or other obligations of the United States, the State of Oregon, or any county of this state, of an actual market value not less than the amount so fixed by the department. [Amended by 2003 c.52 §7]

 

      319.070 Release of surety. Any surety on a bond furnished by a dealer as provided in ORS 319.050 shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to the state accruing on such bond after the expiration of 30 days from the date upon which the surety has lodged with the Department of Transportation a written request to be released and discharged, but this provision shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge the surety from any liability already accrued or which accrues before the expiration of the 30-day period. The department shall promptly, upon receiving the request, notify the dealer who furnished the bond, and unless the dealer, on or before the expiration of the 30-day period, files a new bond, or makes a deposit in accordance with the requirements of ORS 319.050 and 319.060, the department forthwith shall cancel the dealer’s license.

 

      319.080 Additional bond or deposit. The Department of Transportation may require a dealer to give a new or additional surety bond or to deposit additional securities of the character specified in ORS 319.060 if, in its opinion, the security of the surety bond theretofore filed by the dealer, or the market value of the properties deposited as security by the dealer, becomes impaired or inadequate. Upon failure of the dealer to give the new or additional surety bond or to deposit additional securities within 10 days after being requested so to do by the department, the department forthwith shall cancel the license of the dealer.

 

      319.090 Immediate collection of tax and interest; penalties; waiver. (1) If any dealer sells, distributes or uses any motor vehicle fuel without first filing the certificate and bond and securing the license required by ORS 319.030, the license tax provided in ORS 319.020 shall immediately be due and payable on account of all motor vehicle fuel so sold, distributed or used.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Department of Transportation shall proceed forthwith to determine, from the best available sources, the amount of such tax, and it shall immediately assess the tax and interest in the amount found due, together with a penalty of 100 percent of the tax, and shall make its certificate of such assessment and penalty. The department may waive all or part of a penalty imposed under this subsection if the department determines that a violation of the requirement under this section to file the certificate and bond or to secure the license was due to reasonable cause and without intent to avoid payment of the tax. In any suit or proceeding to collect such tax, interest or penalty, the certificate is prima facie evidence that the dealer therein named is indebted to the State of Oregon in the amount of the tax, interest and penalty therein stated. [Amended by 1981 c.396 §1; 1989 c.664 §3; 1999 c.769 §5]

 

      319.096 Suspension of license; liability for tax; reinstatement. (1) The Department of Transportation may, prior to a hearing, suspend the license of a motor vehicle fuel dealer who refuses or neglects to comply with the provisions of ORS 319.010 to 319.430 until the dealer complies with the provisions of ORS 319.010 to 319.430.

      (2) Upon suspension of a dealer’s license under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall immediately notify:

      (a) The dealer by certified mail of the dealer’s license suspension and the dealer’s right to request an immediate hearing to contest the license suspension; and

      (b) All other licensed motor vehicle fuel dealers by a method determined under ORS 319.102 that the authority of the dealer to purchase tax-deferred motor vehicle fuel has been suspended.

      (3) If a licensed motor vehicle fuel dealer sells tax-deferred motor vehicle fuel to a dealer whose license has been suspended under subsection (1) of this section after the third day after the selling dealer receives notice of the suspension under subsection (2) of this section, the selling dealer and the suspended dealer are jointly and severally liable for the tax owed on the sale of the fuel.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding the joint and several liability of the selling dealer and the suspended dealer under subsection (3) of this section, the department shall attempt to collect from the suspended dealer the tax owed on the fuel for a period of 45 days from the date of the sale to the suspended dealer.

      (b) After the expiration of the 45-day period under this subsection, the department shall collect from the selling dealer any tax not collected from the suspended dealer under this subsection.

      (5) The department shall waive the liability of a selling dealer under subsection (3) of this section if the selling dealer establishes to the satisfaction of the department that:

      (a) The sale of the motor vehicle fuel to the suspended dealer was due to circumstances that were beyond the control of the selling dealer; or

      (b) The dealer whose license was suspended engaged in fraud or deceit to avoid timely payment of the tax to the selling dealer.

      (6) When a dealer whose license has been suspended under subsection (1) of this section complies with the provisions of ORS 319.010 to 319.430, the department shall reinstate the dealer’s license and shall notify by a method determined under ORS 319.102 all licensed motor vehicle fuel dealers that the dealer’s license has been reinstated and that the dealer is authorized to purchase tax-deferred fuel.

      (7) If the department determines that a dealer whose license has been suspended under subsection (1) of this section is unwilling or unable to comply with the provisions of ORS 319.010 to 319.430, the department shall revoke the license of the dealer as provided in ORS 319.100. [2003 c.113 §2]

      319.098 Contesting license suspension. A dealer whose license has been suspended by the Department of Transportation under ORS 319.096 may contest the suspension as provided in ORS chapter 183. [2003 c.113 §3]

      319.100 Revocation of license. (1) The Department of Transportation shall revoke the license of any dealer whose license has been suspended under ORS 319.096 and who the department determines is unwilling or unable to comply with the provisions of ORS 319.010 to 319.430.

      (4) The department shall provide notice of the revocation of the license of a dealer under this section to all other licensed motor vehicle fuel dealers by a method determined under ORS 319.102. [1989 c.664 §4; 2003 c.113 §4]

 

      319.102 Notice to dealers of suspension or revocation of another dealer’s license; rules. The Department of Transportation shall establish by rule the most efficient method of notifying licensed motor vehicle fuel dealers as required under ORS 319.096 and 319.100 that a dealer’s license has been suspended, revoked or reinstated. The possible methods may include, but need not be limited to, notice by telephone, electronic mail or regular mail. [2003 c.113 §5]

      319.192 Refund to dealer of uncollectible taxes; rules. (1) Upon application to the Department of Transportation, a motor vehicle fuel dealer may obtain a refund of the tax paid to the department on sales of motor vehicle fuel if:

      (a) The dealer has received less than full consideration for the fuel from or on behalf of a purchaser;

      (b) The account has been declared by the dealer to be an uncollectible account receivable and meets all applicable standards for deductibility for federal income tax purposes pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code; and

      (c) The dealer has not previously received a refund from the department for motor vehicle fuel taxes not paid by the same purchaser.

      (2) For purposes of determining the amount of a refund due under this section, the amount of consideration received by the motor vehicle fuel dealer shall be apportioned between the charges for the motor vehicle fuel and the tax for the fuel. The amount of the tax refunded may not exceed the amount of tax paid under ORS 319.020.

      (3) If the motor vehicle fuel dealer who receives a refund under this section subsequently collects any amount from any source for the account declared uncollectible, the amount collected shall be apportioned between the charges for the motor vehicle fuel and the corresponding tax for the fuel. The motor vehicle fuel tax collected shall be returned to the department.

      (4) The department shall adopt rules governing the process of applying for and receiving refunds under this section. [2003 c.307 §2]

 

      Note: 319.192 was added to and made a part of 319.010 to 319.430 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      319.200 Assessing tax and penalty where dealer fails to report. If any dealer, except one subject to ORS 319.090, fails to file the report required by ORS 319.190, the Department of Transportation shall proceed forthwith to determine from the best available source the amount of motor vehicle fuel sold, distributed or used by such dealer for the period unreported, and such determination shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of such fuel sold, distributed or used. The department immediately shall assess the license tax in the amount so determined, adding thereto a penalty of 10 percent for failure to report. The penalty shall be cumulative of other penalties provided in ORS 319.010 to 319.430 and 319.990. In any suit brought to enforce the rights of the state under this section, the certificate of the department showing the amount of taxes, penalties, interest and costs unpaid by any dealer and that the same are due and unpaid to the state is prima facie evidence of the facts as shown. [Amended by 1967 c.54 §3; 1987 c.610 §8]

 

      319.210 Billing purchasers. Bills shall be rendered to all purchasers of motor vehicle fuel by dealers in motor vehicle fuel. The bills shall separately state and describe to the satisfaction of the Department of Transportation the different products shipped thereunder and shall be serially numbered except where other sales invoice controls acceptable to the department are maintained. [Amended by 1955 c.730 §5; 1987 c.610 §9]

 

      319.220 Receipt, payment or sale of motor vehicle fuel without invoice or delivery tag prohibited. No person shall receive and accept any shipment of motor vehicle fuel from any dealer, or pay for the same, or sell or offer the shipment for sale, unless the shipment is accompanied by an invoice or delivery tag showing the date upon which shipment was delivered and the name of the dealer in motor vehicle fuel. [Amended by 1955 c.730 §6; 1987 c.610 §10]

 

      319.230 Transporting motor vehicle fuel in bulk. Every person operating any conveyance for the purpose of hauling, transporting or delivering motor vehicle fuel in bulk shall, before entering upon the public highways of this state with such conveyance, have and possess during the entire time of hauling or transporting such motor vehicle fuel an invoice, bill of sale or other written statement showing the number of gallons, the true name and address of the seller or consignor, and the true name and address of the buyer or consignee, if any, of the same. The person hauling such motor vehicle fuel shall at the request of any sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable, state police or other officer authorized by law to inquire into or investigate such matters, produce and offer for inspection the invoice, bill of sale or other statement. [Amended by 1957 c.209 §6]

 

      319.240 Exemption of export fuel. (1) The license tax imposed by ORS 319.020 may not be imposed on motor vehicle fuel that is exported by a dealer:

      (a) From this state to another state, territory or country, not including a federally recognized Indian reservation located wholly or partially within the borders of this state, where the motor vehicle fuel is unloaded; and

      (b) Who has a valid motor vehicle fuel dealer’s license or its equivalent issued by the state, territory or country to which the fuel is exported and where it is unloaded.

      (2) In support of any exemption from license taxes claimed under this section other than in the case of stock transfers or deliveries in equipment, every dealer must execute and file with the Department of Transportation an export certificate in such form as shall be prescribed, prepared and furnished by the department, containing a statement, made by some person having actual knowledge of the fact of such exportation, that the motor vehicle fuel has been exported from the State of Oregon, and giving such details with reference to such shipment as the department may require. All export certificates in support of shipments to other states, territories or countries must be completed and on file in the principal office of the dealer in this state within three months after the close of the calendar month in which the shipments to which they relate are made, unless the state, territory or country of destination would not be prejudiced with respect to its collection of taxes thereon if the certificate is not filed within such time. The department may demand of any dealer such additional data as is deemed necessary in support of any such certificate, and failure to supply such data will constitute a waiver of all right to exemption claimed by virtue of such certificate. The department may, in a case where it believes no useful purpose would be served by filing of an export certificate, waive the certificate.

      (3) Any motor vehicle fuel carried from this state in the fuel tank of a motor vehicle shall not be considered as exported from this state, except that a refund of the tax may be paid on such fuel as provided in ORS 319.280 (1)(d).

      (4) No person shall, through false statement, trick or device, or otherwise, obtain motor vehicle fuel for export upon which the Oregon tax has not been paid and fail to export the same, or any portion thereof, or cause the motor vehicle fuel or any portion thereof not to be exported, or shall divert the motor vehicle fuel or any portion thereof, or shall cause it to be diverted from interstate or foreign transit begun in this state, or shall unlawfully return the motor vehicle fuel or any portion thereof to be used or sold in this state and fail to notify the department and the dealer from whom the motor vehicle fuel was originally purchased of the person’s act.

      (5) No dealer or other person shall conspire with any person to withhold from export, or divert from interstate or foreign transit begun in this state, or to return motor vehicle fuel to this state for sale or use so as to avoid any of the taxes imposed by ORS 319.010 to 319.430. [Amended by 1953 c.82 §2; 1955 c.730 §7; 1959 c.186 §1; 1963 c.257 §1; 1987 c.610 §11; 2003 c.56 §1]

 

      319.250 Certain sales to Armed Forces exempted; reports. The license tax imposed by ORS 319.020 shall not be imposed on any aircraft or motor vehicle fuel sold to the Armed Forces of the United States for use in ships, aircraft or for export from this state; but every dealer shall be required to report such sales to the Department of Transportation in such detail as may be required. A certificate by an authorized officer of such Armed Forces shall be accepted by the dealer as sufficient proof that the sale is for the purpose specified in the certificate. [Amended by 1955 c.730 §8; 1959 c.186 §2; 1961 c.43 §1; 1987 c.610 §12]

 

      319.260 Fuel in vehicles coming into or leaving state not taxed. Any person coming into or leaving Oregon in a motor vehicle may transport in the fuel tank of such vehicle motor vehicle fuel for the purpose of operating such motor vehicle, without complying with any of the provisions imposed upon dealers by ORS 319.010 to 319.430. However, if motor vehicle fuel so brought into the state is removed from the fuel tank of the vehicle or used for any purpose other than the propulsion of the vehicle, the person so importing the fuel into this state shall be subject to all the provisions of ORS 319.010 to 319.430 and 319.990 applying to dealers. [Amended by 1987 c.610 §12a]

 

      319.270 Fuel sold or distributed to dealers. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 319.020, if the first sale, use or distribution of motor vehicle fuel or aircraft fuel is from one licensed dealer to another licensed dealer, the selling or distributing dealer is not required to pay the license tax imposed by ORS 319.020. When the purchasing or receiving dealer first sells, uses or distributes the fuel, that dealer shall pay the license tax regardless of whether the sale, use or distribution is to another licensed dealer.

      (2) A dealer who renders monthly statements to the Department of Transportation as required by ORS 319.020 and 319.190 shall show separately the number of gallons of motor vehicle fuel sold or delivered to dealers. [Amended by 1987 c.610 §13]

 

      319.275 Liability for taxes, interest and penalties when person importing fuel does not hold license. (1) A person who is not a licensed dealer shall not accept or receive motor vehicle or aircraft fuel in this state from a person who imports motor vehicle or aircraft fuel who does not hold a valid motor vehicle fuel dealer license in this state. If a person who is not a licensed dealer accepts or receives motor vehicle fuel or aircraft fuel from a person who imports motor vehicle fuel or aircraft fuel and does not hold a valid motor vehicle fuel dealer license in this state, the purchaser or receiver shall be liable for all taxes, interest and penalties contained in ORS 319.010 to 319.430.

      (2) A licensed dealer who accepts or receives motor vehicle fuel or aircraft fuel in this state from a person who imports motor vehicle or aircraft fuel who does not hold a valid dealer license in this state shall pay the tax imposed by ORS 319.020 to the Department of Transportation upon the first sale, use or distribution of the motor vehicle fuel or aircraft fuel. [1987 c.610 §22; 1991 c.863 §§18a,21a]

 

      319.280 Refunds generally. (1) Any person who has paid any tax on motor vehicle fuel levied or directed to be paid by ORS 319.010 to 319.430 either directly by the collection of the tax by the vendor from the consumer, or indirectly by adding the amount of the tax to the price of the fuel and paid by the consumer, shall be reimbursed and repaid the amount of such tax paid, except as provided in ORS 319.290 to 319.330, if such person has:

      (a) Purchased and used such fuel for the purpose of operating or propelling a stationary gas engine, a tractor or a motor boat, if the motor boat is used for commercial purposes at any time during the period for which the refund is claimed;

      (b) Purchased and used such fuel for cleaning or dyeing or other commercial use, except when used in motor vehicles operated upon any highway;

      (c) Purchased and exported such fuel from this state, in containers other than fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, provided that the person:

      (A) Exports the motor vehicle fuel from this state to another state, territory or country, not including a federally recognized Indian reservation located wholly or partially within the borders of this state, where the motor vehicle fuel is unloaded; and

      (B) Has a valid motor vehicle fuel dealer’s license or its equivalent issued by the state, territory or country to which the fuel is exported and where it is unloaded;

      (d) Purchased and exported such fuel in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle and has used such fuel to operate the vehicle upon the highways of another state, if the user has paid to the other state a similar motor vehicle fuel tax on the same fuel, or has paid any other highway use tax the rate for which is increased because such fuel was not purchased in, and the tax thereon paid, to such state; or

      (e) Purchased and used such fuel for small engines that are not used to propel motor vehicles on highways, including but not limited to those that power lawn mowers, leaf blowers, chain saws and similar implements.

      (2) When a motor vehicle with auxiliary equipment uses fuel and there is no auxiliary motor for such equipment or separate tank for such a motor, a refund may be claimed and allowed as provided by subsection (4) of this section, except as otherwise provided by this subsection, without the necessity of furnishing proof of the amount of fuel used in the operation of the auxiliary equipment. The person claiming the refund may present to the Department of Transportation a statement of the claim and be allowed a refund as follows:

      (a) For fuel used in pumping aircraft fuel, motor vehicle fuel, fuel or heating oils or other petroleum products by a power take-off unit on a delivery truck, refund shall be allowed claimant for tax paid on fuel purchased at the rate of three-fourths of one gallon for each 1,000 gallons of petroleum products delivered.

      (b) For fuel used in operating a power take-off unit on a cement mixer truck or on a garbage truck, claimant shall be allowed a refund of 25 percent of the tax paid on all fuel used in such a truck.

      (3) When a person purchases and uses motor vehicle fuel in a vehicle equipped with a power take-off unit, a refund may be claimed for fuel used to operate the power take-off unit provided the vehicle is equipped with a metering device approved by the department and designed to operate only while the vehicle is stationary and the parking brake is engaged; the quantity of fuel measured by the metering device shall be presumed to be the quantity of fuel consumed by the operation of the power take-off unit.

      (4) Before any such refund may be granted, the person claiming such refund must present to the department a statement, accompanied by the original invoices, or reasonable facsimiles approved by the department, showing such purchases; provided that in lieu of original invoices or facsimiles, refunds submitted under subsection (1)(d) of this section shall be accompanied by information showing source of the fuel used and evidence of payment of tax to the state in which the fuel was used. The statement shall be made over the signature of the claimant, and shall state the total amount of such fuel for which the claimant is entitled to be reimbursed under subsection (1) of this section. The department upon the presentation of the statement and invoices or facsimiles, or other required documents, shall cause to be repaid to the claimant from the taxes collected on motor vehicle fuel such taxes so paid by the claimant.

      319.290 Limitation on applications for refunds. Applications for refunds made under ORS 319.280, 319.320 and 319.330 must be filed with the Department of Transportation before the expiration of 15 months from the date of purchase or invoice, except that unused fuel reported as an ending inventory on any claim may be included in a subsequent claim if presented not later than 15 months from the filing date of the claim which established the inventory. All applications for refunds based upon exportation of motor vehicle fuel from this state in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle must be filed with the department before the expiration of 15 months from the last day of the month in which the fuel was used, or before the expiration of 15 months from the date of an assessment for unpaid tax by the state in which the fuel was used. [Amended by 1955 c.730 §9; 1963 c.257 §3; 1979 c.344 §5]

 

      319.300 Seller to give invoice for each purchase made by person entitled to refund. (1) When motor vehicle fuel is sold to a person who claims to be entitled to a refund of the tax imposed, the seller of the motor vehicle fuel shall make and deliver at the time of the sale separate invoices for each purchase in such form and containing any information prescribed by the Department of Transportation.

      (2) The invoices shall be legibly written and shall be void if any corrections or erasures appear on the face thereof. Any person who alters any part of any invoice that will tend to give to the claimant an illegal gain, shall have the entire claim invalidated. The seller shall for a period of at least 18 months retain copies of all invoices and make them available to the department upon request. [Amended by 1953 c.77 §2; 1955 c.730 §10; 1957 c.209 §7]

 

      319.310 Claims for refunds may be required to be under oath; investigation of claims. (1) The Department of Transportation may require any person who makes claim for refund of tax upon motor vehicle fuel to furnish a statement, under oath, giving the occupation, description of the machines or equipment in which the motor vehicle fuel was used, the place where used and such other information as the department may require.

      (2) The department may investigate claims and gather and compile such information in regard to the claims as it considers necessary to safeguard the state and prevent fraudulent practices in connection with tax refunds and tax evasions. The department may, in order to establish the validity of any claim, examine the books and records of the claimant for such purposes. The records shall be sufficient to substantiate the accuracy of the claim and shall be in such form and contain such information as the department may require. Failure of the claimant to maintain such records or to accede to the demand for such examination constitutes a waiver of all rights to the refund claimed on account of the transaction questioned. [Amended by 1959 c.186 §4]

 

      319.320 Refund of tax on fuel used in operation of vehicles over certain roads or private property. (1) Upon compliance with subsection (2) or (3) of this section the Department of Transportation shall refund, in the manner provided in subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the tax on motor vehicle fuel that is used in the operation of a motor vehicle:

      (a) By any person on any road, thoroughfare or property in private ownership.

      (b) By any person on any road, thoroughfare or property, other than a state highway, county road or city street, for the removal of forest products, as defined in ORS 321.005, or the products of such forest products converted to a form other than logs at or near the harvesting site, or for the construction or maintenance of the road, thoroughfare or property, pursuant to a written agreement or permit authorizing the use, construction or maintenance of the road, thoroughfare or property, with or by:

      (A) An agency of the United States;

      (B) The State Board of Forestry;

      (C) The State Forester; or

      (D) A licensee of an agency named in subparagraph (A), (B) or (C) of this paragraph.

      (c) By an agency of the United States or of this state or of any county, city or port of this state on any road, thoroughfare or property, other than a state highway, county road or city street.

      (d) By any person on any county road for the removal of forest products, as defined in ORS 321.005, or the products of such forest products converted to a form other than logs at or near the harvesting site, if:

      (A) The use of the county road is pursuant to a written agreement entered into with, or to a permit issued by, the State Board of Forestry, the State Forester or an agency of the United States, authorizing such person to use such road and requiring such person to pay for or to perform the construction or maintenance of the county road;

      (B) The board, officer or agency that entered into the agreement or granted the permit, by contract with the county court or board of county commissioners, has assumed the responsibility for the construction or maintenance of such county road; and

      (C) Copies of the agreements or permits required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph are filed with the department.

      (2) Except for a farmer subject to subsection (3) of this section, the person or agency, as the case may be, who has paid any tax on such motor vehicle fuels levied or directed to be paid, as provided by ORS 319.010 to 319.430, is entitled to claim a refund of the tax so paid on such fuels or for the proportionate part of tax paid on fuels used in the operation of such vehicles, when part of the operations are over such roads, thoroughfares or property. The proportionate part shall be based upon the number of miles traveled by any such vehicle over such roads, thoroughfares or property as compared to the total number of miles traveled by such vehicle. To be eligible to claim such refund the person or agency, as the case may be, shall first establish and maintain a complete record of the operations, miles traveled, gallons of fuel used and other information, in such form and in such detail as the department may prescribe and require, the source of supply of all fuels purchased or used, and the particular vehicles or equipment in which used. Whenever any such claim is received and approved by the department, it shall cause the refund of tax to be paid to the claimant in like manner as provided for paying of other refund claims.

      (3) A farmer who has paid any tax on motor vehicle fuels levied or directed to be paid, as provided in ORS 319.010 to 319.430, is entitled to claim a refund of the tax paid on such fuels used in farming operations in the operation of any motor vehicle on any road, thoroughfare or property in private ownership.

(1) On or before July 15 of each year, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, after consultation with the Department of Transportation and the State Marine Board, shall determine the amount of the motor vehicle fuel tax imposed under ORS 319.010 to 319.430 during the preceding fiscal year with respect to fuel purchased and used to operate or propel motor boats. The amount determined shall be reduced by the amount of any refunds for motor boats used for commercial purposes actually paid during the preceding year on account of ORS 319.280 (1)(a).

      (2)(a) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall estimate the amount of fuel described in subsection (1) of this section that is used to operate or propel motor boats by conducting a statistically valid, unbiased, independent survey of boat owners. The survey shall be conducted once every four years and shall be designed to estimate the average daily fuel consumption by motor boats and the total days of motor boat use per year. The survey shall be used to determine the amount of the transfer required by subsection (3) of this section for the first transfer that occurs after the survey is completed. If the tax rate changes during the fiscal year, the amount of tax to be transferred shall be prorated based on the percentage of total motor boat use taking place during each tax period.

      (b) In years when no survey is conducted, the amount to be transferred under subsection (3) of this section shall be calculated by multiplying the per boat fuel consumption factors from the preceding survey by the number of motor boats as shown by the annual actual count of boat registrations. The resulting amount, in gallons per year, shall be the basis for the determination of the amount to be transferred.

      (c) The survey required by paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be developed by a research department within Oregon State University, in consultation with the State Marine Board and the Department of Transportation. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall contract for the development and conduct of the survey, and the costs shall be paid by the Department of Transportation.

Thereupon, that amount shall be transferred from the Department of Transportation Driver and Motor Vehicle Suspense Account to the:

      (a) Boating Safety, Law Enforcement and Facility Account created under ORS 830.140, and is continuously appropriated to the State Marine Board for the purposes for which the moneys in the Boating Safety, Law Enforcement and Facility Account are appropriated; and

      (b) Marine Navigation Improvement Fund established under ORS 777.267, and is continuously appropriated to the Oregon Business Development Department for the Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority for the purposes of paying for portions of the cost of maintenance dredging projects undertaken with equipment owned by the State of Oregon at publicly owned ports and marinas.

      (4) Of the amounts transferred under subsection (3) of this section, two cents per gallon of fuel shall first be transferred to the Marine Navigation Improvement Fund and the remaining amounts shall be transferred to the Boating Safety, Law Enforcement and Facility Account. [1985 c.152 §4; 1993 c.741 §30; 1999 c.296 §1; 2005 c.22 §227; 2015 c.767 §96; 2017 c.750 §86]

The estimate shall be reduced by the amount of any refunds actually paid on motor vehicle fuel, excluding those paid on aviation gasoline or jet fuel, during the preceding fiscal year pursuant to ORS 319.330 (1).

      (2) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall certify the amount of the estimate made under subsection (1) of this section to the Department of Transportation, the Director of the Oregon Department of Aviation and the State Treasurer. Thereupon, the amount of the estimate shall be transferred from the Department of Transportation Driver and Motor Vehicle Suspense Account to the State Aviation Account and is continuously appropriated to the Oregon Department of Aviation to carry out the purposes of ORS chapters 835, 836 and 837. [1989 c.101 §2; 1993 c.741 §31; 1999 c.935 §28]

 

      319.420 ORS 319.510 to 319.880 not affected. ORS 319.010 to 319.410 do not affect or repeal any of the provisions of ORS 319.510 to 319.880.

The user’s record of fuel used for any purpose, other than fuel obtained from a seller who collected the tax, shall indicate the date the fuel was obtained, the name and address of the seller from whom the fuel was obtained, and the amount of fuel obtained, in gallons.

      (2) In lieu of maintaining an actual record of fuel used, a user required to be licensed under ORS 319.550 who operates a motor vehicle with a light weight of less than 8,000 pounds may maintain an accurate record of miles operated upon Oregon highways.

      (3) Every seller of fuel for any purpose shall keep a record of fuel sold for any purpose and shall be prepared to prove that all the tax provided by ORS 319.530 has been remitted to the department. The department may specify the form of the seller’s record.

The lien shall not be removed until the tax has been paid or the motor vehicle subject to the lien has been sold in payment of such tax. The lien is paramount to all private liens or encumbrances of whatever character upon the motor vehicle and to the rights of any conditional vendor or any other holder of the legal title in or to the motor vehicle.

Thereafter any person so notified shall neither transfer nor make other disposition of such credits, personal property or debts until the department has consented to a transfer or other disposition or until 30 days have elapsed from and after the receipt of the notice. All persons so notified shall, within five days after the receipt of the notice, advise the department of all such credits, personal property or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them, as the case may be.

      (3) Notice of the intended sale and the time and place thereof shall be given to the delinquent user and to all persons appearing of record to have an interest in the motor vehicle. The notice shall be given in writing at least 10 days before the date set for the sale by enclosing it in an envelope addressed to the user at the address as it appears in the records of the department and, in the case of any person appearing of record to have an interest in the motor vehicle, addressed to the person at the last-known residence or place of business, and depositing the envelope in the United States mail, postage prepaid. In addition, the notice shall be published at least three times, the first of which shall be not less than 10 days before the date set for the sale, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the motor vehicle seized is to be sold. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, the notice shall be posted in three public places in the county for such period of 10 days.

      (4) The notice shall contain a description of the motor vehicle to be sold, together with a statement of the amount due under ORS 319.510 to 319.880, the name of the user and the further statement that unless such amount is paid before the time fixed in the notice the motor vehicle will be sold in accordance with law and such notice.

      (5) The department shall then proceed to sell the motor vehicle in accordance with the law and the notice, and shall deliver to the purchaser a bill of sale which shall vest title in the purchaser. If upon any such sale the moneys received exceed the amount due to the state under ORS 319.510 to 319.880 from the delinquent user, the excess shall be returned to the user and the receipt obtained therefor. If any person having an interest in or lien upon the motor vehicle has filed with the department prior to the sale notice of such interest or lien, the department shall withhold payment of any such excess to the user pending a determination of the rights of the respective parties thereto by a court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason the receipt of the user shall not be available, the department shall deposit the excess with the State Treasurer as trustee for the user or for the heirs, successors or assigns of the user.

      (2) In any suit brought to enforce the rights of the state under ORS 319.510 to 319.880, a certificate by the department showing the delinquency is prima facie evidence of the amount of the obligation, of the delinquency thereof and of compliance by the department with all provisions of ORS 319.510 to 319.880 relating to the obligation. [Amended by 1959 c.188 §25]

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the debtor found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the debtor found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect obligations under this section, and in the execution of the warrant the agent has all of the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.
