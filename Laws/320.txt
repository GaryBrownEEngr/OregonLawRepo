      (2) If an amusement device is operated in this state without a tax imposed by ORS 320.005 to 320.150 having been paid on or before 30 days after the date the tax is due, a penalty of $200 shall be imposed.

      (3) The penalty imposed in subsection (2) of this section shall be waived if the sole reason the tax was not paid is because of the failure of the Oregon State Lottery to act under the agreement described in ORS 320.150. [1999 c.501 §6; 2005 c.94 §92]

 

      320.080 Procedure on failure to pay tax or penalty. (1) If any tax or penalty imposed by ORS 320.005 to 320.150 is not paid as required by ORS 320.005 to 320.150 within 30 days after the date that the written notice and demand for payment required under ORS 305.895 is mailed, the Department of Revenue shall issue a warrant for the payment of the amount of the tax, with the added penalty and the cost of executing the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed or delivered to the taxpayer by the department at the taxpayer’s last-known address.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the taxpayer found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect taxes, and in the execution of the warrant the agent has all of the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (4) Until a warrant issued under this section is satisfied in full, the department has the same remedies to enforce the claim for taxes against the taxpayer as if the state had recovered judgment against the taxpayer for the amount of the tax. [Amended by 1981 c.677 §7; 1983 c.696 §13; 1985 c.761 §16; 1989 c.625 §77; 2003 c.576 §202; 2005 c.94 §93; 2011 c.389 §2; 2011 c.661 §5]

      (2) All revenues received under this section by the treasurers of the several counties shall be placed in the general fund of each county to be expended by the county courts or the board of county commissioners of the several counties for general governmental expenses. [Amended by 1959 c.143 §1; 1963 c.644 §3; 1967 c.323 §1; 1969 c.230 §1; 1989 c.786 §3; 1991 c.459 §272e; 1993 c.803 §11; 1995 c.259 §3; 1999 c.501 §7; 2013 c.768 §133a]

      320.140 Tax does not legalize ownership, display or operation in violation of law. Nothing in ORS 320.005 to 320.150 shall be construed as licensing, authorizing or legalizing the ownership, possession, display or operation, in violation of any law of this state, of any amusement device. [Amended by 1993 c.270 §64; 1993 c.803 §14; 2005 c.94 §97]

 

      320.150 Oregon State Lottery assistance in tax collection responsibilities.

The agreement is not intended to preclude performance by the department of collection functions as from time to time may be required, nor is the agreement intended to preclude the performance of functions by the Oregon State Lottery, under less formal arrangements made with the department, with respect to the tax imposed under ORS 320.005 to 320.150 if the functions are not specifically mentioned in the agreement. The collection of taxes under ORS 320.005 to 320.150 by the Oregon State Lottery does not render the Oregon State Lottery or the agents and employees of the Oregon State Lottery responsible for collection of the tax. [1993 c.803 §13; 1999 c.501 §9; 2005 c.94 §98]
