      321.010 [Repealed by 1953 c.375 §38]

 

      321.011 Policy. The prevention and suppression of forest fires on forestlands for the preservation of forest resources and the continuous growth of timber on lands suitable therefor are declared to be the public policy of the State of Oregon. The Legislative Assembly recognizes that:

      (1) The forested areas situated within eastern Oregon predominate in Ponderosa pine trees and associated species, and that the forested areas situated within western Oregon predominate in Douglas fir and associated species;

      (2) Because of this difference in species, different forest fire protection problems exist in eastern and western Oregon, and different logging conditions and circumstances in each necessitate varied forest practices in the disposal of forest slashings and debris; and

      (3) Therefore, in order to give recognition to such differences and their effect on the accomplishment of the public policy stated in this section, certain classifications of forestlands within the State of Oregon are established by ORS 321.005 to 321.185 and 321.560 to 321.600. [1957 c.309 §2; 2005 c.94 §100]

 

      321.012 Public to share cost of suppressing fires caused by public. The Legislative Assembly finds that it is in the interest of the State of Oregon that the public as a whole share responsibility for protecting the forests of this state, by making funds available from time to time for suppression of fires caused by the public. [1967 c.429 §60]

 

      321.015 Levy of privilege taxes upon harvest of timber for certain purposes; exclusion. (1) For the calendar years beginning January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2019, there is levied a privilege tax of 90.00 cents per thousand feet, board measure, upon taxpayers for the privilege of harvesting of all merchantable forest products harvested on forestlands. Subject to ORS 321.145, the proceeds of the tax shall be transferred as provided in ORS 321.152 (2) to the Forest Research and Experiment Account for use for the forest resource research, experimentation and studies described in ORS 526.215 and for the Forest Research Laboratory established under ORS 526.225.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 477.760, in addition to the tax levied by subsection (1) of this section, there is levied a forest products harvest tax upon taxpayers of 62.5 cents per thousand feet, board measure, for the privilege of harvesting all merchantable forest products harvested on forestlands for the payment of benefits related to fire suppression as provided in ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 and 477.440 to 477.460.

      (3) For the calendar years beginning January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2019, in addition to the taxes levied under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, there is levied a privilege tax upon taxpayers for the privilege of harvesting all merchantable forest products harvested on forestlands in the amount of 156.61 cents per thousand feet, board measure, for the purpose of administering the Oregon Forest Practices Act in an amount not to exceed 40 percent of the total expenditures approved by the Legislative Assembly for this purpose, including salary adjustments approved by the Legislative Assembly for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

      (4) For the calendar years beginning January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2019, in addition to the taxes levied by subsections (1) to (3) of this section, there is levied a privilege tax of 10 cents per thousand feet, board measure, upon taxpayers for the privilege of harvesting all merchantable forest products harvested on forestlands. Subject to ORS 321.145, the proceeds of the tax shall be transferred as provided in ORS 321.152 (5) to the subaccount established pursuant to ORS 350.520 for use by Oregon State University for the purpose of making investments in professional forestry education at the College of Forestry.

      (5) Subject to subsection (6) of this section, the taxes shall be measured by and be applicable to each per thousand feet, board measure, on the total quantity of forest products harvested in this state measured by use of any log scale which is or may be in general use in the logging industry and which is designed to measure total volume of merchantable forest products in board feet. However, if the Department of Revenue finds that the scale used by any taxpayer in computing the taxes due under ORS 321.005 to 321.185 and 321.560 to 321.600 does not accurately reflect the total quantity of merchantable forest products harvested by the taxpayer, it may require the taxpayer to adopt another log scale in general use in the industry which in the department’s opinion will accurately reflect merchantable harvest in board feet.

      (6) The first 25,000 feet, board measure, of forest products harvested annually by any taxpayer during each calendar year shall be excluded from the total quantity of harvested forest products that constitutes the measure of the taxes under ORS 321.005 to 321.185 and 321.560 to 321.600. [1953 c.375 §2; 1957 c.309 §14; 1981 c.321 §10; 1985 c.759 §6; 1989 c.769 §1; 1991 c.459 §273; 1991 c.639 §1; 1993 c.653 §2; 1995 c.507 §1; 1997 c.519 §1; 1999 c.968 §§1,1a; 1999 c.1061 §1; 2001 c.872 §1; 2003 c.769 §1; 2005 c.796 §1; 2007 c.779 §1; 2007 c.852 §1; 2009 c.763 §1; 2011 c.594 §1; 2013 c.639 §1; 2015 c.714 §1; 2017 c.621 §1]

      321.017 Levy of additional privilege tax; distribution to Oregon Forest Resources Institute Fund. (1) In addition to the taxes levied under ORS 321.015 (1) to (4), there hereby is levied a privilege tax upon taxpayers on the harvesting of all merchantable forest products harvested on forestlands in the amount provided in subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) The rate of tax levied in subsection (1) of this section shall be established annually at the beginning of each calendar year by the board of directors of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute, at a rate not to exceed 75 cents per thousand feet, board measure, adjusted annually for inflation since 1991 based on the Consumer Price Index (Portland area -- all items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the Portland, Oregon, area.

      (3) The tax shall be measured by and be applicable to each per thousand feet, board measure, and such shall be subject to and determined by the procedures and provisions of ORS 321.015 (5) and (6).

      (4) The tax levied by subsection (1) of this section shall be due and payable to the Department of Revenue in the manner and procedure, including penalties and interest, as set forth for the collection of the privilege tax in ORS 321.005 to 321.185.

      (5) The revenue from the tax levied by subsection (1) of this section shall be remitted to the State Treasurer who shall deposit it in a suspense account established under ORS 321.145 (1). After payment of refunds, which shall be paid in the same manner as other forest products harvest tax refunds are paid in ORS 321.145 (2), the balance of the additional tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section shall be deposited in the Oregon Forest Resources Institute Fund. [1991 c.949 §22; 1993 c.653 §4; 1999 c.968 §§2,2a; 2001 c.872 §2; 2003 c.769 §2; 2013 c.639 §2; 2017 c.621 §2]

      321.045 Payment of tax; returns; estimated tax; payment. (1) The taxes levied under ORS 321.015 shall be due and payable annually, on or before the last day of January, for the preceding year. The tax shall be delinquent if not paid by the due date, which shall be determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return.

      (2) Subject to the provisions relating to estimated tax payments provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, on or before the last day of January, each taxpayer shall make out a return on the form prescribed by the Department of Revenue showing the amount of the tax for which the taxpayer is liable for the preceding year and the other information the department considers necessary to correctly determine the tax due and shall mail or deliver the return, together with a remittance for the amount of the tax, to the office of the department. The return shall be signed and verified by the taxpayer or a duly authorized agent of the taxpayer. Whenever in its judgment good cause exists, the department may allow upon written application made on or before the due date further time not exceeding 30 days for filing a return.

At least one-quarter of the estimated tax shall be remitted to the department with each estimated tax report and the balance shall be remitted to the department on or before the due date of the tax return required by subsection (2) of this section, without regard for any extension of the due date thereof.

      (5) If the amount remitted with an estimated tax report filed on or before the due date thereof is at least 25 percent of the tax of the taxpayer as due for the calendar year preceding the year for which the report is made or at least 20 percent of the taxpayer’s tax liability as due for the year for which the report is made, or 100 percent of the tax liability on the actual merchantable forest products harvested for the calendar quarter preceding the due date of the estimated tax report, no penalty or interest shall be charged. Otherwise a penalty in the form of interest at the rate established under ORS 305.220 shall be assessed for the period of delinquency calculated on the difference between the payment made and the payment that would have been due had the taxpayer estimated the liability for the quarter in an amount equal to the liability as due for such quarter.

FORESTLAND VALUATION

 

      321.201 Definition of “forestland” for ORS 321.201 to 321.222. As used in ORS 321.201 to 321.222, “forestland” means either forestland, as defined in ORS 321.257, that is located in western Oregon or forestland, as defined in ORS 321.805, that is located in eastern Oregon. [2001 c.860 §13]

 

      321.204 Legislative findings and declarations. The Legislative Assembly finds that an accurate system of annually determining forestland values in this state is vital to achieving a fair and equitable system of taxing the forest resources of this state. The Legislative Assembly declares that an annual determination of forestland values is the process that best achieves an accurate assessment of forestland in this state. [2001 c.860 §14]

 

      321.205 [1953 c.375 §23; repealed by 1961 c.297 §12]

 

      321.207 Valuation models; rules. (1) The Department of Revenue by rule shall develop valuation models to be used to value forestland in western Oregon and eastern Oregon.

      (2) The valuation models may consider forestland sales, stumpage values, immediate harvest values, log prices or other commercially reasonable factors or data that promote real market value analysis of forestland. [2001 c.860 §15]

 

      321.210 Proposed specially assessed values; notice; comments; hearing. (1) Pursuant to the valuation models adopted by the Department of Revenue under ORS 321.207 and for the purpose of certifying specially assessed values of forestland under ORS 321.354 and 321.833, for each tax year the Department of Revenue shall give notice of proposed specially assessed values of forestland. The values shall be proposed by the department on or before April 1 of the assessment year.

      (2) The specially assessed values proposed under this section and certified under ORS 321.216 for forestland in western Oregon shall be for land classes FA, FB, FC, FD, FE, FF, FG and FX.

      (6) Prior to adopting specially assessed values of forestland for a tax year, the department shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed specially assessed values. Any person interested in providing testimony on the proposed specially assessed values shall be given the opportunity to do so at the hearing. [2001 c.860 §16]

 

      321.213 Forestland value advisory committee. (1) At any time, the Department of Revenue may convene a forestland value advisory committee to assist the department in developing a valuation model under ORS 321.207 or in determining specially assessed values of forestland. If the department convenes a committee, it shall be composed of members appointed by the Director of the Department of Revenue. In appointing members, the director shall strive to include representation of counties, the State Forestry Department and large and small forestland owners from western Oregon and eastern Oregon.

      (2) The Department of Revenue shall provide staff and administrative support to facilitate the work of a committee convened by the department. [2001 c.860 §17]

 

      321.215 [1953 c.375 §18; 1957 c.309 §7; 1961 c.297 §7; repealed by 1985 c.759 §40]

 

      321.216 Certified specially assessed values. (1) On or before June 1 of each assessment year, the Department of Revenue shall adopt specially assessed values of forestland, as of the assessment date for that year. The department shall certify the specially assessed values of forestland in eastern Oregon to the county assessors of eastern Oregon and the specially assessed values of forestland in western Oregon to the county assessors of western Oregon.

      (2) The certified specially assessed values constitute:

      (a) The department’s determination of the real market value, as of the assessment date for the tax year, of highest and best use forestland in the land class for which the certification is being made; and

      (b) The specially assessed values, as of the assessment date for the tax year, of designated forestland that is assessed under ORS 321.354 and 321.833 in the land class for which the certification is being made.

      (3) Upon receipt of the certified values, the county assessors shall develop tables for each assessment year that reflect, for each class and area, the values determined under this section and that express the values as values per acre. [2001 c.860 §18]

 

      321.219 Appeal of certified specially assessed values; notice; effect of decision modifying values; rules. (1) At any time following certification of the specially assessed values under ORS 321.216 and before July 1 of the tax year, five or more taxpayers owning in the aggregate not less than five percent of the total forestland in a single land market area may appeal any or all of the specially assessed values so certified.

      (2) Appeals under this section shall be made to the Oregon Tax Court by filing a joint petition with the tax court in the manner provided for appeals from orders of the county boards of property tax appeals. The petition shall designate one of the taxpayers as the representative of all of the taxpayers, and all proceedings before the tax court and any appeal from its determination shall be conducted procedurally as though the designated representative were the only petitioner.

      (3) Notice of the appeal shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Department of Revenue by rule. The notice shall designate the specially assessed values appealed and include a statement of the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) of this section.

      (4) Unless an appeal is resolved prior to September 15 of the tax year and results in a change in a specially assessed value that was certified under ORS 321.216, then notwithstanding the appeal of a certified specially assessed value, the certified specially assessed values shall be entered on the assessment and tax roll for the year and the property taxes for the tax year shall be imposed on those values.

      (5) If a decision by the tax court, or by the Oregon Supreme Court following an appeal of a tax court decision:

      (a) Results in a decrease in a specially assessed value certified under ORS 321.216, any refund of tax arising as a result of the decision shall be made by reducing the tax imposed on forestland affected by the decision in the first tax year following the decision.

      (b) Results in an increase in a specially assessed value certified under ORS 321.216, any additional taxes becoming due shall be payable without interest if paid prior to the 16th day of the month following the month in which the final order of the court is issued. If the additional taxes are not paid within this period, the additional taxes shall thereafter be considered delinquent and shall bear interest at the rate provided in ORS 311.505.

SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF WESTERN OREGON FORESTLAND

 

      321.257 Definitions for ORS 321.257 to 321.390. As used in ORS 321.257 to 321.390, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Department” means the Department of Revenue.

      (2) “Forestland” means land in western Oregon that is being held or used for the predominant purpose of growing and harvesting trees of a marketable species and has been designated as forestland or land in western Oregon, the highest and best use of which is the growing and harvesting of such trees. Trees of a marketable species may vary in different areas in western Oregon and may change as the utilization of forest trees changes. The size, age, location, quality and condition of trees do not necessarily determine marketable species. Forestland often contains isolated openings which because of rock outcrops, river wash, swamps, chemical conditions of the soil, brush and other like conditions prevent adequate stocking of such openings for the production of trees of a marketable species. If the openings in their natural state are necessary to hold the surrounding forestland in forest use through sound management practices, the openings are deemed forestland. Forestland does not include buildings, structures, machinery, equipment or fixtures erected upon, under or above the soil. Forestland includes roads described in ORS 308.236.

      (3) “Land class” or “land classes” means one of the eight classifications of forestland, used for assessment purposes by the department, based upon State Tax Commission Valuation Division Supplements published in 1967, and identified in ORS 321.210.

      (4) “State Forester” means the State Forester or the authorized representative of the State Forester.

      (5) “Sustained yield management” means the growing and harvesting of timber crops on a continuous basis on land that is primarily dedicated to timber production.

      (6) “Taxing district” or “district” means each county, city, school district and other corporation vested with the power to levy property taxes in western Oregon.

      (7) “Timber” means all logs which can be measured in board feet and other forest products as determined by department rule.

      (8) “Western Oregon” means that portion of the state lying west of a line beginning at the intersection of the northern boundary of the State of Oregon and the western boundary of Wasco County, thence southerly along the western boundaries of the counties of Wasco, Jefferson, Deschutes and Klamath to the southern boundary of the State of Oregon. [1977 c.892 §1; 1983 c.539 §2; 1985 c.759 §18; 1989 c.1083 §1; 1993 c.653 §6; 1993 c.801 §1; 1999 c.1078 §12; 2003 c.621 §1]

 

      321.259 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Multiple taxation through a yearly ad valorem levy on both trees and forestland managed in sustained yield timber operations discourages conservation, private ownership and investment of capital.

      (2) The interests of this state, its residents and its future residents are best served by sustained yield practices and taxing policies that encourage production of forest resources for commerce, recreation and watersheds, stabilize employment levels, prevent large population shifts and encourage millage of timber products within Oregon.

      (3) Timber on private lands managed on a sustained yield basis should be treated as a crop and not taxed as real property.

      (4) Forestland should be taxed based on the value of the forestland in timber production. [1993 c.801 §3; 2003 c.621 §2; 2017 c.315 §26]

 

      321.260 [Formerly 528.020; repealed by 1977 c.892 §51]

 

      321.262 Purposes. The purposes of ORS 321.257 to 321.390 are:

      (1) To impose with respect to forestlands in western Oregon a special assessment program whereby the value of forestland is determined as prescribed in ORS 321.201 to 321.222.

      (2) To establish a special assessment program as a means of:

      (a) Recognizing the long-term nature of the forest crop and fostering the public policy of Oregon to encourage the growing and harvesting of timber.

      (b) Protecting the public welfare by assuring that the people of this state and future generations shall have the benefits to be derived from the continuous production of forest products from private forestlands.

      (c) Promoting this state’s policy of encouraging forestry and the restocking of forestlands to provide present and future benefits by enhancing the water supply, preventing erosion, providing habitat for wildlife, providing scenic and recreational opportunities and providing for needed products. [1977 c.892 §2; 1993 c.801 §4; 2003 c.621 §3; 2017 c.315 §27]

      (a) The land is prepared using intensive cultivation methods and is cleared of competing vegetation for at least three years after tree planting;

      (b) The timber is of a species marketable as fiber for inclusion in the furnish for manufacturing paper products;

      (c) The timber is harvested on a rotation cycle within 12 years after planting; and

      (d) The land and timber are subject to intensive agricultural practices such as fertilization, insect and disease control, cultivation and irrigation.

      (4) Small tract forestland qualified under ORS 321.700 to 321.754 and timber harvested from small tract forestland qualified under ORS 321.700 to 321.754.

      321.347 Land designations; classifications; certain election by landowners. For the purposes of ORS 321.257 to 321.390:

      (1) All land in western Oregon valued as forestland for ad valorem property tax purposes on January 1, 1977, shall retain that classification for the purposes of ORS 321.257 to 321.390 unless it is specifically excluded from the provisions thereof or unless it is removed from that classification as provided in ORS 321.359 or is no longer land the highest and best use of which is forestland.

      (2) Land designated as forestland pursuant to ORS 321.605 to 321.680 (1975 Replacement Part) shall retain the original date of such designation.

      (3) Lands classified as reforestation lands as of July 1, 1977, pursuant to ORS 321.255 to 321.360 (1975 Replacement Part) shall be considered to have been designated as forestland from the date of original classification as reforestation lands. Any lands so classified prior to February 1, 1972, shall be presumed to have been designated not earlier than February 1, 1972.

      (4) Pursuant to the election of the owner, as provided in section 45, chapter 892, Oregon Laws 1977, land which, as of January 1, 1977, was designated under the provisions of ORS 321.705 to 321.765 (2001 Edition) shall be considered to have been designated as forestland for the purposes of ORS 321.257 to 321.390 from the date of the original designation under those provisions. Any lands so designated prior to January 1, 1972, shall be presumed to have been designated not earlier than January 1, 1972, for the purposes of additional taxes imposed by ORS 308A.700 to 308A.733. [1977 c.892 §23; 1979 c.553 §10; 1981 c.419 §7; 1991 c.459 §289; 1999 c.19 §5; 1999 c.314 §§68,68a; 2003 c.454 §115; 2003 c.621 §7a]

 

      321.348 Assignment of forestland to land classes; change in class. (1) For each tax year, forestland shall be assigned by the Department of Revenue to land classes as defined in ORS 321.257.

      (2) Land classes assigned under subsection (1) of this section may be changed thereafter by the department upon the initiative of the department, or upon the request of an owner, if further investigation reveals that the basis for the land class determination was inaccurate. Any such redetermination of land class shall be certified immediately to the county assessor. [1993 c.801 §17; 2003 c.621 §8]

 

      321.349 Valuation of certain forestland at farm use value. (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, land that is changed from farm use special assessment under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 to special assessment as forestland under ORS 321.257 to 321.390, at the election of the owner made under rules adopted by the Department of Revenue, shall not be valued under ORS 308.205, 308.232 and 321.257 to 321.390 for the tax year of the change and years thereafter in which such special forestland assessment is in effect for the land, but shall be valued under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128, if:

      (a) The land has been assessed under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 for at least the 10 consecutive years immediately prior to the year for which the change is first effective;

      (b) The planting of the timber takes place after October 15, 1983, and qualifies for the current tax year for special assessment as forestland under ORS 321.257 to 321.390;

      (c) The timber on the land is of an average age of less than 40 years; and

      (d) The land is held by an owner having a total ownership of forestland in western Oregon not in excess of 2,000 acres, as determined under subsection (3) of this section.

      (2) If timber on land valued under subsection (1) of this section reaches, for any tax year, an average age of 40 years or more, this section shall cease to apply. However, without application and without any additional tax, interest or penalty, the land shall for that tax year and for each year thereafter for which the land is qualified, be valued under ORS 308.205, 308.232 and 321.257 to 321.390.

      (3) In computing a forestland owner’s acreage for purposes of subsection (1) of this section, total ownership of the owner’s forestland, as defined in ORS 321.257, in western Oregon shall be included.

      (4)(a) An owner may not have forestland valued under subsection (1) of this section if the owner, or any individual having a share in the owner, has a spouse, brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant who is an owner, or who holds a share in an owner having forestland valued under subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) The county assessor may grant exceptions to paragraph (a) of this subsection if the owner satisfactorily demonstrates that the combination of ownership with the indicated relatives arose from bona fide business reasons other than a desire to circumvent the 2,000 acre limitation imposed under subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) As used in this section, “total ownership” includes:

      (a) Forestland owned by an owner individually; and

      (b) Forestland owned by any corporate or other group or entity in which an owner of the corporation, group or entity owns a 10 percent or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the corporation, group or entity.

      321.354 Common ownership minimum acreage requirements; specially assessed value and maximum assessed value of forestland of large landowners. (1)(a) The Department of Revenue shall identify the forestland that is held in common ownership of 5,000 acres or more as of the assessment date for each tax year.

      (b) Forestland that the department has identified under paragraph (a) of this subsection that, for the previous tax year, was subject to small tract forestland assessment shall be disqualified from small tract forestland assessment and shall be subject to special assessment as provided in this section as of the first tax year the forestland is held in common ownership of 5,000 acres or more.

      (c) For purposes of this subsection, “forestland” includes land that meets the definition of forestland under ORS 321.805.

      (2) Forestland assessed under this section shall have a specially assessed value per acre equal to the value certified to the county assessor for the tax year under ORS 321.216 for the applicable land class of the forestland.

      (3) For each land class described in ORS 321.210, the forestland maximum assessed value per acre shall equal 103 percent of the forestland assessed value per acre for the preceding tax year or 100 percent of the forestland maximum assessed value per acre for the preceding tax year, whichever is greater.

      (4)(a) The assessor shall compute the assessed value of forestland by multiplying the acreage of the forestland in each land class by the lesser of:

      (A) The specially assessed value per acre; or

      (B) The maximum assessed value per acre.

      (b) If the forestland being assessed consists of different land classes, the assessed value of the forestland shall be the sum of the assessed values computed for each land class under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, the forestland shall be assessed as provided in ORS 308.232 if the real market value of the forestland is less than the value established under subsection (4) of this section.

      (6) For purposes of this section:

      (a) The department shall certify to the county assessor of a county in which forestland identified in subsection (1) of this section is located a list of the property tax accounts containing forestland so identified.

      (b) Forestland shall be considered to be in common ownership if the forestland is owned by the person directly or is owned by a corporation, partnership, association or other entity in which the person owns a majority interest.

      (c) Additional taxes may not be imposed as a result of a disqualification under subsection (1) of this section.

      (d) The notification requirements and other procedures that the county assessor must follow in disqualifying forestland do not apply to a disqualification occurring under subsection (1) of this section.

      (e) The department shall notify the county assessor of forestland identified under subsection (1)(a) of this section that is located in that county. [1999 c.1078 §§2,7; 2001 c.860 §2; 2003 c.454 §67]

      (b) Subject to the provisions of ORS 321.257, the land does not substantially meet minimum stocking or acreage requirements under rules adopted by the department. Otherwise, the determination whether the land is properly classifiable as forestland shall be made with due regard to all relevant evidence and without any one or more items of evidence necessarily being determinative.

      (5) The application shall be deemed to have been approved unless, within three months of the date such application was delivered to the assessor or prior to August 15, whichever is later, the assessor shall notify the applicant in writing of the extent to which the application is denied.

      321.359 Removal of designation; appeal from reassessment or denial; requalification. (1)(a) When land has once been designated as forestland either as a result of an application being filed therefor or through the application of ORS 321.347 (3) or (4), it shall be valued as such until the assessor removes the forestland designation under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) The county assessor shall remove the forestland designation upon:

(1) Notwithstanding ORS 308.210, 311.405 or 311.410, if land designated as forestland is subject to disqualification by the county assessor as a result of the discovery that the land is no longer forestland, the disqualification shall be deemed to occur as of the January 1 assessment date of the assessment year in which the discovery occurs.

      (2) This section applies only if notice of the disqualification is mailed by the county assessor prior to August 15 of the tax year for which the disqualification of the land is asserted. [2003 c.621 §15; 2017 c.25 §1]

 

      321.367 Forestland management; effect of failure to manage forestland in accordance with management plan; rules. (1) The State Forester shall identify all of the forestlands that fail to meet the minimum stocking required under ORS 527.610 to 527.770 and that are therefore underproductive as described under ORS 526.455.

      (2) At any time the State Forester has reason to believe that forestland is not being managed as forestland, the State Forester shall review the owner’s management plan, if any, and inspect the property. Subject to subsection (5) of this section, the State Forester shall advise the owner as prescribed in subsection (3) of this section if the State Forester determines the land is not being managed in accordance with a plan that provides for:

      (a) Regeneration of all suitable nonstocked land;

      (b) Maintenance of a free-to-grow condition;

      (c) Protection from fire, insects, disease, animal damage, undesirable vegetative competition; and

      (d) Final harvest.

      (3)(a) The State Forester shall advise the owner that the land is not being managed in accordance with a plan that meets the criteria set forth in subsection (2) of this section and that a plan for the land that does meet the criteria must be developed and activated within one year after the date of the advisement.

      (b) At the request of the owner, the State Forester shall assign a forester or provide a listing of foresters to assist the owner in developing and implementing an appropriate management plan for the land.

      (c) As soon as practicable after the time indicated in the advisement has expired, the State Forester shall view the land to determine if the land is being managed in accordance with a plan that meets the criteria set forth in subsection (2) of this section. If, upon inspection, the State Forester finds that the land is not being so managed, the State Forester shall notify the owner and the county assessor.

      (4) The county assessor, upon receipt of the notice from the State Forester, shall cease to treat that land as forestland under ORS 321.257 to 321.390 and shall value the land as prescribed under ORS 308.146 and 308.232.

      (5) If at the time that the State Forester views the land under subsection (3)(c) of this section, it is determined that a change in ownership has occurred, the State Forester shall notify the new owner as required under subsection (3) of this section in the manner of the original notification.

      (6) When the owner of land disqualified from forestland assessment provides satisfactory information to the State Forester of subsequent action taken to correct the deficiency resulting in the disqualification of land, or provides an acceptable management plan to correct such deficiency, the State Forester shall so indicate to the county assessor. The assessor shall then assess the land under ORS 321.257 to 321.390, if the land is otherwise qualified for such assessment.

      (7) The State Forester shall adopt rules necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. [1977 c.892 §28a; 1979 c.454 §5; 1983 c.669 §1; 1987 c.158 §53; 1991 c.854 §7; 1993 c.801 §38b; 2003 c.621 §19; 2005 c.94 §103]

GENERALLY

 

      321.550 Notice of intent to harvest; rules; effect of failure to file notice; penalty. (1) No person shall harvest or cause to be harvested any timber from land in Oregon without first having notified the State Forester in writing with a copy to the Department of Revenue on forms prepared by the State Forester and the department of intent to harvest pursuant to ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 and 321.700 to 321.754.

      (2) The notification shall specify where and when the harvest will take place and the nature of the harvest and shall include maps and other data as required by the State Forester and the department. The department shall establish by rule procedures to assure the receipt of the tax returns sent out or a report of nonharvest from the person. The department shall conduct field and office audits to ascertain the correctness of any timber tax return.

      (3)(a) If a person fails to file a written notice as required in subsection (1) of this section with respect to any harvest over 5,000 board feet, the department shall notify the person. If, after the person has been notified, the person fails to file a written notice as required in subsection (1) of this section with respect to any subsequent harvest over 5,000 board feet, there shall be added to the amount of the timber tax required to be shown on the return as a result of the subsequent harvest a delinquency penalty of $250 for each violation occurring within a calendar year. The department shall collect the penalty in the same manner as taxes are collected.

      (b) No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection if a penalty for failure to file the notice with the State Forester has been imposed under ORS 527.992.

      (c) The delinquency penalty shall first be added to the small tract forestland timber severance tax imposed under ORS 321.700 to 321.754, if applicable to the harvest. If the small tract forestland timber severance tax is not applicable, the delinquency penalty shall be added to the forest products harvest tax imposed under ORS 321.005 to 321.185. [1985 c.759 §2; 1989 c.588 §4; 1991 c.459 §305; 1993 c.801 §41; 2003 c.454 §54; 2003 c.621 §39a]

 

      321.560 Audit of returns; interest and penalties upon failure to file return or pay tax. (1) The provisions of ORS chapters 305 and 314 as to the audit and examination of reports and returns, determination of deficiencies, liens, assessments, claims for refund, conferences and appeals to the Oregon Tax Court, and the procedures relating thereto, apply to the determination of taxes, penalties and interest imposed under ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754, except where the context requires otherwise.

      (2) If a taxpayer fails to file a return required by ORS 321.045 or 321.700 to 321.754, or fails to pay a tax at the time the tax becomes due, there shall be added to the amount of tax required to be shown on the return a delinquency penalty of five percent of the amount of such tax.

      (3) If the failure to file a return continues for a period in excess of three months after the due date, there shall be added to the amount of tax required to be shown on the return a failure to file penalty of 20 percent of the amount of such tax. This penalty is in addition to the delinquency penalty imposed by subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) If all or any part of the delinquency or deficiency for which a determination is made is due to fraud or an intent to evade the provisions of ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754, or the rules adopted thereunder, a penalty of 100 percent of such delinquency or deficiency shall be added, plus interest at the rate established under ORS 305.220, computed on the full amount of the delinquency or deficiency plus penalty, from the time the return was due.

      (5) For purposes of this section, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax that is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax that may be lawfully claimed upon the return.

      (6) A delinquent tax or a deficiency shall bear interest at the rate established under ORS 305.220 from the time the return was due. [Formerly 321.055; 1991 c.459 §306; 1995 c.53 §4; 1995 c.350 §5; 1995 c.650 §95; 2003 c.454 §55; 2003 c.621 §40a; 2017 c.278 §14]

 

      321.570 Warrant for collection of delinquent taxes. (1) If any tax imposed by ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754, or any portion of the tax, is not paid within 30 days after the date that the written notice and demand for payment required under ORS 305.895 is mailed, the Department of Revenue may issue a warrant for the payment of the amount of the tax, with the added penalties, interest and cost of executing the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed or delivered to the taxpayer by the department at the taxpayer’s last-known address.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the taxpayer found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect this tax. In the execution of the warrant the agent has the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (4) Until a warrant issued under this section is satisfied in full, the department has the same remedies to enforce the claim for taxes against the taxpayer as if the state had recovered judgment against the taxpayer for the amount of the tax. [Formerly 321.075; 1989 c.625 §78; 2003 c.454 §56; 2003 c.576 §203; 2003 c.621 §41a; 2011 c.389 §3; 2011 c.661 §6]

 

      321.580 Effect of failure or refusal to make return. If any taxpayer neglects or refuses to make a return required to be made by ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754, the Department of Revenue is authorized to determine the tax due, based upon any information in its possession or that may come into its possession. The department shall give the taxpayer written notice of the tax and delinquency charges and the tax and delinquency charges shall be a lien from the time of severance. If the tax and delinquency charges are not paid within 30 days from the mailing of the notice, the department shall proceed to collect the tax in the manner provided in ORS 321.570. [Formerly 321.092; 2003 c.454 §57; 2003 c.621 §42a]

 

      321.590 [Formerly 321.095; repealed by 1993 c.801 §43]

 

      321.600 Tax as debt; collection; limitation. All taxes, interest and penalties due and unpaid under ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754 constitute a debt due the State of Oregon and may be collected, together with interest, penalty and costs, by appropriate judicial proceeding, which remedy is in addition to all other existing remedies. However, no proceeding for the collection of taxes under ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754 shall be instituted after the expiration of six years from the date the taxes were due.

      321.605 [1961 c.659 §2; 1963 c.60 §2; 1967 c.543 §1; 1975 c.745 §1; repealed by 1977 c.892 §51]

 

      321.609 Enforcement of certain statutes by department; rules. (1) ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 and 321.700 to 321.754 shall be enforced and the taxes imposed by ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 and 321.700 to 321.754 shall be collected by the Department of Revenue, which shall have the power to prescribe forms and to adopt rules for the ascertainment, assessment and collection of the taxes imposed by ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754.

      (2) For the purpose of determining the taxes imposed by ORS 321.005 to 321.185, 321.560 to 321.600 or 321.700 to 321.754, the department may:

It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to whom information is disclosed or given by the department pursuant to ORS 321.684 (2) or any other provision of state law to divulge or use such information for any purpose other than that specified in the provisions of law authorizing the use or disclosure. No subpoena or judicial order shall be issued compelling the department or any of its officers or employees, or any person who has acquired information pursuant to ORS 321.684 (2) or any other provision of state law, to divulge or make known the amount of tax or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any report or return except where the taxpayer’s liability for timber tax is to be adjudicated by the court from which such process issues.

      321.703 Legislative findings and declarations. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Oregon forests are dynamic ecosystems that make vital contributions to all Oregonians. Environmental benefits of forests include habitats for diverse life forms, clean and oxygenated air, clean, filtered and recycled water and stabilized productive soil. Economic benefits of forests include renewable raw material for paper and wood products used by everyone in daily living. Social benefits of forests include scenic landscapes and vistas, open space, solitude and outdoor recreation.

      (b) Healthy productive forests provide a sustainable flow of goods, services, values and products.

      (c) Private family and nonindustrial forestlands are important parts of the forest resource base of this state. Private family and nonindustrial forestlands make major contributions to the economy of this state and provide many other social and environmental benefits.

      (d) Because of the wide array of management goals and objectives that apply to private family and nonindustrial forestlands, these forestlands provide a great range of valuable forest diversity across the landscape of this state.

      (e) Many lower gradient streams, which are key components of numerous watersheds and are extremely important for some aquatic species, flow through private family and nonindustrial forestlands.

      (f) The interests of this state, its residents and its future residents are best served by sustainable forest practices and taxing policies that encourage maintaining and establishing diverse forest resources for watersheds, commerce, recreation and stabilized employment levels. These practices and policies prevent shifts in population and encourage the processing of forest products within Oregon.

      (g) Timber on private land that is managed on a sustainable basis should be treated as a crop and not taxed as real property.

      (h) A tax imposed at the time of harvest coincides with the cash flow of small timber operations and recognizes the hazards and uncertainties involved in growing a long-term timber crop on a sustainable basis.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares the purposes of the small tract forestland tax option program established under ORS 321.700 to 321.754 are to:

      (a) Impose property taxes on forestland values that are annually determined and adjusted as described in ORS 321.201 to 321.222 and then specially assessed; and

      (b) Impose a severance tax on the harvesting of timber from small tract forestland in order to:

      (A) Recognize the long-term nature of the forest crop and foster the public policy of this state to encourage the growing and harvesting of timber;

      (B) Protect the public welfare by ensuring that the people of this state and future generations will have the benefits to be derived from the continuous production of forest products from privately held small tract forestland;

      (C) Promote the public policy of this state to encourage forestry and the restocking of forestlands in order to provide present and future benefits, including but not limited to water supply enhancement, erosion prevention, wildlife habitat, scenic and recreational opportunities and needed forest products;

      (D) Produce revenues for local taxing districts;

      (E) Match the incidence of taxation with the realization of the economic benefits of harvest; and

      (F) Encourage the establishment of new forests on denuded, nonstocked or underproducing forestland. [2003 c.454 §2; 2017 c.315 §28]

      (3) The tax is imposed at the rate of:

      (a) $3.89 per thousand feet, board measure, of timber harvested in western Oregon; or

      (b) $3.03 per thousand feet, board measure, of timber harvested in eastern Oregon.

      (4) The tax shall be imposed on the net volume of timber harvested, determined by unit of proper measurement for the kind of timber, species, quality class, grade or product harvested.

      (5) For calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, the tax rates imposed under subsection (3) of this section shall be indexed as follows:

      (a) For the rate that applies to the harvest of timber from small tract forestland in western Oregon, the tax rate applicable to the harvest of timber from small tract forestland in western Oregon for the previous calendar year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the average assessed value per acre of small tract forestland in western Oregon for the property tax year in which the current calendar year begins over the average assessed value per acre of small tract forestland in western Oregon for the previous property tax year. For purposes of this paragraph, the average assessed value per acre of small tract forestland in western Oregon is determined by adding the assessed values per acre of small tract forestland for each land class in western Oregon and dividing that number by the number of land classes in western Oregon.

      (b) For the rate that applies to the harvest of timber from small tract forestland in eastern Oregon, the tax rate applicable to the harvest of timber from small tract forestland in eastern Oregon for the previous calendar year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the assessed value per acre of small tract forestland in eastern Oregon for the property tax year in which the current calendar year begins over the assessed value per acre of small tract forestland in eastern Oregon for the previous property tax year.

SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF EASTERN OREGON FORESTLAND

 

      321.805 Definitions for ORS 321.805 to 321.855. As used in ORS 321.805 to 321.855, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Cultured Christmas trees” means trees:

      (a) Grown on lands used exclusively for that purpose, capable of preparation by intensive cultivation methods such as plowing or turning over the soil;

      (b) Of a marketable species;

      (c) Managed to produce trees meeting U.S. No. 2 or better standards for Christmas trees as specified by the Agriculture Marketing Services of the United States Department of Agriculture; and

      (d) Evidencing periodic maintenance practices of shearing for Douglas fir and pine species, weed and brush control, and basal pruning, fertilizing, insect and disease control, stump culture, soil cultivation or irrigation.

      (2) “Department” means the Department of Revenue.

      (3) “Eastern Oregon” means that portion of the state lying east of a line beginning at the intersection of the northern boundary of the State of Oregon and the western boundary of Wasco County, thence south along the western boundaries of the counties of Wasco, Jefferson, Deschutes and Klamath to the southern boundary of the State of Oregon.

      (4) “Forestland” means land in eastern Oregon that is being held or used for the predominant purpose of growing and harvesting trees of a marketable species and that has been designated as forestland under ORS 321.805 to 321.855 or land in eastern Oregon, the highest and best use of which is the growing and harvesting of such trees. Forestland is the land alone. Forestland often contains isolated openings that because of rock outcrops, river wash, swamps, chemical conditions of the soil, brush and other like conditions prevent adequate stocking of such openings for the production of trees of a marketable species. If such openings in their natural state are necessary to hold the surrounding forestland in forest use through sound management practices, the openings are deemed forestland.

      (5) “State Forester” means the State Forester or the authorized representative of the State Forester.

      (6) “Summit of the Cascade Mountains” means a line beginning at the intersection of the northern boundary of the State of Oregon and the western boundary of Wasco County, thence southerly along the western boundaries of the counties of Wasco, Jefferson, Deschutes and Klamath to the southern boundary of the State of Oregon.

      (7) “Timber” means all logs which can be measured in board feet and other forest products as determined by department rule, but does not include western juniper or products from harvested western juniper. [1971 c.654 §2; 1977 c.892 §46; 1983 c.539 §4; 1995 c.79 §178; 1997 c.154 §53; 1999 c.314 §55; 1999 c.1078 §45; 2003 c.621 §53]

 

      321.808 Purposes. The purposes of ORS 321.805 to 321.855 are:

      (1) To impose with respect to forestland in eastern Oregon a special assessment program whereby the assessed value of forestland is determined as prescribed in ORS 321.201 to 321.222.

      (2) To establish a special assessment program as a means of:

      (a) Recognizing the findings in ORS 321.817 without discriminating in favor of either eastern or western Oregon.

      (b) Recognizing the long-term nature of the forest crop and fostering the public policy of Oregon to encourage the growing and harvesting of timber.

      (c) Protecting the public welfare by assuring that the people of this state and future generations shall have the benefits to be derived from the continuous production of forest products from private forestland.

      (d) Promoting this state’s policy of encouraging forestry and the restocking of forestland to provide present and future benefits by enhancing the water supply, preventing erosion, providing habitat for wildlife, providing scenic and recreational opportunities and providing for needed products.

      321.817 Legislative findings. It is hereby found that:

      (1) Multiple taxation through a yearly ad valorem levy on both trees and forestland managed in sustained yield timber operations discourages conservation, private ownership and investment of capital.

      (2) The interests of this state, its residents and its future residents are best served by sustained yield practices and tax policies that encourage production of forest resources for commerce, recreation and watersheds, stabilize employment levels, prevent large population shifts and encourage millage of timber products within Oregon.

      (3) Timber on private lands managed on a sustained yield basis should be treated as a crop and not taxed as real property.

      (4) The portion of this state lying east of the summit of the Cascade Mountains differs greatly in forest tree types, soils, climate, growing conditions and topography from western Oregon.

      (5) Eastern Oregon forests predominate in Ponderosa pine and associated species, while western Oregon forests predominate in Douglas fir and associated species. [Formerly 321.410; 2017 c.315 §30]
