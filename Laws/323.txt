      (2) All taxes paid pursuant to the provisions of ORS 323.005 to 323.482 are intended to be direct taxes on the retail consumer for which required prepayment, through the purchase and affixation of tax stamps, is only to achieve convenience and facility in the collection and administration of the tax. When the tax is paid by any person other than the retail consumer, the payment shall be considered an advance payment to be added to the price of the cigarette and recovered from the retail consumer.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the taxpayer found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant.

      (A) Manufactures cigarettes anywhere that such manufacturer intends to be sold in the United States, including cigarettes intended to be sold in the United States through an importer (except where such importer is an Original Participating Manufacturer (as that term is defined in the Master Settlement Agreement) that will be responsible for the payments under the Master Settlement Agreement with respect to such cigarettes as a result of the provisions of subsection II(mm) of the Master Settlement Agreement and that pays the taxes specified in subsection II(z) of the Master Settlement Agreement, and provided that the manufacturer of such cigarettes does not market or advertise such cigarettes in the United States);

      (B) Is the first purchaser anywhere for resale in the United States of cigarettes manufactured anywhere that the manufacturer does not intend to be sold in the United States; or

      (C) Becomes a successor of an entity described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph.

      (b) The term “tobacco product manufacturer” does not include an affiliate of a tobacco product manufacturer unless such affiliate is itself a tobacco product manufacturer under paragraph (a)(A), (B) or (C) of this subsection.

The Department of Revenue and the Attorney General may promulgate such rules as are necessary to ascertain the number of units sold of such tobacco product manufacturer for each year.

      (b) “Units sold” does not include cigarettes neither the purchase nor the use of which the state may tax under the Constitution or statutes of the United States. [Formerly 293.533; 2005 c.22 §228; 2007 c.707 §1; 2017 c.687 §1]

 

      Note: 323.800 to 323.806 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 323 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      323.803 Findings and purpose. (1) Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State of Oregon and to the people of the State of Oregon. The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.

      (2) Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for this state. Under certain health care programs, the State of Oregon may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.

      (3) Under those health care programs, the State of Oregon pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.

      (4) It is the policy of the State of Oregon that financial burdens imposed on this state by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by this state to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State of Oregon or are found culpable by the courts.

      (5) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the “Master Settlement Agreement,” with the State of Oregon. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates those manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described in the Master Settlement Agreement:

      (a) To pay substantial sums to the State of Oregon (tied in part to their volume of sales);

      (b) To fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and

      (c) To make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.

      (6) It would be contrary to the policy of the State of Oregon if those tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that this state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State of Oregon to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.

      323.806 Required actions by manufacturers; liability of importers.

Funds shall be released from escrow under this sub-subparagraph in the order in which they were placed into escrow and only to the extent and at the time necessary to make payments required under such judgment or settlement;

      (ii) To the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in Oregon in a particular year was greater than the Master Settlement Agreement payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement after final determination of all adjustments, that the manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a Participating Manufacturer (as that term is defined in the Master Settlement Agreement), the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer; or

      (iii) To the extent not released from escrow under sub-subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph, funds shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer 25 years after the date on which they were placed into escrow.

Any tobacco product manufacturer that fails in any year to place into escrow the funds required under this paragraph shall:

      (i) Be required within 15 days to place such funds into escrow as shall bring such manufacturer into compliance with this paragraph. The court, upon a finding of a violation of this paragraph, may impose a civil penalty to be paid to the General Fund of this state in an amount not to exceed five percent of the amount improperly withheld from escrow per day of the violation and in a total amount not to exceed 100 percent of the original amount improperly withheld from escrow;

      (ii) In the case of a knowing violation, be required within 15 days to place such funds into escrow as shall bring such manufacturer into compliance with this paragraph.

      (iii) In the case of a second knowing violation, be prohibited from selling cigarettes to consumers within the State of Oregon (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) for a period not to exceed two years. Each failure to make an annual deposit required under this section shall constitute a separate violation.

      (2) In the case of units sold that are cigarettes manufactured outside the United States and imported into the United States by an importer:

      (a) Importers shall be jointly and severally liable with the tobacco product manufacturer of the cigarettes for the escrow deposits required under subsection (1)(b)(A) of this section;

      (b) Importers may be sued under subsection (1)(b)(C) of this section to the same extent as the tobacco product manufacturer, and shall be subject to all of the same civil penalties, remedies or other relief that may be awarded against the tobacco product manufacturer of the cigarettes as provided in subsection (1)(b)(C) of this section;

      (c) If the importer fails or refuses within 15 days of the Attorney General’s written demand to deposit the funds into escrow for which it is jointly and severally liable under paragraph (a) of this subsection, all cigarettes imported into the United States by the importer shall constitute contraband cigarettes as defined in ORS 323.010 and shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture as provided under ORS 323.248; and

      (d) A nonparticipating manufacturer located outside the United States that conducts business in this state shall provide to the Attorney General on a form prescribed by the Attorney General a declaration from each importer that imports the cigarettes of the nonparticipating manufacturer intended for sale in this state stating that the importer accepts liability pursuant to subsection (1)(b)(A) of this section and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state for the purposes of enforcing this section. [Formerly 293.535; 2017 c.687 §2]

 

      Note: The amendments to 323.806 [formerly 293.535] by section 22, chapter 801, Oregon Laws 2003, become operative only if there is a final judgment that invalidates the amendments to 323.806 by section 21, chapter 801, Oregon Laws 2003.

See section 25, chapter 801, Oregon Laws 2003. The text that, if the court enters a final judgment that invalidates the amendments to 323.806 by section 21, chapter 801, Oregon Laws 2003, becomes operative 31 days after entry of the final judgment, including amendments by section 3, chapter 687, Oregon Laws 2017, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      (b) “Person” means an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation or any other organization or group of persons.

      (3) “Qualified escrow fund” means an escrow arrangement with a federally or state chartered financial institution having no affiliation with any tobacco product manufacturer and having assets of at least $1 billion, where such arrangement requires that such financial institution hold the escrowed funds’ principal for the benefit of releasing parties and prohibits the tobacco product manufacturer who is placing the funds into escrow from using, accessing or directing the use of the escrowed funds’ principal except as consistent with ORS 323.816 (2)(b).

      (4) “Released claims” has the meaning given that term in section II(gg) of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.

      (5) “Releasing parties” has the meaning given that term in section II(ii) of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.

      (6) “Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement” means the settlement agreement (and related documents) entered into on November 23, 1998, by the State of Oregon and leading United States tobacco product manufacturers.

      (7) “Smokeless tobacco products” means moist snuff, as defined in ORS 323.500, or chewing tobacco, as defined in section 5702 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (8)(a) “Tobacco product manufacturer” means an entity that, after September 28, 2009, directly (and not exclusively through any affiliate):

      (A) Manufactures smokeless tobacco products anywhere that such manufacturer intends to be sold in the United States, including smokeless tobacco products intended to be sold in the United States through an importer (except where such importer is an Original Participating Manufacturer, as defined in section II(cc) of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement), that will be responsible for the payments under the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement with respect to such smokeless tobacco products as a result of the provisions of section VI(b) of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement and that pays the taxes specified in section II(w) of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, and provided that the manufacturer of such smokeless tobacco products does not market or advertise such smokeless tobacco products in the United States);

      (9) “Units sold” means the number of individual containers of smokeless tobacco products sold in the State of Oregon by the applicable tobacco product manufacturer (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) during the year in question, as measured by excise taxes collected by the State of Oregon.

A unit container shall contain 3.2 ounces of moist snuff, as defined in ORS 323.500, or 3.0 ounces of chewing tobacco. [2009 c.717 §18]

 

      323.813 Findings and purpose. (1) The use of smokeless tobacco products presents serious public health concerns to the State of Oregon and to the residents of the State of Oregon. The United States Surgeon General has determined that use of smokeless tobacco causes cancer, noncancerous oral conditions and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins using tobacco products.

      (2) Use of smokeless tobacco products also presents serious financial concerns for this state. Under certain health care programs, the State of Oregon may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with the use of smokeless tobacco, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.

      (3) Under those health care programs, the State of Oregon pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for persons for health conditions associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products.

      (4) It is the policy of the State of Oregon that financial burdens imposed on this state by the use of smokeless tobacco be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by this state to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State of Oregon or are found culpable by the courts.

      (5) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, titled the “Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement,” with the State of Oregon. The Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement obligates those manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described in the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement:

      (a) To pay substantial sums to the State of Oregon (tied in part to their volume of sales);

      (b) To fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and

      (c) To make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.

      (6) It would be contrary to the policy of the State of Oregon if those tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that this state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State of Oregon to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise. [2009 c.717 §19]

 

      323.816 Required actions by manufacturer. (1) Any tobacco product manufacturer selling smokeless tobacco products to consumers within the State of Oregon (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) after September 28, 2009, shall do one of the following:

      (a) Comply with the requirements imposed on Participating Manufacturers that are set forth in sections III, V and VII of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement; or

      (b) Place into a qualified escrow fund, by April 15 of the year following the year in question, the amount of $0.40 per unit sold for 2010 or such amount adjusted for inflation for each year thereafter.

      (2) A tobacco product manufacturer that places funds into escrow pursuant to this section shall receive the interest or other appreciation on such funds as earned. The funds themselves shall be released from escrow only under the following circumstances:

      (a) To pay a judgment or settlement on any released claim brought against such tobacco product manufacturer by the State of Oregon or any releasing party located or residing in this state. Funds shall be released from escrow under this paragraph in the order in which they were placed into escrow and only to the extent and at the time necessary to make payments required under such judgment or settlement;

      (b) To refund any excess amount owed to a tobacco product manufacturer when the tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in Oregon in a particular year was greater than the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(c) of that agreement after final determination of all adjustments, that the manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a Participating Manufacturer, as defined in section II(ee) of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement; or

      (c) To refund funds to a tobacco product manufacturer 25 years after the date on which they were placed in escrow, only if the funds were not released from escrow under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection.

      (3) Each tobacco product manufacturer that elects to place funds into escrow pursuant to this section shall annually certify to the Attorney General that it is in compliance with this section. The Attorney General may bring a civil action on behalf of the State of Oregon against any tobacco product manufacturer that fails to place into escrow the funds required under this section. Any tobacco product manufacturer that fails in any year to place into escrow the funds required under this section shall:

      (a) Be required within 15 days to place such funds into escrow as shall bring the manufacturer into compliance with this section. The court, upon a finding of a violation of this section, may impose a civil penalty to be paid to the General Fund of this state in an amount not to exceed five percent of the amount improperly withheld from escrow per day of the violation and in a total amount not to exceed 100 percent of the original amount improperly withheld from escrow;

      (b) In the case of a knowing violation, be required within 15 days to place such funds into escrow as shall bring the manufacturer into compliance with this section. The court, upon a finding of a knowing violation of this section, may impose a civil penalty to be paid to the General Fund of this state in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the amount improperly withheld from escrow per day of the violation and in a total amount not to exceed 300 percent of the original amount improperly withheld from escrow; and

      (c) In the case of a second knowing violation, be prohibited from selling smokeless tobacco products to consumers within the State of Oregon (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) for a period not to exceed two years. Each failure to make an annual deposit required under this section shall constitute a separate violation. [2009 c.717 §20]

      (b) Tobacco, in any form, that is functional in the product and that, because of its appearance, the type of tobacco used in the filler or its packaging and labeling, is likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a cigarette; or

      (c) Any roll of tobacco that is wrapped in any substance containing tobacco and that, because of its appearance, the type of tobacco used in the filler or its packaging and labeling, is likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a cigarette described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (2) “Cigarette” includes “roll-your-own,” which is any tobacco that, because of its appearance, type, packaging or labeling, is suitable for use and likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as tobacco for making cigarettes. For purposes of the definition of “cigarette,” 0.09 ounces of “roll-your-own” tobacco shall constitute one individual “cigarette.”

      (3) “Cigarette distributor” means any person or business that sells or distributes cigarettes to a tobacco retailer.

      (4) “Package” means a package, carton or container of any kind in which cigarettes are offered for sale, sold or otherwise distributed or intended for distribution to consumers.
