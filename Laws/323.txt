      (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the owner of a seized vending machine, receptacle or vehicle shall have the right of redemption provided in subsection (2) of this section for a period of 60 days from the date of the seizure if the owner claims that right prior to the redemption provided for in subsection (2) of this section.

      323.620 Remedies cumulative. The remedies of the state provided for in ORS 323.500 to 323.645 are cumulative. No action taken by the Department of Revenue or Attorney General constitutes an election by the state to pursue any remedy to the exclusion of any other remedy for which provision is made in ORS 323.500 to 323.645.

      Note: 323.800 to 323.807 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 323 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      323.803 Findings and purpose. (1) Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State of Oregon and to the people of the State of Oregon. The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.

      (2) Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for this state. Under certain health care programs, the State of Oregon may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.

      (3) Under those health care programs, the State of Oregon pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.

      (4) It is the policy of the State of Oregon that financial burdens imposed on this state by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by this state to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State of Oregon or are found culpable by the courts.

      (5) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the “Master Settlement Agreement,” with the State of Oregon. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates those manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described in the Master Settlement Agreement:

      (a) To pay substantial sums to the State of Oregon (tied in part to their volume of sales);

      (b) To fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and

      (c) To make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.

      (6) It would be contrary to the policy of the State of Oregon if those tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that this state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State of Oregon to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.

Funds shall be released from escrow under this sub-subparagraph in the order in which they were placed into escrow and only to the extent and at the time necessary to make payments required under such judgment or settlement;

      (ii) To the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in Oregon in a particular year was greater than the Master Settlement Agreement payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement after final determination of all adjustments, that the manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a Participating Manufacturer (as that term is defined in the Master Settlement Agreement), the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer; or

      (ii) In the case of a knowing violation, be required within 15 days to place such funds into escrow as shall bring such manufacturer into compliance with this paragraph.

      (iii) In the case of a second knowing violation, be prohibited from selling cigarettes to consumers within the State of Oregon (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) for a period not to exceed two years. Each failure to make an annual deposit required under this section shall constitute a separate violation.

      (2) In the case of units sold that are cigarettes manufactured outside the United States and imported into the United States by an importer:

      (a) Importers shall be jointly and severally liable with the tobacco product manufacturer of the cigarettes for the escrow deposits required under subsection (1)(b)(A) of this section;

      (b) Importers may be sued under subsection (1)(b)(C) of this section to the same extent as the tobacco product manufacturer, and shall be subject to all of the same civil penalties, remedies or other relief that may be awarded against the tobacco product manufacturer of the cigarettes as provided in subsection (1)(b)(C) of this section;

      (c) If the importer fails or refuses within 15 days of the Attorney General’s written demand to deposit the funds into escrow for which it is jointly and severally liable under paragraph (a) of this subsection, all cigarettes imported into the United States by the importer shall constitute contraband cigarettes as defined in ORS 323.010 and shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture as provided under ORS 323.248; and

      (d) A nonparticipating manufacturer located outside the United States that conducts business in this state shall provide to the Attorney General on a form prescribed by the Attorney General a declaration from each importer that imports the cigarettes of the nonparticipating manufacturer intended for sale in this state stating that the importer accepts liability pursuant to subsection (1)(b)(A) of this section and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state for the purposes of enforcing this section. [Formerly 293.535; 2017 c.687 §2]

 

      Note: The amendments to 323.806 [formerly 293.535] by section 22, chapter 801, Oregon Laws 2003, become operative only if there is a final judgment that invalidates the amendments to 323.806 by section 21, chapter 801, Oregon Laws 2003.

      (9) “Units sold” means the number of individual containers of smokeless tobacco products sold in the State of Oregon by the applicable tobacco product manufacturer (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) during the year in question, as measured by excise taxes collected by the State of Oregon. The Department of Revenue shall adopt such rules as are necessary to ascertain the amount of state excise tax paid on the smokeless tobacco products of such tobacco product manufacturer for each year. A unit container shall contain 3.2 ounces of moist snuff, as defined in ORS 323.500, or 3.0 ounces of chewing tobacco. [2009 c.717 §18]

 

      323.813 Findings and purpose. (1) The use of smokeless tobacco products presents serious public health concerns to the State of Oregon and to the residents of the State of Oregon. The United States Surgeon General has determined that use of smokeless tobacco causes cancer, noncancerous oral conditions and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins using tobacco products.

      (2) Use of smokeless tobacco products also presents serious financial concerns for this state. Under certain health care programs, the State of Oregon may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with the use of smokeless tobacco, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.

      (3) Under those health care programs, the State of Oregon pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for persons for health conditions associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products.

      (4) It is the policy of the State of Oregon that financial burdens imposed on this state by the use of smokeless tobacco be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by this state to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State of Oregon or are found culpable by the courts.

      (5) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, titled the “Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement,” with the State of Oregon. The Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement obligates those manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described in the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement:

      (a) To pay substantial sums to the State of Oregon (tied in part to their volume of sales);

      (b) To fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and

      (c) To make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.

      (6) It would be contrary to the policy of the State of Oregon if those tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that this state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State of Oregon to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise. [2009 c.717 §19]

 

      323.816 Required actions by manufacturer. (1) Any tobacco product manufacturer selling smokeless tobacco products to consumers within the State of Oregon (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) after September 28, 2009, shall do one of the following:

      (a) Comply with the requirements imposed on Participating Manufacturers that are set forth in sections III, V and VII of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement; or

      (b) Place into a qualified escrow fund, by April 15 of the year following the year in question, the amount of $0.40 per unit sold for 2010 or such amount adjusted for inflation for each year thereafter.

      (2) A tobacco product manufacturer that places funds into escrow pursuant to this section shall receive the interest or other appreciation on such funds as earned. The funds themselves shall be released from escrow only under the following circumstances:

      (a) To pay a judgment or settlement on any released claim brought against such tobacco product manufacturer by the State of Oregon or any releasing party located or residing in this state. Funds shall be released from escrow under this paragraph in the order in which they were placed into escrow and only to the extent and at the time necessary to make payments required under such judgment or settlement;

      (b) To refund any excess amount owed to a tobacco product manufacturer when the tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in Oregon in a particular year was greater than the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(c) of that agreement after final determination of all adjustments, that the manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a Participating Manufacturer, as defined in section II(ee) of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement; or

      (c) To refund funds to a tobacco product manufacturer 25 years after the date on which they were placed in escrow, only if the funds were not released from escrow under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection.

      (3) Each tobacco product manufacturer that elects to place funds into escrow pursuant to this section shall annually certify to the Attorney General that it is in compliance with this section. The Attorney General may bring a civil action on behalf of the State of Oregon against any tobacco product manufacturer that fails to place into escrow the funds required under this section. Any tobacco product manufacturer that fails in any year to place into escrow the funds required under this section shall:

      (a) Be required within 15 days to place such funds into escrow as shall bring the manufacturer into compliance with this section. The court, upon a finding of a violation of this section, may impose a civil penalty to be paid to the General Fund of this state in an amount not to exceed five percent of the amount improperly withheld from escrow per day of the violation and in a total amount not to exceed 100 percent of the original amount improperly withheld from escrow;

      (b) In the case of a knowing violation, be required within 15 days to place such funds into escrow as shall bring the manufacturer into compliance with this section. The court, upon a finding of a knowing violation of this section, may impose a civil penalty to be paid to the General Fund of this state in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the amount improperly withheld from escrow per day of the violation and in a total amount not to exceed 300 percent of the original amount improperly withheld from escrow; and

      (c) In the case of a second knowing violation, be prohibited from selling smokeless tobacco products to consumers within the State of Oregon (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) for a period not to exceed two years. Each failure to make an annual deposit required under this section shall constitute a separate violation. [2009 c.717 §20]
