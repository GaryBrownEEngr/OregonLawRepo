      (1) “Department” means the Department of Revenue.

      (2) “Gas” means natural gas and casinghead gas.

      (3) “Gross value” or “gross sales value” means the actual cash price prevailing for oil or gas of the kind, character and quality of the oil or gas subject to the tax imposed under this chapter at the time such oil or gas is produced, as determined by the department.

      (4) “Gross production” means the total volume of oil or gas extracted from a well, including oil or gas extracted but not sold. “Gross production” does not include the extraction from a well of any oil or gas reinjected therein for storage.

      (5) “Produced and saved” means extracted and sold, extracted and used or extracted and retained for later sale or use.

      (6) “Oil” means petroleum, crude oil, mineral oil and casinghead gas.

      (7) “Person” includes partnership, corporation, association, fiduciary, trustee and any combination of individuals.

      (8) “Quarter” and “quarterly” mean calendar quarters. [1981 c.889 §1]

 

IMPOSITION OF TAX

 

      324.070 Imposition of tax; rate; basis of levy. (1) A privilege tax of six percent of the gross value at the well is levied upon the production of oil and gas within the State of Oregon. The gross value at the well shall be reduced by the value of any part thereof, the ownership or right to which is exempt from taxation.

      (2) The tax levied shall be measured by the value of the whole production, including what is commonly known as the royalty interest. [1981 c.889 §2; 1991 c.459 §322]

 

      324.080 Exemptions of gross sales value. An exemption from the tax levied on oil or gas imposed by ORS 324.070 is granted upon the first $3,000 in gross sales value of the gross production each calendar quarter from each well. [1981 c.889 §3]

 

      324.090 State and local government interests exempt; credit of taxes imposed by state and local governments. (1) Any royalty or other interest in oil or gas owned by the state, counties, cities, towns, school districts or other municipal corporations or political subdivisions, is exempt from the gross production tax imposed by ORS 324.070.

      (2) There shall be allowed as a credit against taxes imposed by this chapter all ad valorem taxes imposed by the state, counties, cities, towns, school districts and other municipal corporations and political subdivisions upon any property rights attached to or inherent in the right to produce oil and gas, upon producing oil and gas leases, upon machinery, appliances and equipment used in and around any well producing oil or gas and actually used in the operation of the well, upon oil and gas produced in the state and upon any investment in any property mentioned or described in this subsection. [1981 c.889 §4]

 

COLLECTION OF TAX

 

      324.110 Quarterly payment of tax; computation of prevailing cash price. (1) The gross production tax on oil or gas imposed by this chapter shall be paid on a quarterly basis. The tax shall become due on the 45th day following the preceding quarterly period on all oil or gas produced in and saved during the preceding quarterly period, and, if the tax is not paid on or before the end of the 45th day, it shall become delinquent and shall be collected as provided in this chapter. The Department of Revenue, upon request and a proper showing of the necessity therefor, may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 30 days, for paying the tax and when such a request is granted the tax shall not be delinquent until the extended period has expired.

      (2) On oil or gas sold at the time of production, the gross production tax shall be paid by the purchaser, and the purchaser shall and is authorized to deduct in making settlements with the producer or royalty owner, the amount of tax so paid. In the event oil on which the gross production tax becomes due is not sold at the time of production but is retained or used by the producer, the tax on the oil not so sold shall be paid by the producer, including the tax due on royalty oil not sold. In settlement with the royalty owner, the producer shall have the right to deduct the amount of the tax so paid on royalty oil or to deduct royalty oil equivalent in value at the time the tax becomes due with the amount of the tax paid.

      (3) The amount of gas produced and used for fuel or otherwise used in the operation of any lease or premises in the drilling for or production of oil or gas, or for repressuring, shall not be considered for the purpose of this chapter as gas actually produced and saved.

      (4) When oil or gas is sold at a sale price that does not represent the cash price prevailing for oil or gas of like kind, character or quality in the field from which such product is produced, the department may require the tax to be paid upon the basis of the prevailing cash price then being paid at the time of production in the field for oil, or gas of like kind, quality and character. [1981 c.889 §5]

 

      324.120 Statement by taxpayer; other required information. (1) The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid to the Department of Revenue and the person paying the tax shall file with the department at the time the tax is required to be paid, a statement, under oath, on forms prescribed by the department, giving, with other information required, the following:

      (a) Full description of the property by lease name, subdivision of quarter section, section, township and range from which the oil or gas was produced;

      (b) The name of the producer;

      (c) The gross amount of the oil or gas purchased;

      (d) The total value of the oil or gas at the price paid, if purchased at time of production;

      (e) The formation from which the oil or gas is produced; and

      (f) The prevailing market price of oil or gas sold at time of production.

      (2) If a purchaser of oil or gas pays the tax, the producer of the oil or gas for which the tax is being paid shall make available to the purchaser all information required under subsection (1) of this section. In lieu of the statement, a purchaser, at time of production, may furnish a true verified copy of the regular settlement sheet in use by such purchaser, if the sheet contains all the information required. [1981 c.889 §6]

 

      324.130 Statement of producer; filing of statement. (1) Any person engaged in the production within this state of oil or gas shall, on or before the 45th day following the preceding quarterly period, file with the Department of Revenue a statement under oath, upon forms prescribed by the department, giving, along with other information required, the following:

      (a) The name of the property and the description by subdivision of quarter section, section, township and range;

      (b) The gross amount of oil or gas produced and saved;

      (c) The name of the purchaser and the price paid by the purchaser; and

      (d) The formation from which the oil or gas is produced.

      (2) Each report required by this section shall be filed on separate forms as to product and county. [1981 c.889 §7; 2005 c.94 §112]

 

      324.140 Penalty for delinquent reports; report of claimed exempt royalties. (1) Reports required under ORS 324.120 and 324.130 from either the purchaser or producer, as the case may be, shall be delinquent after the last day fixed for filing, and every person required to file a report shall be subject to penalty of $25 per day for each property upon which the person fails or refuses to file a report. The penalties prescribed by this section shall be for failure to file reports and shall be in addition to the interest and penalty imposed for delinquent tax, and shall likewise constitute a lien against the assets of the person failing or refusing to file a report. The penalties prescribed under this section shall be collected in the same manner as gross production taxes and shall be deposited in the suspense account referred to in ORS 324.340.

      (2) When royalty is claimed to be exempt from taxation by law, the facts on which claims of exemption are based and other information as the Department of Revenue may require shall be furnished in the report. [1981 c.889 §8; 1983 c.740 §98]

 

      324.170 Audit; interest on delinquent tax or deficiency. (1) The provisions of ORS chapters 305 and 314 as to the audit and examination of reports and returns, determination of deficiencies, assessments, claims for refund, conferences and appeals to the Oregon Tax Court, and the procedures relating thereto, shall apply to the determination of taxes, penalties and interest under this chapter, except where the context requires otherwise.

      (2) A delinquent tax or deficiency shall bear interest at the rate established under ORS 305.220 from the time the tax was due. [1981 c.889 §10; 1982 s.s.1 c.16 §24; 1995 c.650 §48; 2017 c.278 §20]

 

      324.180 Notice to person liable for unpaid tax. If any person neglects or refuses to make a return required to be made by this chapter, the Department of Revenue is authorized to determine the tax due, based upon any information in its possession or that may come into its possession. The department shall give the person liable for the tax written notice by regular mail or other form of delivery of the tax and delinquency charges and the tax and delinquency charges shall be a lien from the time of production. If the tax and delinquency charges are not paid within 30 days from the mailing or delivery of the notice, the department shall proceed to collect the tax in the manner provided in ORS 324.190. [1981 c.889 §11; 1991 c.249 §27; 2019 c.360 §5]

 

      324.190 Collection of unpaid tax. (1) If any tax imposed by this chapter, or any portion of such tax, is not paid within 30 days after the date that the written notice and demand for payment required under ORS 305.895 is mailed, the Department of Revenue shall issue a warrant for the payment of the amount of the tax, with the added penalties, interest and cost of executing the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the taxpayer by the department at the taxpayer’s last-known address.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the taxpayer found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department, a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect this tax. In the execution of the warrant the agent has the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (4) Until a warrant under this section is satisfied in full, the department has the same remedies to enforce the claim for taxes against the taxpayer as if the state had a recorded judgment against the taxpayer for the amount of the tax. [1981 c.889 §12; 1983 c.696 §18; 1985 c.761 §22; 1989 c.625 §79; 2003 c.576 §206; 2011 c.389 §6; 2011 c.661 §9; 2019 c.360 §6]

 

      324.200 Release of lien on real estate. (1) Any person having a lien upon or any interest in real estate against which the amount of the warrant provided for in ORS 324.190 has become a lien, notice of which has been recorded in accordance with the laws of the state prior to the filing of the warrant, may request the Department of Revenue in writing to release the real estate from the lien of the warrant. If, upon such request the department finds that a sale of the property would not result in satisfaction of the taxes due in whole or in part, the department shall execute a release of the lien as to such property and such release shall be conclusive evidence of the extinguishment of the lien as to that property. If the department fails to act upon a request for release of a lien under this subsection within 60 days from the date of the request, any person having a lien upon or interest in the property against which the warrant has become a lien may make the department a party to any proceeding brought to enforce any interest in or lien upon such real property, and the determination of the court in such proceeding shall be conclusive and binding upon the department and the State of Oregon.

      (2) In addition to the release of the lien provided for in subsection (1) of this section, the department may execute releases in the following cases, which releases shall be conclusive evidence of the extinguishment of the lien:

      (a) If the department finds that the liability for the amount of the warrant, together with all interest, penalties and costs in respect thereto has been satisfied.

      (b) If the department finds that the fair market value of that part of the property remaining subject to the lien is at least double the amount of the liability remaining unsatisfied in respect of such tax and the amount of all prior liens upon the property.

      (c) If there is furnished to the department a bond, in such form and with the security the department considers sufficient, or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, in either case conditioned upon the payment of the amount of the warrant, together with all interest in respect thereof, within 60 days after the issuance of the release.

      (d) If there is paid to the department in partial satisfaction of the amount of the warrant an amount not less than the value, as determined by the department, of the interest of the State of Oregon in the part of the property to be so discharged. In determining such value the department shall give consideration to the fair market value of the part of the property to be so discharged and to such liens thereon as have priority to the lien of the State of Oregon. [1981 c.889 §13; 1991 c.331 §55; 1997 c.631 §460]

 

      324.210 Status of taxes, interest and penalties as debt; limitation on time of collection. All taxes, interest and penalties due and unpaid under this chapter, shall constitute a debt due the State of Oregon from the person liable for the tax and may be collected, together with interest, penalty and costs, by appropriate judicial proceeding, which remedy is in addition to all other existing remedies. However, no proceeding for the collection of taxes under this section shall be instituted after the expiration of six years from the date such taxes were due. [1981 c.889 §14]

 

      324.240 Payment of tax when oil or gas in litigation. When oil or gas subject to gross production tax under this chapter is in litigation or dispute involving ownership of the oil or gas, and the oil or gas is sold, the usual gross production tax, as provided by law, shall be paid from the proceeds or funds in the hands of the purchaser of the oil or gas and in lieu of payment for the production, to the extent of the tax. The receipt of the Department of Revenue therefor shall be accepted in lieu of money in settlement of the purchase price of the production. If oil or gas is assigned as security for debt or otherwise, the tax shall be likewise paid by the assignee, and the tax shall constitute a lien upon the interest assigned, which shall be paramount to the indebtedness for which the assignment is made, and if the tax becomes delinquent, the usual penalty shall apply. [1981 c.889 §16]
