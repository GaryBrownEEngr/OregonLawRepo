Upon receipt of the unofficial education records by a school in the receiving state, the school shall enroll and appropriately place the student based on the information provided in the unofficial records pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible.

      B. Official education records and transcripts. Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student, the school in the receiving state shall request the student’s official education record from the school in the sending state. Upon receipt of this request, the school in the sending state will process and furnish the official education records to the school in the receiving state within 10 days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the Interstate Commission.

When the student transfers before or during the school year, the receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational courses based on the student’s enrollment in the sending state school or educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state if the courses are offered. Course placement includes but is not limited to honors, International Baccalaureate, advanced placement, vocational, technical and career pathways courses. Continuing the student’s academic program from the previous school and promoting placement in academically and career challenging courses should be paramount when considering placement. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued enrollment of the student in a course.

      B. Educational program placement. The receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational programs based on current educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state or based on participation or placement in like programs in the sending state. Such programs include, but are not limited to, talented and gifted programs and English as a second language programs. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.

      C. Special education services.

      1. In compliance with the federal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq., the receiving state shall initially provide comparable services to a student with disabilities based on the student’s current individualized education program. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.

      2. In compliance with the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794, and with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12131-12165, the receiving state shall make reasonable accommodations and modifications to address the needs of incoming students with disabilities, subject to an existing section 504 or Title II plan, to provide the student with equal access to education. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.

      D. Placement flexibility. Local education agency administrative officials shall have flexibility in waiving course or program prerequisites, or other preconditions for placement in courses or programs offered under the jurisdiction of the local education agency.

      E. Absence as related to deployment activities. A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined by this compact, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences at the discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with the student’s parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.

ARTICLE VII

GRADUATION

 

 

In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, states and local education agencies shall incorporate the following procedures:

      A. Waiver requirements. Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar course work has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial. Should a waiver not be granted to a student who would qualify to graduate from the sending school, the local education agency shall provide an alternative means of acquiring required coursework so that graduation may occur on time.

      B. Exit exams. States shall accept exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state, national norm-referenced achievement tests or alternative testing that is given in lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state. In the event the above alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a student transferring in the student’s senior year, then the provisions of Section C of this Article shall apply.

      C. Transfers during senior year. Should a military student transferring at the beginning or during the student’s senior year be ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local education agency, if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In the event that one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with Sections A and B of this Article.

The individual appointed to this position must be a member of the uniformed service. The Department of Education of the State of Oregon shall assist the military family education liaison in the performance of the duties of the position.

      4. The bylaws may provide for meetings of the Interstate Commission to be conducted by telecommunication or electronic communication.

      C. Consist of ex officio, nonvoting representatives who are members of interested organizations.

The Department of Defense shall serve as an ex officio, nonvoting member of the executive committee.

      F. Establish bylaws and rules that provide for conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying.

      2. Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal and state statute;

Such methods of data collection, exchange and reporting shall, in so far as is reasonably possible, conform to current technology and coordinate its information functions with the appropriate custodian of records as identified in the bylaws and rules.

      J. Create a process that permits military officials, education officials and parents to inform the Interstate Commission if and when there are alleged violations of this compact or its rules or when issues subject to the jurisdiction of this compact or its rules are not addressed by the state or local education agency. This section shall not be construed to create a private right of action against the Interstate Commission or any member state.

The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact’s purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.

      2. All courts shall take judicial notice of this compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission.

      3. The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact or promulgated rules.

      B. Default, technical assistance, suspension and termination.

      1. If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default.

      2. If a member state has defaulted, the Interstate Commission shall provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.

      3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.

      4. Suspension or termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature and each of the member states.

      5. The state that has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.

      6. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or that has been suspended or terminated from this compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.

      7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney fees.

      C. Dispute resolution.

      1. The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes that are subject to this compact and that may arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.

      2. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.

      D. Enforcement.

      1. The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.

      2. The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United State District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

      3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.

 

ARTICLE XIV

THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION

 

      A. The Interstate Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.

      B. The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission’s annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.

      C. The Interstate Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same, nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.

      D. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.
