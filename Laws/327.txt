      (iii) 0.2 for each student in average daily membership enrolled in a union high school district or in an area of a unified school district where the district is only responsible for educating students in grades 9 through 12 in that area.

      (iv) −0.1 for each student in average daily membership enrolled in an elementary district operating kindergarten through grade six or kindergarten through grade eight or in an area of a unified school district where the district is only responsible for educating students in kindergarten through grade eight.

      (v) 0.25 times the sum of the following:

      (I) The number of students who are in average daily membership and who are also in poverty families, as determined by the Department of Education based on rules adopted by the State Board of Education that incorporate poverty data published by the United States Census Bureau, student data provided by school districts and other data identified by the board;

      (II) The number of children in foster homes in the district as determined by the report of the Department of Human Services to the United States Department of Education, “Annual Statistical Report on Children in Foster Homes and Children in Families Receiving AFDC Payments in Excess of the Poverty Income Level,” or its successor, for October 31 of the year prior to the year of distribution; and

      (III) The number of children in the district in state-recognized facilities for neglected and delinquent children, based on information from the Department of Human Services for October 31 of the year prior to the year of distribution.

      (vi) The amount determined under ORS 327.077 for each remote small elementary school and for each small high school in the district.

      (B) All numbers of children used for the computation in this paragraph must reflect any district consolidations that have occurred since the numbers were compiled.

      (C) The total additional weight that shall be assigned to any student in average daily membership in a district, exclusive of students described in subparagraph (A)(v) and (vi) of this paragraph, may not exceed 2.0.

      (2) High cost disabilities grant = the total amount received by a school district under ORS 327.348 for providing special education and related services to resident pupils with disabilities.

      (3)(a) Transportation grant equals:

      (A) 70 percent of approved transportation costs for those school districts ranked below the 80th percentile under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (B) 80 percent of approved transportation costs for those school districts ranked in or above the 80th percentile but below the 90th percentile under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (C) 90 percent of approved transportation costs for those school districts ranked in or above the 90th percentile under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) Each fiscal year, the Department of Education shall rank school districts based on the approved transportation costs per ADM of each school district, ranking the school district with the highest approved transportation costs per ADM at the top of the order.

      (4)(a) Facility Grant = 8 percent of total construction costs of new school buildings.

      (b) A school district shall receive a Facility Grant in the distribution year that a new school building is first used.

      (c) As used in this subsection:

(1) In order to accomplish the purpose described in ORS 326.700, the State Board of Education shall adopt by rule definitions and procedures to be applied to the computation of the State School Fund allocations where necessary to make students enrolled in the Youth Corrections Education Program, as defined in ORS 326.695, and the Juvenile Detention Education Program, as defined in ORS 326.695, equivalent to students enrolled in common and union high school districts for purposes of distribution of the fund.

      (2)(a) The Youth Corrections Education Program shall receive from the State School Fund for each school year a special State School Fund grant, consisting of a general purpose grant that is equal to the Youth Corrections Education Program extended ADMw multiplied by Funding Percentage and further multiplied by Statewide Target per ADMw Grant. For the purpose of the calculation made under this paragraph:

      (A) ADMw equals ADM multiplied by 2.0 multiplied by the additional per student weight, as calculated in ORS 327.013 (1)(c)(A)(i).

      (B) Extended ADMw equals ADMw or ADMw of the prior year, whichever is greater.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Youth Corrections Education Program may not receive moneys under this section from the State School Fund for any youth in the program who:

      (A) Has received a high school diploma or a modified diploma; or

      (3) The Juvenile Detention Education Program shall receive from the State School Fund for each school year a special State School Fund grant, consisting of a general purpose grant that is equal to the Juvenile Detention Education Program extended ADMw multiplied by Funding Percentage and further multiplied by Statewide Target per ADMw Grant. For the purpose of the calculation made under this subsection:

      (a) ADMw equals ADM multiplied by 1.5.

      (b) Extended ADMw equals ADMw or ADMw of the prior year, whichever is greater.

      (4) Funds allocated to the Youth Corrections Education Program and the Juvenile Detention Education Program from the State School Fund shall remain with the Department of Education and shall be adjusted in the year following the distribution to reflect the actual ADMw of students in the Youth Corrections Education Program and the Juvenile Detention Education Program in the same manner as for the school districts under ORS 327.101.

      327.099 Adjustment of distribution within fiscal year. (1) The Department of Education shall adjust the distribution to a school district to reflect the difference between the estimated level of local revenues to the district under ORS 327.011 and the projected level of those same local revenues used to calculate the State School Fund apportionment to the district. The adjustment shall be incorporated in the May 15 apportionment to the district in the distribution year.

      (2) The department shall adjust the May 15 apportionment to a school district in the distribution year to reflect an ADMw of the district equal to the higher of the ADMw of the prior year or the adjusted ADMw for the December quarter. Adjusted ADMw for the December quarter shall equal:

      (a) ADMw as determined by the department from information provided in the December quarterly report for the current distribution year filed with the department under ORS 327.133;

      (b) Multiplied by the lesser of 1.0 or the average of the ratios for the preceding two years of the ADM for the year ending June 30 to the ADM for the quarter ending December 31 for the same school year as filed under ORS 327.133.

      (3) The sum equal to the sum of all negative adjustments made to the May 15 apportionment under subsection (1) of this section shall be used by the department for purposes of funding positive adjustments required under subsection (1) of this section and adjustments required under subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) The department shall also set aside an amount of the funds appropriated to the State School Fund for the fiscal year to fund any positive adjustments required under subsection (1) of this section and adjustments required under subsection (2) of this section in excess of the amount available under subsection (3) of this section. The amount set aside shall be as determined by law.

      (5) If the amounts available under subsections (3) and (4) of this section are either not sufficient to fund the positive adjustments or exceed the positive adjustments to districts required under subsections (1) and (2) of this section and the adjustments required under subsection (2) of this section, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall recalculate the funding percentage in ORS 327.013 (1)(a) to distribute as nearly as practicable the total sum available for distribution. [1991 c.780 §12; 1993 c.61 §7; 2003 c.715 §24; 2005 c.755 §19; 2009 c.698 §15]

 

      327.100 [Repealed by 1963 c.570 §33]

 

      327.101 Adjustment of distribution between fiscal years. (1) Each fiscal year, the distribution to a school district under ORS 327.008 and 327.013 shall be adjusted to fully reflect the difference between the apportionment due to the district for the prior fiscal year under ORS 327.008 and 327.013, and the amounts actually distributed to the district in the prior fiscal year under ORS 327.008, 327.013 and 327.099. The adjustment shall be made to the May 15 apportionment to the district.

      (2) No consideration shall be made in the adjustment made under subsection (1) of this section for any penalties, forfeitures or additional receipts of State School Fund moneys, except when expressly directed by law.

      (3) An amount of funds equal to the sum of all negative adjustments made to the May 15 apportionment under subsection (1) of this section shall be used by the Department of Education for purposes of funding positive adjustments required under subsection (1) of this section in the same fiscal year.

      (4) If the amounts available under subsection (3) of this section are either not sufficient or exceed the adjustments to districts required under subsection (1) of this section, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall recalculate the funding percentage in ORS 327.013 (1)(a) to distribute as nearly as practicable the total sum available for distribution. [1991 c.780 §13; 1993 c.61 §8; 2005 c.209 §4; 2005 c.755 §20; 2009 c.698 §16]

 

      327.102 Standard school complaints; process; rules. (1) The State Board of Education shall adopt by rule requirements for the process that a school district must use when the district receives a complaint pertaining to whether a school in the district is a standard school as defined in ORS 327.006.

      (a) Have specific timelines for the completion of the process by both the district and the person making the complaint;

      (b) Have a specific time period within which the district must make a final decision on a complaint, after which the final decision on the complaint may be appealed to the Superintendent of Public Instruction; and

      (c) Recognize that if a district does not provide a written decision within the specific time period, failure to provide such a decision will be regarded as the district’s final decision. [2007 c.519 §1]

      327.103 Standard school presumed; effect of finding of deficiency; rules. (1) All school districts are presumed to maintain a standard school district until the school district has been found to be deficient by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, pursuant to standards and rules of the State Board of Education.

      (2) If any deficiencies are not corrected before the beginning of the school year next following the date of the finding of deficiency and if an extension has not been granted under subsection (3) of this section, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may withhold portions of State School Fund moneys otherwise allocated to the school district for operating expenses until such deficiencies are corrected unless the withholding would create an undue hardship, as determined pursuant to rules of the State Board of Education.

      (3)(a) Within 90 days of the finding of deficiency, a school district found not to be in compliance shall submit a plan, acceptable to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for meeting standardization requirements. A team of Department of Education staff shall contact the school district and offer technical assistance. When an acceptable plan for meeting standardization requirements has been submitted, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may allow an extension of time before withholding moneys, not to exceed 12 months, if the superintendent determines that such deficiencies cannot be corrected or removed before the beginning of the next school year.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may not grant an extension of time if a school district could correct the deficiency through merger.

      (c) For the period of the extension of time under this subsection, the school district shall be considered a conditionally standard school district.

      (4)(a) Regardless of whether the Superintendent of Public Instruction has granted a school district an extension of time under subsection (3) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a school district that fails to submit a plan for meeting standardization requirements within the time specified by the superintendent may not receive further State School Fund moneys until a plan acceptable to the superintendent is submitted.

      (b) Pursuant to rules adopted by the State Board of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may extend the time specified for submitting a plan if the superintendent determines that a human-created disaster or a natural disaster affects the ability of the school district to comply with the date requirement.

A school district may satisfy the requirements of this section by offering half-day kindergarten or full-day kindergarten.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a school district is not considered to be nonstandard under ORS 327.103 if the school district:

(1) Upon receipt from a citizen of Oregon of a complaint that on its face is colorable that a school district or public charter school sponsors, financially supports or is actively involved with religious activity, the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the superintendent’s designated representative shall undertake promptly a preliminary investigation of the facts alleged in the complaint.

      (2) If, after the preliminary investigation, the superintendent finds that there is a substantial basis to believe that the school district or public charter school sponsors, financially supports or is actively involved with religious activity, the superintendent shall:

      (a) In the case of a school district:

      (A) Notify the complainant and the school district;

      (B) Withhold immediately all funds due the school district under ORS 327.095; and

      (6) The funds withheld under this section shall be held in an escrow account and shall be removed from that account only as follows:

      (a) If the superintendent determines, after a contested case hearing, or a court on appeal rules, that the school district or public charter school never sponsored, financially supported or was actively involved with religious activity, the entire amount, including interest thereon, in the escrow account shall be released to the school district or public charter school.

      (b) If the superintendent determines, after a contested case hearing, or a court on appeal rules, that the school district or public charter school sponsored, financially supported or was actively involved with religious activity in the past but has ceased to do so, that portion of the amount, including interest thereon, in the escrow account that accrued to the school district or public charter school after the school district or public charter school ceased the proscribed conduct shall be paid to the school district or public charter school. Any amount, including interest thereon, permanently withheld from the school district or public charter school shall revert to the State School Fund or to the General Fund, if the biennium has ended.

In conducting the investigation, the superintendent shall have the power of subpoena to compel production of documents and attendance of witnesses at depositions and may do all things necessary to secure a full and thorough investigation.

The amount of each local option equalization grant shall be calculated by the Department of Education.

      (6) If the election authorizing the imposition of a local option tax is held after the start of a biennium in which the local option tax is to be imposed, the local option equalization grant for a fiscal year of that biennium shall be determined as otherwise prescribed in this section, but may not be paid to the school district until the first fiscal year of the next succeeding biennium.

      (4) If the estimated local option equalization grant payment does not equal the actual local option equalization grant to which a school district is entitled under ORS 327.336, the department shall determine the increase or decrease needed to correct the amount of the grant and may incorporate the correction into a state school fund grant made to the district. The correction may be made in any state school fund grant made during the fiscal year in which the estimated grant payment was made or in the next succeeding fiscal year.

      (5) If the amount of moneys available in the Local Option Equalization Grants Account is insufficient to make the payments required under ORS 327.336 and this section, the payments shall be proportionally reduced so that the state does not accrue a debt in making these payments.

The department may require the State Treasurer to deposit any such surplus, until it is able to loan same, in qualified state depositories, upon the same terms and conditions as other public funds are deposited therein, in which event any interest received from any such state depository shall be credited to the fund on which such interest was earned.

      (4) The department may reduce the rate of interest to be paid upon outstanding loans from the Common School Fund and any trust fund placed in its charge, to correspond with the rate of interest to be paid upon new loans, but no reduction in rate of interest shall be made upon any of the loans until interest at the old rate has been paid in full to date of receipt of remittance at the office of the department.

      (b) Subject to a reservation of mineral rights.

      (c) Subject to a lease of any kind.

      327.440 Loan repayment. Secured loans authorized by ORS 327.430 shall be repaid in semiannual, quarterly or monthly installments, as may mutually be agreed upon between the borrower and the Department of State Lands, and the installments shall aggregate each year an amount equal to one year’s interest on the original principal of the loan plus an additional two percent of the original principal sum, except as provided in ORS 327.425. Of the installment so paid each year, the amount at the specified interest rate on the principal remaining unpaid shall be credited as interest and the balance credited to reduction of the loan principal.

      327.450 Foreclosure of mortgages given to secure loans.

The department may foreclose its mortgage in the event of waste or any other impairment of the property upon which the loan was made. It may also foreclose for delinquency in payment of principal or interest installments or in payment of taxes on such property.

      (2) The department may bid in the land in the name of the state at a price not to exceed the total amount of the state’s claim or they may accept a deed or a release of the equity of redemption. Should it appear to the satisfaction of the department that the mortgagee cannot make the payment of interest and that foreclosure would work an injustice and that foreclosure is not then necessary to secure the fund from loss, the department may extend the time for paying such interest not exceeding two years. [Amended by 1965 c.100 §36]

 

      327.455 Record of purchases by Department of State Lands on foreclosures; resale or lease of land; disposition of proceeds. The Director of the Department of State Lands shall keep a correct record of all purchases on foreclosures under ORS 327.450 with a description of the lands so purchased or acquired, and a statement of the fund to which they belong. Such lands shall be placed in the hands of the director and sold or leased under the direction of the department on the best terms obtainable, and the proceeds, to the amount of the principal of the loans, shall be paid into the fund from which the loans were made, and the excess paid to the interest account of that fund.

 

      327.465 Cancellation of unpaid taxes after deed to state in liquidation of loan. Whenever the Department of State Lands receives a deed to the State of Oregon of lands covered by a mortgage given to secure a loan from the Common School Fund in liquidation of the debt represented by the loan, the department shall send a written notice of the transaction to the county court of the county in which such deeded lands are situated. Upon the receipt of such notice, the county court shall cancel on the county tax records unpaid taxes levied and assessed against such property in that county. This section does not apply to tax liens of irrigation or drainage districts organized prior to the effective date of the lien of the department.

 

      327.470 Cancellation of taxes on land acquired through foreclosure proceedings; right of redemption. (1) Excepting tax liens of irrigation or drainage districts organized before the effective date of the Department of State Lands’ lien, whenever the State of Oregon acquires property or lands through foreclosure of a mortgage given to secure a loan from the Common School Fund and the state has received the sheriff’s deed made as a result of such foreclosure proceedings and the period for redemption has expired, the county court, or board of county commissioners, of the county in which such lands are situated shall cancel on the county tax records all the unpaid taxes levied and assessed against the property.

      (2) At the time the sheriff issues a certificate of sale in the foreclosure proceedings of any department mortgage, the sheriff shall serve a copy of the certificate upon the county judge, or the chairperson of the board of county commissioners, of the county in which the foreclosure takes place. The county shall have a 60-day period from the date of the sheriff’s certificate in which to redeem the land by paying the department the full amount of its investment in the land, including principal and interest, foreclosure charges, abstracting expense, and any other necessary expense incurred by the department in said foreclosure proceedings.

 

      327.475 When county court may acquire mortgaged lands deeded to state. Whenever the Department of State Lands receives a deed as described in ORS 327.465, the county court of the county in which the lands are situated may, within one year from the recorded date of such deed, acquire from the state the property so conveyed by paying to the state the total amount of the state’s investment in the property.

 

      327.480 Use of Common School Fund moneys to comply with judgment canceling fraudulent deed. (1) Where the judgment in a suit instituted by the State of Oregon to cancel and set aside any deed of lands from the State of Oregon alleged to have been procured by fraud and in violation of law grants relief to the State of Oregon which is conditioned on the payment of money, the Department of State Lands may pay from the Common School Fund the sum necessary to comply with the conditions of the judgment.

      (2) This section shall not be considered as a legislative interpretation relieving the defendants in such suit from applying to the legislature for repayment of the purchase price of such land, or that the State of Oregon is not entitled to an accounting from the purchaser, the assignee, or successor in interest, for school or other lands obtained in violation of law, or that the State of Oregon must repay the purchase price of such lands, with or without interest as a condition of obtaining relief. This section is intended to prevent the loss to the State of Oregon of lands obtained in violation of law, where the court imposes as a condition for granting relief the payment of money. [Amended by 1965 c.100 §37; 2003 c.576 §433]

[1997 c.612 §3; 1999 c.44 §10; 1999 c.1066 §13]

 

      327.705 Purpose of ORS 327.700 to 327.711. The Legislative Assembly declares that the purpose of ORS 327.700 to 327.711 is to authorize lottery bonds for state education projects. The lottery bonds authorized by ORS 327.700 to 327.711 shall be issued pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585. The obligation of the State of Oregon with respect to the lottery bonds and with respect to any grant agreement or other commitment authorized by ORS 327.700 to 327.711, 327.731, 348.696 and 777.277 shall at all times be restricted to the availability of unobligated net lottery proceeds, proceeds of lottery bonds and any other amounts specifically committed by ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585. Neither the faith and credit of the State of Oregon nor any of its taxing power shall be pledged or committed to the payment of lottery bonds or any other commitment of the State of Oregon authorized by ORS 327.700 to 327.711. [1997 c.612 §1; 1999 c.44 §11; 2007 c.783 §127]

 

      327.708 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The financing of the costs of state education projects accomplishes the purpose of financing public education in Oregon, as well as having the additional effect of creating jobs and furthering economic development in Oregon by:

      (a) Maintaining and increasing the utility, effectiveness and capacity of public education facilities and public education technology and ensuring their availability to Oregon students; and

      (b) Creating employment opportunities in this state through the funding of capital improvement and maintenance projects on which workers will be employed.

      (2) Based on the findings made in this section, the use of the net proceeds from the operation of the Oregon State Lottery to fund state education projects and to pay state education lottery bonds is an appropriate use of state lottery funds under section 4, Article XV of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 461.510. [1997 c.612 §2; 1999 c.44 §12]

 

      327.711 Payment of debt service; issuance of bonds; School Capital Construction, Maintenance and Technology Fund.

      (3) The School Capital Construction, Maintenance and Technology Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. The net proceeds from the sale of the state education lottery bonds that are available to pay costs of state education projects shall be credited to the School Capital Construction, Maintenance and Technology Fund. Investment earnings received on amounts in the School Capital Construction, Maintenance and Technology Fund shall be credited to the School Capital Construction, Maintenance and Technology Fund. All moneys from time to time credited to the School Capital Construction, Maintenance and Technology Fund, including any investment earnings, are appropriated continuously to the Department of Education only for distribution to school districts pursuant to ORS 327.731 and for payment of the bond-related costs that are allocable to state education lottery bonds. Amounts in the School Capital Construction, Maintenance and Technology Fund shall be disbursed upon the written request of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to school districts for state education projects pursuant to ORS 327.731, and upon the written request of the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services to pay for bond-related costs that are allocable to state education lottery bonds.
