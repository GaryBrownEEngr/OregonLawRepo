The funds shall be kept in a separate fund to be known as and designated “School District No. ___ Bond Interest and Sinking Fund,” which shall be irrevocably pledged to and used solely for the payment of the interest accruing on and the principal of the bonds when due, so long as any of the bonds or the coupons thereto appertaining remain outstanding and unpaid. The interest earnings of the fund shall be credited thereto and become a part thereof. For failure to retain and account for such funds, as provided in this section, the county treasurer, county fiscal officer or insured institution or trust company designated by the district shall be liable upon the official bond of the treasurer, other officer or institution, respectively.

      (3) The fund shall not be diverted or used for any other purpose; but if a surplus remains after all interest and principal have been paid on all serial school district bonds then outstanding and unpaid, the surplus may be transferred to such other fund as the district school board may direct. [Amended by 1955 c.467 §1; 1965 c.100 §57a; 1981 c.441 §2; 1985 c.762 §184; 1997 c.631 §461]

      (b) If the school district has established tax zones pursuant to ORS 328.570 to 328.579, a levy imposed under this subsection shall be apportioned among the tax zones of the school district consistently, with the percentages set forth in the resolution adopted under ORS 328.576.

All coupons or bonds so paid must be immediately reported to the district school board.

      (2) No county treasurer, county fiscal officer or district school board shall pay to the purchaser of any bond issued by a school district, or to any agency representing such purchaser, any commission whatsoever for the collection of the interest on or principal of any such bond. The county treasurer or county fiscal officer shall not be required to remit to the purchaser of any bonds or coupons the amount necessary to redeem them until the day such bonds or coupons are due.

      (b) Deadlines or application periods in which school districts must submit applications.

      (c) The character, quality and currency of the information on the financial affairs and condition of a school district that must be submitted for a school district’s application to be considered.

      (3)(a) After reviewing the request, if the State Treasurer determines that the school district is eligible, the State Treasurer shall promptly issue the certificate of qualification and provide it to the requesting school district.

      (b)(A) Unless the certificate of qualification is revoked by the State Treasurer, and subject to the fulfillment of any conditions or requirements imposed by the State Treasurer, the school district receiving the certificate and all other persons may rely on the certificate as evidencing eligibility for the state guaranty for one year from and after the date of the certificate.

      (B) A revocation of a certificate of qualification does not affect the state guaranty of any outstanding school bonds previously issued under a valid certificate.

      (4) Any qualified school district that chooses to forgo the benefits of the state guaranty for a particular issue of school bonds may do so by not referring to ORS 328.321 to 328.356 on the face of its school bonds.

      (5) A school district that has school bonds, the principal of or interest on which has been paid in whole or in part by the state under ORS 328.341, is not eligible to issue any additional school bonds with the state guaranty until:

      (b) The State Treasurer may remove a school district from the status of ineligibility and may issue a certificate of qualification for that school district when a subsequent application of the school district evidences that it is no longer imprudent for the state to guarantee the school bonds of that school district.

      (2) Nothing in this section affects the state guaranty of school bonds of a school district issued:

      (a) Before determination of ineligibility or before revocation of a certification of qualification;

      (b) After the eligibility of the school district is restored; or

      (c) A writing sent by first class mail.

      (3)(a) If sufficient moneys to pay the scheduled debt service payment have not been transferred to the paying agent, the State Treasurer shall, on or before the scheduled payment date, transfer sufficient moneys to the paying agent to make the scheduled debt service payment.

      (b) The payment by the State Treasurer:

      (A) Discharges the obligation of the issuing school district to its bondholders for the payment; and

      (B) Transfers the rights represented by the general obligation of the school district from the bondholders to the state.

      (c) The school district shall pay to the State Treasurer all amounts paid by the treasurer to the paying agent, as well as interest, penalties and any additional costs incurred by the treasurer, as provided in ORS 328.346. [1997 c.614 §6; 1999 c.251 §5]

      328.346 Recovery from school districts of payments on school bonds by State Treasurer. (1)(a) If one or more payments on school bonds are made by the State Treasurer as provided in ORS 328.341, the State Treasurer shall pursue recovery from the school district of all moneys necessary to reimburse the state for all amounts paid by the treasurer to the paying agent, as well as interest, penalties and any additional costs incurred by the treasurer as described in this section. In seeking recovery, the State Treasurer may:

      (A) Intercept any payments from the General Fund, the State School Fund, the income of the Common School Fund and any other source of operating moneys provided by or through the state to the school district that issued the school bonds that would otherwise be paid to the school district by the state;

      (B) Exercise the rights of a secured creditor in any moneys or assets pledged by the school district to secure the district’s reimbursement obligation to the state; and

      (C) Apply any intercepted payments and pledged moneys or assets to reimburse the state for payments made pursuant to the state guaranty until all obligations of the school district to the state arising from those payments, including interest and penalties, and any additional costs incurred by the treasurer as described in this section are paid in full.

      (b) The state has no obligation to the school district or to any person or entity to replace any moneys or assets intercepted or pledged under authority of this section.

      (c) The authority of the State Treasurer to intercept payments and the lien in any pledged moneys under this subsection have priority over all claims against money provided by the state to a school district, including a claim that is based on a funds diversion agreement under ORS 238.698. A funds diversion agreement under ORS 238.698 has priority over all other claims against money provided by the state to a school district.

      (a) Reimburse all moneys drawn or paid by the State Treasurer on its behalf;

      (b) Pay interest to the state on all moneys paid by the state from the date the moneys were drawn to the date they are repaid at a rate to be determined by the State Treasurer, in the State Treasurer’s discretion, to be sufficient to cover the costs of funds to the state plus the costs of administration of the state guaranty obligation and of collection of reimbursement; and

      (c) Pay any applicable penalties as described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (3)(a) The State Treasurer shall establish the reimbursement interest rate after considering the circumstances of any prior draws by the school district on the state, market interest and penalty rates and the cost of funds, if any, that were required to be used or borrowed by the state to make payment on the school bonds. The State Treasurer shall have authority to establish, by negotiations with the school district or otherwise, any plan of reimbursement by the school district that will result in full and complete reimbursement to the state. Subject to the requirement for full and complete reimbursement, the State Treasurer may consider incorporating into the reimbursement plan the means and methods to allow the school district to continue its operations during the time the reimbursement plan is in effect.

      (b) The State Treasurer may, after considering the circumstances giving rise to the failure of the school district to make payment on its school bonds in a timely manner, impose on the school district a penalty of not more than five percent of the amount paid by the state pursuant to the state guaranty for each instance in which a payment by the state is made.

      (4)(a) If the State Treasurer determines that amounts obtained under this section will not reimburse the state in full within the time determined by the State Treasurer or incorporated in the reimbursement plan from the state’s payment of a school district’s debt service payment, the State Treasurer shall pursue any legal action, including but not limited to mandamus, against the school district or school district board to compel the school district to:

      (A) Levy and provide property tax revenues to pay debt service on its school bonds and other obligations when due; and

      (B) Meet its repayment obligations to the state.

      (b) With respect to any school bonds for which the State Treasurer has made payment under the state guaranty, and in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, the state shall have the same substantive and procedural rights as would a holder of the school bonds of a school district.

      (b) A school district may use ad valorem property taxes or other moneys to replace intercepted funds or other funds paid to the State Treasurer only if the ad valorem property taxes or other moneys were derived from:

      (A) Taxes originally levied to make the payment, but which were not timely received by the school district;

      (B) Taxes from a special levy imposed to make up the missed payment or to replace the intercepted funds or funds otherwise paid to the State Treasurer;

      (C) Moneys transferred from any lawfully available funds of the school district or the undistributed reserves, if any, of the school district; or

      (D) Any other source of moneys on hand and legally available.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, a school district may not replace operating funds intercepted by the state or otherwise paid to the State Treasurer with moneys collected and held to make payments on school bonds if that replacement would divert moneys from the payment of future debt service on the school bonds and increase the risk that the state guaranty would be called upon a second time.

      (b) Real or personal property held by the school district.

      (3) The lien may be foreclosed by a proceeding brought in the circuit courts of the state and any tangible real or personal property subject to the lien may be sold upon an order of the court. The proceeds of the sale must be applied first to the payment of the costs of foreclosure and then to the amounts owing under ORS 328.346 (2), with any remaining balance paid to the school district.

      (b) Each state bond shall recite that it is a valid obligation of the state and that the full faith, credit and resources of the state are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the state bond from the taxes or revenues identified in accordance with its terms and the Oregon Constitution and other laws of this state.

      (7) Upon the completion of any sale of the state bonds, the State Treasurer shall credit the proceeds of the sale, other than accrued interest and amounts required to pay costs of issuance of the state bonds, to the fund or account established by the State Treasurer to be applied to the purpose for which the state bonds were issued.

Upon receipt of the audit report and the resolution, the Secretary of State and the Department of Education must either acknowledge the plans of the school district board or education service district board to correct deficiencies cited in the audit report or notify the board of those deficiencies that, if not corrected, could result in the withholding of funds under this section. At the request of a board, the Secretary of State or the Department of Education shall make suggestions for correcting those deficiencies. If the board does not agree with the notification by the Secretary of State or the Department of Education, the board shall be granted an opportunity for a conference regarding the notification, audit determinations or corrective measures to be taken.

      (4) If the Secretary of State or the Department of Education concurs with the determination made under subsection (1) of this section in two successive audits of the same school district or education service district and determines that the school district board or education service district board has not taken adequate action to correct the deficiencies cited in the notifications given under subsection (3) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Department of Education may certify those facts to the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
