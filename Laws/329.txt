IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

(Successful Schools Program)

 

      329.825 Policy on successful and innovative schools. It shall be the policy of the State of Oregon to promote and encourage successful and innovative schools. Success shall be determined by establishing standards of improvement in student learning and measuring each school’s performance in meeting those standards. Schools that meet those standards will be rewarded with additional tools to further improve student learning. [1997 c.864 §1]

 

      Note: 329.825 and 329.830 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 329 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      329.830 Establishment; application; incentive rewards; rules. (1) The State Board of Education shall establish a system of determining successful schools and dispensing appropriate incentive rewards to those schools. The system shall be based on a school being the measurement unit to determine success. School success shall be determined by measuring a school’s improvement over a specific assessment period. The successful schools program shall be voluntary.

      (2) A school may submit an application to the Department of Education for the successful schools program. The application shall include a short statement from the school requesting consideration for the successful schools program. The application shall also include a copy of the district continuous improvement plan implemented pursuant to ORS 329.095 for the school.

      (3) A school may not amend its application after the application is submitted without approval by the state board. A school that has submitted an application may not submit a new application until the assessment period has ended, unless the school withdraws the previous application.

      (4) The department shall distribute incentive rewards to schools that are determined to be successful schools. The board shall establish criteria for determining successful schools. The criteria shall include, but not be limited to:

      (a) The results from the statewide assessment system developed pursuant to ORS 329.485;

      (b) The achievement of measurable academic goals from district continuous improvement plans; and

      (c) Other criteria relating to improvement in student learning.

      (5) The department shall base the amount of the reward to each successful school on the number of teachers employed by the school. The minimum reward for each full-time teacher shall be $1,000. Part-time teachers shall receive a percentage of the reward based on the amount of time the part-time teacher worked. Teachers hired during the assessment period shall receive a percentage of the reward based on the length of time the teacher worked at the school during the assessment period.

      (6) Each teacher shall individually decide how to use the reward. A reward shall be used by a teacher for classroom enhancements or professional development. As used in this subsection, “classroom enhancements” means items and activities that will improve student learning, including, but not limited to, books, instructional materials, multimedia equipment and software, supplies and field trips.

(Early Success Reading Initiative)

 

      329.832 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Reading is the gateway to learning and a key to building a child’s self-esteem.

      (2) Children who read below grade level after third grade are at significantly greater risk of truancy, school failure, criminal and at-risk behaviors, early pregnancy and substance abuse.

      (3) Research shows that children who have academic problems and exhibit at-risk behavior can be helped most effectively through prevention programs designed specifically to strengthen the collaborative and collective decision-making skills of kindergarten through grade three teachers and administrators within each individual school.

      (4) Scientifically based assessment methods can identify as early as kindergarten those children needing extra help to successfully learn to read.

      (5) Scientifically based instructional reading materials can provide the reading skills children need to successfully learn to read. [2001 c.861 §1]

 

      Note: 329.832 to 329.837 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 329 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      329.834 Creation; components; reading sites. (1) There is created the Early Success Reading Initiative for the State of Oregon.

      (2) The purpose of the initiative is to recognize the essential need of elementary schools to effectively use research-based teaching practices and learning strategies.

      (3) The components of the Early Success Reading Initiative include, but are not limited to:

      (a) Providing research-based assessment systems to administrators, teachers and the public in order to provide the decision-making and accountability information needed to monitor children’s progress as they learn to read.

      (b) Screening and continuously monitoring the reading progress of all children from kindergarten through the completion of the third grade.

      (c) Using scientific, research-based reading systems to create school cultures and processes that enable all children to read successfully, including children with disabilities and children with linguistic and cultural diversity and other learning needs.

      (d) Enabling administrators and teachers within each individual school to collect, interpret and use student learning data to:

      (A) Guide kindergarten through grade three teachers and administrators in instructional decisions;

      (B) Implement a kindergarten through grade three schoolwide reading action plan;

      (C) Provide strategies for student groups; and

      (D) Provide structured interaction with parents.

      (e) Establishing a relationship between school districts and the University of Oregon to provide instructional and research support to assist school administrators, teachers and parents to enable students in kindergarten through grade three to learn to read effectively and successfully through means that are in congruence with state standards for reading and common curriculum goals.

      (4) The University of Oregon may design, implement and monitor the Early Success Reading Initiative. The University of Oregon may provide consultation services to school districts that establish early success reading sites.

      (5) The goal of the initiative is to enable each school district to establish early success reading sites at individual elementary schools. An elementary school that is initially selected as an early success reading site shall serve as a model and as a resource to other elementary schools within its school district as those schools implement the initiative. [2001 c.861 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 329.832.

 

      329.837 Report. The University of Oregon shall report annually on the implementation, longitudinal progress and results of the Early Success Reading Initiative to the Governor and the appropriate legislative committees. [2001 c.861 §3; 2011 c.731 §21]
