A fair representation of the subsidy recipients who qualify for lower copayments must be persons with children who are from underserved racial, ethnic or minority populations. In addition, child care providers that meet specified minimum standards established under the tiered quality rating and improvement system may receive an enhanced reimbursement under the subsidy programs.

      (e) Subsidy recipients must report a change of child care provider to the department during the period a subsidy is being received.

      (2) The department shall work to meet federal recommendations for income eligibility and market access in regard to employment-related child care administered by the department. [2015 c.698 §1]
