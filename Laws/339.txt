      (a)(A) For a homeschooled student, the student must meet all school district eligibility requirements except:

      (i) The school district’s school or class attendance requirements; and

      (ii) The class requirements of the voluntary association that administers the interscholastic activity, if applicable.

      (B) For a student who attends a public charter school, the student must meet all school district eligibility requirements except the school district’s school or class attendance requirements.

      (b) The student must meet one of these requirements:

      (A) Achieve a minimum score that places the student at or above the 23rd percentile, based on national norms, on an examination from the list the State Board of Education adopts under ORS 339.035.

      (B) An additional annual fee that is equivalent to not more than five percent of the amount of the school district’s General Purpose Grant per ADMw, as calculated under ORS 327.013, if participating in the interscholastic activity requires the student to enroll in a course for credit.

      (b) The school district and the public charter school shall enter into an agreement to specify the amount of the fees described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) A public charter school is required to pay a fee described in paragraph (a) of this subsection only once per year per student participating in an interscholastic activity at a school in the school district, regardless of the number of interscholastic activities in which the student participates.

The student must also comply with all public school requirements during the time of participation.

      (b) A student who attends a public charter school must be allowed to participate in an interscholastic activity in the same manner that a resident of the school district may participate in the interscholastic activity. A school district may not give priority to residents of the school district to participate in interscholastic activities, but may require a student who attends a public charter school to satisfy any standards for acceptance for participation.

      (7) A homeschooled student, or a student who attends a public charter school, who participates in interscholastic activities must reside within the attendance boundaries of the school at which the student participates unless the school district has a policy that allows any student attending a school of the school district to participate in interscholastic activities at any school of the school district.
