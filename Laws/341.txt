GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      341.005 Definitions for chapter. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

      (1) “Academic year” means the year beginning July 1 of each year and ending June 30 of the following year running concurrently with the fiscal year.

      (2) “Board” means the board of education of a community college district.

      (3) “Board member” means a member of the board of education of a community college district.

      (4) “Community college” means a public institution operated by a community college district for the purposes of providing courses of study limited to not more than two years’ full-time attendance, with the exception of technical programs in which the curriculum may require more than two years of attendance but less than four years, and designed to meet the needs of a geographical area by providing educational services, including but not limited to career and technical education programs or lower division collegiate programs.

      (5) “Community college district” or “district” means a district formed under this chapter to operate one or more community colleges or to secure educational services available at a community college. “Community college district” includes a community college service district.

      (6) “Director” means the Director of the Office of Community Colleges and Workforce Development appointed under ORS 350.160 by the executive director of the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.

      (7) “Full-time equivalent student” means a student or combination of several students who carries or carry among them, within a single academic year, a minimum number of clock hours of instruction, in any program, to be specified by rule by the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.

      (8) “Paying agent and registrar” means the county treasurer or county fiscal officer of the county in which the chief administrative officer of the community college district maintains the administrative office.

      (9) “Petitioning territory” means a community college district petitioning to have an area outside the district included in the district or to have an area inside the district excluded from the district, or an area outside the district petitioning to be included within the district.

      (10) “Principal county” means the county in which the chief administrative officer of the community college district maintains the administrative office. [Formerly 341.510; 1971 c.513 §1; 1981 c.173 §52; 1987 c.474 §4; 1993 c.45 §§127,128; 1995 c.67 §1; 1997 c.271 §3; 2009 c.94 §11; 2013 c.747 §43; 2015 c.366 §12]

 

      341.009 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The community college is an educational institution that is intended to fill the institutional gap in education by offering broad, comprehensive programs in academic subjects and in career and technical education subjects. It is primarily designed to provide associate or certificate degree programs for some, serve a transitional purpose for others who will continue baccalaureate or other college work, provide the ability to enter the workforce immediately and serve to determine future educational needs for other students. It can provide means for continuation of academic education, career and technical education or the attainment of entirely new skills as demands for old skills and old occupations are supplanted by new technologies. It may also provide the means to coordinate courses and programs with high schools to accommodate successful transition to college degree programs.

      (2) Each community college should be so located as to be within commuting time of a substantial majority of its students. As an economical method of providing education close to the student’s home, the community college should remain a commuting institution.

      (3) The community college should establish its organizational patterns to maintain a unique quality of flexibility and the ability to change to meet changing needs.

      (4) The community college is a post-high-school institution. It should not be a “starter” institution intended to evolve into a four-year baccalaureate institution. It should be concerned with programs terminating before reaching the baccalaureate degree.

      (5) The community college should continue to be prohibited by law from becoming a baccalaureate degree granting institution.

      (6) Admission to the community college should be open to high school graduates or to persons who have not graduated from high school who can profit from the instruction offered.

      (7) There should be close cooperation between those directing the community college program and those responsible for public universities listed in ORS 352.002, so that lower-division college transfer programs of the community college will provide adequate preparation for entering baccalaureate degree granting programs, and so that students will be able to transfer with a minimum of difficulty.

      (8) The community college should offer as comprehensive a program as the needs and resources of the area that it serves dictate. Cost to student and quality of instruction in established private institutions should be among the factors in determining necessary duplication of effort.

      (9) It should be the policy of the community college to open its facilities and make available its resources to the high schools of its area on a sound contractual basis, for appropriate secondary or transitional courses, either academic or as part of career and technical education, when it is within its ability to provide facilities and it is determined that the high school cannot or does not offer them.

      (10) Programs designed to meet the needs of the area served should be based on the actual educational and service needs of the district. Specific career and technical education courses should be related not only to the employment opportunities of the area but of the state and nation as well. Such determination should be made in consultation with representatives of labor, business, industry, agriculture and other interested groups.

      (11) The initiative for the establishment of new community colleges should come from the localities to be served, as a response to demonstrated educational needs of an area. However, these localities must not only be willing to assume the responsibility for the institutions but must be able to provide resources needed for an adequate educational and service program.

      (12) The governing board of the community college should be charged with the policy-making function. With respect to educational programming, the governing board shall:

      (a) Identify educational needs of the district; and

      (b) Bring together the resources necessary to meet the needs.

      (13) The state should maintain a policy of substantial state participation in community college building costs and the maintenance of an adequate level of state support for operation. However, no state funds should be appropriated for buildings such as dormitories or athletic facilities for spectator sports. The district should provide a substantial portion of the funds for capital improvement as well as for operation of a community college.

      (14) State appropriations for community colleges shall be made separately from those for other segments of education.

      (15) The formula for the distribution of funds for operating costs should reflect the heavier operating costs and capital outlay for certain career and technical education courses. Federal funds received for career and technical education, adult basic education, workforce development or other federal initiatives should be used for those purposes only and be distributed separately from funds appropriated by the state and should be exempted from the computations of the present distribution formula for operating costs.

      (16) The cost of education to the individual should be sufficiently low to permit students of low-income families to attend. This is particularly true of tuition costs. However, students should pay an amount sufficient to provide an incentive to profit from the instructional program offered.

      (17) Any eligible Oregon resident should have the right to attend a community college even though not residing in a district operating one, subject to the right of the governing board to limit the size of classes and to give preference to students residing in the district. Local school districts and education service districts should have the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions with the governing boards for the enrollment of students residing in such areas. [1971 c.513 §97; 1993 c.45 §130; 1995 c.67 §2; 2007 c.858 §36; 2009 c.94 §12; 2011 c.637 §122; 2013 c.747 §44]

 

      341.010 [Repealed by 1965 c.100 §456]

 

      341.015 Guidelines for districts. The Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall adopt guidelines for the orderly development and management of community college districts, including guidelines for personnel policy formulation, student record keeping and privacy procedures. [1971 c.233 §§1,2; 1987 c.474 §5; 1995 c.67 §3; 2013 c.747 §187; 2015 c.841 §3]

 

      341.018 [1975 c.553 §10; 1993 c.45 §131; repealed by 1995 c.67 §42]

 

DIRECT AND CONTRACT SERVICES

 

      341.019 Provision of services by district; rules; local advisory committees. (1) All areas within this state shall be served by a community college district. Such services may be provided either:

      (a) Directly by formation of a community college district; or

      (b) Indirectly by contract with an existing community college district.

      (2) The Office of Community Colleges and Workforce Development shall fix responsibility for serving each area that is not within a community college district. Where feasible, each area shall be a whole county or a group of counties or that part of a county not already in a community college district.

      (3) In order to obtain the services described in subsection (1)(b) of this section, residents of a nondistrict area must indicate their interest in receiving services by requesting formation of a local advisory committee and seeking the advice and counsel of the Office of Community Colleges and Workforce Development.

      (4) The Higher Education Coordinating Commission by rule shall establish standards for the Office of Community Colleges and Workforce Development to use determining when there is sufficient interest among the residents of a nondistrict area to warrant appointment of a local advisory committee.

      (5) When the Office of Community Colleges and Workforce Development has made the determination under subsection (4) of this section, the office and the interested residents of the nondistrict area shall apply jointly to the governing body of the county for the appointment of a local advisory committee.

      (6) Upon application, the governing body of the county shall appoint a local advisory committee and shall ensure that the committee is broadly representative of the nondistrict area.

      (7) If the nondistrict area involves two or more counties, the governing body of each county shall appoint members to the local advisory committee in proportion to the number of county residents within the nondistrict area.

      (8) The governing body of a county making appointments under subsection (6) or (7) of this section shall not be obligated to fund any part of the budget described in ORS 341.021 (3).

      (9) The duties of the local advisory committee shall include, but need not be limited to, advising the officials of the community college district serving the nondistrict area on the educational needs of the area.

      (10) As used in ORS 341.019 to 341.022, “community college district” includes a community college service district. [1987 c.191 §2; 1991 c.757 §3; 2013 c.747 §45; 2015 c.366 §13]

 

      341.020 [Repealed by 1965 c.100 §456]

 

      341.021 Provision of service outside districts. (1) The Office of Community Colleges and Workforce Development shall invite existing community college districts to submit proposals for the provision of service to an area that has officially indicated its interest in receiving service.

      (2) The responsibilities of the host community college district shall include:

      (a) Preparing a written agreement for services to be provided to nondistrict areas using a format specified by the office; and

      (b) Acting as the fiscal agent for agreements including establishing tuition and fees for services offered under terms of an agreement.

      (3) Agreements between the community college district and nondistrict entities as listed in ORS 341.315 shall include an annual budget setting forth both revenue and expenditures. The budget shall be based upon the following conditions:

      (a) Subject to ORS 341.022, eligible full-time equivalent student enrollment produced under the agreement may be claimed for state reimbursement purposes by the community college district. Such reimbursement shall come from the Community College Support Fund established in ORS 341.620 and shall be distributed as directed in ORS 341.626 and the rules of the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.

      (b) A share of the budget shall be provided by those individuals or agencies receiving service under this agreement as specified by rule of the commission adopted under ORS 341.024 (3).

      (4) Agreements developed under this section shall be wholly supported by Community College Support Fund reimbursement, nondistrict student tuition and nondistrict resources. [1987 c.191 §3; 1991 c.757 §4; 1995 c.67 §4; 2013 c.747 §46; 2015 c.366 §14]

 

      341.022 Maximum reimbursable enrollments in nondistrict areas. Annual state reimbursable enrollments under an agreement with a nondistrict area shall not exceed 300 full-time equivalent students. [1987 c.191 §4]

 

      341.023 [1987 c.191 §5; 1991 c.757 §5; repealed by 1995 c.67 §42]

 

      341.024 Rules. The Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall adopt rules to implement ORS 341.019 to 341.024. The rules shall provide:

COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS

 

(Formation)

 

      341.025 Petition for formation of district. (1) Whenever the electors registered in contiguous territory desire the formation of a community college district, they may sign a petition requesting the formation of such a district and present it to the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.

      (2) The petition must be substantially in the form established by the commission, which shall furnish the petition form. The petition:

      (a) Must contain the minimum number of signatures fixed by the commission of 500, or 10 percent of the electors registered in each county or part of a county within the designated territory, whichever is the lesser;

      (b) Must designate the boundaries of the territory to be included in the proposed district, which may include all or part of the territory lying within the boundaries of a school district and may be located in more than one county;

      (c) Must request that the territory be organized into a district;

      (d) May specify or reserve the right to specify the location for the proposed community college or may request the commission to determine the location;

      (e) Must specify the method of nomination and election of the board of education of the proposed district from among the methods described in ORS 341.327; and

      (f) Must contain any other information required by rules of the commission. [Formerly 341.710; 1967 c.465 §5; 1969 c.220 §1; 1969 c.673 §1; 1971 c.513 §73; 1983 c.83 §71; 1983 c.350 §194; 1989 c.261 §1; 1995 c.67 §5; 2013 c.747 §48]

 

      341.030 [Repealed by 1965 c.100 §456]

 

      341.035 [Formerly 341.720; repealed by 1969 c.673 §14]

 

      341.037 [1971 c.513 §74b; 1987 c.192 §1; repealed by 1989 c.261 §4]

 

      341.039 Formation of community college service district; method to change to community college district. (1) A petition submitted pursuant to ORS 341.025 may specify that the proposed district be organized as a community college service district. The formation of a community college service district shall comply with the provisions of ORS 341.025 to 341.125. A petition affecting a territory that, in the judgment of the Director of the Office of Community Colleges and Workforce Development, will not generate an annual enrollment in excess of 1,000 full-time equivalent students after three years of operation shall be considered to be a petition for the formation of a community college service district.

      (2) If formed, a community college service district shall in all respects be governed by the laws applicable to community college districts with the following exceptions:

      (a) Notwithstanding ORS 341.675, community college service districts formed on or after July 1, 1997, may not incur bonded indebtedness for any purpose. This limitation shall not be construed to prohibit lease-purchase arrangements or other lawful forms of capital financing. A community college service district may hold and own buildings and grounds acquired through gifts or financing methods authorized by this section.

      (b) The board of education for a community college service district shall annually review the programs and services of the service district. This review shall have as its purpose a determination of which services can most effectively and economically be delivered directly and which services can best be delivered through contracting arrangements. The direct hiring of faculty and staff is expressly permitted.

      (3) After having been in operation for at least three years, a community college service district may submit to the electors of the district the question of whether the district shall operate as a community college district.

      (4) Prior to submitting the question to the electors, the community college service district must have been in operation for three years, and must have secured the approval of the Higher Education Coordinating Commission to hold the election. Before granting approval, the commission must find:

Notwithstanding ORS 341.039 (3) and (4), on July 1, 2001, all community college service districts formed prior to July 1, 1997, shall become community college districts and on and after July 1, 2001, shall operate as community college districts. [2001 c.168 §2]

 

      341.045 Feasibility study; hearing. (1) The Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall examine the petition to determine whether it is complete. If the petition is complete and if formation of the district is consistent with the overall plan for all education in the state, the commission shall undertake a study of the feasibility of a community college in the geographical area proposed by the petition, including but not limited to:

      (a) Educational needs of the area.

      (b) Potential enrollment levels.

      (c) The rate of operating taxes that is required to meet the local share of operating and capital expenses and that would, if adopted, be the district’s permanent rate limit for operating taxes, including whether the proposed rate bears a reasonable relationship to the permanent rate limit of operating community college districts of similar size and circumstance to the proposed new district. If the proposed rate is substantially below the rate of similar operating districts, the feasibility study shall explicitly detail how the proposed new district intends to provide a comprehensive community college program.

      (d) Relationship of the proposed district to the overall plan for all education in the state.

      (e) Boundaries of the proposed district.

      (2) Upon completion of the study, the commission shall set a date for a public hearing on the petition and study and shall give notice of the hearing in the manner provided in ORS 341.357.

      (3) The notice of hearing shall state:

      (a) A study has been conducted on a proposed district.

      (c) Whether the proposed community college district specifies providing its courses through contract with agencies authorized to enter into such contracts.

      (d) The time and place set for the hearing on the petition. [Formerly 347.730; 1967 c.465 §1; 1969 c.673 §2; 1971 c.513 §74; 1991 c.397 §1; 1997 c.541 §378; 2013 c.747 §50]

 

      341.050 [Repealed by 1965 c.100 §456]

 

      341.055 Hearing; alteration of proposed boundaries. (1) At the time designated in the notice given under ORS 341.045, the Higher Education Coordinating Commission or its authorized representative shall conduct a public hearing on the study and may adjourn the hearing from time to time. The commission may alter the boundaries set forth in the petition submitted under ORS 341.025 to include all territory the residents of which will be materially benefited by formation of the community college district as determined by the study conducted under ORS 341.045. The commission shall not modify the boundaries of the district as set forth in the petition so as to exclude from the district any territory the residents of which will be materially benefited by formation of the district, nor may there be included in the proposed district any territory the residents of which will not be materially benefited.

      (2) If the commission concludes that any territory has been improperly included or omitted from the proposed community college district and that electors within the included or omitted territory have not appeared at the hearing, the commission shall continue further hearing on the study and shall order notice given to the nonappearing electors requiring them to appear and show cause why their territory should not be excluded or included in the proposed district. The notice shall be given either in the same manner as notice of the original hearing was given or by personal service on each nonappearing elector. If notice is given by personal service, such service shall be made at least 10 days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. [Formerly 341.740; 1967 c.465 §2; 1969 c.673 §3; 2013 c.747 §51]

If, in the opinion of the Higher Education Coordinating Commission, the study conducted under ORS 341.045 and the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings held under ORS 341.055 indicate that the formation of a community college district as petitioned is not warranted under the policies set forth by ORS 341.009, the commission shall order dismissal of the petition. An appeal from this order may be taken within 60 days in the manner provided in ORS 183.480. [1965 c.238 §2; 1967 c.465 §3; 1969 c.673 §4; 1991 c.397 §2; 2013 c.747 §52]

An appeal from the recommendation may be taken within 60 days in the manner provided in ORS 183.480. If no appeal from this recommendation is filed within 60 days after the date of the recommendation, the recommendation becomes final.

      (2) If an appeal is filed, the recommendation becomes final on the date the recommendation is affirmed by the court. However, if the recommendation is not affirmed, the commission may not submit its recommendation to the Legislative Assembly but may reconsider the conclusions of the study conducted under ORS 341.045 and if the commission revises those conclusions, the commission may set a date for a new hearing.

      (3) Upon receipt of the final recommendation, the Legislative Assembly shall approve or disapprove the recommendation. If the recommendation is approved, an election under ORS 341.085 shall be held. If the recommendation is disapproved, the commission may revise its recommendation and resubmit a final recommendation to the Legislative Assembly but not sooner than 60 days after the action of disapproval was taken. [1969 c.673 §6 (enacted in lieu of 341.075); 1971 c.513 §75; 1977 c.827 §1; 2003 c.574 §1; 2013 c.747 §53]

The election shall be held not sooner than the 90th day after the effective date of the appropriation required by ORS 341.102. The election date shall be uniform throughout the proposed district, and shall be set by the commission on a date specified in ORS 255.345. However, if the question of establishing a permanent rate limit for operating taxes is to be submitted, the election must be held on the same date as the next primary election or the next general election, as determined by the commission.

      (2) ORS chapter 255 and ORS 250.035 and 250.036 govern the notice and conduct of an election under this section.

The rate limit shall be specified by the commission as a result of its study and the hearing held under ORS 341.055. The commission may also include the question of incurring indebtedness to pay organizational expenses of the district between the time the district is approved and the first budget is adopted. If the question of incurring indebtedness is approved, the district may borrow money on its negotiable, short-term, promissory notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed the limit approved at the election and may, notwithstanding ORS 294.338, expend the money without the preparation and adoption of a budget.

      (2) In preparing its first budget, the board of the district shall provide for the repayment of the indebtedness incurred for organizational expenses under subsection (1) of this section. [1965 c.129 §2; 1969 c.673 §10; 1971 c.513 §77; 1995 c.67 §7; 1997 c.541 §380; 2013 c.747 §55]

If the election does not occur within the biennium immediately following the appropriation or allocation, the question shall be brought before the next Legislative Assembly. The state shall fund the election without regard to the outcome of the election.

      (b) Shall furnish any affected county assessor with a copy of the proclamation.

      (2) If the location of the community college or zone boundaries are specified on the ballot, and the vote favors formation, the commission shall include such location and boundaries in its proclamation.

      (3) If the vote is in favor of the formation of a community college district but opposed to a permanent rate limit at the rate submitted, the district shall not be formed. [Formerly 341.780; 1969 c.673 §13; 1983 c.350 §197; 1995 c.67 §10; 1997 c.541 §381; 2013 c.747 §178]

 

      341.125 First board. (1) The first board of education of a district shall be elected at the same election as the election at which votes are cast for the formation of the district. Nominations for the board of education positions to be filled by nomination and election at-large shall be made by petition requesting that such person’s name be placed on the ballot and signed with the signatures of at least 50 electors registered in the proposed district. If the district has been zoned and the position is to be filled by nomination or election by zone, the petition shall be signed by at least 25 electors registered in the zone. The petition shall be presented to the Higher Education Coordinating Commission at least 70 days prior to the election. Upon receipt of petitions that comply with applicable law, the commission shall cause the names of the nominees to be placed upon the ballot.

      (2) Seven members shall be elected to the first board, to serve terms of four and two years respectively in accordance with the number of votes each receives with the three members receiving the largest number of votes serving the four-year terms. The terms of office of the members of the first board shall be computed from the date of June 30 subsequent to the date of their election, but the members shall take office immediately following the election. If for any reason a district is not formed, the election of board members for that proposed district is void.

      (3) If the district has been zoned, the commission shall designate the positions to be nominated or elected by zone and shall specify the length of the term to be served by each member of the first board elected by zone.

      (4) If the election is at large, the length of the term of office of members of the first board elected shall be determined in accordance with the number of votes each receives in the election. Those receiving the highest number of votes may serve the four-year terms, subject to any term designations made by the commission under subsection (3) of this section.

      (4) If a state that has entered into the agreement to pay the per capita state aid to eligible Oregon community colleges as described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section does not make any payment agreed to, the agreement terminates after the affected community college notifies the Higher Education Coordinating Commission of the lack of payment. The termination is effective 30 days after the commission notifies the appropriate agency of the other state that the agreement is terminated if no payment is received by the end of the academic period for which tuition is assessed and no payment is received at that time. The agreement may be reinstated by mutual consent of the parties.

      (5) The Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall adopt rules governing attendance in community colleges or comparable institutions in other states for purposes of the reimbursement authorized under subsections (1) and (2) of this section to ensure that Oregon residents shall not be the object of such reimbursement if they can obtain the same education within the state without undue hardship.

Any community college district may participate in the plan by giving written notice to the office.

      (2) An administrative employee may make an election to participate in the optional retirement plan if the community college district that employs the employee is participating in the plan. The election must be made in the following manner:

      (a) An administrative employee who is an active member of the Public Employees Retirement System may make an election to participate in the plan within 180 days after the community college district commences participation in the plan, effective on the first day of the month following the election.

      (b) An administrative employee who is hired after the community college district commences participation in the plan may make an election to participate in the plan within the first six months of employment, effective on the first day of the month following six full months of employment.

      (3) An administrative employee who does not elect to participate in the optional retirement plan remains or becomes a member of the Public Employees Retirement System in accordance with ORS chapters 238 and 238A.

      (4) An administrative employee may elect to participate in the optional retirement plan only if at the time the election becomes effective the employee is not concurrently employed in a position with any participating public employer other than the community college district in a position that entitles the employee to membership in the Public Employees Retirement System. Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, employees who elect to participate in the optional retirement plan are ineligible for active membership in the Public Employees Retirement System for as long as those employees are employed by a community college district that participates in the plan, whether by reason of employment by the district or any other participating public employer.

      (5)(a) An administrative employee who elects to participate in the optional retirement plan, who has creditable service under ORS chapter 238 as defined by ORS 238.005 and who is not vested shall be considered by the Public Employees Retirement Board to be a terminated member under the provisions of ORS 238.095 as of the effective date of the election, and the amount credited to the member account of the member shall be transferred directly to the optional retirement plan by the Public Employees Retirement Board in the manner provided by subsection (6) of this section.

      (b) An administrative employee who elects to participate in the optional retirement plan, who has creditable service under ORS chapter 238 as defined by ORS 238.005 and who is vested shall be considered to be an inactive member by the Public Employees Retirement Board and shall retain all the rights, privileges and options under ORS chapter 238 unless the employee makes a written request to the Public Employees Retirement Board for a transfer of the amounts credited to the member account of the member to the optional retirement plan. A request for a transfer must be made at the time the member elects to participate in the optional retirement plan. Upon receiving the request, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall transfer all amounts credited to the member account of the member directly to the optional retirement plan and shall terminate all rights, privileges and options of the employee under ORS chapter 238.

      (c) An administrative employee who elects to participate in the optional retirement plan and who is not a vested member of the pension program of the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan as described in ORS 238A.115 on the date that the election becomes effective shall be considered to be a terminated member of the pension program by the Public Employees Retirement Board as of the effective date of the election.

      (d) An administrative employee who elects to participate in the optional retirement plan and who is a vested member of the pension program of the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan as described in ORS 238A.115 on the date that the election becomes effective shall be considered an inactive member of the pension program by the Public Employees Retirement Board as of the effective date of the election. An employee who is subject to the provisions of this paragraph retains all the rights, privileges and options of an inactive member of the pension program. If the actuarial equivalent of the employee’s benefit under the pension program at the time that the election becomes effective is $5,000 or less, the employee may make a written request to the Public Employees Retirement Board for a transfer of the employee’s interest under the pension program to the optional retirement plan. The request must be made at the time the member elects to participate in the optional retirement plan. Upon receiving the request, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall transfer the amount determined to be the actuarial equivalent of the employee’s benefit under the pension program directly to the optional retirement plan and shall terminate the membership of the employee in the pension program.

An administrative employee who elects to participate in the optional retirement plan and who is a member of the individual account program of the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan may make a written request to the Public Employees Retirement Board that all amounts in the member’s employee account, rollover account and employer account, to the extent the member is vested in those accounts under ORS 238A.320, be transferred to the optional retirement plan. The request must be made at the time the member elects to participate in the optional retirement plan. Upon receiving the request, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall transfer the amounts directly to the optional retirement plan and shall terminate the membership of the employee in the individual account program.

      (f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (d) and (e) of this subsection, the Public Employees Retirement Board shall not treat any employee as an inactive member under the provisions of this subsection for the purpose of receiving any benefit under ORS chapter 238 or 238A that requires that the employee be separated from all service with participating public employers and with employers who are treated as part of a participating public employer’s controlled group under the federal laws and rules governing the status of the Public Employees Retirement System and the Public Employees Retirement Fund as a qualified governmental retirement plan and trust.

      (6) Any amounts transferred from the Public Employees Retirement Fund under subsection (5) of this section shall be transferred directly to the optional retirement plan by the Public Employees Retirement Board and shall not be made available to the employee.

      (7) An employee participating in the optional retirement plan shall contribute monthly an amount equal to the percentage of the employee’s salary that the employee would otherwise have contributed as an employee contribution to the Public Employees Retirement System if the employee had not elected to participate in the optional retirement plan.

      (8) A participating community college district shall contribute monthly to the optional retirement plan the percentage of salary for each employee participating in the plan that is equal to the percentage of salary that is required to be made as the employer contribution under ORS 238A.220, less any contributions made by reason of unfunded liabilities. The district may make contributions under this subsection only during periods of time in which the employee would be eligible for membership in the Public Employees Retirement System if the employee had not elected to participate in the optional retirement plan.

      (9) An administrative employee who elects to participate in the optional retirement plan may make an election to withdraw from the plan. An employee may make an election under this subsection only once. Upon withdrawing from the plan:

      (a) All contributions made to the plan before the effective date of the withdrawal remain credited to the employee;

      (C) If the two directors reside in the same zone, then that director elected by the greater number of votes between the two directors at large shall hold the board position for the territory of the zone in which the director resided at the date of election, and the other director shall hold the board position of the other zone.

      (D) The board members shall continue in office until their respective terms of at-large election expire, provided any vacancy occurring in a board member’s office before the expiration of such term shall be filled until expiration by appointment by the board of a resident of the board member’s zone.

      (4) The board shall appoint an advisory committee of seven members, including three from the original territory and three from the new territory. The board shall appoint a seventh, at-large member from a list of persons nominated by the advisory committee. The at-large member shall be the chairperson.

      (3) The aggregate amount of such district bonded indebtedness shall not exceed one and one-half percent (0.015) of the real market value of all taxable property within the district, computed in accordance with ORS 308.207.

      341.681 Issuance of bonds.

The paying agent and registrar shall cause the bonds to be delivered promptly to the purchasers thereof upon payment therefor, and if the place of delivery is outside the city in which the paying agent and registrar’s office is situated, the cost of delivery of the bonds shall be paid by the issuing district.

      (2) The paying agent and registrar shall hold the proceeds of the sale of all bonds for the community college district subject to the order of the board of the district to be used solely for the purpose for which the bonds were issued. The paying agent and registrar is authorized to deliver the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to the person designated as custodian of the community college district funds under ORS 341.703.

      (3) When the bonds have been so executed, registered and delivered, their legality shall not be open to contest by the community college district, or by any person for or on its behalf, for any reason whatever. [1971 c.513 §44; 1995 c.67 §32; 2007 c.783 §136]

 

      341.690 Tax levy to meet annual bonded indebtedness; bond sinking fund. (1) The board of the district shall ascertain and levy annually, in addition to all other taxes, a direct ad valorem tax on all the taxable property in the district, sufficient to pay the maturing interest and principal of all community college district bonds outstanding promptly when and as such payments become due. The amount of the tax may be increased by an amount sufficient to retire any bonds which may be callable. The board shall annually file a copy of its budget and levies with the paying agent and registrar. The board shall in each year include such taxes in the district budget for such year. Such taxes shall in each year be certified, extended upon the tax rolls and collected by the same officers in the same manner and at the same time as the taxes for general district purposes.

      (2) The funds derived from such tax levies shall be retained by the paying agent and registrar without being paid to the district or to any officer thereof, and shall be kept by the paying agent and registrar in a separate fund to be known as and designated “______Community College District Bond Interest and Sinking Fund,” which shall be irrevocably pledged to and used solely for the payment of the interest accruing on and the principal of the bonds when due, so long as any of the bonds or the coupons thereto appertaining remain outstanding and unpaid. The interest earnings of such fund shall be credited thereto and become a part thereof. For failure to retain and account for such funds, as provided in this section, the paying agent and registrar shall be liable upon the official bond of the paying agent and registrar.

      (3) The fund shall not be diverted or used for any other purpose; but if a surplus remains after all interest and principal have been paid on all community college district bonds then outstanding and unpaid, the surplus may be transferred to such other fund as the board of the district may direct.

      (4) If the tax required by subsection (1) of this section is not levied by the board of the district, the paying agent and registrar shall certify the county share, based on the proportion of the assessed valuation of the community college district located in the county, to the governing body of each county in which territory of the district is located which shall then levy a tax on all taxable property within the county that is in the district sufficient to raise the required amount.

      (5) The county assessors shall extend the tax so levied upon the county tax rolls for such district. The county sheriffs shall collect this tax and pay the sums collected into the fund kept by the paying agent and registrar pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. [1971 c.513 §45; 1995 c.67 §33]

 

      341.693 Payment of bond principal and interest. (1) The paying agent and registrar must cause to be paid out of any money in the hands of the paying agent and registrar belonging to the community college district, the interest on or principal of, as the case may be, any bond issued by the district promptly when and as the same becomes due at the place of payment designated in such coupons or bonds. All coupons or bonds so paid must be immediately reported to the board of the district.

      (2) The paying agent and registrar shall not be required to remit to the purchaser of any bonds or coupons the amount necessary to redeem them until the day such bonds or coupons are due. [1971 c.513 §46; 1995 c.67 §34]

 

      341.695 Bond redemption procedure. (1) Whenever the sinking fund mentioned in ORS 341.690 equals the amount, principal and interest, of any bond then due or subject at the option of the district to be paid or redeemed when authorized by the board of the district, the paying agent and registrar shall notify the holder of such bond and publish a notice in the newspaper published in the district in compliance with ORS 193.010 to 193.100. The notice shall state that the paying agent and registrar will, within 30 days from the date of the notice, redeem and pay any such bond then redeemable and payable, giving priority according to the date of issuance numerically. Upon presentation of any such bond at the place of payment specified therein, the paying agent and registrar shall cause the bond to be paid. If any holder of such bond fails to present it at the time mentioned in the notice, the interest thereon shall cease, and the paying agent and registrar shall thereafter pay only the amount of such bond and the interest accrued thereon up to the last day of the time of redemption mentioned in the notice.

      (2) When any bonds are so redeemed or paid, the paying agent and registrar shall cause the same to be canceled and write across the face thereof “redeemed” and the date of redemption, and shall deliver it to the board of the district, taking its receipt therefor. [1971 c.513 §47; 1995 c.67 §35]

 

      341.697 Refunding bonds. (1) Whenever any community college district has any outstanding bonded indebtedness, which is due or subject at the option of the district to be paid or redeemed, the district, by and through the board of the district, may:

      (a) Issue and exchange, for any such indebtedness, its bonds bearing the rate of interest determined by the board pursuant to ORS 287A.300 (1) to (3); or

      (b) Issue and sell such bonds and apply the proceeds of such sale in payment of the indebtedness for the payment of which the refunding bonds are proposed to be issued.

      (2) Refunding bonds issued under subsection (1) of this section shall in all respects conform to, and be governed, as to their issue, by ORS 341.675 (3) and the provisions of ORS 287A.360 to 287A.380 that are not inconsistent with this section.

      (3) The refunding of indebtedness and issuing of bonds for such purpose shall not require an election, but may be done by resolution of the board of the district at any legally called board meeting. The debt limitations imposed by law shall not affect the right of any district to issue refunding bonds under authority of this section. The validity of any bonds so issued, or of the indebtedness thereby refunded, shall not thereafter be open to contest by the district or by any person for any reason whatever. [1971 c.513 §48; 1981 c.94 §30; 1983 c.347 §26; 1993 c.45 §146; 2007 c.783 §137]

      (2) For the purpose of receiving deposits of community college funds, the board of the district shall designate such bank or banks, as the board deems safe and proper depositories for district funds. The custodian designated under subsection (1) of this section shall not be liable personally or upon the official bond of the custodian for moneys lost by reason of failure or insolvency of any bank which becomes a depository under this subsection.

      (3) When funds are available for payment, district obligations shall be paid by check bearing the original signature of the custodian of the district funds; or if authorized by the board of the district, the custodian’s facsimile signature.

      (4) Where a statute specifies a warrant as the means by which district obligations shall be paid, warrant means “check” if funds are available for payment. [1971 c.513 §50; 1995 c.67 §36]

 

      341.705 Warrant procedure. (1) As used in this section, “community college district obligation” includes salaries of district employees and other regularly contracted services.

      (2) Warrants in payment of district obligations shall be issued only when there are insufficient funds to pay the warrant and shall be indorsed “not paid for want of funds.” Warrants may be issued at the end of each month, if necessary. Warrants shall not be issued without a vote of the board of the district. They must be signed by the chairperson of the board and countersigned by the district clerk. If the chairperson is absent or unable to execute the warrants, the board may authorize any member of the board to act as chairperson in executing the warrants.

      (3) Unless the board of the district has designated a lower rate of interest, which rate must appear on the face of the warrants, warrants indorsed “not paid for want of funds” shall draw interest at a rate not to exceed seven percent (0.07) from date of indorsement until called.

      (4) Funds becoming available for payment of warrants indorsed “not paid for want of funds” shall be applied in payment in the order in which the warrants were so indorsed.

      (5) At the last regular school board meeting of the district preceding July 1 in each year, the district clerk shall certify to the board a list of all district warrants which were called for payment more than seven years prior to July 1 next following the meeting, and which have not been paid. The certification shall state the amount of each of such warrants, to whom issued, and date of issuance. The board of the district shall cause notice to be published in some newspaper having a general circulation in the district. The notice shall contain a statement that if such warrants are not presented for payment within 60 days from July 1, they will be canceled, and payment thereof will be refused.

      (6) At the first regular meeting of the board in each district after the expiration of 60 days from July 1 in each year, the board shall make an order that all such warrants which have not been so presented for payment, describing them, shall be canceled and the board shall so cancel.

      (7) Nothing in this section prohibits a board from paying, upon any claim arising from the canceling of any such warrant, the principal of the warrant when presented without interest if not indorsed for want of funds and, if indorsed for want of funds, with interest to the date such warrant was called. [1971 c.513 §52]

      (2) The board of the district in which indebtedness was incurred under this section shall levy an annual tax on all taxable property in the district sufficient to meet the interest payments and retire the indebtedness, but no tax shall be necessary where other provisions are made for payment of the indebtedness. [1971 c.513 §53; 1983 c.124 §10; 1985 c.356 §5; 1993 c.97 §26; 2007 c.783 §139]
