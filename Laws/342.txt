      342.835 Probationary teacher. (1) The district board of any fair dismissal district may discharge or remove any probationary teacher in the employ of the district at any time during a probationary period for any cause considered in good faith sufficient by the board.

      (2) For any cause it may deem in good faith sufficient, the district board may refuse to renew the contract of any probationary teacher. However, the teacher shall be entitled to notice of the intended action by March 15, and upon request shall be provided a hearing before the district board. Upon request of the probationary teacher the board shall provide the probationary teacher a written copy of the reasons for the nonrenewal, which shall provide the basis for the hearing.

      (3) If an appeal is taken from any hearing, the appeal shall be to the circuit court for the county in which the headquarters of the school district is located and shall be limited to the following:

      (a) The procedures at the hearing;

At least 30 consecutive days of employment in the same district in a successive year shall be sufficient to keep the service intact, and the teacher shall not lose credit for previous probationary years served. [1981 c.299 §3]

 

      Note: 342.840 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly and was added to 342.805 to 342.937 but was not added to or made a part of any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      342.845 Contract teacher; part-time contract teacher; effect of program transfer; administrator contracts. (1) A contract teacher shall not be subjected to the requirement of annual appointment nor shall the teacher be dismissed or employed on a part-time basis without the consent of the teacher except as provided in ORS 342.805 to 342.937.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a part-time contract teacher attains contract status at not less than half-time but less than full-time and may be assigned within those limits by the school district. The assignment of a contract part-time teacher is not subject to the procedures specified in ORS 342.805 to 342.930. A contract part-time teacher who accepts a full-time assignment shall be considered a contract teacher for purposes of the assignment.

      (3) No teacher shall be deprived of employment status solely because the duties of employment have been assumed or acquired by another school district or education service district in a state reorganization of a regional special education program. Where such reorganization occurs, a teacher shall be transferred to the employment of the school district or education service district which assumed or acquired program responsibilities. The teacher shall be allowed to transfer accrued sick leave and experience status to the new district. However, the district to which the programs are transferred is obligated to hire displaced employees only to the extent that such would complement a cost effective staffing plan in the reorganized program.

      (4)(a) As used in this subsection:

      (A) “Juvenile detention education program” means the Juvenile Detention Education Program, as defined in ORS 326.695.

      (b) No teacher shall be deprived of employment status solely because the duties of employment have been assumed or acquired by another school district or education service district pursuant to a transfer of juvenile detention education program responsibilities to another school district or education service district. Where such reorganization occurs, a teacher shall be transferred to the employment of the school district or education service district that assumed or acquired program responsibilities. The teacher shall be allowed to transfer accrued sick leave, seniority and status as a contract teacher. However, the district to which the program is transferred is obligated to hire displaced teachers only to the extent that such would complement a cost-effective staffing plan in the reorganized program.

      (5)(a) An administrator shall serve a probationary period that does not exceed three years, unless the administrator and the school district mutually agree to a shorter time period. Following a probationary period, an administrator shall be employed by a school district pursuant to a three-year employment contract. An administrator may be dismissed or have a reduction in pay during the term of a contract for any reason set forth for dismissal of a teacher in ORS 342.865, or pursuant to ORS 342.934 (5). If an administrator is dismissed or has a reduction in pay during the term of the contract, the administrator may appeal to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board in the same manner as provided for the appeal of a dismissal or a nonextension of a contract teacher. An administrator may not appeal the nonextension of a contract to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board.

      (b) The administrator may be assigned and reassigned at will during the term of the contract.

      (c) The district school board may elect not to extend the administrator’s contract for any cause the school board in good faith considers sufficient. Prior to March 15 of the second year of the administrator’s contract, the school board shall take one of the following actions:

      (A) Issue a new three-year contract effective July 1 following the March 15 of the second year of the administrator’s contract;

      (B) Provide, in writing, notice that the contract will not be renewed or extended; or

      (C) Extend the existing contract for a period of not more than one year.

      (6) If an administrator receives notice of contract nonextension prior to the expiration of the administrator’s contract, the administrator shall have the right to fill any vacant teaching position in the district for which the contract administrator is licensed and competent as defined in ORS 342.934, provided the administrator has three years’ teaching experience in Oregon that has been successful, in the judgment of the district superintendent. [1965 c.608 §§5,6; 1977 c.880 §2; 1983 c.554 §1; 1983 s.s. c.1 §2; 1993 c.480 §2; 1997 c.864 §8; 2001 c.681 §9; 2007 c.858 §37]

 

      342.850 Teacher evaluation; personnel file content; rules. (1) The district superintendent of every school district, including superintendents of education service districts, shall cause to have made at least annually but with multiple observations an evaluation of performance for each probationary teacher employed by the district. The purpose of the evaluation is to aid the teacher in making continuing professional growth and to determine the teacher’s performance of the teaching responsibilities. Evaluations shall be based upon at least two observations and other relevant information developed by the district.

      (2)(a) The district school board shall develop an evaluation process in consultation with school administrators and with teachers. If the district’s teachers are represented by a local bargaining organization, the board shall consult with teachers belonging to and appointed by the local bargaining organization in the consultation required by this paragraph.

      (b) The district school board shall implement the evaluation process that includes:

      (A) The establishment of job descriptions and performance standards which include but are not limited to items included in the job description;

      (B) A preevaluation interview which includes but is not limited to the establishment of performance goals for the teacher, based on the job description and performance standards;

      (C) An evaluation based on written criteria which include the performance goals;

      (D) A post-evaluation interview in which:

      (i) The results of the evaluation are discussed with the teacher; and

      (ii) A written program of assistance for improvement is established, if one is needed to remedy any deficiency specified in ORS 342.865 (1)(a), (d), (g) or (h); and

      (E) The utilization of peer assistance whenever practicable and reasonable to aid teachers to better meet the needs of students. Peer assistance shall be voluntary and subject to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement. No witness or document related to the peer assistance or the record of peer assistance shall be admissible in any proceeding before the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board, or in a probationary teacher nonrenewal hearing before a school board under ORS 342.835, without the mutual consent of the district and the teacher provided with peer assistance.

      (c) Nothing in this subsection is intended to prohibit a district from consulting with any other individuals.

      (3) Except in those districts having an average daily membership, as defined in ORS 327.006, of fewer than 200 students, the person or persons making the evaluations must hold teaching licenses. The evaluation shall be signed by the school official who supervises the teacher and by the teacher. A copy of the evaluation shall be delivered to the teacher.

      (4) The evaluation reports shall be maintained in the personnel files of the district.

      (5) The evaluation report shall be placed in the teacher’s personnel file only after reasonable notice to the teacher.

      (6) A teacher may make a written statement relating to any evaluation, reprimand, charge, action or any matter placed in the teacher’s personnel file and such teacher’s statement shall be placed in the personnel file.

      (7) All charges resulting in disciplinary action shall be considered a permanent part of a teacher’s personnel file and shall not be removed for any reason. A teacher shall have the right to attach the teacher’s response, or other relevant documents, to any document included under this subsection.

      (8) The personnel file shall be open for inspection by the teacher, the teacher’s designees and the district school board and its designees. District school boards shall adopt rules governing access to personnel files, including rules specifying whom school officials may designate to inspect personnel files.

      (9) A program of assistance for improvement or evaluation procedure shall not be technically construed, and no alleged error or unfairness in a program of assistance for improvement shall cause the overturning of a dismissal, nonextension of contract, nonrenewal of contract or other disciplinary action unless the contract teacher suffered a substantial and prejudicial impairment in the teacher’s ability to comply with school district standards. [1971 c.570 §5; 1973 c.298 §3; 1973 c.458 §1; 1977 c.881 §3; 1979 c.598 §1; 1979 c.668 §2a; 1987 c.663 §1; 1989 c.491 §29; 1997 c.864 §9]

      (a) Strengthen the knowledge, skills, disposition and classroom and administrative practices of teachers and administrators in public schools;

      (b) Refine the support, assistance and professional growth opportunities offered to a teacher or an administrator, based on the individual needs of the teacher or administrator and the needs of the students, the school and the school district of the teacher or administrator;

      (c) Allow each teacher or administrator to establish a set of classroom or administrative practices and student learning objectives that are based on the individual circumstances of the teacher or administrator, including the classroom or other assignments of the teacher or administrator;

      (2) In determining whether the professional performance of a contract teacher is adequate, consideration shall be given to regular and special evaluation reports prepared in accordance with the policy of the employing school district and to any written standards of performance which shall have been adopted by the board.

      (3) Suspension or dismissal on the grounds contained in subsection (1)(e) of this section shall not disqualify the teacher involved for any of the disability benefits provided in ORS chapter 238, or any of the benefits provided in ORS 332.507.

      (4) Dismissal under subsection (1)(f) of this section shall remove the individual from any school district policies, collective bargaining provisions regarding dismissal procedures and appeals and the provisions of ORS 342.805 to 342.937. [1965 c.608 §§9,19; 1973 c.298 §4; 1977 c.860 §4; 1981 c.569 §1; 1995 c.446 §10; 1997 c.249 §104; 1997 c.864 §10; 1999 c.130 §8]

 

      342.875 Suspension; reinstatement. Whenever a district superintendent has reason to believe that cause exists for the dismissal of a contract teacher on any ground specified in ORS 342.865 (1)(b) to (f), and when the district superintendent is of the opinion that immediate suspension of the teacher is necessary for the best interest of education in the district, the district superintendent may suspend a contract teacher from the position without prior notice to the teacher. The teacher’s salary shall continue during the first five days of the suspension period. However, within five days after such suspension becomes effective, either procedure shall be commenced for the dismissal of the teacher pursuant to the provisions of ORS 342.805 to 342.937 or the teacher must be reinstated. [1965 c.608 §7; 1971 c.570 §6; 1977 c.881 §4; 1997 c.864 §11]

      342.895 Contract teachers; procedure for dismissal or contract nonextension; appeal. (1) Contract teachers shall be employed by a school district pursuant to two-year employment contracts.

      (2) Authority to dismiss or not extend a contract teacher is vested in the district school board subject to the provisions of the fair dismissal and contract extension procedures of ORS 342.805 to 342.937 and only after recommendation of the dismissal or nonextension of contract is given to the district school board by the superintendent.

      (3)(a) At least 20 days before recommending to a board the dismissal of the contract teacher, the district superintendent shall give written notice to the contract teacher by certified mail or delivered in person of the intention to make a recommendation to dismiss the teacher. The notice shall set forth the statutory grounds upon which the superintendent believes such dismissal is justified, and shall contain a plain and concise statement of the facts relied on to support the statutory grounds for dismissal. If the statutory grounds specified are those specified in ORS 342.865 (1)(a), (c), (d), (g) or (h), then evidence shall be limited to those allegations supported by statements in the personnel file of the teacher on the date of the notice to recommend dismissal, maintained as required in ORS 342.850. Notice shall also be sent to the district school board and to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board. A copy of ORS 342.805 to 342.937 shall also be sent to the contract teacher.

      (b) If, after the 20-day notice required by paragraph (a) of this subsection, the district school board takes action to approve the recommendation for dismissal from the superintendent, the dismissal takes effect on or after the date of the district school board’s action, as specified by the board. Notice of the board’s action shall be given to the contract teacher as soon as practicable by certified mail, return receipt requested or in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil action.

      (4)(a) Upon recommendation of the district superintendent, the district school board may extend a contract teacher’s employment for a new two-year term by providing written notice to the teacher no later than March 15 of the first year of the contract. Any new contract that extends the teacher’s employment for a new term shall replace any prior contracts.

      (b) If the district school board does not extend a contract teacher’s contract by March 15 of the first year of the contract, the district superintendent, or the superintendent’s designee, shall place the teacher on a program of assistance for improvement. The district superintendent or the superintendent’s designee may, in addition, place any other teacher on a program of assistance for improvement if in the judgment of the district superintendent or designee a program of assistance for improvement is needed.

      (c) Provided that the district school board has not extended the teacher’s contract for a new two-year term, the district board, upon recommendation of the superintendent, may elect by written notice to the teacher no later than March 15 of the second year of the teacher’s contract not to extend the teacher’s contract based on any ground specified in ORS 342.865. A contract teacher whose contract is not extended may appeal the nonextension to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 243.650 to 243.782 or the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement entered into after August 15, 1997, no grievance or other claim of violation of applicable evaluation procedures, or fundamental unfairness in a program of assistance for improvement, shall be filed while a teacher is on a program of assistance. All statutes of limitation and grievance timelines shall be tolled while the subject claims are held in abeyance under this moratorium provision. Except as provided in this subsection, the moratorium and tolling period ends on the date the program of assistance for improvement is completed, not to exceed one year, after which any claims subject to this provision may be pursued as otherwise provided by law or contract. In the case of a contract teacher who does not receive contract extension by March 15 of the first year of the teacher’s contract, the moratorium period shall last until the teacher receives notice of contract extension or nonextension and no later than March 15 of the following school year, or until the teacher receives notice of dismissal. A contract teacher who is dismissed or receives notice of contract nonextension, and who appeals to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board, may raise any claims subject to this moratorium provision before the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board, which shall have jurisdiction to decide such claims. If the teacher does raise claims covered by this moratorium provision in an appeal to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board, such appeal shall be the teacher’s sole and exclusive remedy. If a contract teacher does not appeal a contract nonextension or dismissal to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board but instead pursues contract grievances to arbitration alleging a violation of evaluation procedures or fundamental unfairness in a program of assistance for improvement, the arbitrator shall not have authority to award reinstatement of the contract teacher, but may award other remedies including but not limited to back pay, front pay, compensatory damages and such further relief as the arbitrator deems appropriate. A program of assistance for improvement shall not be technically construed, and no alleged error or unfairness in a program of assistance shall cause the overturning of a dismissal, nonextension of contract, nonrenewal of contract or other disciplinary actions unless the contract teacher suffered a substantial and prejudicial impairment in the teacher’s ability to comply with school district standards.

      (6) No teacher may be dismissed, laid off or caused to suffer nonextension or nonrenewal of a contract based upon the teacher’s salary placement or other compensation. [1965 c.608 §11; 1971 c.570 §7; 1973 c.298 §5; 1977 c.881 §5; 1979 c.668 §3; 1997 c.864 §12]

 

      342.905 Appeal procedure; arbitration as alternative. (1) If the district school board dismisses the teacher or does not extend the contract of the contract teacher, the teacher or the teacher’s representative may appeal that decision to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board established under ORS 342.930 by depositing by certified mail addressed to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and a copy to the superintendent of the school district:

      (a) In the case of dismissal, within 10 days, as provided in ORS 174.120, after receipt of notice of the district school board’s decision, notice of appeal with a brief statement giving the reasons for the appeal.

      (b) In the case of a contract nonextension, within 15 days, as provided in ORS 174.120, after receipt of the written notice of nonextension of a contract, notice of appeal with a brief statement giving the reasons for the appeal.

      (2)(a) As soon as practicable after the time the notice of appeal is received by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the superintendent shall appoint a panel of three members from the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board for the purpose of conducting a hearing. Insofar as practicable, the panel shall be selected from those members of the board serving in positions where the average daily membership as determined in ORS 342.930 most nearly coincides with that of the involved district. The panel shall consist of:

      (A) One member from the category representing district school board members;

      (B) One member from the category not affiliated with common or union high school districts; and

      (C) One member from the category representing teachers or administrators, as follows:

      (i) If the appeal is from a contract teacher in a teaching position, the panel shall include the teacher member of the board.

      (ii) If the contract teacher is in an administrative position, an administrative member shall sit in place of the teacher member.

      (b) The panel may not contain a member who is a resident of the district that is bringing the dismissal or nonextension.

      (c) The Department of Education, at the department’s expense, shall provide to the panel appropriate professional and other special assistance reasonably required to conduct a hearing. The panel shall be empowered, on behalf of the contract teacher, the district superintendent and the district school board, to subpoena and swear witnesses and to require witnesses to give testimony and produce relevant evidence at or prior to the hearing.

      (d) The executive secretary of the board may issue subpoenas on behalf of a panel. A person subpoenaed under this subsection may move to quash or modify the subpoena if it is oppressive or unreasonable. The motion must be made before the time specified in the subpoena for appearance or production of materials. The motion may be made to the executive secretary or the panel.

      (e) In a case pending before a panel that involves a teacher’s performance at an Oregon Youth Authority facility, the panel assigned to the case may submit to the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority written questions that the panel unanimously agrees are relevant to the case. The director shall respond to the panel’s questions in writing within 20 days of the director’s receipt of the questions from the panel. If a question by the panel seeks information that is not confidential or privileged under Oregon or federal law, the director shall provide the information requested by the panel. If a question by the panel seeks information that is confidential or privileged under Oregon or federal law, the director, in responding to the question, may not disclose the confidential or privileged information but shall instead explain that the information being sought is confidential or privileged. The procedure outlined in this paragraph is not in lieu of any other mechanism that may be available to the panel or parties for obtaining or presenting evidence.

      (3) The Attorney General shall assign an assistant, at no cost to either involved party, to advise the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board, to be present at any hearing held by a panel, and to perform those tasks at the request of the board that would normally require legal training.

      (4) Within 10 days after receipt of the notice of an appeal of contract nonextension, the district shall serve upon the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board and the teacher a written statement of reason for the contract nonextension, which shall include:

      (a) A plain and concise statement of the facts relied on to support the statutory grounds for nonextension of the contract;

      (b) The statutory grounds upon which the district believes such contract nonextension is justified; and

      (c) A list of witnesses and documents upon which the district will rely at hearing.

      (5)(a) At least 10 days prior to the hearing, the teacher shall provide a list of witnesses and exhibits to the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel and the school district.

      (b) The Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel shall hold a contested case hearing under ORS chapter 183 within 100 days of the receipt by the teacher of notice of dismissal or of the statement of reasons in the case of contract nonextension. No later than 140 days after the filing of an appeal, consistent with due process, the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel shall prepare and send a written decision to the contract teacher, the district superintendent, the district school board and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The hearing shall be private unless the teacher requests a public hearing. At the hearing, the district and the contract teacher shall have the right to be present and be heard, to be represented by counsel, to present evidence and cross-examine adverse witnesses and to offer evidence that in the panel’s judgment is relevant to the dispute. The panel may take all reasonable steps to require the parties to conclude the hearing in an expeditious manner.

      (6) When the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel has completed its hearing, it shall prepare a written decision and send it to the contract teacher, the district superintendent, the district school board and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel shall determine whether the facts relied upon to support the statutory grounds cited for dismissal or nonextension are true and substantiated. If the panel finds these facts true and substantiated, it shall then consider whether such facts, in light of all the circumstances and additional facts developed at the hearing that are relevant to the statutory standards in ORS 342.865 (1), are adequate to justify the statutory grounds cited. In making such determination, the panel shall consider all reasonable written rules, policies and standards of performance adopted by the school district board unless it finds that such rules, policies and standards have been so inconsistently applied as to amount to arbitrariness. The panel shall not reverse the dismissal or nonextension if it finds the facts relied upon are true and substantiated unless it determines, in light of all the evidence and for reasons stated with specificity in its findings and order, that the dismissal or nonextension was unreasonable, arbitrary or clearly an excessive remedy.

      (7)(a) Subject to subsection (6) of this section and paragraph (b) of this subsection, if the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel finds that the facts relied on to support the recommendation of the district superintendent are untrue or unsubstantiated, or if true and substantiated, are not adequate to justify the statutory grounds cited as reason for the dismissal or nonextension, and so notifies the contract teacher, the district superintendent, the district school board and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the teacher shall be reinstated and the teacher shall receive such back pay as ordered by the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel for the period between the effective date of the dismissal or nonextension and the date of the order reinstating the teacher, or the date when the district actually reinstates the teacher, whichever is later. However, nothing in this section requires a school district to pay the teacher until the reinstatement occurs if the district has other legal grounds for not reinstating the teacher.

      (b) So long as the right of the district board under subsection (9) of this section and under ORS 183.480 and 183.500 to judicial review of the action of the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board remains unexpired, the district school board may withhold the reinstated teacher from performance of teaching duties, unless otherwise ordered by the court having jurisdiction of the appeal.

      (c) Subject to ORS 342.850 (9), if the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel determines that the procedures described in ORS 342.850 (2)(b)(A) to (D) have not been substantially complied with, the teacher may be reinstated with back pay as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (8) Subject to subsection (6) of this section, if the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel finds the facts relied on to support the recommendation of the district superintendent true and substantiated, and that those facts justify the statutory grounds cited as reason for the dismissal or nonextension and so notifies the contract teacher, the district superintendent, the district school board and the Superintendent of Public Instruction in writing, the dismissal or nonextension becomes final on the date of the notice.

      (9) An appeal from action of the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel shall be taken in the manner provided in ORS 183.480.

      (10)(a) If both the district board and the teacher or teacher’s representative agree, arbitration may be used as an alternative to a hearing before a Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel to determine if the teacher’s dismissal or nonextension of a contract is in compliance with the standards of ORS 342.805 to 342.910. If the teacher or teacher’s representative desires to use the arbitration procedure, the request for arbitration shall be included in the request for appeal that is filed with the Superintendent of Public Instruction under this section. Within 10 days of the time the superintendent of the district is notified of the teacher’s intent to appeal the dismissal or nonextension of a contract, the superintendent of the district shall notify the teacher or teacher’s representative and the Superintendent of Public Instruction as to whether the district has agreed to use the arbitration procedure. If the district determines not to use the arbitration procedure, the hearing procedure shall be continued under this section in the same manner as if no request for arbitration had been made. If the arbitration procedure is used, the teacher has no further rights to a hearing before a Fair Dismissal Appeals Board panel.

      (b) The procedures for selection of the arbitrator are those in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. If there is no provision or agreement or if the agreement does not contain a procedure for selection, the parties shall request a list of five arbitrators from the Employment Relations Board and shall choose an arbitrator by alternative striking of names until one name is left. The remaining person shall act as the arbitrator. The Employment Relations Board shall compile a roster of qualified arbitrators from which the lists are to be taken.

      (c) In determining whether the district board’s dismissal or nonextension of the teacher should be sustained, the arbitrator shall use the same reasons, rules and levels of evidence as are required for the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board under ORS 342.805 to 342.910. [1965 c.608 §12; 1971 c.570 §8; 1973 c.298 §6; 1973 c.612 §14; 1977 c.223 §1; 1977 c.400 §5; 1977 c.881 §6; 1979 c.668 §4; 1987 c.663 §2; 1993 c.236 §1; 1993 c.237 §1; 1993 c.778 §28; 1997 c.864 §13; 2001 c.449 §1; 2003 c.798 §4]

 

      342.910 Waiver of contract grievance claim if appeal of dismissal decision filed; waiver of certain rights and procedures. (1) Any teacher who files an appeal of a dismissal or nonextension of a contract decision with the Fair Dismissal Appeals Board, upon motion of the school district, shall be required to waive any contract grievance claim regarding the same dismissal or nonextension of a contract as a condition to Fair Dismissal Appeals Board or subsequent judicial review.

      (2) A school district and an exclusive bargaining representative of teachers may agree to waive all or any part of the rights and procedures provided under ORS 342.805 to 342.937 if third party review of any dismissal or nonextension of a contract teacher is available. [1995 c.286 §16; 1997 c.864 §14]

 

      342.915 [1965 c.608 §13; 1971 c.570 §9; 1979 c.668 §5; repealed by 1997 c.864 §29]

 

      342.925 [1965 c.608 §14; repealed by 1971 c.570 §15]

 

      342.930 Fair Dismissal Appeals Board; rules. (1) The Fair Dismissal Appeals Board is created, consisting of 24 members appointed by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate as provided in ORS 171.562 and 171.565.

      (2)(a) The membership of the board shall be as follows:

      (A) Six members must be administrators in common or union high school districts;

      (B) Six members must be contract teachers;

      (C) Six members must be members of common or union high school district boards at the time of their appointment; and

      (D) Six members may not have any affiliation with any common or union high school district.

      (b) One member from each category described in paragraph (a)(A) and (B) of this subsection may be retired prior to appointment if the member had been previously employed as an administrator or a contract teacher in this state.

      (c) At least one member from each category described in paragraph (a) of this subsection must be resident of a school district so that each type of school district described below is represented:

      (A) A school district with an average daily membership, as defined in ORS 327.006, of less than 1,500 students;

      (B) A school district with an average daily membership, as defined in ORS 327.006, of 1,500 to 4,500 students; and

      (C) A school district with an average daily membership, as defined in ORS 327.006, of greater than 4,500 students.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the term of office of each member is four years, but a member serves at the pleasure of the Governor. Before the expiration of the term of a member, the Governor shall appoint a successor whose term begins on July 1 next following. A member is eligible for reappointment. If there is a vacancy for any cause, the Governor shall make an appointment to become immediately effective for the unexpired term.

      (4) A member whose term has expired may continue to serve for the following limited purposes:

      (a) To conduct a hearing and prepare a written decision if the member was appointed to a panel in accordance with ORS 342.905 (2) before the expiration of the member’s term; or

      (b) To reconsider a decision if the member served on the panel originally hearing an appeal and a motion for reconsideration is filed prior to an appeal to the Court of Appeals.

      (5) The continued service of a member as provided in subsection (4) of this section shall not prevent a successor from taking office at the time prescribed in subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) Members shall be entitled to compensation and expenses as provided in ORS 292.495 for each day or part thereof during which they perform duties under ORS 342.805, 342.815, 342.835, 342.850, 342.875, 342.895 to 342.910 and this section, to be paid by the district school board from which the appeal is taken. However, any member of the board who would be entitled to receive a per diem except for being employed in full-time public service may receive the payment if service on the board is performed while the member is not under obligation to perform contractual teaching or administrative duties.

      (7) The board shall select one of its members as chairperson and another as vice chairperson, for such terms and with duties and powers necessary for the performance of the functions of such offices as the board determines.

      (8) A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.

      (9) In accordance with applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, the board may adopt rules necessary for the administration of this section and ORS 342.905 and 342.910. [1971 c.570 §10; 1973 c.298 §7; 1977 c.881 §7; 1983 c.777 §1; 1985 c.216 §1; 1997 c.864 §14a; 2001 c.449 §2; 2013 c.18 §1]

 

      342.934 Procedure for reduction of teacher staff due to funding or administrative decision. (1) The procedure for reduction in teacher staff positions resulting from the school district’s lack of funds to continue its educational program at its anticipated level or resulting from the district’s elimination or adjustment of classes due to administrative decision shall be as provided in this section. However, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with the right of a fair dismissal district to discharge, remove or fail to renew the contract of a probationary teacher pursuant to ORS 342.835.

      (2) The school district shall make every reasonable effort to:

      (a) Transfer teachers of courses scheduled for discontinuation to other teaching positions for which they are licensed and qualified.

      (b) Combine teaching positions in a manner which allows teachers to remain qualified so long as the combined positions meet the curriculum needs of the district and the competence consideration specified in subsection (4) of this section.

      (3) In determining teachers to be retained when a school district reduces its staff under this section, the school district shall:

      (a) Determine whether teachers to be retained hold proper licenses at the time of layoff to fill the remaining positions.

      (b) Determine seniority of teachers to be retained, calculated from the first day of actual service as teachers with the school district inclusive of approved leaves of absence. Ties shall be broken by drawing lots.

      (c) Determine competence and merit of teachers, if necessary, under subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) If a school district desires to retain a teacher with less seniority than a teacher being released under this section, the district shall determine that the teacher being retained has more competence or merit than the teacher with more seniority who is being released.

      (5) An administrator shall retain status and seniority as a contract teacher and voluntarily may return to teaching in a reduction in staff situation. However, an administrator who was never employed as a teacher in the district shall not be eligible to become a nonadministrative teacher in the district if the effect is to displace a nonadministrative contract teacher.

      (6) In consultation with its employees or, for those employees in a recognized or certified collective bargaining unit, with the exclusive bargaining representative of that unit, each school district shall establish a procedure for recalling teachers to employment in the district who have been released because of a prospective or actual reduction in staff. The procedure so established shall define the criteria for recall and the teacher shall have the right of recall thereunder for 27 months after the last date of release by the district unless waived as provided in such procedure by rejection of a specific position. A contract teacher who is recalled shall retain the status obtained before the release. A probationary teacher who is recalled shall have years taught for the district counted as if the employment had been continuous for purposes of obtaining contract teacher status.

      (7) An appeal from a decision on reduction in staff or recall under this section shall be by arbitration under the rules of the Employment Relations Board or by a procedure mutually agreed upon by the employee representatives and the employer. The results of the procedure shall be final and binding on the parties. Appeals from multiple reductions may be considered in a single arbitration. The arbitrator is authorized to reverse the staff reduction decision or the recall decision made by the district only if the district:

      (a) Exceeded its jurisdiction;

      (b) Failed to follow the procedure applicable to the matter before it;

      (c) Made a finding or order not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record; or

      (d) Improperly construed the applicable law.

      (8) After August 15, 1997, a school district shall not agree in any collective bargaining agreement to waive the right to consider competence in making decisions about the order of reduction in staff or recall of staff. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a school district and the exclusive bargaining representative from agreeing to alternative criteria for competence determinations under this subsection so long as the criteria ensure that all retained teachers are qualified for the positions they fill. As used in this subsection, “qualified” means the measurement of the teacher’s ability to teach the particular grade level or subject matter in which the teacher is placed after the reduction in force. Qualifications shall be measured by more than seniority and licensure, but may include other criteria that reasonably measure the teacher’s fitness to teach the relevant grade or subject level. Determinations of competence or qualifications under this subsection may take into account requirements for any special needs students.

      (9) As used in this section:

      (a) “Competence” means the ability to teach a subject or grade level based on recent teaching experience related to that subject or grade level within the last five years, or educational attainments, or both, but not based solely on being licensed to teach. The district may consider a teacher’s willingness to undergo additional training or pursue additional education in deciding upon questions of competence.

      (b) “Merit” means the measurement of one teacher’s ability and effectiveness against the ability and effectiveness of another teacher. [1981 c.569 §3; 1983 s.s. c.1 §1; 1989 c.282 §1; 1993 c.480 §1; 1997 c.864 §15]

 

      342.935 [1965 c.608 §15; repealed by 1971 c.570 §15; see 342.960]

 

      342.937 Reimbursement for teacher dismissal costs. The Superintendent of Public Instruction may reimburse any school districts for all or part of the costs reasonably related to a dismissal of a contract teacher or nonextension of a contract teacher’s contract, or appeal therefrom under ORS 342.805 to 342.937, provided that the school district is the ultimate prevailing party. The superintendent may consider the school district’s ability to pay the costs related to the dismissal or nonextension of the contract teacher, and seek such funds from the Emergency Board as may be in the superintendent’s judgment necessary to carry out this provision. [1997 c.864 §6]
