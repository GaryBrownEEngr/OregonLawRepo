For the purpose of this subsection, ORS 670.280 applies to individuals who hold positions of authority or control in the operation of the school and to its faculty members and agents.

      (3) A career school licensed in any other state must be licensed in this state before establishing a physical presence in this state such as offices or agents, or both, for the purpose of solicitation of students.

      (8) The commission may issue a conditional license to a career school that meets the requirements of subsection (5) of this section but that does not comply with the applicable standards adopted by rule under ORS 345.325. A conditional license issued under this subsection is effective for a period prescribed by the commission, which may not exceed 90 days.

No person shall act as an agent for a career school unless and until the career school has obtained a license.

      (2) For the purposes of licensing and student protection, persons acting as agents for a career school domiciled within or outside this state are employees of the school and shall be included under the school’s bonding or student protection policy, or both.

Service upon the executive director shall be taken and held in all courts to be as valid and binding as if personal service thereof had been made upon the applicant within this state.

      (2) When any summons, pleading, writ or process is served on the executive director, service shall be by duplicate copies. One of the duplicates shall be filed in the office of the executive director and the other immediately forwarded by certified mail to the agent thereby affected or therein named, at the agent’s last-known post-office address. If service is of a summons, the plaintiff therein also shall cause the agent to be served therewith in a manner provided by ORCP 7. [Amended by 1961 c.268 §7; 1975 c.478 §7; 1979 c.284 §138; 1989 c.333 §6; 1995 c.343 §6; 2012 c.104 §26; 2015 c.27 §38]

      345.110 Tuition Protection Fund; rules. (1) The Tuition Protection Fund is established separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned by the fund shall be credited to the fund. Proceeds of the fund are continuously appropriated to the Higher Education Coordinating Commission to protect students when a career school ceases to provide educational services and for administrative expenses incurred under subsection (5) of this section.

      (2) The commission shall maintain and administer the fund and shall adopt by rule procedures governing the administration and maintenance of the fund, including requirements relating to contributions to and claims against the fund.

      (3) Each career school shall pay to the Tuition Protection Fund an initial capitalization deposit in amounts and within time limits established by rule of the commission. Thereafter, each school shall make installment payments based on a matrix adopted by rule of the commission. In establishing the amount and frequency of payments, the commission may consider the enrollment and financial condition of each school and such other factors as the commission considers appropriate. The commission may deny, suspend or revoke the license of a school which fails to make payments or fails to conform to other requirements of this section or rules adopted by the commission under this section.

      (4) The commission shall deposit moneys received under this section with the State Treasurer in the Tuition Protection Fund.

      (5) The commission may disburse moneys from the fund by checks or orders drawn upon the State Treasurer in conformance with rules of the commission and only for tuition protection purposes, including the commission’s costs in administering and maintaining the fund.

      (6) The commission may enter into contracts to carry out the purposes of the fund. The provisions of ORS 279.835 to 279.855 and ORS chapters 279A and 279B do not apply to contracts entered into under this subsection. [Amended by 1975 c.478 §11; 1981 c.897 §49; 1989 c.333 §9; 1991 c.534 §4; 1993 c.45 §264; 1995 c.343 §7; 2003 c.540 §2; 2003 c.794 §257a; 2012 c.104 §29]

 

      345.113 Negotiability of contract for student loan. (1) In any contract for the provision of instruction or training or other services by a career school on credit entered into between a career school and a student, or between a lending institution which regularly loans money to students of a particular career school and a prospective student of that career school, such contract, note or any instrument or evidence of indebtedness of the student shall have printed on the face thereof the words “Student Loan.” Such contract, note, instrument or evidence of indebtedness with the words “Student Loan” printed thereon shall not be a negotiable instrument within the meaning of ORS chapter 73. However, this section shall have no force or effect on the negotiability of any contract, promissory note, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness owned or guaranteed or insured by any state or federal governmental agency even though the contract, note, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness contains the wording required by this subsection.

      (2) Notwithstanding the absence of such notice on a contract, note, instrument or evidence of indebtedness arising out of a contract for the provision of training or instruction or other services by a career school, an assignee of the rights of the career school or lending institution as described in subsection (1) of this section is subject to all claims and defenses of the student against the career school or lending institution arising out of the contract for provision of professional instruction or training or other services. Any agreement to the contrary shall be of no force or effect in limiting the rights of a student under this section. The assignee’s liability under this section shall not exceed the amount owing to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against the assignee. The restrictions imposed by this subsection shall not apply with respect to any promissory note, contract, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness owned or guaranteed or insured by any state or federal governmental agency even though said note, contract, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain the words required by subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) An assignee of a student loan who in good faith enforces a security interest in property held by the student shall not be liable to such student for punitive damages in an action for wrongful repossession. The fact that a career school misrepresented the nature of the training or instruction or other services shall not, of itself, make an assignee’s repossession wrongful. [1975 c.478 §28; 1995 c.343 §8]

 

      345.115 Refund schedule; limit on advance deposit; default; rules. (1) The enrollment agreement entered into between a person and a career school for the purpose of obtaining instruction or training shall contain a schedule for the refund of tuition, deposits and fees when the person does not complete the course or program of instruction or training which was the subject of the contract. No action or suit may be brought by a career school or its assigns if the enrollment agreement does not contain this refund schedule. This provision shall not limit the career school’s right to defend any action or suit brought by any person on a contract which does not contain such a schedule.

      (2) The refund schedule required by subsection (1) of this section shall be established by the Higher Education Coordinating Commission in consultation with the advisory committee appointed under ORS 345.330. In establishing the refund schedule, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The reasonable, obligated and fixed costs of the career school, including but not limited to rent, personnel and nonreturnable supplies.

      (b) The method of instruction.

      (c) The reasonable value of services performed prior to cancellation of the course or program.

      (3) The commission may establish varying refund schedules when the difference in services performed necessitates separate schedules.

      (4) Nothing in this section is intended to prevent a career school from requiring an advance deposit of tuition on behalf of the person intending to enroll in a course or program offered by or through the career school. However, the advance deposit shall be limited to 20 percent of the total tuition and fees, excluding federal and state financial aid, unless the commission determines by rule that larger advance deposits are appropriate.

      (5) A school shall be considered in default of the enrollment agreement when a course or program is discontinued or canceled or the school closes prior to completion of contracted services. When a school is in default, student tuition may be refunded on a pro rata basis if the commission determines that the school has made provision for students enrolled at the time of default to complete a comparable program at another institution at no additional tuition cost to the student beyond the original contract with the defaulting school. If the school does not make such provision, a total refund of all tuition and fees shall be made to the students. [1965 c.409 §2; 1967 c.67 §16; 1975 c.478 §12; 1989 c.333 §10; 1993 c.742 §78; 1995 c.343 §9; 2012 c.104 §30]

 

      345.117 Information required on enrollment agreement. Any enrollment agreement used within this state as a contract for instruction between a career school and a student shall have printed or stamped upon it: “Any inquiry a student may have regarding this contract may be made in writing to the school (name and address), or to the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (current address).” [1975 c.478 §22; 1989 c.333 §11; 1995 c.343 §10; 2012 c.104 §31]

 

      345.120 Investigations; notice for corrective action, suspension or revocation. (1) On the written complaint of any person, the Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall, and on the commission’s own motion may, investigate the actions of any career school or agent, or any person who assumes to act in either capacity within this state.

      (9) Neither the career school nor its agents engage in advertising, sales, collection, credit or other practices of any type which are unlawful under ORS 646.608;

      (10) The directors, administrators, supervisors and instructors of the school are of good reputation and character, except that a school shall not be issued a notice for corrective action or a license shall not be denied, suspended or revoked because a faculty member has been convicted of a crime except as authorized under ORS 670.280;

      (11) Any student housing owned, maintained or approved by the career school is appropriate, safe and adequate;

      (12) The school has a written placement assistance plan; and

      (13) A license application from a new school or an application for approval of a new program from an existing school shall include labor market information that identifies the need for the new school or program.
