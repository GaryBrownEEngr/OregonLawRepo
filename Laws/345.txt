      (2) Notwithstanding the absence of such notice on a contract, note, instrument or evidence of indebtedness arising out of a contract for the provision of training or instruction or other services by a career school, an assignee of the rights of the career school or lending institution as described in subsection (1) of this section is subject to all claims and defenses of the student against the career school or lending institution arising out of the contract for provision of professional instruction or training or other services. Any agreement to the contrary shall be of no force or effect in limiting the rights of a student under this section. The assignee’s liability under this section shall not exceed the amount owing to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against the assignee. The restrictions imposed by this subsection shall not apply with respect to any promissory note, contract, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness owned or guaranteed or insured by any state or federal governmental agency even though said note, contract, instrument or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain the words required by subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) An assignee of a student loan who in good faith enforces a security interest in property held by the student shall not be liable to such student for punitive damages in an action for wrongful repossession. The fact that a career school misrepresented the nature of the training or instruction or other services shall not, of itself, make an assignee’s repossession wrongful. [1975 c.478 §28; 1995 c.343 §8]

 

      345.115 Refund schedule; limit on advance deposit; default; rules. (1) The enrollment agreement entered into between a person and a career school for the purpose of obtaining instruction or training shall contain a schedule for the refund of tuition, deposits and fees when the person does not complete the course or program of instruction or training which was the subject of the contract. No action or suit may be brought by a career school or its assigns if the enrollment agreement does not contain this refund schedule. This provision shall not limit the career school’s right to defend any action or suit brought by any person on a contract which does not contain such a schedule.

      (2) The refund schedule required by subsection (1) of this section shall be established by the Higher Education Coordinating Commission in consultation with the advisory committee appointed under ORS 345.330. In establishing the refund schedule, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The reasonable, obligated and fixed costs of the career school, including but not limited to rent, personnel and nonreturnable supplies.

      (b) The method of instruction.

      (c) The reasonable value of services performed prior to cancellation of the course or program.

      (3) The commission may establish varying refund schedules when the difference in services performed necessitates separate schedules.

      (4) Nothing in this section is intended to prevent a career school from requiring an advance deposit of tuition on behalf of the person intending to enroll in a course or program offered by or through the career school. However, the advance deposit shall be limited to 20 percent of the total tuition and fees, excluding federal and state financial aid, unless the commission determines by rule that larger advance deposits are appropriate.

      (5) A school shall be considered in default of the enrollment agreement when a course or program is discontinued or canceled or the school closes prior to completion of contracted services. When a school is in default, student tuition may be refunded on a pro rata basis if the commission determines that the school has made provision for students enrolled at the time of default to complete a comparable program at another institution at no additional tuition cost to the student beyond the original contract with the defaulting school. If the school does not make such provision, a total refund of all tuition and fees shall be made to the students. [1965 c.409 §2; 1967 c.67 §16; 1975 c.478 §12; 1989 c.333 §10; 1993 c.742 §78; 1995 c.343 §9; 2012 c.104 §30]

 

      345.117 Information required on enrollment agreement. Any enrollment agreement used within this state as a contract for instruction between a career school and a student shall have printed or stamped upon it: “Any inquiry a student may have regarding this contract may be made in writing to the school (name and address), or to the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (current address).” [1975 c.478 §22; 1989 c.333 §11; 1995 c.343 §10; 2012 c.104 §31]

 

      345.120 Investigations; probation; notice for corrective action or revocation of licenses. (1) On the written complaint of any person, the Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall, and on the commission’s own motion may, investigate the actions of any career school or agent, or any person who assumes to act in either capacity within this state.

      (2) After receiving a written complaint or deciding to proceed to an investigation on its own motion under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall notify the career school that is the subject of the investigation. When conducting an investigation under this section, the commission shall engage with both the career school under investigation and with any affected students.

      (3) As a result of the investigation, and in addition to any penalty that may be imposed under ORS 345.992, the commission may issue a notice for corrective action or, subject to the procedures set forth in subsection (4) of this section, may suspend or revoke any license issued under ORS 345.010 to 345.450 when the licensee has:

      (a) Obtained a license by misrepresentation.

      (b) Violated ORS 345.010 to 345.450 or any applicable rule.

      (c) Ceased to engage in the business authorized by the license.

      (d) Willfully used or employed any method, act or practice declared unlawful by ORS 646.608.

      (4)(a) When notice of suspension or revocation is issued, the licensee shall be notified and, upon request, shall be granted a contested case hearing under ORS 183.310 (2).

      (b) If a licensee requests a contested case hearing under this subsection, the suspension or revocation may take effect only after a hearing officer determines that there is proper cause.

      (5) A licensee that is issued a notice for corrective action must be formally notified by the commission that it has deficiencies that must be corrected within a time specified in the notice.

      (6) A licensee whose license is suspended is prohibited from advertising, recruiting or enrolling students but may remain in operation to complete training of students enrolled on the effective date of the suspension.

      (7) A licensee whose license has been revoked is not authorized to continue in operation on and after the effective date of the revocation. [Amended by 1965 c.409 §3; 1975 c.478 §13; 1989 c.333 §12; 1993 c.45 §265; 1995 c.343 §11; 2012 c.104 §32; 2017 c.422 §1]

STANDARDS

 

      345.320 Legislative findings and purpose. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that career schools are capable of increasing the educational opportunities available in this state or to residents of this state and of making a contribution to the social and economic progress of the people of this state. Career schools offer different approaches to education than do public schools and are often able to provide professional, technical and placement assistance not otherwise available.

      (2) It is the purpose of ORS 345.010 to 345.450 to provide for the protection, education and welfare of the citizens of this state, its career schools and its students, by establishing minimum standards concerning quality of education, ethical and business practices, health and safety and fiscal responsibility, and protecting against substandard, transient, unethical, deceptive or fraudulent practices.

      (11) Any student housing owned, maintained or approved by the career school is appropriate, safe and adequate;

      (12) The school has a written placement assistance plan; and

      (13) A license application from a new school or an application for approval of a new program from an existing school shall include labor market information that identifies the need for the new school or program.
