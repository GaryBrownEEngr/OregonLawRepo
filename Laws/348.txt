GENERALLY

 

      348.005 Policy on student financial aid. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The State of Oregon can achieve its full economic and social potential only if all Oregonians have the opportunity to contribute to the full extent of their capabilities and only when financial barriers to their educational goals are removed;

      (b) All Oregonians who meet the appropriate admissions requirements should be able to attend any community college, public university listed in ORS 352.002 or independent not-for-profit institution of post-secondary education regardless of individual economic or social circumstances;

      (c) The interests of this state are best served when public subsidies supporting college students are distributed fairly, equitably and consciously to ensure maximum access and choice for all Oregonians at the least cost to the taxpayers;

      (d) Need-based student financial aid is an effective, efficient and essential means of assisting Oregonians who are unable to afford the full cost of higher education;

      (e) Student financial aid allows Oregonians with limited resources to select academic programs based on their interests, aptitudes and career goals;

      (f) Student financial aid encourages and permits capable and promising Oregonians to persist in their education and training within this state; and

      (g) By assisting Oregonians in this manner, student financial aid contributes to the quality of life of each Oregonian and to the social, cultural and economic well-being of all Oregonians.

      (2) It is the intention of the Legislative Assembly to establish financial assistance programs to enable qualified Oregonians who need student aid to obtain post-secondary education in Oregon’s community colleges, public universities or independent not-for-profit institutions of post-secondary education. [1993 c.239 §1; 2005 c.22 §242; 2011 c.637 §134]

 

      348.007 Financial aid eligibility for students with modified or extended diplomas. A student who receives a modified diploma or extended diploma under ORS 329.451 may not be denied eligibility for financial aid to obtain post-secondary education in a public university listed in ORS 352.002, community college or independent not-for-profit institution of higher education that operates in this state for the sole reason that the student did not receive a high school diploma. [2013 c.725 §2]

 

      Note: 348.007 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 348 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (5) “Third party financial firm” means a company, business or other organization that contracts with a public or private post-secondary institution of education to provide disbursement and management services of financial aid funds, or management of financial accounts, to students enrolled in the public or private post-secondary institution of education.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any written obligation made by any minor in consideration of an educational loan received by the minor from any person shall be as valid and binding as if the minor had, at the time of making and executing the obligation, attained the age of majority, but only if prior to the making of the educational loan an educational institution has certified in writing to the person making the educational loan that the minor is enrolled, or has been accepted for enrollment, in the educational institution.

      (3) Any obligation mentioned in subsection (2) of this section may be enforced in any action or proceeding against such person in the name of the person and shall be valid, insofar as the issue of age is concerned, without the consent thereto of the parent or guardian of such person.

      348.183 Legislative intent. The Legislative Assembly recognizes:

      (1) That an investment in educational opportunities for all Oregonians is an investment in a strong and stable economy and greater personal opportunities;

      (2) That the single largest barrier to attending an institution of higher education is lack of finances;

      (3) That keeping higher education affordable requires a shared effort and partnership by students, family, the federal government, state government and private philanthropy;

      (4) The broad and diverse range of quality post-secondary educational services provided by Oregon’s institutions of higher education, including Oregon’s community colleges, public universities and independent not-for-profit institutions of higher education;

      (5) The positive effects on Oregon’s citizens, families and economy of encouraging talented and hardworking students to stay in Oregon to pursue a post-secondary education; and

      (6) That, in order to maintain affordable tuition at Oregon’s public universities and community colleges, the Legislative Assembly, through the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, should review tuition affordability on the basis of standards, including the Higher Education Price Index, median family income, enrollment growth and state appropriations made to public universities and community colleges in this state. This review by the Legislative Assembly on tuition and fee increases should occur biennially. [1999 c.1070 §2; 2007 c.802 §2; 2007 c.858 §38; 2011 c.637 §142]

      348.205 Oregon Opportunity Grant program; rules. (1) The Oregon Opportunity Grant program is established within the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.

      (2) Under the program, the cost of education of a qualified student shall be shared by the student, the family of the student, the federal government and the state.

      (3) The Director of the Office of Student Access and Completion shall determine the cost of education of a qualified student based on the type of eligible post-secondary institution the student is attending. The cost of education equals:

      (a) For a student attending a community college, the average cost of education of attending a community college in this state;

      (b) For a student attending a public university listed in ORS 352.002, the average cost of education of attending a public university;

      (c) For a student attending a two-year Oregon-based, generally accredited, not-for-profit institution of higher education, the average cost of education of attending a community college in this state; and

      (d) For a student attending the Oregon Health and Science University or a four-year Oregon-based, generally accredited, not-for-profit institution of higher education, the average cost of education of attending a public university listed in ORS 352.002.

      (4)(a) The director shall determine the amount of the student share. The student share shall be based on:

      (A) The type of eligible post-secondary institution the student is attending;

      (B) The number of hours of work that the director determines may be reasonably expected from the student; and

      (C) The amount of loans that the director determines would constitute a manageable debt burden for the student.

      (b) The student shall determine how to cover the student share through income from work, loans, savings and scholarships.

      (c) The student share for a student who attends a community college may not exceed the amount that the director determines a student may earn based on the number of hours of work reasonably expected from the student under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (d) The student share for a student who attends an eligible post-secondary institution that is not a community college may not exceed the sum of the amount that the director determines a student may receive as loans plus the amount a student may earn based on the number of hours of work reasonably expected from the student under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (5) The director shall determine the amount of the family share. The family share shall be based on the resources of the family.

      (6) The director shall determine the amount of the federal share based on how much the student or the student’s family is expected to receive from the federal government.

      (7)(a) The director shall determine the amount of the state share. The state share shall be equal to the cost of education reduced by the student share, family share and amount received by the student from the federal government.

      (b) The director shall establish a minimum amount that a student may receive as a state share. If the director determines that the amount of the state share of a student is below the minimum amount, the student may not receive the state share.

COORDINATION OF STATE AGENCIES

 

      348.900 Needs assessment for health care occupations; evaluation of health care education programs. (1) The Employment Department, in consultation with health care industry employers, shall perform a statewide and regional needs assessment for health care occupations to identify emerging occupations and occupations for which there is high demand or a shortage of workers. The assessment shall be performed as necessary on a periodic basis, as determined by the department, in consultation with industry employers. To perform the needs assessment, the department may consider any reliable data sources available to the department.

      (2) Based on the needs assessment, the Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall inform the community colleges, public universities listed in ORS 352.002, Oregon Health and Science University and health care industry employers of the identified statewide needs and invite the development of health care education programs that are responsive to those needs.

      (3) When approving health care education programs, the commission, the governing board of a public university listed in ORS 352.002 and the Oregon Health and Science University Board of Directors shall use the statewide needs assessment to evaluate whether a program fulfills statewide needs. If the commission or the board determines there is a statewide need, the commission or the board shall facilitate the:

      (a) Coordination of new health care education programs and existing health care education programs that are similar to the new health care education programs to address the statewide need; and

      (b) Alignment of health care education programs relating to statewide access, student transferability between programs, course articulation and common student learning outcomes for health care education programs.

      (4) In the development and approval of health care education programs, community colleges, public universities, Oregon Health and Science University, the commission, the governing board of a public university listed in ORS 352.002 and the Oregon Health and Science University Board of Directors shall consider issues related to statewide access, student transferability between programs, course articulation and common student learning outcomes for health care education programs. The community colleges, public universities, Oregon Health and Science University and commission shall continue to provide and improve upon an effective articulation and transfer framework for students in Oregon’s post-secondary sectors.

      348.910 Applied baccalaureate degrees. (1) As used in this section, “applied baccalaureate degree” means a bachelor’s degree designed to incorporate applied associate courses and degrees with additional coursework emphasizing higher-order thinking skills and advanced technical knowledge and skills.

      (2) The Higher Education Coordinating Commission shall develop a plan for offering applied baccalaureate degree programs at community colleges and public universities listed in ORS 352.002. The commission shall consider the following types of programs for the purpose of offering some of these types and the possibility of combinations of these types:

      (a) A career ladder program that requires a substantial number of upper level courses in the same technical area of study as the student’s applied associate degree;

      (b) An inverse program that reverses the traditional curriculum sequence by adding general education courses in the student’s third and fourth years to the associate degree courses taken in the student’s first and second years;

      (c) A management ladder program that combines associate degree requirements with applied management skills coursework; and

      (d) A work experience program that combines general education and technical coursework with direct, supervised work experience in a relevant field.

      (3) The plan must include the following elements:

      (a) The method by which the applied baccalaureate degree programs will be created, including any necessary accreditation by the relevant accrediting agency;

      (b) The criteria for approving the degree and course options offered by public universities listed in ORS 352.002 and community colleges;

      (c) The articulation agreements between community colleges and public universities listed in ORS 352.002 necessary to ensure that the applied baccalaureate degree programs are as widely available as possible;

      (d) The resources required to implement the applied baccalaureate degree program;

      (e) The timeline necessary to implement the applied baccalaureate degree program; and

      (f) A recommendation as to whether community colleges should be allowed to offer applied baccalaureate degrees. [2009 c.779 §1; 2011 c.9 §36; 2011 c.637 §§207,207a]
