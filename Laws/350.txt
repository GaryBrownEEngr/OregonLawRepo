POLICY ON HIGHER EDUCATION

 

      350.001 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) For its survival and political well-being, Oregon needs wise and effective leadership and an informed citizenry.

      (2) For its survival and economic well-being, Oregon needs able and imaginative men and women for the direction and operation of all its institutions, for the production of goods and services and for the management of its fiscal affairs. Oregon also needs alert and informed consumers.

      (3) For its cultural advancement, Oregon needs creative talent as well as appreciative and discriminating readers, viewers and listeners. Oregon also needs people who understand the diverse patterns of behavior, communication and belief that make up the common cultures of the various communities in which we all must function.

      (4) For its survival, Oregon needs citizens who understand the interdependence of human beings and our shared dependence on the resources provided by our natural environment.

      (5) Oregon needs people who, in the roles of parents and teachers and in other capacities, are able to transmit the state’s and the nation’s ideals and heritage to future generations.

      (6) For their personal well-being, individual Oregonians need to cultivate an advanced literacy essential to leading productive and rewarding lives. This includes the capacity to think logically and critically; to internalize and exemplify humane values; to write, speak and figure clearly and accurately; to understand, in some depth, a variety of psychological, historical, cultural, aesthetic and scientific concepts and theories; and to master a range of occupational, professional, avocational, social and personal skills. [Formerly 351.001]

 

      350.005 Additional findings. In addition to making the findings under ORS 350.001, the Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Oregonians need access to educational opportunities beyond high school and throughout life.

      (2) To meet the societal and individual needs described under ORS 350.001, Oregonians have created and should sustain diverse institutions of higher education, both independent and state-assisted.

      (3) These institutions have developed the intellectual capacity of Oregonians and have prepared thousands of them for productive and fulfilling careers.

      (4) These institutions should provide educational access to all segments of Oregon’s diverse population.

      (5) These institutions provide research that generates knowledge value essential for Oregon’s economic growth.

      (6) These institutions engage the professional expertise of their faculties to solve social problems.

      (7) These institutions provide important cultural activities and services that add to Oregon’s quality of life. [Formerly 351.003]

 

      350.009 Fundamental goals of public higher education. The Legislative Assembly finds that public higher education is necessary to accomplish the findings in ORS 350.001 and recognizes the following as fundamental goals of public higher education in this state:

      (1) Creating an educated citizenry to support responsible roles in a democratic society and provide a globally competitive workforce to drive this state’s economy, while ensuring access for all qualified Oregonians to a high-quality post-secondary education;

      (2) Ensuring a high-quality learning environment that allows students to succeed;

      (3) Creating original knowledge and advancing innovation; and

      (4) Contributing positively to the economic, civic and cultural life of communities in all regions of Oregon. [Formerly 351.006]

 

      350.014 Mission of education beyond high school. (1) The Legislative Assembly declares that the mission of all education beyond high school in Oregon includes ensuring that by 2025, when adult Oregonians complete their education:

      (a) At least 40 percent have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher;

      (b) At least 40 percent have earned an associate’s degree or a post-secondary credential as their highest level of educational attainment; and

      (c) The remaining 20 percent or less have earned a high school diploma, an extended or modified high school diploma or the equivalent of a high school diploma as their highest level of educational attainment.

      (2) The earning of a post-secondary credential described in subsection (1)(b) of this section may be satisfied by adult Oregonians who have completed apprenticeship programs registered with the State Apprenticeship and Training Council. [Formerly 351.009; 2017 c.264 §1]

 

      350.018 Educational attainment goals for adult Oregonians not currently enrolled in academic programs; rules. (1) The Higher Education Coordinating Commission, in coordination with the State Workforce and Talent Development Board, shall establish by rule educational attainment goals for adult Oregonians who are not currently enrolled in a kindergarten through grade 12 school, an institution of higher education or another post-secondary training program.

      (2) The educational attainment goals established under this section shall:

      (a) Be associated with current and projected job opportunities for adult Oregonians; and

      (b) Be designed to promote labor market success. [2017 c.264 §2]

POLICY ON INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION

 

      350.600 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The current and future need for higher education services in Oregon is too great and too diverse to be met by government-sponsored institutions alone.

      (2) From the early 1840s the citizens of Oregon, through private initiative, have created and sustained a variety of independent not-for-profit institutions of higher education, irrevocably organized as public benefit corporations in service to the people of Oregon. For the purposes of ORS 350.600 to 350.620, “independent institutions” or “independent higher education” refers to such institutions.

      (3) These independent institutions:

      (a) Conduct teaching, research and public service of high quality, contributing substantially to the preparation of a professional workforce, to the intellectual and cultural quality of life in Oregon and to the individual character of social responsibility so highly prized in this state and nation;

      (b) Provide a major share of all post-secondary education in Oregon, at the lowest cost to the taxpayer;

      (c) Add meaningful and valued diversity to the array of post-secondary educational opportunities available to Oregonians;

      (d) Are accessible to qualified students of all ethnic backgrounds and from all socioeconomic levels;

      (e) Annually attract thousands of talented people to Oregon from other regions of the country and the world;

      (f) Provide unique local opportunities in higher education that many Oregonians would otherwise leave the state to find;

      (g) Attract and sustain voluntary donations of private time, treasure and talent from thousands of citizens in public service toward fulfilling the educational needs of the larger community; and

      (h) Constitute a sizable economic enterprise.

      (4) The educational capital and services of these independent institutions are essential to meeting the current and future higher educational needs of Oregon’s citizens. [Formerly 352.665]

 

      350.605 Public purpose to encourage and increase opportunities in independent higher education. Based on the legislative findings described in ORS 350.600, the Legislative Assembly declares that it is an important public interest to encourage and increase opportunities in independent higher education for the people of Oregon. [Formerly 352.667]

 

      350.610 Policies and practices of state agencies and Higher Education Coordinating Commission. The Legislative Assembly declares that all state agencies and the Higher Education Coordinating Commission should pursue policies and engage in practices that enhance the vitality of independent higher education in Oregon and should cooperate with the state’s independent institutions. [Formerly 352.669]

 

      350.615 State financial aid for students. The Legislative Assembly declares that it is an important public interest, and an appropriate objective of the state, that Oregonians who need financial assistance to attend an independent institution in Oregon should have access to state financial aid. [Formerly 352.672]

 

      350.620 State policies to enhance and encourage independent higher education. The Legislative Assembly declares its ongoing interest in state policies that:

      (1) Enhance the ability of independent institutions to sustain and expand their services in Oregon;

      (2) Complement, assist and strengthen existing or planned programs and activities of independent institutions in Oregon while maintaining high academic and administrative standards;

      (3) Encourage broad public participation in independent higher education;

      (4) Promote coordination among independent and community colleges and state universities;

      (5) Stimulate and encourage private initiative and financial support in connection with the programs and activities of independent higher education;

      (6) Encourage recognition of the contributions made by independent higher education to the well-being of the state and to the development of the individual; and

      (7) Develop, maintain and provide the public with sufficient information concerning independent educational opportunities within the state. [Formerly 352.675]

 

AID TO INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS

 

      350.630 Legislative findings. It is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding that:

      (1) Independent institutions of higher education in the state educate a substantial share of all post-secondary students in Oregon and such nonpublic institutions make an important contribution to post-secondary education in Oregon.

      (2) The state’s duty to support the achieving of public welfare purposes in education may be, in part, fulfilled by the state’s support of those nonsectarian educational objectives achieved through nonpublic post-secondary institutions.

      (3) Many of Oregon’s private and independent institutions of higher learning face serious financial difficulties and, should any of these institutions be forced to close, many of their students would seek admission in public institutions creating an added financial burden to the state and an impairment of post-secondary education in Oregon. Such hazards may be substantially reduced and all education in the state improved through the purchase of nonsectarian educational services from Oregon’s private and independent institutions. [Formerly 352.710]

 

      350.635 Definitions for ORS 350.630 to 350.655. As used in ORS 350.630 to 350.655, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (2) “Nonsectarian educational services” means the provision of instruction in secular subjects.

      (3) “Secular subjects” means any course that is presented in the curriculum of a private and independent institution of higher education that is not hobby or recreational in nature or that does not advocate the religious teachings or the morals or forms of worship of any sect. [Formerly 352.720]

 

      350.640 Contracts with independent institutions for nonsectarian and nonreligious educational services. (1) The Higher Education Coordinating Commission may enter into contracts with private and independent institutions of higher education for the performance of nonsectarian educational services to assist the state in providing educational opportunities for Oregon students.

      (2) The commission may accept grants, gifts, bequests, and devises of real and personal property to carry out the purposes of ORS 350.630 to 350.655.

      (3) No funds disbursed pursuant to ORS 350.630 to 350.655 shall be used by any recipient for any religious purpose. [Formerly 352.730]

 

      350.645 Computation of payments under contracts. Payments to private and independent institutions of higher education under contracts entered into under ORS 350.640 shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Student Access and Completion on a uniform rate for every 45 quarter hours, or equivalent, of approved and registered course work in nonsectarian subjects completed by undergraduate students enrolled in the institutions who are residents of Oregon, and shall not exceed the actual cost to the institution of providing such educational services. This uniform rate shall apply to the estimated 45-hour units for each institution upon which the legislative appropriation is based for that year, or the actual 45-hour units for each institution, whichever is the lesser. Any remaining funds shall be distributed among those institutions whose actual 45-hour units exceed the estimate. The distribution to each institution shall be according to the uniform rate established for the 45-hour units or an amount equal to the ratio that the excess units bear to 45. However, if insufficient funds are available for such a distribution, then the distribution shall be according to the ratio that the total number of 45-hour units in excess of the estimate bears to the total amount of funds remaining undistributed, multiplied by the number of excess 45-hour units, if any, at each institution. [Formerly 352.740; 2017 c.66 §59]

 

      350.650 Rules. In accordance with any applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, the Higher Education Coordinating Commission may make such reasonable rules and regulations as are necessary or proper to carry out ORS 350.630 to 350.655. [Formerly 352.750]

 

      350.655 Severability. If a part of ORS 350.630 to 350.655 is invalid, all valid parts that are severable from the invalid part remain in effect. If a part of ORS 350.630 to 350.655 is invalid in one or more of its applications, the part remains in effect in all valid applications that are severable from the invalid applications.

______________________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE I

      Whereas the future of this nation and of the western states is dependent upon the quality of the education of its youth; and

      Whereas many of the western states individually do not have sufficient numbers of potential students to warrant the establishment and maintenance within their borders of adequate facilities in all of the essential fields of technical, professional and graduate training, nor do all of the states have the financial ability to furnish within their borders institutions capable of providing acceptable standards of training in all of the fields mentioned above; and

      Whereas it is believed that the western states, or groups of such states within the region, cooperatively can provide acceptable and efficient educational facilities to meet the needs of the region and of the students thereof:

      Now, therefore, the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming and the territories of Alaska and Hawaii do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

      The terms of each commissioner shall be four years; provided, however, that the first three commissioners shall be appointed as follows: One for two years, one for three years, and one for four years. Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor shall be appointed and qualified. If any office becomes vacant for any reason, the Governor shall appoint a commissioner to fill the office for the remainder of the unexpired term.

The chairman may call upon such additional meetings and upon the request of a majority of the commissioners of three or more compacting states or territories shall call additional meetings.

      The commission shall submit a budget to the Governor of each compacting state and territory at such time and for such period as may be required.

      The commission shall, after negotiations with interested institutions, determine the cost of providing the facilities for graduate and professional education for use in its contractual agreements throughout the region.

      On or before the fifteenth day of January of each year the commission shall submit to the governors and legislatures of the compacting states and territories a report of its activities for the preceding calendar year.

      The commission shall keep accurate books of account, showing in full its receipts and disbursements, and said books of account shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by the Governor of any compacting state or territory or his designated representative. The commission shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedure of any of the compacting states or territories. The commission shall provide for an independent annual audit.

The commission shall first endeavor to provide adequate services and facilities in the fields of dentistry, medicine, public health and veterinary medicine, and may undertake similar activities in other professional and graduate fields.

      For this purpose the commission may enter into contractual agreements:

      (a) With the governing authority of any educational institution in the region, or with any compacting state or territory, to provide such graduate or professional educational services upon terms and conditions to be agreed upon between contracting parties, and

      (b) With the governing authority of any educational institution in the region or with any compacting state or territory to assist in the placement of graduate or professional students in educational institutions in the region providing the desired services and facilities, upon such terms and conditions as the commission may prescribe.

In conducting such studies, the commission may confer with any national or regional planning body which may be established. The commission shall draft and recommend to the Governors of the various compacting states and territories uniform legislation dealing with problems of higher education in the region.

      For the purposes of this compact the word “region” shall be construed to mean the geographical limits of the several compacting states and territories.

      This compact may be terminated at any time by consent of a majority of the compacting states or territories. Consent shall be manifested by passage and signature in the usual manner of legislation expressing such consent by the legislature and Governor of such terminating state. Any state or territory may at any time withdraw from this compact by means of appropriate legislation to that end. Such withdrawal shall not become effective until two years after written notice thereof by the Governor of the withdrawing state or territory, accompanied by a certified copy of the requisite legislative action, is received by the commission. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state or territory from its obligations hereunder accruing prior to the effective date of withdrawal. The withdrawing state or territory may rescind its action of withdrawal at any time within the two-year period. Thereafter, the withdrawing state or territory may be reinstated by application to and the approval by a majority vote of the commission.

      Unless such default shall be remedied within a period of two years following the effective date of such default, this compact may be terminated with respect to such defaulting state or territory by affirmative vote of three-fourths of the other member states or territories.

      Any such defaulting state may be reinstated by: (a) performing all acts and obligations upon which it has heretofore defaulted, and (b) application to and the approval by a majority vote of the commission.
