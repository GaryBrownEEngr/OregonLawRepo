PUBLIC UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE

 

(Generally)

 

      352.025 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that the State of Oregon will benefit from having public universities with governing boards that:

      (a) Provide transparency, public accountability and support for the university.

      (b) Are close to and closely focused on the individual university.

      (c) Lead to greater access and affordability for Oregon residents and do not disadvantage Oregon students relative to out-of-state students.

      (d) Act in the best interests of both the university and the State of Oregon as a whole.

      (e) Promote the academic success of students in support of the mission of all education beyond high school as described in ORS 350.014.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly also finds that:

      (a) Even with universities with governing boards, there are economy-of-scale benefits to having a coordinated university system.

      (b) Even with universities with governing boards, shared services may continue to be shared among universities.

      (c) Legal title to all real property, whether acquired before or after the creation of a governing board, through state funding, revenue bonds or philanthropy, shall be taken and held in the name of the State of Oregon, acting by and through the governing board.

      (d) The Legislative Assembly has a responsibility to monitor the success of governing boards at fulfilling their missions, their compacts and the principles stated in this section. [2013 c.768 §1; 2017 c.440 §7]

 

      352.027 Legislative intent.

      352.372 Findings and policy for ORS 352.365 to 352.379. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that basic research is fundamental to the continuation and expansion of applied research and is thus a necessary ingredient in economic growth. The Legislative Assembly further finds that basic research is itself an important activity which should be promoted.

      (2) It is the policy of this state that basic research is an appropriate and necessary activity of our public universities. Further, the State of Oregon has an obligation with other states and the federal government to encourage and finance basic research if the state and nation are to be active participants in a future which will require ever increasing levels of knowledge and understanding.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly acknowledges that a characteristic of basic research is that no defined result can be guaranteed and asserts that only through scholarly investigation can knowledge be advanced to be later developed and applied.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly believes that moneys for basic research should be regularly appropriated and that such moneys should be used for support of qualified investigators and funding of research projects. [Formerly 351.870]

The leases may grant the trustee or lender the right to evict the university and exclude the university from possession of the real property for the term of the lease if the university fails to pay when due the amounts scheduled to be paid under the operative documents or otherwise defaults under the operative documents. Upon default, the trustee or lender may sublease the real property to third parties and apply any rents to payments scheduled to be made under the operative documents.

      (b) May not mortgage, pledge or grant a security interest in, or otherwise encumber, real or personal property that has been pledged or leased to provide security for, or acquired, constructed, improved with, or otherwise directly benefited by, the proceeds of outstanding state bonds, except as provided in ORS 352.113 (4).

To prepare the schedule, the State Treasurer may request and rely upon information produced by one or more universities with a governing board or a shared services enterprise of the universities that provides services related to debt management. The schedule must include amounts sufficient to pay principal, interest and premium, if any, on the state bonds, and to pay administrative and other costs of the State of Oregon that are related to the state bonds or other obligations. If the State Treasurer issues state bonds for the benefit of a public university on or after August 14, 2013, that are intended to be repaid in whole or in part by university revenues or other moneys under the control of the university, the schedule shall be amended to include such state bonds and the amounts to be paid by the university. In the absence of manifest error, the schedule provided by the State Treasurer to a public university is binding on the university. The public university shall pay the amounts specified in the schedule provided by the State Treasurer on or before the dates specified in the schedule from the legally available revenue of the university and on a pari passu basis with the payment of any revenue bonds of the university issued pursuant to ORS 352.408.

      (4) At the request of the State Treasurer, a public university listed in ORS 352.002 shall provide the State Treasurer with periodic cash flow projections and other information that allow the State Treasurer to review and approve the sufficiency of the university’s cash flow to pay amounts specified in the schedule described in subsection (3) of this section and to pay amounts owed under loans from state agencies that were funded with the proceeds of state bonds.

      (5) Moneys deposited with the State Treasurer or the Oregon Department of Administrative Services in a debt service reserve account or otherwise for the portion of the debt service associated with obligations entered into before August 14, 2013, for the benefit of a public university listed in ORS 352.002 must remain with the State Treasurer or the Oregon Department of Administrative Services until the obligations have been retired or defeased. Earnings on moneys described in this subsection must be credited to the account or fund in which the moneys are held.

      (6) The principal, interest, premium, if any, and any issuance costs of state bonds issued before, on or after August 14, 2013, for the benefit of a public university listed in ORS 352.002, and any related credit enhancement device or interest rate exchange agreement, shall be paid from the sources identified in the laws and operative documents authorizing the state bonds. The public university for which the state bonds were issued shall pay any other expenses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, legal expenses arising from an inquiry, audit or other action by a federal or state regulatory body, unless the expense or liability results solely from the negligence or willful misconduct of a state agency.

      (7) Pursuant to ORS chapter 180, on behalf of the State Treasurer or any other state agency, the Attorney General shall appear, commence, prosecute or defend any action, suit, matter, cause or proceeding arising from any state bond issued for the benefit of a public university listed in ORS 352.002 and any related credit enhancement device or interest rate exchange agreement. As soon as practicable after a governing board is established by a public university pursuant to ORS 352.054, the university and the State Treasurer shall enter into an agreement that addresses reimbursement of reasonable costs and expenses associated with the legal representation of the State Treasurer in connection with state bonds issued for the benefit of the public university before, on or after August 14, 2013, and any other topic necessary for the Department of Justice to provide legal representation to the State Treasurer in connection with state bonds issued for the benefit of the public university and to provide representation related to funds and accounts or services provided under ORS 352.135.

(Funds and Accounts)

 

      352.442 Federal aid; donations; acceptance and use. A public university listed in ORS 352.002 may, in its discretion, accept financial assistance and grants, either in the form of money or labor, from the United States or any of its agencies, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, regardless of any laws of this state in conflict with the regulations of the federal government with respect thereto, and may also accept from others any donation or grant of land, to be taken and held in the name of the State of Oregon, acting by and through the governing board, or gift of money or other valuable gift or thing, for any of the purposes contemplated by Article XI-F(1) and Article XI-G of the Oregon Constitution and ORS 352.157 to 352.171. Unless enjoined by the terms or conditions of any such gift or grant, the governing board may convert the same, or any of them, into money, through sale or disposal thereof. [Formerly 351.505; 2017 c.440 §31]

 

      352.450 Public University Fund. (1) The Public University Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. Any interest or other investment income derived from moneys in the Public University Fund is credited to the fund.

      (2) Except for moneys otherwise designated by statute or federal law, the governing board of any public university listed in ORS 352.002 may place any or all moneys received by it into the Public University Fund. Once deposited in the fund, the moneys of a public university shall be commingled with other moneys in the fund and are fungible, except to the extent they may be separately accounted for by the public university designated under subsection (3)(a) of this section.

      (3)(a) Public universities listed in ORS 352.002 that choose to participate in the Public University Fund shall, by agreement or other structure authorized by law, designate the participating public university responsible for the Public University Fund and identify any and all obligations necessary for a participating public university listed in ORS 352.002 to serve as the designated responsible party under this subsection.

      (b) The participating public universities shall inform the State Treasurer of the designated public university responsible for the Public University Fund. The participating public universities may change which participating public university is responsible for the Public University Fund.

      (c) The State Treasurer may conclusively rely on a written instruction from the public universities as to the designated public university responsible for the fund.

      (d) The designated public university shall inform the State Treasurer of the personnel authorized to provide instructions to the State Treasurer with respect to moneys in the fund. The State Treasurer may rely on instructions from the authorized personnel of the designated public university related to the deposit, withdrawal, investment, transfer, borrowing or lending of moneys in the fund. The State Treasurer is not responsible for or liable to the public universities for any error or omission in the instructions the State Treasurer receives from the designated public university.

      (4) All moneys in the Public University Fund are continuously appropriated to the public university responsible for the Public University Fund, to be used only in a manner consistent with the agreement or other structure authorized by law as described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) The moneys in the Public University Fund may be invested as provided in ORS 293.701 to 293.857.

      (6) Public universities that participate in the Public University Fund may, by agreement or other structure authorized by law, direct the public university designated under subsection (3)(a) of this section to establish accounts and subaccounts within the fund when the participating public universities determine that accounts or subaccounts are necessary or desirable. Except when otherwise specified by a statute establishing an account, the participating public universities or, as appropriate, the designated public university, may credit any interest or income derived from moneys in the fund to any account or subaccount within the fund.

      (7) Public universities that participate in the Public University Fund or, as appropriate, the public university designated under subsection (3)(a) of this section, shall keep a record of all moneys deposited into the fund. The record shall indicate by separate cumulative accounts and subaccounts the sources from which the moneys are derived and the individual activity or program against which each withdrawal is charged.

      (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, public universities that participate in the Public University Fund or, as appropriate, the public university designated under subsection (3)(a) of this section, may transfer or lend the moneys in the fund to other participating public universities listed in ORS 352.002. The Public University Fund may be a borrowing fund for purposes of ORS 293.205 to 293.225 and may borrow from the Oregon Short Term Fund established in ORS 293.728 or other state funds. Subject to the limitations of Article XI, section 7, of the Oregon Constitution, the Public University Fund may be a lending fund for purposes of ORS 293.205 to 293.225 and may lend moneys to other state funds. The public university designated under subsection (3)(a) of this section shall be the relevant state agency or department for whom the State Treasurer may transfer funds or with whom the State Treasurer may enter into an agreement pursuant to ORS 293.205 to 293.225.

      (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ORS 293.169, 293.171, 293.353, 293.406, 293.450, 293.455, 293.460 and 293.465 to 293.485 apply to moneys in the Public University Fund and to checks, warrants or electronic funds transfers from or to the fund. For purposes of ORS 293.169, 293.171, 293.353, 293.406, 293.450, 293.455, 293.460 and 293.465 to 293.485:

      (a) The public university designated under subsection (3)(a) of this section is the relevant state agency or department; and

      (b) The personnel of the designated public university authorized to provide instructions to the State Treasurer are the relevant state officers.

      (10)(a) The State Treasurer may establish separate or commingled funds, or establish separate or commingled accounts within funds established under this subsection. The State Treasurer may establish separate or commingled accounts within other funds in the State Treasury to receive, hold, keep, manage or invest moneys of a public university listed in ORS 352.002 pursuant to any agreements entered into by the State Treasurer and the university under ORS 352.135. The moneys in a fund or account established under this subsection may be invested as provided in ORS 293.701 to 293.857 and any interest or other investment income derived from the fund or account shall be credited to the fund or account. All moneys held in a fund or account established under this subsection are continuously appropriated to the relevant public university that has entered into an agreement with the State Treasurer under ORS 352.135 for the purpose of carrying out the powers and duties of the public university or the purposes for which the moneys were donated.
