PUBLIC UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE

 

(Generally)

 

      352.025 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that the State of Oregon will benefit from having public universities with governing boards that:

      (a) Provide transparency, public accountability and support for the university.

      (b) Are close to and closely focused on the individual university.

      (c) Lead to greater access and affordability for Oregon residents and do not disadvantage Oregon students relative to out-of-state students.

      (d) Act in the best interests of both the university and the State of Oregon as a whole.

      (e) Promote the academic success of students in support of the mission of all education beyond high school as described in ORS 350.014.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly also finds that:

      (a) Even with universities with governing boards, there are economy-of-scale benefits to having a coordinated university system.

      (b) Even with universities with governing boards, shared services may continue to be shared among universities.

      (c) Legal title to all real property, whether acquired before or after the creation of a governing board, through state funding, revenue bonds or philanthropy, shall be taken and held in the name of the State of Oregon, acting by and through the governing board.

      (d) The Legislative Assembly has a responsibility to monitor the success of governing boards at fulfilling their missions, their compacts and the principles stated in this section. [2013 c.768 §1; 2017 c.440 §7]

 

      352.027 Legislative intent.

      352.372 Findings and policy for ORS 352.365 to 352.379. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that basic research is fundamental to the continuation and expansion of applied research and is thus a necessary ingredient in economic growth. The Legislative Assembly further finds that basic research is itself an important activity which should be promoted.

      (2) It is the policy of this state that basic research is an appropriate and necessary activity of our public universities. Further, the State of Oregon has an obligation with other states and the federal government to encourage and finance basic research if the state and nation are to be active participants in a future which will require ever increasing levels of knowledge and understanding.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly acknowledges that a characteristic of basic research is that no defined result can be guaranteed and asserts that only through scholarly investigation can knowledge be advanced to be later developed and applied.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly believes that moneys for basic research should be regularly appropriated and that such moneys should be used for support of qualified investigators and funding of research projects. [Formerly 351.870]

The public university for which the state bonds were issued shall pay any other expenses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, legal expenses arising from an inquiry, audit or other action by a federal or state regulatory body, unless the expense or liability results solely from the negligence or willful misconduct of a state agency.
