Failure to disapprove an agreement submitted hereunder within 90 days of its submission shall constitute approval thereof.

      (b) In the event that a library agreement made pursuant to this compact shall deal in whole or in part with the provision of services or facilities with regard to which an officer or agency of the state government has constitutional or statutory powers of control, the agreement shall, as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the state officer or agency having such power of control and shall be approved or disapproved by the state officer or agency as to all matters within the state officer’s or agency’s jurisdiction in the same manner and subject to the same requirements governing the action of the attorneys general pursuant to paragraph (a) of this article. This requirement of submission and approval shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the requirement of submission to and approval by the attorneys general.

      357.750 Applications for grants; uses of grant moneys; rules. Units of local government and counties may apply to the State Library Board for annual establishment and development grants. The grants may be made from funds specifically appropriated for that purpose and are to be used to establish, develop or improve public library early literacy services for children from birth to six years of age and to provide the statewide summer reading program, as defined by rule of the State Library Board, for children from birth to 14 years of age. [1977 c.291 §2; 1993 c.20 §2; 2007 c.191 §1; 2012 c.37 §42a; 2015 c.328 §26]

      357.780 Grants for public library services to children; basis of distribution of funds. (1) The State Library Board shall disburse moneys under this section based on the estimated total population of children, from birth to 14 years of age, in the state. For those areas of the state not served by local public libraries, the moneys available shall be reallocated to qualifying public libraries. A public library that begins providing library service to previously unserved population shall be eligible for grants from the moneys appropriated for purposes of this section. Upon satisfactory application therefor, the State Library Board shall cause the appropriate amount to be paid to the public library.

      (2) The State Library Board shall distribute 80 percent of the funds specifically appropriated by the Legislative Assembly on a per child basis for public library services in the following manner to ensure the same population is not counted more than once:

      (a) There shall be paid to each consolidated county library that is the primary provider of public library services to all persons in a county, or to each library district that is the primary provider of public library services in a county, a per capita amount for each child residing in the county.

      (b) Where public library services are provided by a public library for which the governing authority has jurisdiction in more than one county, there shall be paid to that library a per capita amount for each child residing therein.

      (c) Where public library services are not provided as described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, but by a library of which the governing authority is the primary provider of public library services to a jurisdiction less than county wide, there shall be paid to the library a per capita amount for children residing therein. In addition, a public library having a valid contract with a unit of local government to provide library services to a population beyond its governing authority’s jurisdiction shall be paid a per capita amount for the population of children served if specified in the contract. The number of children residing within a jurisdiction that is less than a county shall be estimated using the percentage of children in the total population of the county.

      (d) Where public library services are not provided as described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection, but are provided by a county or district library that has a valid contract with one or more libraries to provide persons in their jurisdiction with library services, there shall be paid to the county or district library a per capita amount for each child residing therein, exclusive of the populations served by libraries eligible for grants under paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (3) The State Library Board shall distribute 20 percent of the funds specifically appropriated by the Legislative Assembly for public library services on an area basis.

      (4) The State Library Board may not make a grant that is less than $1,000 to a qualifying public library for public library services for children. [1979 c.835 §2; 1985 c.257 §2; 1987 c.92 §5; 1991 c.602 §2; 1993 c.20 §3; 2007 c.191 §2; 2015 c.328 §28]
