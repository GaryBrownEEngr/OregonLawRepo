HISTORIC PRESERVATION PLAN

 

      358.605 Legislative findings.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds that the preservation and rehabilitation of historic resources are of prime importance as a prime attraction for all visitors; that they help attract new industry by being an influence in business relocation decisions; and that rehabilitation projects are labor intensive, with subsequent benefits of payroll, energy savings and are important to the revitalization of deteriorating neighborhoods and downtowns.
