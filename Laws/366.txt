      366.285 Location of highways when in doubt; procedure. (1) The Department of Transportation may locate, relocate, define, establish, reestablish and confirm the extension, location and establishment of primary and secondary state highways where:

      (a) By reason of loss or destruction of field notes of the original surveys made by the county when such roads or highways were laid out and established by the county, defective or incomplete surveys or records, or destroyed monuments or marks, the exact original location and boundary cannot be found or ascertained.

      (b) For any reason the exact location and right of way lines are in doubt or are challenged.

      (2) In exercising the authority under subsection (1) of this section the procedure afforded the county with respect to public roads under ORS 368.201 to 368.221 may be followed by the department. [Amended by 1981 c.153 §61]

 

      366.290 Adding to or removing roads from state highway system; responsibility for construction and maintenance. (1) The Department of Transportation may select, locate, establish, designate, improve and maintain out of the highway fund a system of state highways, and for that purpose may, by mutual agreement with several counties, select county roads or public roads. By an appropriate order entered in its records the department may designate and adopt such roads as state highways. Thereafter the construction, improvement, maintenance and repair of such roads shall be under the jurisdiction of the department.

      (2) In the selection of highways or roads to be included in the state highway system the department shall give consideration to and shall select such county roads or public roads as will contribute to and best promote the completion of an adequate system of state highways.

      (3)(a) With the written agreement of the county in which a particular highway or part thereof is located, the department may, when in its opinion the interests of highway users will be best served, eliminate from the state highway system any road, highway, road segment or highway segment. The road, highway or segment becomes a county road or highway, and the construction, repair, maintenance or improvement, and jurisdiction over the road or highway will be exclusively under the county in which the road or highway is located.

      (b) In addition to the funds provided under ORS 366.762 to the county, the department may annually provide funds out of the State Highway Fund to address the additional costs to the county for the construction, repair, maintenance or improvement of the road or highway over which the county accepts jurisdiction.

      (c) The agreement between the department and the county accepting jurisdiction must contain provisions to ensure that freight movement on the highway will not be restricted beyond the limits set in the agreement, unless the Oregon Transportation Commission, in consultation with the freight industry and the county, concludes that the restriction is necessary for the safety of the highway users. Nothing in this section prevents a county from taking emergency action to protect safety or place weight restrictions on a structure that is failing or otherwise damaged.

      (4) The construction, maintenance and repair of state highways shall be carried on at the sole expense of the state or at the expense of the state and the county by mutual agreement between the department and the county in which any particular state highway is located. [Amended by 1953 c.252 §2; 1979 c.223 §1; 2011 c.330 §24]

 

      366.292 Consideration of tolling prior to doing modernization project. Before proceeding with a modernization project, or a series of modernization projects on a single highway, that might result in a segment of highway to which tolling could reasonably be applied, the Department of Transportation shall determine what portion of the costs of construction and maintenance could be recovered through tolls on users of the project. The toll potential of a modernization project shall be considered among other factors in determining which modernization projects should be included in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program, with those projects with the greater potential to be self-funded through tolls ranking higher. A determination under this section may be based on assumptions that a single toll would be imposed or on assumptions that tolls would be imposed that vary depending on time of day or any other condition the department deems relevant. [1999 c.1072 §2]

 

      366.295 Relocation of highways. The Oregon Transportation Commission may make such changes in the location of highways designated and adopted by the commission, as in the judgment and discretion of the commission will result in better alignment, more advantageous and economical highway operation and maintenance, or as will contribute to and afford a more serviceable system of state highways than is possible under the present location. [Amended by 1977 c.312 §1]

 

      366.297 Environmental performance standards; rules. (1) As used in this section, “highway” has the meaning given that term in ORS 801.305.

      (2) The Department of Transportation shall adopt rules, taking into consideration the following:

      (a) Incorporating environmental performance standards into the design and construction of all state highway construction projects, including local government highway construction projects funded by the department.

      (b) Improving the environmental permitting process for state highway construction projects in order to:

      (A) Reduce the time required to design projects and obtain environmental permits;

      (B) Reduce the cost and delay associated with redesigning projects to meet environmental requirements;

      (C) Maintain a strong commitment to environmental stewardship; and

      (D) Reduce this state’s dependence on foreign oil. [2009 c.865 §18]

 

      Note: 366.297 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 366 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      366.300 Treatment of sections eliminated when highway relocated. (1) Whenever the Department of Transportation relocates or realigns a state highway or a section thereof, and by reason of such relocation or realignment there is eliminated from the original route of the highway a section thereof, the eliminated section shall, if needed for the service of persons living thereon or for a community served thereby, be maintained by the department at state expense, or by the county or by the state and the county on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon.

      (2) If such eliminated sections of old right of way, or any part thereof, in the judgment of the department, are needed or valuable for public road use, then the department shall, by appropriate action, declare the purpose of the department to preserve the same for public road use.

      (3) If the department determines under subsection (2) of this section that the eliminated sections are merely parts of the old right of way which are no longer needed or valuable for highway right of way purposes or any other public road use, then if such eliminated sections are not owned by the department in fee, the department shall abandon such eliminated sections and such sections shall, except as otherwise provided in this section, revert to and title thereto shall vest in the abutting owner or owners.

      (4) Nothing in this section shall impair vested rights of property owners under existing deeds, easements or contracts whereby the state or any county acquired such rights of way. This section shall not prevent the department from contracting for the acquisition of easements or rights of way on such terms and conditions as to abandonment and reverter as it may consider advisable under the conditions then existing. [Amended by 1985 c.259 §1]

 

      366.305 Materials, supplies and equipment. The Department of Transportation may select the materials to be used in the construction, maintenance and operation of state highways. It may purchase or contract for, independent of any particular job, improvement or highway project, whether done by contract, force account or otherwise, any material, supplies or equipment deemed necessary for carrying out the provisions and purposes of this Act in such amounts and manner and pursuant to such method as in the judgment of the department will be for the best interests of the state.

 

      366.310 Buildings and structures. The Department of Transportation may construct, equip, furnish and maintain office accommodations, shops, equipment sheds, storage plants and warehouses, snow fences, patrolmen quarters or accommodations and any other building, structure or thing deemed necessary for the efficient administration of the duties of the department and which in the opinion of the department are required for the proper and adequate accomplishment of the purposes of this Act.

 

      366.315 Widths of rights of way. The Department of Transportation may determine the widths of rights of way for all state highways.

 

      366.317 [1975 c.414 §1; repealed by 2015 c.138 §10]

 

      366.320 Acquisition of rights of way and right of access. (1) The Department of Transportation may acquire rights of way deemed necessary for all primary and secondary state highways, both within and without the corporate limits of cities and towns, except that such rights of way within the corporate limits of cities and towns may be acquired at the sole expense of the state, at the expense of the city or town or at the expense of the city or town and the state, as may be mutually agreed upon.

      (2) The department may acquire by purchase, agreement, donation or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain, real property or any right or interest therein deemed necessary for rights of way, either for original location or for widening, straightening or otherwise changing any highway, road or street. The department may, when acquiring real property for right of way, acquire all right of access from abutting property to the highway to be constructed, relocated or widened.

      (3) All rights of way owned or held by the several counties over and along any roads adopted as state highways are vested in the state, by and through the department. This subsection does not apply to any rights of way owned by any city for city streets. [Amended by 1953 c.252 §2]

 

      366.321 Expense of relocating municipal facilities payable by department; exceptions. (1) When location, construction, relocation, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of a state highway requires relocation of any facilities placed or maintained in or on a public right of way by any municipal corporation, or a district or authority established under ORS chapter 264, 450, 451, 523 or 545, the Department of Transportation shall pay the municipal corporation, district or authority whose facilities are so required to be relocated the reasonable expenses of relocation, less any benefits and salvage of the relocation.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to:

      (a) Facilities located in or on the right of way of a state highway under permits issued by the department upon the condition that the permittee would bear the cost of any relocation; or

      (b) Facilities located in or on the right of way of a state highway where the municipal corporation, district or authority established under ORS chapter 264, 450, 451 or 545, has placed such facilities in or on the right of way of the state highway without a permit from the Oregon Transportation Commission or has refused to execute a permit as required by law or commission regulations. However, this paragraph shall not apply where such municipal corporation, district or authority has located facilities in or on the right of way of a city street or county road with the permission of the governing body of such city or county before such city street or county road was selected and designated a state highway by the Department of Transportation pursuant to ORS 366.290 or 373.010. [1967 c.272 §1; 1975 c.587 §1; 1975 c.782 §51a]

 

      366.323 Studies to aid in relocating persons displaced by highway acquisition. When plans of the Department of Transportation projected for one year involve acquisition of properties in any city which will require removal of 25 or more dwelling units, businesses or institutions, the Department of Transportation shall make a study of the persons residing on or maintaining businesses or institutions on property scheduled for highway acquisition. Such studies shall be kept current until the premises required for highway acquisition are vacated. The department shall obtain such other information as it finds appropriate to aid in the relocation of persons displaced by the highway acquisition, and may extend its studies beyond city boundaries when the highway acquisition will involve dwellings, businesses or institutions within three miles of a city boundary. Such information shall be made available to the persons displaced and to other persons who may provide or assist in providing new locations. This section shall apply whether the highway acquisitions will be paid for in whole or in part from state funds either directly or by reimbursement. The Department of Transportation may contract with any governmental subdivision or agency, or with private concerns to make and maintain such studies, or may employ necessary assistants therefor. [1959 c.648 §1; 1963 c.187 §1]

 

      366.324 Financial assistance to persons displaced by highway acquisition; rules. (1) When federal funds are available for payment of direct financial assistance to persons displaced by highway acquisition, the Department of Transportation may match such federal funds to the extent provided by federal law and to provide such direct financial assistance in the instances and on the conditions set forth by federal law and regulations.

      (2) When federal funds are not available or used for payment of direct financial assistance to persons displaced by department acquisition of property, the department may provide direct financial assistance to such persons. Financial assistance authorized by this subsection shall not exceed the total amount that would have been payable under subsection (1) of this section if federal funds had been available or used. The department may adopt rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this subsection. [1959 c.648 §2; 1963 c.187 §2; 1965 c.222 §1]

 

      366.325 Rights of way through cemeteries. The Department of Transportation may acquire by purchase, agreement, donation or by exercise of the power of eminent domain, real property for right of way through a cemetery, except that the department has no authority to acquire any such real property by exercise of the power of eminent domain if within the area sought to be taken there are graves which would be disturbed by the location and construction of a highway. The department may acquire by purchase, agreement, donation or exercise of the power of eminent domain, real property contiguous to the cemetery, and may convey such real property to the cemetery association or the owners of the cemetery in exchange for the property sought to be acquired for right of way purposes, but such authority shall not be exercised unless and until the owners of the cemetery agree in writing to the exchange of lands.

 

      366.330 Acquisition of land adjoining right of way. The Department of Transportation may, when acquiring real property for right of way purposes, acquire additional real property adjoining the real property sought to be acquired for the particular public project if such additional and adjoining real property is needed for the purpose of moving and establishing thereon buildings or other structures then established on real property required for right of way purposes. The acquisition of the abutting, additional real property may be accomplished by purchase, agreement, donation or exercise of the power of eminent domain. Such real property can be acquired only in the event that the owner of the real property required for right of way purposes and on which there is then located buildings or other structures, has entered into a written agreement with the department providing for and consenting to the removal and reestablishment of the buildings or structures on the additional, abutting real property.

      366.507 Modernization program; funding; conditions and criteria. The Department of Transportation shall use an amount equal to the amount of moneys in the State Highway Fund that becomes available for its use from the increase in tax rates created by the amendments to ORS 319.020, 319.530, 825.476 and 825.480 by sections 1, 2 and 10 to 15, chapter 209, Oregon Laws 1985, and an amount equal to one-third of the amount of moneys in the State Highway Fund that becomes available for its use from any increase in tax rates created by the amendments to ORS 319.020, 319.530, 825.476 and 825.480 by sections 5, 6 and 8 to 15, chapter 899, Oregon Laws 1987, and from any increase in tax rates that results from the provisions of sections 16 and 17, chapter 899, Oregon Laws 1987, to establish and operate a state modernization program for highways. The program established under this section and the use of moneys in the program are subject to the following:

      (1) The moneys may be used by the department to retire bonds that the department issues for the modernization program under bonding authority of the department.

      (2) The intent of the modernization program is to increase highway safety, to accelerate improvements from the backlog of needs on the state highways and to fund modernization of highways and local roads to support economic development in Oregon. Projects both on and off the state highway system are eligible.

      (3) Projects to be implemented by the modernization program shall be selected by the Oregon Transportation Commission. The criteria for selection of projects will be established after public hearings that allow citizens an opportunity to review the criteria. The commission may use up to one-half of moneys available under this section for modernization projects selected by the commission from a list of projects of statewide significance.

      (4) In developing criteria for selection of projects, the commission shall consider the following:

      (a) Projects must be of significance to the state highway system.

      (b) Except for projects that are of statewide significance, projects must be equitably distributed throughout Oregon.

      (c) Projects may be on county or city arterial roads connecting to or supporting a state highway.

      (d) Priority may be given to projects that make a meaningful contribution to increased highway safety.

      (e) Priority may also be given to projects that encourage economic development where:

      (A) There is commitment by private industry to construct a facility.

      (B) There is support from other state agencies.

      (f) Priority may be given where there is local government or private sector financial participation, or both, in the improvement in addition to improvements adjacent to the project.

      (g) Priority may be given where there is strong local support.

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, federal moneys or moneys from the State Highway Fund other than those described in this section may be used for the modernization program as long as the total amount used is equal to the amount described in this section. Federal moneys that are appropriated by Congress for specific projects and federal moneys that are allocated by the United States Department of Transportation for specific projects may not be used for the modernization program under this section. [1985 c.209 §9; 1987 c.899 §2; 1999 c.969 §4; 2001 c.766 §§1,2; 2003 c.618 §§14,15; 2005 c.837 §13]

 

      366.508 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Estimated highway, road and street revenues from current sources will not adequately meet the need for continued development of a statewide road and bridge system that is economically efficient, provides accessibility to and from commercial, agricultural, industrial, tourist and recreational facilities and enhances the highway safety, environmental quality and land use goals of this state;

      (b) Responsibility for the cost of the highway, road and street system should be proportional and should be based on the number and types of vehicles that use the system and on the frequency of their use; and

      (c) Expansion, modernization, maintenance, repair, reconstruction, increased capacity and enhanced safety on all roads and bridges is crucial to the economic revitalization of Oregon.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that the purpose of this section and ORS 319.020, 319.530, 366.507, 366.739, 366.774, 366.790, 825.476 and 825.480 is:

      (a) To enhance the revenue base for the state, counties and cities for continued development and maintenance of the road and bridge system; and

      (b) To enhance the revitalization of this state’s economy by implementing a long-term plan for the state, counties and cities that establishes priorities for road and bridge improvements. [1987 c.899 §1]
