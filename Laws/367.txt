[1997 c.679 §2; 2003 c.201 §12; 2003 c.790 §14; 2007 c.783 §162]

 

      367.017 [2009 c.865 §31; repealed by 2017 c.750 §140]

 

      367.020 Loans and other assistance to public and private entities; rules; other authorized purposes.

      367.025 Issuance of infrastructure bonds. (1) If the Department of Transportation determines that it is necessary or desirable to issue infrastructure bonds to provide moneys for the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund, the department shall ask the State Treasurer to issue infrastructure bonds.

The department or State Treasurer may exercise any power granted by ORS chapter 286A in connection with bonds authorized by this section. However, the State Treasurer or the department shall not pledge or encumber any moneys of the State of Oregon other than those required by ORS 367.010 to 367.067 to be deposited in the infrastructure fund.

      (2) The department may enter into covenants for the benefit of the owners of bonds authorized by this section regarding the use of moneys in the infrastructure fund, the providing of infrastructure assistance and the collection of infrastructure loans. Any such covenants shall be binding upon the State of Oregon in accordance with their terms and shall be enforceable against the State of Oregon by owners of the bonds. However, no owner of bonds authorized by this section shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon, or to enforce payment thereof against any property of the state, except those moneys in the infrastructure fund that are pledged to pay the bonds and any moneys the department or an agency may agree to use to repay infrastructure loans under ORS 367.040. Bonds authorized by this section shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state, except moneys in the infrastructure fund that are pledged to pay the bonds, and any property that the department or agency pledges, mortgages or assigns to secure infrastructure loans pursuant to ORS 367.040. Revenue bonds authorized by this section shall not constitute a debt of the state or a lending of the credit of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation.

      (3) The total principal amount of revenue bonds that are issued under this section and outstanding at any time shall not exceed $200 million. [1997 c.679 §6; 2007 c.783 §164]

 

      367.035 Loans to municipalities; authority of municipalities; repayment plan. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any restriction on indebtedness contained in a charter, a municipality may obtain an infrastructure loan from the Department of Transportation by entering into a loan contract with the department. A municipality that obtains an infrastructure loan may pledge to the repayment of the loan all or any portion of the revenue sources specified in this subsection. A municipality shall repay an infrastructure loan in accordance with the terms of the loan contract and to the extent required by the loan contract from any or all of the following sources:

      (a) Revenues of any transportation project, including special assessment revenues;

      (b) Moneys withheld under subsection (3) or (5) of this section;

      (c) The general fund of the municipality; or

      (d) Any other sources including, but not limited to, an appropriation or allocation to a county under ORS 366.762 to 366.768 or to a city under ORS 366.785 to 366.820.

      (2) An infrastructure loan contract with a municipality may provide that a portion of the proceeds of the loan be applied to fund a reserve fund to secure the repayment of the loan or secure the repayment of revenue bonds issued to finance the loan.

      (3) An infrastructure loan contract with a city or county may provide that all or a portion of the principal and interest on an infrastructure loan be repaid by withholding all or a portion of an apportionment due to a county under ORS 366.762 to 366.768 or due to a city under ORS 366.785 to 366.820. The department shall immediately transfer funds withheld under this subsection from the State Highway Fund to the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund.

      (4) A municipality that intends to obtain an infrastructure loan shall adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing the infrastructure loan.

      (5) If a municipality fails to comply with the terms of an infrastructure loan contract, the department may seek any legal or equitable remedy to obtain compliance or payment of damages. If any municipality fails to make an infrastructure loan payment when due, the State of Oregon shall, at the request of the department, withhold any funds due to the municipality from the state and apply the amounts withheld to pay the entire amount owed by the municipality under the infrastructure loan contract. The department shall deposit funds withheld under this subsection in the account of the infrastructure fund to which the municipality’s infrastructure loan payments are required to be deposited. The department may waive the right of the State of Oregon to withhold moneys under this subsection only if the department has not pledged the right as security for the repayment of infrastructure bonds. [1997 c.679 §7; 2003 c.201 §14]

 

      367.040 Loans to state agencies; loan contract. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 283.087 (4), an agency may obtain an infrastructure loan the principal amount of which, when combined with the principal amount of financing agreements previously entered into for the same project, is more than $100,000 for the project. An agency may agree to pay the infrastructure loan from any or all of the available moneys of the agency and may pledge all or any portion of those moneys to repay the infrastructure loan. An infrastructure loan of an agency does not constitute a debt of the state or a lending of the credit of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation.

      (2) If an infrastructure loan is made to an agency, the terms of the infrastructure loan contract bind the State of Oregon and the agency, and the agency shall unconditionally repay the infrastructure loan from the moneys the agency has pledged in accordance with the terms of the infrastructure loan contract. [1997 c.679 §8; 2003 c.201 §15; 2013 c.767 §6]

 

      367.050 Powers of department. The Department of Transportation may:

      (1) Make all contracts and agreements, execute and deliver all instruments and do all things necessary or convenient to provide financial assistance for transportation projects in accordance with ORS 367.010 to 367.067 or to perform covenants made to secure infrastructure bonds; and

      (2) Enter into and perform such contracts and agreements with entities concerning the planning, construction, lease or other acquisition, installation or financing of transportation projects. [1997 c.679 §9; 2003 c.201 §16]

The lien of a pledge made under this subsection is subordinate to the lien of a pledge securing bonds issued under ORS 367.605 to 367.665.

      (2) If, during a fiscal year, the moneys in the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund are insufficient to cover any claims by financial institutions, credit enhancement providers, bondholders or bond trustees that arise from loan guarantees or other extensions of credit made under ORS 367.010 to 367.067, the department shall transfer, as often as necessary or appropriate in that fiscal year, moneys from the State Highway Fund to satisfy such claims. However, the department may not make a transfer of moneys from the State Highway Fund otherwise required by this section if:

      (a) The transfer will reduce the moneys in the State Highway Fund to an amount that is insufficient to pay the principal and interest that will fall due during the fiscal year on outstanding bonds issued under ORS 367.555 to 367.600; or

      (b) The transfer relates to a claim arising out of a transportation project for which moneys in the State Highway Fund may not be used under section 3a, Article IX, Oregon Constitution, and ORS 366.505. [1999 c.1036 §2; 2003 c.201 §17; 2003 c.790 §15]

(1) For the biennium beginning July 1, 2017, at the request of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, in consultation with the Department of Transportation, the State Treasurer is authorized to issue lottery bonds pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585 in an amount that produces $30 million in net proceeds and interest earnings for the purpose described in subsection (2) of this section, plus an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs.

      (2) Net proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to this section and interest earnings must be transferred to the Department of Transportation for deposit in the Connect Oregon Fund established under ORS 367.080 in an amount sufficient to provide $30 million for the department to finance grants for transportation projects as provided in ORS 367.080 to 367.086 [series became 367.080 to 367.089].

      (3) Bond-related costs for the lottery bonds authorized by this section must be paid from the gross proceeds of the lottery bonds and from allocations for the purposes of ORS 286A.576 (1)(c).

      (4) The Legislative Assembly finds that issuing lottery bonds to finance transportation projects pursuant to this section is essential to promoting the state’s economic development, and the use of lottery bond proceeds is authorized based on the following findings:

      (a) There is an urgent need to improve and expand publicly owned and privately owned transportation infrastructure to support economic development in this state.

      (b) A safe, efficient and reliable transportation network supports the long-term economic development and livability of this state.

      (c) A multimodal network of transportation options moves people and goods efficiently.

      (d) Local governments and private sector businesses often lack capital and the technical capacity to undertake multimodal transportation projects.

      (e) Public financial assistance can stimulate industrial growth and commercial enterprise and promote employment opportunities in this state.

      (f) Public investment in transportation infrastructure will create jobs and further economic development in this state.

      (g) The use of lottery bond proceeds as provided in this section will create jobs, further economic development, finance public education or restore and protect parks, beaches, watersheds and native fish and wildlife within Oregon, and issuance of lottery bonds for the purpose described in this section is therefore an appropriate use of state lottery funds under Article XV, section 4, of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 461.510. [2017 c.748 §8]

      Sec. 9. To the extent that proposed transportation projects meet the qualifications established by the Oregon Transportation Commission by rule, the commission shall allocate at least 10 percent of the net proceeds of the lottery bonds authorized by section 8 of this 2017 Act to each region described in this section. For purposes of this section, the regions are as follows:

      (1) Region one consists of Clackamas, Hood River, Multnomah and Washington Counties.

      (2) Region two consists of Benton, Clatsop, Columbia, Lane, Lincoln, Linn, Marion, Polk, Tillamook and Yamhill Counties.

      (3) Region three consists of Coos, Curry, Douglas, Jackson and Josephine Counties.

      (4) Region four consists of Crook, Deschutes, Gilliam, Jefferson, Klamath, Lake, Sherman, Wasco and Wheeler Counties.

      (5) Region five consists of Baker, Grant, Harney, Malheur, Morrow, Umatilla, Union and Wallowa Counties. [2017 c.748 §9]

      (b) The State Treasurer may only issue additional bonds if sufficient moneys described under ORS 367.605 may be pledged to pay the annual bond debt service for all outstanding bonds issued under this section as well as for the additional bonds.

      (3)(a) When the commission determines that a project described in this section is completed, the commission shall reallocate any amount remaining from the allocation made under this section to another project described in the same region.

      (b) When the commission determines that all of the projects within a region are completed, the commission shall reallocate any amount remaining from the allocation made under this section to any other project listed in this section.

      (4) The amounts described in this section for jurisdiction transfers described in section 134 of this 2017 Act may not be allocated until after the transfer for which the allocation is dedicated occurs. [2017 c.750 §71d]

 

      Note: The reference to 367.620 (3)(d) in section 71d (1), chapter 750, Oregon Laws 2017, applies to the version of 367.620 that becomes operative January 1, 2020.

 

      367.621 Use of private sector resources in specified work. It is the policy of the State of Oregon to use increased revenues from the amendments to ORS 803.090, 803.420, 818.225, 825.476 and 825.480 by sections 1 to 5, chapter 618, Oregon Laws 2003, in a manner that maximizes the creation of new jobs. Each public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, that receives moneys from the revenues generated by the amendments to ORS 803.090, 803.420, 818.225, 825.476 and 825.480 by sections 1 to 5, chapter 618, Oregon Laws 2003, shall use private sector resources to the greatest extent possible in accomplishing the work funded by revenues from the amendments to ORS 803.090, 803.420, 818.225, 825.476 and 825.480 by sections 1 to 5, chapter 618, Oregon Laws 2003. [2003 c.618 §41]

 

      Note: 367.621 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 367 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      367.622 Preservation and modernization projects funded by specified bonds; rules; selection criteria. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Highway” has the meaning given that term in ORS 801.305.

      (b) “Modernization” means improvements that add capacity to highways, including but not limited to new or widened lanes and new bypasses.

      (c) “Preservation” means paving, striping, reconstruction and other activities designed to add useful life to existing highways.

      (2) Bonds described in ORS 367.620 (2) shall be used to finance preservation and modernization projects chosen by the Oregon Transportation Commission. The commission shall select projects from among the following:

      (a) Highways that need increased lane capacity.

      (b) Highways and bridges that have weight limitations.

      (c) State and local bridges.

      (d) Interchanges on multilane highways.

      (e) District highways in cities and counties that require preservation. The Department of Transportation shall adopt rules defining “district highway” for purposes of this paragraph.

      (3) In choosing projects under subsection (2) of this section, the commission shall use the following criteria, in addition to any criteria developed under ORS 367.623:

      (a) Lane capacity projects shall be chosen from a financially constrained list.

      (b) Bridge projects shall be chosen on the basis of a bridge inventory or rating system recognized by the commission.

      (c) Priority for interchange projects shall be given to projects on multilane highways where safety can be enhanced by constructing a grade-separated interchange to replace an at-grade crossing.

      (d) Priority for district highway preservation projects shall be given to those projects that may facilitate transfer of jurisdiction over the highway from the state to a local government.

      (e) Projects selected for financing under this section shall be equitably distributed throughout the state, using the criteria for distribution of projects that are used for the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program. [2001 c.669 §2; 2005 c.612 §8]

 

      Note: 367.622 and 367.623 were added to and made a part of ORS chapter 367 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      367.623 Consultation with local governments for project selection. In establishing criteria other than those specified in ORS 367.622 for selection of projects, and in choosing projects under ORS 367.622, the Oregon Transportation Commission shall consult with local governments, metropolitan planning organizations and regional transportation advisory groups. [2001 c.669 §3]

OREGON INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM

 

      367.800 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Entrepreneurial approaches to the acquisition, design, management and financing of transportation projects will accelerate cost-effective project delivery.

      (2) Entrepreneurial approaches can bring substantial benefits to the public in transportation project development and execution.

      (3) Risk management is a critical component of partnerships for transportation projects.

      (4) Successful implementation of an Oregon innovative partnership program for transportation projects requires that risk in a project be managed and shared by public and private sector participants, with the partner best able to control a risk bearing responsibility for the risk.

      (5) The Legislative Assembly and the executive branch of government accept responsibility for providing predictability for partnerships for transportation projects and for allowing negotiated agreements to be implemented.

      (6) The development, acquisition and construction of transportation projects creates jobs and furthers economic development in Oregon by, among other things:

      (a) Increasing the economy and efficiency of public transportation, improving the flow of commerce into and around the state and the surrounding region, improving the attractiveness of Oregon to new businesses and supporting the operations and prosperity of existing businesses; and

      (b) Improving the movement of people into and around the state and the surrounding region, alleviating congestion and crowding and reducing the burdens on existing public transportation systems and transportation facilities. [2003 c.790 §1]

 

      Note: 367.800 to 367.824 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 367 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
