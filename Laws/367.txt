[1997 c.679 §2; 2003 c.201 §12; 2003 c.790 §14; 2007 c.783 §162]

 

      367.017 [2009 c.865 §31; repealed by 2017 c.750 §140]

 

      367.020 Loans and other assistance to public and private entities; rules; other authorized purposes.

The Oregon Transportation Commission shall adopt rules that prescribe procedures and standards for making infrastructure loans and providing infrastructure assistance.

      367.025 Issuance of infrastructure bonds. (1) If the Department of Transportation determines that it is necessary or desirable to issue infrastructure bonds to provide moneys for the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund, the department shall ask the State Treasurer to issue infrastructure bonds.

      (2) Infrastructure bonds shall be issued as provided in ORS chapter 286A. [1997 c.679 §5; 2001 c.536 §9; 2003 c.794 §266; 2007 c.783 §163]

 

      367.030 Issuance of revenue bonds; bond covenants; maximum amount of bonds. (1) To provide moneys for the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund or to refund bonds authorized by this section, the State Treasurer may, at the request of the Department of Transportation, issue revenue bonds of the State of Oregon that are payable solely from all or any portion of the moneys deposited in the infrastructure fund and may pledge such moneys to secure the revenue bonds. The department or State Treasurer may exercise any power granted by ORS chapter 286A in connection with bonds authorized by this section. However, the State Treasurer or the department shall not pledge or encumber any moneys of the State of Oregon other than those required by ORS 367.010 to 367.067 to be deposited in the infrastructure fund.

      (2) The department may enter into covenants for the benefit of the owners of bonds authorized by this section regarding the use of moneys in the infrastructure fund, the providing of infrastructure assistance and the collection of infrastructure loans. Any such covenants shall be binding upon the State of Oregon in accordance with their terms and shall be enforceable against the State of Oregon by owners of the bonds. However, no owner of bonds authorized by this section shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon, or to enforce payment thereof against any property of the state, except those moneys in the infrastructure fund that are pledged to pay the bonds and any moneys the department or an agency may agree to use to repay infrastructure loans under ORS 367.040. Bonds authorized by this section shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state, except moneys in the infrastructure fund that are pledged to pay the bonds, and any property that the department or agency pledges, mortgages or assigns to secure infrastructure loans pursuant to ORS 367.040. Revenue bonds authorized by this section shall not constitute a debt of the state or a lending of the credit of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation.

      (3) The total principal amount of revenue bonds that are issued under this section and outstanding at any time shall not exceed $200 million. [1997 c.679 §6; 2007 c.783 §164]

 

      367.035 Loans to municipalities; authority of municipalities; repayment plan. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any restriction on indebtedness contained in a charter, a municipality may obtain an infrastructure loan from the Department of Transportation by entering into a loan contract with the department. A municipality that obtains an infrastructure loan may pledge to the repayment of the loan all or any portion of the revenue sources specified in this subsection. A municipality shall repay an infrastructure loan in accordance with the terms of the loan contract and to the extent required by the loan contract from any or all of the following sources:

      (a) Revenues of any transportation project, including special assessment revenues;

      (b) Moneys withheld under subsection (3) or (5) of this section;

      (c) The general fund of the municipality; or

      (d) Any other sources including, but not limited to, an appropriation or allocation to a county under ORS 366.762 to 366.768 or to a city under ORS 366.785 to 366.820.

      (2) An infrastructure loan contract with a municipality may provide that a portion of the proceeds of the loan be applied to fund a reserve fund to secure the repayment of the loan or secure the repayment of revenue bonds issued to finance the loan.

      (3) An infrastructure loan contract with a city or county may provide that all or a portion of the principal and interest on an infrastructure loan be repaid by withholding all or a portion of an apportionment due to a county under ORS 366.762 to 366.768 or due to a city under ORS 366.785 to 366.820. The department shall immediately transfer funds withheld under this subsection from the State Highway Fund to the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund.

      (4) A municipality that intends to obtain an infrastructure loan shall adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing the infrastructure loan.

      (5) If a municipality fails to comply with the terms of an infrastructure loan contract, the department may seek any legal or equitable remedy to obtain compliance or payment of damages. If any municipality fails to make an infrastructure loan payment when due, the State of Oregon shall, at the request of the department, withhold any funds due to the municipality from the state and apply the amounts withheld to pay the entire amount owed by the municipality under the infrastructure loan contract. The department shall deposit funds withheld under this subsection in the account of the infrastructure fund to which the municipality’s infrastructure loan payments are required to be deposited. The department may waive the right of the State of Oregon to withhold moneys under this subsection only if the department has not pledged the right as security for the repayment of infrastructure bonds. [1997 c.679 §7; 2003 c.201 §14]

 

      367.040 Loans to state agencies; loan contract. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 283.087 (4), an agency may obtain an infrastructure loan the principal amount of which, when combined with the principal amount of financing agreements previously entered into for the same project, is more than $100,000 for the project. An agency may agree to pay the infrastructure loan from any or all of the available moneys of the agency and may pledge all or any portion of those moneys to repay the infrastructure loan. An infrastructure loan of an agency does not constitute a debt of the state or a lending of the credit of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation.

      (2) If an infrastructure loan is made to an agency, the terms of the infrastructure loan contract bind the State of Oregon and the agency, and the agency shall unconditionally repay the infrastructure loan from the moneys the agency has pledged in accordance with the terms of the infrastructure loan contract. [1997 c.679 §8; 2003 c.201 §15; 2013 c.767 §6]

 

      367.050 Powers of department. The Department of Transportation may:

      (1) Make all contracts and agreements, execute and deliver all instruments and do all things necessary or convenient to provide financial assistance for transportation projects in accordance with ORS 367.010 to 367.067 or to perform covenants made to secure infrastructure bonds; and

      (2) Enter into and perform such contracts and agreements with entities concerning the planning, construction, lease or other acquisition, installation or financing of transportation projects. [1997 c.679 §9; 2003 c.201 §16]

(1) The Department of Transportation shall consult with the legislative committees related to transportation during a session of the Legislative Assembly, or the interim legislative committees related to transportation, prior to expending federal funds received under a federal law that provides general economic stimulus moneys to this state that may be used by the department for transportation projects.

      (2) As used in this section, “transportation project” has the meaning given that term in ORS 367.010. [2011 c.629 §3]

 

      Note: 367.055 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 367 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      367.060 Department pledge to ensure loan guarantees; transfer of moneys from State Highway Fund. (1) The Department of Transportation may pledge not more than $50 million to ensure the repayment of loan guarantees or other extensions of credit made to or on behalf of municipalities to finance transportation projects or to ensure repayment of loan guarantees or other extensions of credit as provided in ORS 367.816. The lien of a pledge made under this subsection is subordinate to the lien of a pledge securing bonds issued under ORS 367.605 to 367.665.

      (2) If, during a fiscal year, the moneys in the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund are insufficient to cover any claims by financial institutions, credit enhancement providers, bondholders or bond trustees that arise from loan guarantees or other extensions of credit made under ORS 367.010 to 367.067, the department shall transfer, as often as necessary or appropriate in that fiscal year, moneys from the State Highway Fund to satisfy such claims. However, the department may not make a transfer of moneys from the State Highway Fund otherwise required by this section if:

      (a) The transfer will reduce the moneys in the State Highway Fund to an amount that is insufficient to pay the principal and interest that will fall due during the fiscal year on outstanding bonds issued under ORS 367.555 to 367.600; or

      (b) The transfer relates to a claim arising out of a transportation project for which moneys in the State Highway Fund may not be used under section 3a, Article IX, Oregon Constitution, and ORS 366.505. [1999 c.1036 §2; 2003 c.201 §17; 2003 c.790 §15]

      (c) “Preservation” means paving, striping, reconstruction and other activities designed to add useful life to existing highways.

      (2) Bonds described in ORS 367.620 (2) shall be used to finance preservation and modernization projects chosen by the Oregon Transportation Commission. The commission shall select projects from among the following:

      (a) Highways that need increased lane capacity.

      (b) Highways and bridges that have weight limitations.

      (c) State and local bridges.

      (d) Interchanges on multilane highways.

      (e) District highways in cities and counties that require preservation. The Department of Transportation shall adopt rules defining “district highway” for purposes of this paragraph.

      (a) Lane capacity projects shall be chosen from a financially constrained list.

      (b) Bridge projects shall be chosen on the basis of a bridge inventory or rating system recognized by the commission.

      (c) Priority for interchange projects shall be given to projects on multilane highways where safety can be enhanced by constructing a grade-separated interchange to replace an at-grade crossing.

      (d) Priority for district highway preservation projects shall be given to those projects that may facilitate transfer of jurisdiction over the highway from the state to a local government.

      (e) Projects selected for financing under this section shall be equitably distributed throughout the state, using the criteria for distribution of projects that are used for the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program. [2001 c.669 §2; 2005 c.612 §8]

 

      Note: 367.622 and 367.623 were added to and made a part of ORS chapter 367 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

(1) In addition to any authority to issue and sell bonds and other similar obligations, this section establishes continuing authority for the State Treasurer to issue and sell bonds and other similar obligations, at the request of the Department of Transportation, in a manner consistent with this section. To finance any transportation project in whole or in part, the department may request that the State Treasurer issue revenue bonds on behalf of the department. Revenue bonds authorized under this section shall be issued in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 286A. The bonds shall be secured by a pledge of, and a lien on, and shall be payable only from moneys in the State Transportation Enterprise Fund established by ORS 367.810 and any other revenues specifically pledged to repayment of the bonds. Such a pledge by the department of its revenues creates a lien that is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made as provided in ORS 286A.102. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section are not general obligations of the state and are not secured by or payable from any funds or assets of the state other than the moneys and revenues specifically pledged to the repayment of such revenue bonds.

      (2) Moneys received from the issuance of revenue bonds or other debt obligations, including any investment earnings thereon, may be expended:

      (a) For the purpose of financing the costs of the transportation project for which the bonds are issued;

      (b) To pay the costs and other administrative expenses of the bonds;

      (c) To pay the costs of credit enhancement or to fund any reserves determined to be necessary or advantageous in connection with the revenue bonds; and

      (d) To reimburse the department for any costs related to carrying out the purposes of the program established under ORS 367.804.

      (3) Any transportation project may be financed in whole or in part with:

      (a) The proceeds of grant anticipation revenue bonds authorized by 23 U.S.C. 122 and applicable state law.

      (b) Grants, loans, loan guarantees, lines of credit, revolving lines of credit or other financing arrangements available pursuant to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act under 23 U.S.C. 181 et seq., or any other applicable federal law.

      (c) Infrastructure loans or assistance from the Oregon Transportation Infrastructure Fund established by ORS 367.015.

      (4) As security for the payment of financing described in subsection (3) of this section, the revenues from the project may be pledged, but no such pledge of revenues constitutes in any manner or to any extent a general obligation of the state. Any financing described in subsection (3) of this section may be structured on a senior, parity or subordinate basis to any other financing. [2003 c.790 §7; 2007 c.783 §174]
