      (2) If the owner does not make the repairs within the time allowed, the county governing body may order the repairs to be made. The county governing body shall file the order for the repairs with the county clerk, the order describing the abutting property. The recorded order is notice that the described property is subject to a lien for the cost of the repairs, in an amount to be determined later by an order of the county governing body. The county clerk shall indorse upon the order the date of the filing and record and index the order in special books to be kept by the county clerk for such purpose.

 

      368.915 Payment and reimbursement when county makes repairs. (1) After the repairs mentioned in ORS 368.910 have been completed the county governing body shall compute the cost to which may be added up to 10 percent of the cost for administration. Payment for the repairs shall be made from the general fund of the county.

      (2) The fund drawn upon for the repairs shall be reimbursed by an assessment of the total cost against the abutting property. After the owner has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard, the county governing body shall by order determine the cost to be assessed against the abutting property. Notice of the determination of the assessment shall be mailed to the owner within 10 days after the cost is determined. The county governing body shall certify the order to the county assessor and shall record the order with the county clerk. The clerk shall indorse on the order the date of filing and record and index it in the special books kept by the clerk for such purpose.

 

      368.920 Expense of repairs as lien on abutting property. The assessment mentioned in ORS 368.915 and interest are a lien upon the abutting property from the date of the filing with the county clerk of the order of the county governing body for the repairs under ORS 368.910. No transfer, sale or division of the abutting land, or change in its legal description, divests the lien from the whole of the original abutting land. Failure to enter the name of the owner or mistake in the name of the owner in the order for repairs in no way renders void any assessment and in no way affects the lien on the property described. The lien has priority over all other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens. Upon payment in full of the assessment and interest, the county sheriff shall enter satisfaction by a notation in the record kept by the county clerk, and the property is thereby discharged from the lien.

 

      368.925 Delinquency in paying assessment for repairs; execution sale. (1) Thirty days after the notice of the determination of the assessment mentioned in ORS 368.915 is mailed to the owner, the entire amount is due and payable at the office of the county sheriff, and if not so paid shall be delinquent from that date and shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per year until paid.

      (2) One year from the date an assessment is delinquent, the county sheriff shall transmit to the county clerk a written description of the property, the name of the person to whom assessed, the amount of the assessment and the interest due. The county clerk shall issue a writ of execution thereon, directed to the sheriff of the county. The sheriff shall proceed to collect the unpaid assessment by advertising and selling the property in the manner provided by law for the sale of real property on execution, but no property shall be sold for a sum less than the amount of the unpaid assessment plus interest and the cost of advertising and sale.
