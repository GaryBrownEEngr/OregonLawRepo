If the county court in its order calling an election under ORS 370.031 designates the particular roads to be built or improved by the money raised by the sale of bonds, the county court shall not use any of the money raised upon any other road or for any other purpose than those mentioned in the order. If the order does not designate any particular roads to be built or improved by the money raised, then the county court may expend the money raised from the sale of the bonds to build, improve or maintain such permanent roads within the county as the county court considers proper. [Amended by 1983 c.350 §234]

 

      370.130 Order declaring election results; contents and effect. If at any election under ORS 370.031 a majority of the electors voting at the election favors issuing the bonds, the county court shall enter an order in its journal declaring that fact. This order shall:

      (1) Be conclusive as to the regularity of all the proceedings in reference to the matter.

      (2) Designate the amount of the total assessed valuation of all the property within the county.

      (3) Designate the amount of all the previous debts and liabilities of the county incurred for road purposes and remaining unpaid.

      (4) Be prima facie evidence as to the amount of the assessed valuation and the indebtedness. [Amended by 1983 c.350 §235]

 

      370.140 Issuance of bonds. After having entered the order as provided in ORS 370.130, the county court shall cause the bonds to be issued as prescribed in ORS chapter 287A. [Amended by 1981 c.94 §34; 2007 c.783 §175]

 

      370.150 Issuance of serial in lieu of term bonds. After the issuance of bonds has been authorized by an election held in accordance with ORS 370.031, 370.120 and 370.130, the county court, in lieu of bonds redeemable only at the time stated in the notice, may issue bonds and, in the order providing for their issuance, reserve the right to redeem any or all of them serially each year. When bonds are issued with such reservation, the redemption fund provided for in ORS 370.170 may be used each year, as it is collected, for the redemption of such proportion or percentage of the bonds as will redeem all of them at the end of the time fixed in the prior proceedings for maturity of the bonds, instead of being kept and deposited as provided by law or loaned as provided in ORS 370.200 until the final maturity of the bonds. [Amended by 1967 c.451 §21; 1983 c.350 §236]

 

      370.160 Option to issue redeemable term or serial bonds. In its discretion, the county court further may issue either term bonds or the serial bonds mentioned in ORS 370.150 with the option of redeeming them on and after certain interest-paying dates specified by the county court in the bonds. [Amended by 1997 c.171 §19; 2007 c.783 §176]

 

      370.170 Special bond redemption funds. Beginning with the fourth year after the bonds are sold the county court shall each year thereafter, until maturity of the bonds, set aside as a special fund for their payment such percentage of the face value of the bonds as at the date of their maturity shall aggregate their full face value. Where bonds are issued in different series maturing at different times a separate redemption fund shall be provided for each series.

 

      370.180 Tax levy for redemption fund and bond interest. The amount necessary to provide the redemption fund and to pay the annual interest on outstanding bonds shall be added to the general levy of taxes as may be required, which tax shall be levied upon all the taxable property within the county.

 

      370.190 [Repealed by 1967 c.451 §32]

 

      370.200 Loan of redemption funds. Whenever there are sufficient funds on hand in the bond redemption fund, the county treasurer with the approval of the county court may loan any money in the bond redemption fund, secured by first mortgage on improved real estate within the county at six percent interest per year. All applications for such loans shall be made in writing to the county treasurer, shall state the amount of the loan applied for and the security offered and shall be numbered consecutively as received and passed upon by the county court. The county court shall require an abstract of title of property and a written opinion from the district attorney of the county concerning the validity of the title of the lands offered as security. The county court may authorize or reject any loan. No loan shall be made in excess of 50 percent of the assessed valuation of the property offered as security. No expense shall be incurred by the county in loaning any such funds.

 

      370.210 [Repealed by 1967 c.451 §32]

 

      370.220 [Repealed by 1967 c.451 §32]

      370.240 Warrants in lieu of bonds. (1) After the issuance of bonds has been authorized by an election held in accordance with ORS 370.031, 370.120 and 370.130, the county court, in lieu of the issuance of any or all such bonds, may issue warrants drawn upon the county treasury for the purpose of securing any or all funds sought to be secured by the issuance of such bonds.

      (2) These warrants shall be in denominations of $50, or multiples thereof up to $1,000, and shall bear the same rate of interest as the bonds would bear in lieu of which the warrants are issued.

      (3) No such warrants shall become due at any specified time, but shall be redeemable by the county at any time in the same manner as other county warrants are redeemed or paid. [Amended by 1983 c.350 §237]

 

      370.250 [Repealed by 1981 c.153 §79]
