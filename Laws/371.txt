The county court shall not divide such territory to include any of it in any other road district unless the people of the drainage district or city, by majority vote at an election held pursuant to law, vote that the territory be included by the county court in a road district established by the county court. The county court may include in the road district of any drainage district contiguous property adjoining or adjacent to such drainage district, but in no event shall the total area added by the county court be more than 50 percent of the area of the drainage district.

The board of supervisors of such drainage district may cooperate with the county court in construction, maintenance and repairs on roads within the boundaries of the drainage district, and for this purpose may levy in any one year a tax on every acre of land in the district in the proportion that the acre is benefited by the proposed construction, maintenance or repair, but in no event to exceed $1 for any one acre.

      371.067 Construction, maintenance and repair in city road district. Any construction, maintenance and repairs on roads within the boundaries of a city that constitutes an entire and separate road district under ORS 371.060 shall be only on such public roads, as defined in ORS 368.001, within the district as are designated by order of the governing body of the city.

      371.650 Certification of assessment; recording order; lien. (1) The county court shall certify a list and description of the ownership, stating the amount of assessment against each individual parcel of land, and shall record the order with the county clerk, who shall indorse thereon the date of the filing thereof and record and index it in the County Clerk Lien Record.

      (2) The assessments and interest are a lien upon the land against which the same are assessed from the date of the filing with the county clerk of the order of the county court for the improvement, as provided in ORS 371.635. Each parcel of land is deemed to be benefited by the improvement to the full amount of the assessment levied thereon. No transfer, sale or division of any such parcel, or change in the legal description thereof, in any way divests the lien from the original parcel and the whole thereof. Failing to enter the name of the owner or a mistake in the name of the owner does not in any way render void any assessment and does not in any way affect the lien on the land described. The lien has priority over all other liens and encumbrances whatsoever, except tax liens.

      (3) Upon payment of the assessment in full, the county court shall satisfy the same by recording the satisfaction of lien in the County Clerk Lien Record, and the parcel of land charged with such assessment is thereby discharged from the lien. [Amended by 1955 c.773 §8; 1959 c.656 §2; 2001 c.577 §4]

 

      371.655 When assessment due, payable and delinquent; application of other statutes. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, 30 days after the assessment is certified, the entire amount against each parcel of land shall be due and payable at the office designated by the governing body of the county and, if not so paid, shall be delinquent from that date and shall bear interest at a rate established by the governing body of the county.

      (2) The owner of property assessed under ORS 371.605 to 371.660 shall have the right to apply for installment payment of the assessment as provided in ORS 223.210.

      (3) The provisions of ORS 223.205 and 223.210 to 223.314 (Bancroft Bonding Act) and 223.770 relating to the assessment of property benefited by public improvements and to the issuance of bonds and other obligations for the cost of the improvements shall apply in so far as practicable and applicable in relation to the assessment by counties of the cost or any portion of the cost of improvements against the property benefited in accordance with ORS 371.605 to 371.660 and to the issuance of bonds and other obligations by the county.

      (4) Where, in ORS 223.205 to 223.314 and 223.770, officials of local governments are referred to, the corresponding officials of counties where applicable and unless otherwise designated by charter shall perform the required functions. [Amended by 1955 c.773 §9; 1959 c.656 §3; 1961 c.432 §3; 1963 c.545 §1; 1965 c.227 §1; 1971 c.325 §3; 1981 c.322 §8; 1991 c.459 §391; 1991 c.902 §112; 1995 c.333 §17; 1997 c.249 §118; 2003 c.802 §64; 2009 c.538 §2]

 

      371.660 Delinquent list; execution and sale. (1) One year from the date an assessment for improvements under ORS 371.605 to 371.660 is delinquent, or, in case the assessment has been spread in semiannual installments, one year from the date any semiannual installment of the assessment is delinquent, the county court shall prepare a delinquent list of all assessments not wholly paid. The list shall contain a description of the land, the name of the person to whom assessed and the amount of the assessment and interest due.

      (2) The county court shall transmit the list to the county clerk, who shall issue a writ of execution thereon, directed to the county court.

      (3) The county court shall proceed to collect the unpaid assessments named in the list by advertising and selling each parcel of land in the manner provided by law for the sale of real property on execution, but no parcel shall be sold for a sum less than the amount of the unpaid assessment plus interest thereon and the cost of advertising and sale. [Amended by 1955 c.773 §10; 1959 c.656 §4; 1961 c.432 §4]
