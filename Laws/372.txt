No proposal shall be filed until the assent of all known holders of valid indebtedness against the district is obtained or provision is made in the plan for payment of the nonassenting holders.

      (2) Upon the filing of the proposal, the county board shall fix a time for, and cause notice to be given of, a hearing on the petition. The hearing shall be held not less than 30 nor more than 50 days after the date the petition is filed with the board. Notice of the hearing shall be given by:

      (a) Posting in three public places within the district not less than 15 days prior to the hearing; and

      (b) Publication in some newspaper of general circulation in the district once a week for three successive weeks before the hearing, making three publications, the last publication being at least five days before the hearing.

The notice shall give a brief summary of the proposed plan of dissolution and liquidation and state that a copy is on file at the office of the county clerk, available for inspection. [1971 c.514 §35]

 

      372.480 Grounds for granting dissolution; assumption of district indebtedness; disposition of surplus; statement of dissolution. (1) After the hearing, if the county board determines it is in the best interest of the district to dissolve, it shall grant the petition and enter an order dissolving the district or the county board may deny the petition. If an order is entered dissolving the district, the district board shall thereupon constitute a board of trustees to dispose of the property of the district and pay its debts and obligations or procure releases thereof.

      (2) If a county service district assumes all indebtedness of the highway lighting district and undertakes to continue to furnish service to the inhabitants pursuant to the plan of dissolution and liquidation, and if the consent of all the known holders of valid indebtedness against the district has been obtained or provision has been made in the plan for payment of the nonassenting holders, the board of trustees may convey to the county service district all assets of the highway lighting district as described by the district board under ORS 372.460 after paying and discharging the debts to, or procuring releases from, the nonassenting holders.

      (3) Except as provided by subsection (2) of this section, any surplus funds remaining to the credit of the district, after payment of the indebtedness of the district, shall be turned over to the county treasurer to become a part of the general fund of the county. If the assets of the district are insufficient to pay the indebtedness, the board of trustees shall levy taxes, within the limits of the authority of the district, for the liquidation of such indebtedness.

      (4) Upon completing liquidation of the highway lighting district, the board of trustees shall execute, under oath, a signed statement that the district has been dissolved and its affairs liquidated, which statement shall be filed in the office of the county clerk of the county.
