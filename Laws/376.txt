(1) If the owners of lands abutting on the proposed pedestrian mall representing 10 percent of the frontage on the proposed pedestrian mall have made written objection to the establishment of the proposed pedestrian mall, the legislative body shall so find and shall terminate the proceedings for such establishment. In such event no proceeding under ORS 376.705 to 376.825 for the establishment of the same or substantially the same pedestrian mall shall be commenced within one year after such termination.

      (2) If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by ORS 376.735, then if the owners of more than 10 percent of the area of land included within the district described in the resolution of intention and subject to assessment have made written objection to the establishment of the proposed pedestrian mall, the legislative body shall so find and in that event the legislative body may continue with proceedings for the establishment of the pedestrian mall but shall have no power to make any assessment upon benefited property to pay damages. In such event no proceeding under ORS 376.705 to 376.825 for the levy of assessments upon benefited property to pay damages in connection with the establishment of the same or substantially the same pedestrian mall shall be commenced within one year after such finding. [1961 c.666 §§16,17]

 

      376.765 Changing boundaries when assessments to be levied under ORS 376.735; notice; objections. (1) If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by ORS 376.735, then at the hearing the legislative body may change the boundaries of the proposed district by adding thereto land which in its opinion will be benefited by the establishment of the pedestrian mall or by excluding from the district lands which in its opinion will not be so benefited. If the legislative body proposes any such change it shall take proceedings as required by this section and shall continue the hearing to the time fixed for hearing objections to the proposed change.

      (2) No such change shall be made except after notice of intention to do so, given by at least one insertion in the newspaper in which the resolution of intention was published, describing the proposed change and specifying the time for hearing objections, which shall not be less than 30 days after publication of the notice. If the change proposed is one to include additional land in the district, a copy of such notice shall be mailed to each person to whom land proposed to be added is assessed as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, at the address of the person as shown on such roll, and to any person, whether owner in fee or having a lien upon, or legal or equitable interest in, any such lands whose name and address and a designation of the land in which the person is interested is on file in the office of the county clerk. Such notice shall be mailed at least 25 days prior to the time set for hearing objections.

      (3) Written objection to any proposed changes may be filed with the city recorder at any time up to the hour fixed for hearing objections to such changes. [1961 c.666 §18]

 

      376.770 Allowing claims for damages; payment. (1) At the hearing on the resolution of intention the legislative body may allow any claim for damages made pursuant to ORS 376.755 (2). Any such allowance shall be for the full amount of damages claimed in the written claim except that the legislative body, with the written consent of the claimant, may allow a claim for a lesser amount.

      (2) The right of any claimant to payment of the amount of any allowed claim shall be contingent upon the final establishment of the pedestrian mall but all allowed claims must be paid by the city, from such source as the legislative body may determine, before vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall, pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825. [1961 c.666 §20]

 

      376.775 Hearing objections, claims and protests; waiver; decision; continuations. (1) At the hearing all objections and protests shall be heard and considered, and all claims shall be heard and considered.

      (2) Any objections or protests, whether to the things proposed by the resolution of intention or to any changes proposed pursuant to ORS 376.765, not made at the time and in the manner provided by ORS 376.705 to 376.825 are deemed voluntarily waived, and the proceedings under ORS 376.705 to 376.825 shall not be attacked on any ground not stated in a written objection filed as provided in ORS 376.705 to 376.825.

      (3) Except in the case of a majority protest, as provided in ORS 376.760, the legislative body may sustain or deny any or all objections or protests and its determination is final.

      (4) The hearing may be continued from time to time by order entered on the minutes. [1961 c.666 §§15,19]

 

      376.780 Resolution after hearing; fixing boundaries. (1) Following the conclusion of the hearing, the legislative body shall by resolution either abandon the proceeding taken pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825 or determine that the pedestrian mall shall be established.

      (2) If assessments are to be levied as contemplated by ORS 376.735, then in the resolution provided for in subsection (1) of this section, the legislative body shall fix and establish the boundaries of the district as finally determined. [1961 c.666 §§21,25]

 

      376.785 Judicial proceedings to determine unsettled claims for damages; satisfaction prior to traffic prohibition. (1) If following the hearing the legislative body shall determine that the pedestrian mall shall be established, and if at that time there remain any written claims for damages which have not been allowed pursuant to ORS 376.770 or which have not been withdrawn, the legislative body shall direct that an action or actions be brought in the circuit court of the county in which the city is located in the name of the city by the city attorney, for a determination of the damages, if any, to which the claimant may legally be entitled because of the establishment of the pedestrian mall. Such action shall be in the nature of a proceeding in eminent domain for the condemnation of the right or rights in real property, the taking of which by the establishment of the pedestrian mall results in the damages claimed. In such action the amount set forth in the claim relating thereto shall not constitute a limitation upon the amount which may be pleaded, proved or recovered.

      (2) Except as may otherwise be provided in ORS 376.705 to 376.825, such action and proceeding shall be governed so far as the same may be made applicable by those provisions of ORS chapter 35 relating to actions and proceedings in eminent domain. In any such action the resolution adopted under ORS 376.780 (1) shall be conclusive evidence of the public necessity of the proposed pedestrian mall; that the property or rights in property to be taken are necessary therefor, and that the pedestrian mall is planned and located in the manner which will be compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.

      (3) The judgment in any such action shall be satisfied and a final order taken before vehicular traffic is prohibited, in whole or in part, on the pedestrian mall pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825. [1961 c.666 §§22,23]

 

      376.790 Assessment of damages and other expenses against benefited lands. After all claims for damages filed pursuant to ORS 376.755 (2) have been finally determined, by allowance by the legislative body, by withdrawal, or by a judgment in an action or actions brought pursuant to ORS chapter 35, and the full amount of damages to be paid has accordingly been finally determined, all or part of the total amount of such damages (but not exceeding such part thereof as may be specified in the resolution of intention), together with all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any proceedings or actions taken pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825, may be assessed against the lands within the district and subject to assessment in proportion to the benefits to be derived from the establishment of the pedestrian mall. [1961 c.666 §26]

 

      376.795 Manner of assessment; sale of bonds representing unpaid assessments. (1) Such assessment may be levied and bonds to represent unpaid assessments issued and sold substantially in the manner provided in ORS 223.005 to 223.105 and 223.205 to 223.930, and to the extent applicable, such law shall govern as to the preparation of the assessment, the lands subject to assessment, the hearing upon the assessment and the notice thereof, the confirmation and recordation of the assessment, the lien of the assessments, the notice of recordation, the collection of assessments, the issuance, sale and delivery of bonds upon unpaid assessments, the term of the bonds, the maximum interest rate thereon, the collection and enforcement of such bonds and all other matters to the extent applicable and except as provided in ORS 376.705 to 376.825.

      (2) In so applying the provisions of ORS 223.005 to 223.105 and 223.205 to 223.930, the following provisions and exceptions shall apply:

      (a) The limits provided by such law on the amount of the assessment shall not apply.

      (b) The legislative body shall provide for the form of the bonds and of the principal and interest coupons to be attached thereto.

      (c) The legislative body may provide that the redemption provision of the bonds shall require the payment of such premium as the legislative body may specify. [1961 c.666 §§27,28]

 

      376.800 Special fund for payment of damages and expenses; use of surplus. (1) All collections of assessments and all proceeds of the sale of bonds issued upon unpaid assessments shall be placed in a special fund and used exclusively for the payment of the damages, if any, and expenses for which the assessments were levied.

      (2) If there is a surplus in such special fund, the legislative body may expend such surplus for the improvement or operation of the pedestrian mall. [1961 c.666 §29]

 

      376.805 Payment of damages and other expenses from sources other than assessments and bonds. Notwithstanding the fact that the proceedings under ORS 376.705 to 376.825 have provided that assessments are to be levied as contemplated by ORS 376.735, the legislative body, at any time and either before or after the adoption of the resolution provided for in ORS 376.780 (1), may determine that such assessments shall not be levied. In lieu thereof the legislative body may provide for the payment of all or any part of the amounts referred to in ORS 376.790, out of general funds of the city or out of any other available funds. [1961 c.666 §30]

 

      376.810 Ordinance establishing mall; contents. Following the adoption of the resolution provided for in ORS 376.780 (1), and as soon as moneys have been fully provided for the payment of all claims, if any, allowed pursuant to ORS 376.770, and for the payment of all damages and compensation, if any, awarded in any action or actions brought pursuant to ORS chapter 35, the legislative body may adopt an ordinance establishing the pedestrian mall. Such ordinance shall contain:

      (1) A general description of the pedestrian mall and a declaration and determination that the same is finally established. The mall as finally established shall be substantially the same as that described in the resolution of intention.

      (2) Rules and regulations prohibiting vehicular traffic on such pedestrian mall subject to such exceptions as the ordinance may provide. Such rules and regulations and such exceptions shall be substantially in accordance with the statements made in the resolution of intention.

      (3) Such additional rules and regulations as the legislative body may determine pertaining to the interpretation, operation and enforcement of the rules and regulations referred to in subsection (2) of this section, and otherwise pertaining to the use, operation, maintenance of the pedestrian mall.

      (4) Such provisions as the legislative body may determine pertaining to the operative date or dates of any of such rules or regulations. [1961 c.666 §31]

 

      376.815 Adoption of ordinance; payment of claims, damages and compensation. (1) Such ordinance shall be adopted and published in the manner, and shall take effect, as provided by law or charter for other ordinances of the city. Such ordinance shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as other ordinances of the city.

      (2) No payment of allowed claims or damages or compensation awarded by any court shall be made until such ordinance is in effect but all such allowed claims, damages and compensation shall be paid before the rules and regulations provided in such ordinance become operative. [1961 c.666 §§32,33]

 

      376.820 Jurisdiction over mall; abandonment or modification. (1) Proceedings under ORS 376.705 to 376.825 and the adoption of such ordinance notwithstanding, the city and its legislative body shall retain its police powers and other rights and powers relating to the city streets constituting a part of the pedestrian mall. No action taken pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825 shall be interpreted or construed to be a vacation or abandonment, in whole or in part, of any city street or any right therein, it being intended that the establishment of a pedestrian mall pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825 be a matter of regulation only.

      (2) Nothing in ORS 376.705 to 376.825 shall be interpreted or construed to prevent the city and its legislative body, at any time subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance provided for in ORS 376.705 to 376.825, from abandoning the operation of the pedestrian mall, from changing the extent of the pedestrian mall, or from changing or repealing any of the rules and regulations pertaining to the pedestrian mall. [1961 c.666 §34]

 

      376.825 Improvements on mall; payment of costs. (1) The city and its legislative body shall have the power to improve a pedestrian mall as provided in ORS 376.720 (1)(d), and for the accomplishment, in whole or in part, of that purpose may use ORS 223.005 to 223.105 and 223.205 to 223.930 or any similar special assessment law. Any work or improvement permitted by such statutes shall be deemed to be work or improvement permitted to be done under any such Act or law. The city may also pay the whole or any part of the cost and expenses of improving a pedestrian mall from its general funds or from any other available money and may let contracts for the work in any manner permitted by law or charter.

      (2) A pedestrian mall established or to be established pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825 may be so improved either concurrently with the proceedings taken under ORS 376.705 to 376.825 for the establishment of the pedestrian mall or at any time subsequent to the establishment of the city mall, but no contract for the work or improvement shall be awarded until moneys have been fully provided for the payment of all claims allowed pursuant to ORS 376.770 and for the payment of all damages and compensation, if any, awarded in any action or actions brought pursuant hereof. If in connection with the establishment of a pedestrian mall and concurrently with the proceedings taken pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825, the legislative body proposes to improve the proposed pedestrian mall and for that purpose uses ORS 223.005 to 223.105 and 223.205 to 223.930 or any similar special assessment law, the legislative body may combine any part of the proceedings taken pursuant to ORS 376.705 to 376.825 with any part of the proceedings taken under any such special assessment law, to the end that duplication of ordinances, resolutions, notices, hearings and other acts or proceedings may be avoided. [1961 c.666 §§35,36]
