Whenever any person, firm or corporation, including any public, municipal or private corporation and any privately or publicly owned utility or cooperative association, desires to dig up, cut down, injure, destroy or in any manner remove any trees growing upon the right of way of any state highway, such person shall file with the Department of Transportation an application in writing, setting forth the reasons and purpose for the removal or destruction of the trees.

      (2) Such permits may be granted when it becomes necessary to cut or remove brush and tree growth which otherwise would be hazardous to the operation or maintenance of lines for the transmission of electric energy or communication, or which would impair the efficiency of the service of such lines to the public, but such cutting or removal shall be done in such manner as not substantially to impair the scenic beauty of the highway.

HISTORIC AND SCENIC HIGHWAYS

 

      377.100 Study of highway system; designation of historic and scenic highways. The Oregon Transportation Commission shall conduct a study of the historic, scenic and cultural values of the state highway system. The study required by this subsection is subject to the following:

      (1) In developing the study the commission shall appoint a volunteer citizen advisory committee to advise the commission on the study.

      (2) The study shall identify and evaluate areas of the state highway system for their historic, recreational or scenic significance.

      (3) The study shall designate highways, portions of highways or highway related structures as historic and scenic highways. [1983 c.552 §1; 1985 c.260 §1]

 

      377.105 Effect of designation as historic and scenic highway. When a highway, portion of a highway or highway related structure is designated as an historic and scenic highway under ORS 377.100, the Oregon Transportation Commission and the Department of Transportation:

      (1) Shall provide for the rehabilitation, restoration, maintenance and preservation of those features of the highway or structure that have historical, engineering, recreational, scenic or tourist related significance, whenever prudent and feasible.

      (2) May consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer, state historic organizations and other appropriate groups or organizations to determine how to best rehabilitate, restore, maintain and preserve the significant features of the highway or structure.

      (3) In all highway planning and funding considerations, shall provide for the continuance of the significant features of the highway or structure, whenever prudent and feasible.

      (4) As the commission determines appropriate, may arrange for and provide for posting of signs, consistent with ORS 377.700 to 377.844, 810.200 and 810.210, to inform the traveling public of the location and significant features of the highway or structure.

      (5) Shall not dismantle, destroy, abandon, significantly transform or sell the highway or structure or any portion thereof or take any other action that will adversely affect the preservation of the highway or structure as an historic and scenic highway when it is prudent or feasible not to take such action.

      (6) May provide for bypass highways to divert damaging traffic from use of the highway or structure or provide other means of limiting or diverting use of the highway or structure by damaging traffic.

      (7) Are directed to seek and may accept and use for the purposes of this section and ORS 377.100 contributions, gifts, grants and moneys from any source, public or private.

      (8) May hold hearings that have been given appropriate public notification before any significant action is taken relating to a highway, portion of a highway or highway related structure that is so designated.

      (9) Shall consider aesthetics and environmental effects when the only alternative to rehabilitation or restoration is to replace a portion of a highway or highway related structure so designated. [1983 c.552 §2; 1985 c.16 §461; 1985 c.260 §2]

      377.713 Compensation following partial or total loss of outdoor advertising sign; rules. (1) For purposes of this section:

      (a)(A) An owner of an outdoor advertising sign shall be considered to have suffered a total loss with respect to the outdoor advertising sign if, due to a highway construction project, the outdoor advertising sign is removed from its current location or the face of the outdoor advertising sign would be totally blocked in its current location.

      (B) An owner of an outdoor advertising sign shall be considered to have suffered a partial loss with respect to the outdoor advertising sign if, due to a highway construction project, the face of the outdoor advertising sign would be substantially but not totally blocked in its current location.

      (b) Full compensation for loss of an outdoor advertising sign equals the market value of the outdoor advertising sign, measured by comparable sales of outdoor advertising signs as determined by an appraiser recognized as a specialist in such valuations, less the salvage value of the components of the outdoor advertising sign.

      (2)(a) When the Department of Transportation determines that a highway construction project supervised by the department will result in the total or partial loss of an outdoor advertising sign, the department shall enter into negotiations with the owner of the outdoor advertising sign for relocation of the outdoor advertising sign.

      (b) The department may require the owner to provide information about the owner’s efforts to acquire a comparable location for the outdoor advertising sign.

      (c) The department may assist the owner’s efforts to acquire and obtain approval for a comparable location for the outdoor advertising sign.

      (3)(a) The department may enter into an agreement with the owner of an outdoor advertising sign for relocation of the outdoor advertising sign on any terms not prohibited by law or inconsistent with this section.

      (b) An agreement entered into under this subsection may not require the department to pay the owner of the outdoor advertising sign an amount in compensation that is greater than the actual cost to the owner of relocating the outdoor advertising sign.

      (4)(a) If, after reasonable efforts, the owner of an outdoor advertising sign subject to total or partial loss is unable to acquire a comparable location in the same market area for the outdoor advertising sign, except as provided in ORS 377.725 (4), the department shall pay the owner compensation as provided in this subsection.

      (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, for a total loss of an outdoor advertising sign, the department shall pay the owner full compensation for the loss and permanently cancel the sign permit, and the owner shall remove the sign.

      (c) For a total loss of an outdoor advertising sign in which a new site for the outdoor advertising sign is found at a less than comparable location, the department shall pay the owner the difference between the amount of full compensation for the loss and the market value of the outdoor advertising sign as located at the new site. If the new site is on a state highway, the owner may use the outdoor advertising sign’s existing permit issued under ORS 377.725 to apply for a relocation permit. If the new site is not on a state highway, the department shall permanently cancel the permit.

      (d) For a partial loss of an outdoor advertising sign, the department shall pay the owner the percentage of full compensation that is equal to the loss of market value due to the blockage of the sign’s face.

      (e) The department and the owner may enter into an agreement for partial or full compensation under this subsection in the form of additional relocation credits or other in-kind value.

      (5)(a) If the department and the owner of an outdoor advertising sign do not agree that a comparable location is available in the case of the total loss of an outdoor advertising sign, or do not agree to the amount of compensation offered by the department, the department shall provide written notice of the final offer of compensation to the owner.

      (b) The owner may appeal to the department the comparable location determination and the amount of compensation contained in the written notice. The hearing on the appeal shall be conducted as a contested case hearing under ORS chapter 183.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, in the case of the total loss of an outdoor advertising sign, the owner shall remove the outdoor advertising sign that is the subject of the written notice within 90 days after receipt of the notice.

      (6) Nothing in this section may be construed to require the department to take, and the department may not take or authorize, any action that would make the department ineligible to receive federal funds.

      (7) The department may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section. [2018 c.93 §46]

      (3) Each affidavit must be on a form prepared by the department. [1981 c.329 §2; 1987 c.336 §4; 1993 c.741 §55]

 

      377.725 Permit; application; fee; cancellation; rules. (1) A person may not erect, control, relocate or reconstruct an outdoor advertising sign unless the Department of Transportation has issued a permit for the erection, control, relocation or reconstruction of the sign.

      (2) A person who applies for a permit to the Director of Transportation shall complete forms furnished by the director. The permit application shall include a precise description of the outdoor advertising sign and such other information as the director considers necessary or desirable to determine compliance with ORS 377.700 to 377.844. The director shall issue a permit for an outdoor advertising sign that complies with ORS 377.700 to 377.844. A valid permit may be transferred to another person upon written notice to the director.

      (3) A permit may not be issued for an outdoor advertising sign located adjacent to an interstate highway or freeway unless the director determines that access to the outdoor advertising sign from the interstate highway or freeway can be obtained without violating the access control line of the interstate highway or freeway.

      (4) If an application for a permit to relocate or reconstruct an outdoor advertising sign is for a location identified in the current Statewide Transportation Improvement Program, the department shall require the applicant to execute an affidavit acknowledging the project and forgoing any claim for compensation under ORS 377.713.

      (5) A permit shall be renewed annually on the first day of January. Application for renewal of a permit shall be filed prior to expiration of the term of the permit. If application for renewal of a permit is filed within 30 days after the expiration of the term, the permit shall be granted if any additional fee specified by the department in rules adopted under ORS 377.729 is paid at the time the application is filed. Any permit not renewed in accordance with this section shall be canceled.

      (6) Permit fees for purposes of this section are as established by the department by rule under ORS 377.729.

      (8) The display surface of an outdoor advertising sign may be changed or cutouts may be attached or removed within the sign area without obtaining a permit. However, a permit shall be obtained if the outdoor advertising sign is reconstructed.

      (9) A reconstruction permit may be issued for the addition of another display surface on the opposite side of an existing, conforming outdoor advertising sign under permit, that is no larger than the existing display surface.

      (10) The director shall require removal of a sign or shall cancel a permit and require removal of an outdoor advertising sign as provided by ORS 377.775 if the director finds a sign or an outdoor advertising sign has been erected, maintained or serviced from the highway right of way at any portion of the right of way where the department has acquired rights of access to the highway or rights of access have not accrued to the abutting property. If there is no permit for the outdoor advertising sign, then the director shall require removal of the outdoor advertising sign. In addition, the department may recover from the owner of the sign or outdoor advertising sign or from the person erecting, maintaining or servicing the sign or outdoor advertising sign, the amount of damage to landscaping, sod, fencing, ditches or other highway appurtenances resulting from such acts. If a permit is canceled under this subsection, an outdoor advertising sign may not be relocated under ORS 377.767.

      (11)(a) The director may cancel a permit, unless a corrected application is filed or the outdoor advertising sign is brought into compliance within 30 days after written notice thereof is mailed to the permittee, if the director finds:

      (A) The applicant has knowingly supplied materially false or misleading information in the application for a permit or renewal thereof; or

      (B) The outdoor advertising sign covered by the permit violates ORS 377.700 to 377.844.

      (13) The director shall assign a permit plate with an identification number to the permit issued for an outdoor advertising sign. The permittee shall attach the permit plate to the outdoor advertising sign so the plate is visible from the adjacent state highway. The absence of a permit plate or failure to renew the permit annually is prima facie evidence that the outdoor advertising sign does not comply with ORS 377.700 to 377.844.

      (14) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 377.712, 377.753 and 377.765, no permits shall be issued for the erection of any new outdoor advertising sign after May 30, 2007.

      377.729 Fees for sign permits and business licenses; rules. The Department of Transportation may adopt rules establishing permit fees for purposes of ORS 377.725 and fees for an outdoor advertising business license issued under ORS 377.730.

[1985 c.553 §4; 1987 c.336 §1; 2001 c.750 §2]

A license granted under this section expires on June 30 of each year. The fee shall not be prorated. The director shall by certified mail send to each licensee a notice of expiration of license and a renewal application form not less than 30 days before the date of expiration.

      (3) If the director finds that an applicant has knowingly provided materially false or misleading information in the application or that a licensee has violated any of the provisions of ORS 377.700 to 377.844, the director may revoke, suspend for a period of up to one year or refuse to renew the license unless a corrected application is filed or the violation ceases, within 30 days after written notice to do so is mailed to the applicant or licensee. During the suspension of a license, the licensee may continue in business, but shall not erect or reconstruct any sign requiring a permit under ORS 377.700 to 377.844. [1971 c.770 §22; 1973 c.790 §5; 1993 c.741 §57; 2001 c.750 §3]

      Note: 377.737 was added to and made a part of 377.700 to 377.844 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      377.740 ORS 377.700 to 377.844 not intended to authorize signs prohibited by other governmental units. Nothing in ORS 377.700 to 377.844 and 377.992 is intended to permit a person to erect or maintain any sign that is prohibited by any governmental unit. [1971 c.770 §25]

Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, permits shall be issued at no cost to any city or county that applies or to any nonprofit or civic applicant approved by a city or county. Each permit entitles the holder of the permit to erect one sign in accordance with this section.

      (2) Each city may be given permits under this section entitling the city to erect signs that are visible from state highways and that are within the city limits or, pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with appropriate federal authorities, are no more than one mile outside of the city limits.

      (3) Each county may be given permits under this section entitling each unincorporated community identified in the county comprehensive plan, as defined in ORS 197.015, to erect signs that are visible from state highways and that are within one mile of the community growth boundary as designated by the county. The permits may be given directly to the county or, if the county governing body so authorizes, to an unincorporated community or a nonprofit or civic organization designated by the county governing body.

      377.757 Requirements for signs authorized by ORS 377.756; payment of cost of sign. (1) A sign authorized by ORS 377.756 shall not exceed 48 square feet in size and may not have a vertical or horizontal dimension of more than eight feet.

If appropriate federal authorities notify the Department of Transportation that the erection of a sign pursuant to any of the provisions of ORS 377.756 to 377.758 is contrary to any federal law, the department shall cease issuing permits and shall cause any signs erected pursuant to ORS 377.756 to 377.758 to be removed. [1987 c.631 §5; 2001 c.104 §128]

 

      377.759 Issuance of relocation credits for removal of outdoor advertising signs from scenic byway; rules. (1) The Department of Transportation shall administer an incentive program to encourage voluntary removal of outdoor advertising signs from particularly scenic areas of scenic byways.

      (2) An owner of an outdoor advertising sign that is visible from a scenic byway may apply to the department for participation in the incentive program. The sign and permit must meet the requirements of ORS 377.700 to 377.844 to qualify for relocation. A sign that is a nonconforming sign for a defect that cannot be remedied upon reconstruction at the same location does not qualify for the incentive program.

      (3) If the department determines that the sign is in a particularly scenic area of a scenic byway, the department shall notify the owner that the sign qualifies for the incentive program. If the owner chooses to remove the sign, the owner shall notify the department of the date by which the owner will remove the sign. The removal date must be not later than 90 days after the department’s notification.

      (4) The department shall issue two relocation credits to the owner in exchange for the removal of a qualified sign. If the owner also submits an application for relocation of the sign and permit under ORS 377.767, the department may issue the relocation permit and one relocation credit.

[2009 c.463 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 377.759.

 

      377.763 Consolidation of relocation credits. The owner of a relocation credit may combine relocation credits for outdoor advertising signs that have 249 square feet or less of display surface on one side to form a single relocation credit. After the relocation credits are combined, the Department of Transportation shall cancel the smaller relocation credits used to create the combined relocation credit. The first time an owner uses a combined relocation credit, the combined relocation credit is not restricted by the provisions of ORS 377.767 (4). [2009 c.463 §4]

Subject to the provisions of ORS 377.700 to 377.844, such signs may be maintained, reconstructed and relocated. However, such signs may not be relocated unless a relocation permit has been issued pursuant to ORS 377.767. A permit may not be issued to relocate an outdoor advertising sign that was not lawfully in existence on May 30, 2007, except that outdoor advertising signs that are visible from a road or street that is designated as a state highway after May 30, 2007, and that are lawfully located within a commercial or industrial zone at the time the road or street is designated as a state highway, may be relocated within the same section of highway.

      (2) All outdoor advertising signs that are lawfully located outside of a commercial or industrial zone and visible from an interstate highway or a primary highway shall be removed upon payment of just compensation as provided by ORS 377.780.

      (3) Upon payment of just compensation, the Department of Transportation may remove any lawful outdoor advertising sign located in a scenic area designated pursuant to ORS 377.505 to 377.540.

      (4) Outdoor advertising signs in existence on May 30, 2007, that are lawfully located outside of a commercial or industrial zone in existence on July 1, 1971, and visible from a secondary highway and not within a scenic area existing on July 1, 1971, or thereafter designated a scenic area may be removed only upon payment of just compensation as provided in ORS 377.780. Upon payment of just compensation, the department may remove the outdoor advertising sign. It may not be reconstructed or replaced if destroyed by natural causes and may not be relocated.

      (5) If a secondary highway existing on July 2, 1971, is subsequently designated as an interstate or primary highway, upon payment of just compensation, the department may remove outdoor advertising signs not conforming to the provisions of ORS 377.700 to 377.844.

      (6) If any other highway is designated as an interstate or primary highway, upon payment of just compensation, the department may remove a nonconforming outdoor advertising sign lawful before such designation but nonconforming thereafter.

      (7) Upon the construction or designation of a secondary highway, after July 2, 1971, an outdoor advertising sign lawfully in existence and not regulated under ORS 377.700 to 377.844 prior to such construction or designation is subject to subsection (4) of this section.

A permit or a relocation credit shall be issued for the relocation of a permitted outdoor advertising sign lawfully located within a commercial or industrial zone in existence on May 30, 2007, if the site lease for the sign is terminated for any reason. The existing outdoor advertising sign may be relocated within any commercial or industrial zone if the new sign and the new site comply with ORS 377.700 to 377.844, and upon the following conditions:

      (1) The outdoor advertising sign that is relocated may not have a sign size larger than that specified in the permit for the sign located on the site on which the lease was terminated. However, an outdoor advertising sign with 250 square feet or more of display surface on one side may be increased to the maximum size allowed by ORS 377.700 to 377.844 if the relocated sign is not visible from Interstate Highway 5, Interstate Highway 205, or Interstate Highway 84. A single-faced sign may be relocated as a back-to-back sign.

      (2) The site for the relocated sign is not within the distances set forth below, on the same side of the highway, from a site from which an outdoor advertising sign was purchased pursuant to the provisions of ORS 377.700 to 377.844.

      (3) If an outdoor advertising sign is relocated within a commercial or industrial zone that first came into existence after January 1, 1973, the site shall be within 750 feet of a developed commercial or industrial area, as measured parallel to the centerline of the highway. For purposes of this subsection, “developed commercial or industrial area” includes only the land occupied by a building, parking lot, storage area or processing area of a commercial or industrial use and on the same side of the highway.

      (4) A permit may not be issued to relocate an outdoor advertising sign more than 100 miles from the existing site of the sign as of May 30, 2007, as measured along public streets, roads or highways between that site and the proposed new site.

      (5) Outdoor advertising signs may not be relocated to a scenic byway. If a portion of a highway is no longer designated as a scenic byway, as provided by state and federal law, an outdoor advertising sign may be relocated to that portion subject to ORS 377.700 to 377.844 and 377.992 and any other limitations provided by law.

      (1) Issuance of a permit under ORS 377.767 to relocate an outdoor advertising sign for which a permit has been issued under ORS 377.725 does not cancel the original permit issued under ORS 377.725 except as provided in this section. The applicant for the permit to relocate shall surrender the original permit to the Director of Transportation upon issuance of the permit to relocate. Upon completion of the relocation of the outdoor advertising sign, including the removal of the sign structure from the original site, the person holding the permit for relocation of the sign shall immediately notify the director in writing.

      (2) The director shall retain any permit surrendered under subsection (1) of this section. If the director:

      (a) Is notified that the relocation of the outdoor advertising sign is completed within 180 days after the issuance of the permit for relocation, the director shall cancel the original permit.

      (b) Cancels the permit for relocation because the relocation of the outdoor advertising sign is not completed within 180 days as required under ORS 377.725, the director shall reinstate the original permit for the sign to the person whose permit for relocation of the sign is canceled.

      (3) A permit that is reinstated under subsection (2) of this section remains valid and retains all rights under ORS 377.725 of a permit that has not been surrendered under this section. [1979 c.146 §2; 1993 c.741 §59; 2007 c.199 §15; 2009 c.463 §9]

 

      377.770 Signs in protected, commercial or industrial areas. (1) Signs and outdoor advertising signs erected or maintained within protected areas shall comply with the sign rules for protected areas. If any provision of ORS 377.700 to 377.844 or rules adopted pursuant thereto are more restrictive than the sign rules for protected areas, the more restrictive provision or rule applies.

      (2) In addition to the requirements provided by subsection (1) of this section, and subject to ORS 377.505 to 377.540, 377.720, 377.725, 377.745, 377.750 and 377.767:

      (a) Outdoor advertising signs lawfully in existence on May 30, 2007, may be maintained, reconstructed or relocated within commercial or industrial zones. Within cities, an outdoor advertising sign may not be erected more than 660 feet from the nearest edge of the right of way if the sign is designed to be viewed primarily from a state highway.

      (b) The Legislative Assembly declares it is the paramount policy of this state to prohibit outdoor advertising signs visible to the traveling public from a state highway except those lawfully in existence on May 30, 2007, in commercial or industrial zones established on May 30, 2007, except as provided by ORS 377.753, 377.765 and 377.767.

      377.775 Removal procedure for noncomplying signs; ownership issues at hearing; disposition of removed signs; costs of removal. (1) Any sign that fails to comply with ORS 377.700 to 377.844 is a public and private nuisance. In addition to the penalties provided by ORS 377.992, such a sign may be removed by the Director of Transportation or the duly authorized representative of the director as provided by this section. The director may enter upon private property and remove the sign without incurring any liability therefor.

      (2) If a noncomplying sign does not bear the name and address of its owner or if the owner is not readily identified and located, the director may remove it immediately.

      (3)(a) If a noncomplying sign bears the name and address of its owner or if the owner of the sign is readily identified and located, the director shall notify the owner that the sign is in violation of ORS 377.700 to 377.844 and that the owner has 30 days from the date of the notice within which to make the sign comply, to remove the sign or to request a hearing before the director within the time specified in the notice.

      (b) If the sign is not made to comply or is not removed and if the owner does not request a hearing within the time required, or if the owner after a hearing fails to comply with the final order in the proceedings, the director or the duly authorized representatives of the director may remove and destroy or otherwise dispose of the sign.

      (4)(a) If the person who receives notice under subsection (3) of this section intends to raise issues regarding ownership interests in the sign or its appurtenances in a hearing requested under subsection (3) of this section, the request for hearing must include notice that the person intends to raise those issues and must contain the names and addresses of all persons who have ownership interests in the sign or its appurtenances.

      (b) If the person requesting the hearing under subsection (3) of this section fails to include notice of intent to raise issues regarding ownership interests, the person may not raise the issues in the hearing. In addition, the person who requested the hearing may not raise issues regarding ownership interests of any person whose name and address the person who requested the hearing has failed to provide as required by paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) For purposes of this subsection, an ownership interest includes, but is not limited to:

      (A) An interest in the land on which the sign is located, in the sign structure and in the display surface; and

      (B) A right to operate the sign, whether the right is created by lease, operating agreement or otherwise.

      (5)(a) The director shall, after removing a sign in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, place the sign in storage for 30 days while the director makes a further effort to find its owner.

      (b) If the owner cannot be found within 30 days, the director may, without incurring any liability therefor, destroy or otherwise dispose of the sign.

      (c) If the owner is found within 30 days, the owner may be required to remove the sign from storage.

      (d) If the owner is found at any time, the director may recover from the owner the cost of storage. The cost of storage is in addition to the cost of removal payable under subsection (6) of this section.

      (6) The owner is liable for, and the director shall collect, the costs of removing a sign. Costs shall be determined by the director on the basis of actual costs of removal or on a square-foot flat fee basis.

      (7) A hearing under this section shall be conducted as a contested case hearing under ORS chapter 183. [1971 c.770 §17; 1973 c.790 §13; 1977 c.265 §5; 1993 c.741 §61; 2001 c.508 §2; 2007 c.199 §18]

If the Department of Transportation has issued three or more final orders in a 12-month period finding that a person has violated one or more provisions of ORS 377.700 to 377.844, the Director of Transportation may file an action for injunctive relief to enjoin the person, or any other entity substantially controlled or directed by the person, from further violating ORS 377.700 to 377.844. The action may be filed in the Circuit Court for Marion County or in the circuit court of the county that is the principal place of business or residence of the person the director seeks to enjoin.

In determining value, the department shall use the accepted appraisal method customarily used in such cases or the method prescribed by federal regulations, if any, applicable to such appraisals or payments, whichever results in the lowest valuation. However, in any case, the department shall so appraise such signs or rights taken by whatever method may be required to avoid imposition of a reduction in the amount of federal highway funds the state otherwise would be eligible to receive.
