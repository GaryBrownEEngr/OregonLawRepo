However, no such hypothecation or pledge of revenues, or the issuance of the revenue bonds shall constitute in any manner, or to any extent be made to constitute, a general obligation of any county, city, town or port making the pledge.

 

      381.235 Formal requirements and conditions of bonds. Revenue bonds mentioned in ORS 381.230:

      (b) There may be included in determining such amount the costs and expenses in connection with the issuance and sale of the refunding revenue bonds, the premium, if any, to be paid on any of the revenue bonds to be refunded, the unpaid interest to accrue on the revenue bonds to be refunded prior to the retirement thereof, and the cost of any improvements to the bridge then determined by the governing authority to be necessary or advisable.

      (3) The refunding revenue bonds shall be secured in the same manner and be payable from the same source as the revenue bonds refinanced and redeemed as may be otherwise provided in the resolution adopted by the governing authority of the county, city, town or port, but in no event shall such refunding revenue bonds constitute general obligations of the county, city, town or port, nor an indebtedness or liability within the meaning of any constitutional limitation or provision. [1953 c.648 §2]

 

      381.239 Revenue bonds and refunding revenue bonds are negotiable instruments; not deemed general obligations of issuer. All revenue bonds and refunding revenue bonds issued under ORS 381.205 to 381.314 shall be negotiable instruments under the law merchant, notwithstanding they shall be payable solely from the revenues pledged for that purpose.

      381.240 Incurring indebtedness for bridge expenses; issuing voted bonds. Any and all of the counties, cities, towns or ports mentioned in ORS 381.205, independently or in conjunction with each other, may incur indebtedness and issue negotiable bonds therefor in order to obtain funds for the whole or any part of the cost of the construction, reconstruction, purchase, acquisition or maintenance of the bridges authorized by ORS 381.205 to 381.314 when so authorized by the electors of the county, city, town or port.

      381.275 Contracts made in name of authority authorizing work.

      381.302 Acquiring and operating interstate ferry by bridge authority as part of cost of acquiring interstate bridge. (1) Whenever any county, city, town or port mentioned in ORS 381.205, heretofore or hereafter determines through its governing authority to construct a bridge under ORS 381.205 to 381.314, it may, as a part of the cost of the bridge, include and acquire any then existing and operating ferry, with appurtenant properties, which the governing body determines to be serving the same area to be served by the proposed bridge and the continued operation of which would adversely affect the traffic on the bridge.

      (2) Any ferry thus acquired may be operated by the authority constructing such bridge free or on tolls, and if operated on tolls, the tolls charged shall be pledged to the payment of its revenue bonds and interest thereon issued on account of the bridge. Tolls thus collected shall be sufficient to meet all operating costs and expenses, including insurance, maintenance and a reasonable depreciation, and such payments as may have been determined by the governing authority to be necessary to apply on the amortization of the principal and interest of the revenue bonds during the period pending the completion and opening of the bridge.

      (3) Upon the opening of such bridge to traffic, and thereafter while the bridge is open to traffic, no ferry thus acquired shall operate. The property used in the operation of any such ferry may be sold or disposed of by the governing authority in such manner as will protect the bridge from the competition thereof.

      (4) Acquisition of any such ferry may be made upon such terms as the governing authority shall determine, and the acquisition price may be made payable not later than the time of the opening of the bridge.

      (5) Whenever the governing authority of the county, city, town or port determines to proceed in accordance with this section to acquire any ferry as a part of the cost of a bridge, and to thereafter operate such ferry as permitted by this section, it may do so regardless of whether such ferry operates from a point within the boundaries of the county, city, town or port, provided that there has been received a report of engineers indicating the advisability of the acquisition of such ferry in connection with the construction and operation of the bridge. [1953 c.648 §3]
