GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      383.001 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The development, improvement, expansion and maintenance of an efficient, safe and well-maintained system of roads, highways and other transportation facilities is essential to the economic well-being and high quality of life of the people of this state.

      (2) Public sources of revenues, including federal funding, to provide an efficient transportation system have not kept pace with the state’s growing population and growing transportation needs, and all available alternative sources of funding should be utilized to supplement available public sources of revenues.

      (3) Because public funding sources are not providing the state with sufficient funds to meet all of its transportation needs, private funding should be encouraged as an additional source of funding for transportation projects and facilities.

      (4) Various alternatives for utilizing the funds of private entities in the acquisition, design, construction, reconstruction, operation and maintenance of transportation facilities exist, including arrangements whereby private entities obtain exclusive agreements to design, build, own, lease or operate with private funds all or a portion of transportation projects and facilities in exchange for the right to receive certain revenues generated from the operation and utilization of such transportation projects and facilities.

      (5) Another important alternative for the funding of transportation facilities is the use of federal funds pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 129(a), as amended by section 112 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which established a program authorizing federal participation in construction of publicly or privately owned toll highways, bridges and tunnels.

      (6) The federal legislation allows for a mix of federal funding and private funding of transportation facilities, allowing the states to leverage available federal funds as a means for attracting private capital.

      (7) Legislation for the utilization of private funding of transportation facilities should be flexible enough to permit the Department of Transportation to obtain the advantages of any available alternative under which the acquisition, design, construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance and repair of transportation facilities can be financed in whole or in part or in combination by any available sources of private or public funding.

      (8) The funding of transportation facilities through the imposition of tolls on those who use such facilities is a fair and impartial means of assessing the costs of improvements against those who most benefit from such improvements, and is consistent with public policy.

      (9) Joint endeavors of public and private entities do the following:

      (a) Take advantage of private sector efficiencies in designing, constructing and operating transportation projects.

      (b) Allow for the rapid formation of capital necessary for funding transportation projects.

      (c) Require continued compliance with environmental requirements and applicable state and federal laws that all publicly financed projects must address. [1995 c.668 §1]

      383.013 Tollway design. (1) The design of each tollway shall at least meet the minimum design standards generally applicable, at the time the Department of Transportation authorizes the tollway, to the state and other units of government authorized to build and own roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, railways and related facilities.

      (2) In considering the design of a tollway, the department shall solicit the recommendation of all units of government having jurisdiction over any of the territory encompassing or adjacent to the proposed route of the tollway. The department shall consider the present and future needs of local transit authorities and whether the proposed tollway project should be expanded to include the acquisition of land or rights of way for future mass transit needs or for future expansion due to projected population growth.

      (3) In considering the design of a tollway, the department shall solicit the recommendation of state and local parks departments to consider whether parks or campsites for travelers or bicyclists should be incorporated into the tollway design. The department may enter into agreements for the use of state and local funding for the acquisition and construction of such parks and campsites. The land on which such parks and campsites shall be located may be owned or leased in any manner in which any other tollway property may be owned or leased and shall be managed by any entity chosen by the department for such purpose, including the entity that operates or maintains the tollway. The allocation of revenues derived from the ownership or operation of any park or campsite shall be in accordance with any arrangement the department deems desirable. [1995 c.668 §6; 2001 c.844 §3]

 

      383.014 Interstate system compatibility; rules. The Oregon Transportation Commission shall set standards by rule for electronic toll collection systems and photo enforcement systems used on tollways in this state to ensure that systems used in Oregon and systems used in the State of Washington are compatible to the extent technology permits. [2007 c.531 §8]

 

      383.015 Initiation of project; fees; rules; conditions for authorization; studies. (1) Tollway projects may be initiated by the Department of Transportation, by a unit of government having an interest in the installation of a tollway, or by a private entity interested in constructing or operating a tollway project. The department shall charge an administrative fee for reviewing and considering any tollway project proposed by a private entity, which the department shall establish by rule. All such administrative fees shall be deposited into the State Tollway Account.

      (2) The department shall adopt rules pursuant to which it will consider authorization of a tollway project. The rules shall require consideration of:

      (a) The opinions and interests of units of government encompassing or adjacent to the path of the proposed tollway project in having the tollway installed;

      (b) The probable impact of the proposed tollway project on local environmental, aesthetic and economic conditions and on the economy of the state in general;

      (c) The extent to which funding other than state funding is available for the proposed tollway project;

      (d) The likelihood that the estimated use of the tollway project will provide sufficient revenues to independently finance the costs related to the construction and future maintenance, repair and reconstruction of the tollway project, including the repayment of any loans to be made from moneys in the State Tollway Account;

      (e) With respect to tollway projects, any portion of which will be financed with state funds or department loans or grants:

      (A) The relative importance of the proposed tollway project compared to other proposed tollways; and

      (B) Traffic congestion and economic conditions in the communities that will be affected by competing tollway projects; and

      (f) The effects of tollway implementation on community and local street traffic.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 383.001 to 383.075, no tollway project shall be authorized unless the department finds that either:

      (a) Based on the department’s estimate of present and future traffic patterns, the revenues generated by the tollway project will be sufficient, after payment of all obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction and operation of such tollway project, to ensure the continued maintenance, repair and reconstruction of the tollway project without the contribution of additional public funds; or

      (b) The revenues generated by the tollway project will be at least sufficient to pay its operational expenses and a portion of the costs of its construction, maintenance, repair and reconstruction, and the importance of the tollway project to the welfare or economy of the state is great enough to justify the use of public funding for a portion of its construction, maintenance, repair and reconstruction.

      (4) If the department finds that a proposed tollway project qualifies for authorization under this section, the department may conduct or cause to be conducted any environmental, geological or other studies required by law as a condition of construction of the tollway project. The costs of completing the studies for any proposed tollway project may be paid from moneys in the State Tollway Account that are reimbursed from the permanent financing for the project. [1995 c.668 §7; 1997 c.390 §2; 2007 c.531 §17; 2013 c.4 §16]

 

      383.017 Awarding of contracts for tollway projects; rules for awarding rest area concessions; application of certain laws. (1) The Department of Transportation may award any contract, franchise, license or agreement related to a tollway project, other than a concession for the provision of goods or services at a rest area, under a competitive process or by private negotiation with one or more entities, or by any combination of competition and negotiation without regard to any other laws concerning the procurement of goods or services for projects of the state.

      (2) When using a competitive process for the award of a tollway project contract, the department shall consider the following factors in addition to the proposer’s estimate of cost:

      (a) The quality of the design, if applicable, submitted by a proposer. In considering the quality of the design of a tollway project, the department shall take into consideration:

      (A) The structural integrity of the design, including the probable effect of the design on the future costs of maintenance of the tollway;

      (B) The aesthetic qualities of the design, including such factors as the width of lane separators, landscaping and sound walls;

      (C) The traffic capacity of the design;

      (D) The aspects of the design that affect safety, such as the lane width, the quality of lane markers and separators, the shape and positioning of ramps and curves and the changes in elevation; and

      (E) The ease with which traffic will be able to pass through the toll collection facilities.

      (b) The extent to which small businesses will be involved in the tollway project. The department shall encourage participation by small businesses to the maximum extent the department determines is practicable. As used in this paragraph, “small business” means an independent business with fewer than 20 employees and with average annual gross receipts over the last three years not exceeding $1 million for construction firms and $300,000 for nonconstruction firms. “Small business” does not include a subsidiary or parent company belonging to a group of firms that are owned and controlled by the same individuals and that have average aggregate annual gross receipts in excess of $1 million for construction firms or $300,000 for nonconstruction firms over the last three years.

      (c) The financial stability of the proposer and the ability of the proposer to provide funding for the tollway project and surety for its performance and financial obligations with respect to the tollway project.

      (d) The experience of the proposer and its subcontractors in building and operating projects such as the tollway project.

      (e) The terms of the financial arrangement proposed or accepted by the proposer with respect to franchise fees, license fees, lease payments or operating expenses and the proposer’s required rate of return from its operation or maintenance of the tollway.

      (3)(a) The department may adopt rules and procedures for the award of franchises, licenses, leases or other concessions for rest areas without regard to any other laws concerning the procurement of goods or services for projects of the state. All such franchises, licenses, leases or other concessions shall require the franchisee, licensee, lessee or concessionaire, as applicable, to maintain the subject premises in accordance with all applicable state and federal health and safety standards, to maintain one or more policies of casualty and property insurance and adequate workers’ compensation insurance, and to pay and discharge all taxes, utilities, fees and other charges or claims that are levied, assessed or charged against the premises or concession or that may become a lien upon the premises. The rules shall encourage participation by small businesses to the maximum extent the department determines is practicable. The department may grant any small business a 10 percent or greater bid advantage in any bidding process for a concession.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “small business” means an independent business with fewer than 20 employees and with average annual gross receipts over the last three years not exceeding $300,000. “Small business” does not include a subsidiary or parent company belonging to a group of firms that are owned and controlled by the same individuals and that have average aggregate annual gross receipts in excess of $300,000 over the last three years. “Small business” also does not include a franchise of any business that has average aggregate annual gross receipts in excess of $300,000 over the last three years.

      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department may use any method for the award of any contract, franchise, license or agreement that is necessary to comply with the requirements of any grant or other funding source.

      (5) If public funds are involved in the project, construction of a tollway project shall be subject to the prevailing wage requirements of ORS 279C.800 to 279C.870.

      (6) For purposes of complying with applicable state and local land use laws, including statewide planning goals, comprehensive plans, land use regulations, ORS chapters 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 215, 221, 222 and 227, and any requirement imposed by the Land Conservation and Development Commission, a tollway project shall be treated as a project of the department and not as a project of any other person or entity.

      (7) Tollways, and any related facilities that would normally be purchased, constructed or installed by the department if the tollway were a conventional highway that was constructed and operated by the department, shall be exempt from ad valorem property taxation.

      (8) Tollways are considered state highways for purposes of law enforcement and application of the Oregon Vehicle Code. [1995 c.668 §8; 2003 c.794 §269]

 

      383.019 Agreements between department and private entities regarding maintenance of tollways. (1) Every agreement between the Department of Transportation and a private entity pursuant to which the private entity owns or operates a tollway and is entitled to collect the revenues therefrom shall require that the tollway be maintained in a safe condition and be returned to the state in a safe and serviceable condition without need of any repair or reconstruction.

      (2) Every agreement between the department and a private entity pursuant to which the private entity owns or operates a tollway and is entitled to collect the revenues therefrom shall provide for the establishment and funding of a maintenance, repair and reconstruction trust fund that is designed to ensure that adequate funds will be available to maintain and repair the tollway, so that the tollway will be surrendered to the department in good condition without need of repair or reconstruction.

(1) In accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 286A, the State Treasurer, at the request of the Department of Transportation, may issue revenue bonds for the purpose of financing a tollway project, provided that such bonds shall never constitute a debt or general obligation of the department or of this state or any of its political subdivisions, but shall be payable solely from the revenues, amounts, funds and accounts described in ORS 383.009 (3).

      (2) The proceeds of revenue bonds issued under this section may be used by the department or loaned to a private entity or a unit of government for the purpose of financing any portion of the capital costs related to the construction of a tollway project, including costs of the acquisition of interests in land upon which the tollway project will be constructed, to provide a financial reserve required under any federal funding agreement and for the payment of the costs of issuing the bonds and funding bond reserves.

      (3) The bonds authorized by this section may be issued as taxable bonds or as tax-exempt bonds under the income tax laws of the United States.

      (4) Notwithstanding the status of the bonds for federal income tax purposes, interest paid to the owners of the bonds shall be exempt from personal income taxes imposed by this state.

      (5) When issuing bonds authorized by this section, the department and the State Treasurer may make covenants with bondholders regarding the imposition and regulation of tolls, the making of loans and grants funded from the State Tollway Account, the use of amounts required to be deposited in the State Tollway Account and the issuance of additional bonds. [1995 c.668 §11; 2007 c.783 §177]

 

      383.025 Certain information provided to Department of Transportation exempt from disclosure.
