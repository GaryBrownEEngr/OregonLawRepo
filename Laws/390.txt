OUTDOOR RECREATION RESOURCES

 

      390.010 Policy of state toward outdoor recreation resources. The Legislative Assembly recognizes and declares:

      (1) It is desirable that all Oregonians of present and future generations and visitors who are lawfully present within the boundaries of this state be assured adequate outdoor recreation resources. It is desirable that all levels of government and private interests take prompt and coordinated action to the extent practicable without diminishing or affecting their respective powers and functions to conserve, develop, and utilize such resources for the benefit and enjoyment of all the people.

      (2) The economy and well-being of the people are in large part dependent upon proper utilization of the state’s outdoor recreation resources for the physical, spiritual, cultural, scientific and other benefits which such resources afford.

      (3) It is in the public interest to increase outdoor recreation opportunities commensurate with the growth in need through necessary and appropriate actions, including, but not limited to, the following:

      (a) Protection of existing and needed open spaces for appreciation, use and enjoyment of Oregon’s scenic landscape.

      (b) Provision of adequate land for outdoor recreation.

      (c) Preservation and restoration for public enjoyment and education of structures, objects, facilities and resources which are examples of Oregon history, archaeology and natural science.

      (e) Encouragement of outdoor activities such as festivals, fairs, and events relating to music, dance, drama, art and sports.

      (f) Expansion of facilities for camping, picnicking and lodging in or near recreational areas and along routes of travel.

      (5) It shall be the policy of the State of Oregon to supply those outdoor recreation areas, facilities and opportunities which are clearly the responsibility of the state in meeting growing needs; and to encourage all agencies of government, voluntary and commercial organizations, citizen recreation groups and others to work cooperatively and in a coordinated manner to assist in meeting total recreation needs through exercise of their appropriate responsibilities. [Formerly 184.310]

In addition to any other persons permitted to enforce violations, the State Parks and Recreation Department and any employee of the State Parks and Recreation Department specifically designated by the State Parks and Recreation Director may issue citations for park and recreation violations established under this chapter in the manner provided by ORS chapter 153. [1981 c.692 §2; 1981 c.798 §35; 1987 c.905 §21; 1999 c.1051 §98; 2011 c.597 §134]

      (1) “State park lottery bonds” means the bonds authorized to be issued under ORS 390.067 for the purpose of financing state park projects.

      (2) “State park projects” means projects for the acquisition, development, improvement, upgrading, preservation and expansion of the capacity of facilities of the system of state parks, including but not limited to parks, park facilities, ocean shores, scenic waterways, trails and historic sites in the State of Oregon. [1997 c.800 §3; 1999 c.44 §21]

 

      Note: 390.060 to 390.067 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 390 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      390.063 Lottery bonds for state park projects. The Legislative Assembly declares that the purpose of ORS 390.060 to 390.067 is to authorize lottery bonds for state park projects. The lottery bonds authorized by ORS 390.060 to 390.067 shall be issued pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585. The obligation of the State of Oregon with respect to the bonds and with respect to any grant agreement or other commitment authorized by ORS 267.334, 285B.410, 285B.422, 285B.482, 285B.530 to 285B.548 and 390.060 to 390.067 shall at all times be restricted to the availability of unobligated net lottery proceeds, proceeds of lottery bonds and any other amounts specifically committed by ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585. Neither the faith and credit of the State of Oregon nor any of its taxing power shall be pledged or committed to the payment of lottery bonds or any other commitment of the State of Oregon authorized by ORS 390.060 to 390.067. [1997 c.800 §1; 1999 c.44 §22; 2005 c.835 §31; 2007 c.783 §178a]

 

      Note: See note under 390.060.

 

      390.065 Findings; use of Oregon State Lottery proceeds. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Expenditures by visitors to Oregon state parks and by employees of the State Parks and Recreation Department currently contribute approximately $549 million each year to local economies throughout Oregon. The acquisition, development, improvement, upgrading, preservation and expansion of the capacity of facilities of the system of state parks, including parks, park facilities, ocean shores, scenic waterways, trails and historic sites in the State of Oregon, do and will accomplish the purpose of creating jobs and furthering economic development in Oregon by:

      (a) Increasing the capacity, usefulness and attractive qualities of public recreational facilities, thereby promoting travel and tourism in Oregon;

      (b) Generating business for and supporting the operations and prosperity of businesses located in the areas of the public recreational facilities; and

      (c) Creating employment opportunities within this state through the funding of development and improvement projects on which workers will be employed.

      (2) Based on the findings made in this section, the use of the net proceeds from the operation of the Oregon State Lottery to fund state park projects and to pay state park lottery bonds described in ORS 390.063 is an appropriate use of state lottery funds under section 4, Article XV of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 461.510. [1997 c.800 §2; 1999 c.44 §23]

 

      Note: See note under 390.060.

 

      390.067 Request for issuance of state park lottery bonds; Oregon Parks for the Future Fund; uses of fund. (1) State park lottery bonds shall be issued only at the request of the State Parks and Recreation Director. State park lottery bonds may be issued in an amount sufficient to provide no more than $105 million of net proceeds to pay costs of state park projects, plus the amounts required to pay bond-related costs.

      (2) The Oregon Parks for the Future Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. The net proceeds from the sale of the state park lottery bonds which are available to pay costs of state park projects shall be credited to the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund. Investment earnings on amounts in the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund shall be credited to the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund. All moneys from time to time credited to the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund, including any investment earnings, are appropriated continuously to the State Parks and Recreation Department only for payment of costs of state park projects and for payment of bond-related costs that are allocable to state park lottery bonds. Amounts in the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund shall be disbursed upon the written request of the State Parks and Recreation Director to pay for costs of state park projects pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, and upon the written request of the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services to pay for bond-related costs that are allocable to state park lottery bonds.

      (3) The State Parks and Recreation Director shall apply amounts in the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund to pay costs of state park projects. The State Parks and Recreation Director may make and administer contracts to carry out state park projects. In addition, the director may enter into agreements with any state agency or local government that commits the State Parks and Recreation Department to pay anticipated funds from the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund to the agency or local government for state park projects. Agreements under this subsection may, subject to the provisions of this section, provide for the remittance of the moneys on such periodic basis, in such amounts, over such period of years and with such priority over other commitments of such funds as the director shall specify in the agreements. The obligation of the state and the department to provide funds under any such agreement shall be subject to the availability of amounts in the Oregon Parks for the Future Fund and any other amounts lawfully available to the State Parks and Recreation Department. The State Parks and Recreation Department and any agency or local government receiving proceeds of state park lottery bonds shall, if so directed by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, take any action specified by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services which is necessary to maintain the excludability of lottery bond interest from gross income under the United States Internal Revenue Code. [1997 c.800 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 390.060.

 

      Note: Section 32, chapter 748, Oregon Laws 2017, provides:

      Sec. 32. Oregon Main Street Revitalization Grant Program. (1) For the biennium beginning July 1, 2017, at the request of the State Parks and Recreation Department, the State Treasurer may issue lottery bonds pursuant to ORS 286A.560 to 286A.585 in an amount that does not exceed $5 million in net proceeds for the purposes described in subsection (2) of this section, plus an additional amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be necessary to pay bond-related costs.

      (2) Net proceeds of lottery bonds issued under this section in an amount sufficient to provide $5 million in net proceeds and interest earnings must be transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department for deposit into the Oregon Main Street Revitalization Grant Program Fund established in ORS 390.264 to provide grants pursuant to ORS 390.262.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly finds that the use of proceeds of lottery bonds issued pursuant to this section will create jobs, further economic development and enhance the economic vitality of Oregon downtowns and local communities by supporting projects that revitalize historic downtown commercial districts, redevelop and reuse existing buildings, facilitate small business relocation and expansion initiatives and provide assistance, training and technical services.

      390.314 Legislative findings and policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that, to protect and preserve the natural, scenic and recreational qualities of lands along the Willamette River, to preserve and restore historical sites, structures, facilities and objects on lands along the Willamette River for public education and enjoyment and to further the state policy established under ORS 390.010, it is in the public interest to develop and maintain a natural, scenic, historical and recreational greenway upon lands along the Willamette River to be known as the Willamette River Greenway.

      (2) In providing for the development and maintenance of the Willamette River Greenway, the Legislative Assembly:

      (a) Recognizing the need for coordinated planning for such greenway, finds it necessary to provide for development and implementation of a plan for such greenway through the cooperative efforts of the state and units of local government.

      (b) Recognizing the need of the people of this state for existing residential, commercial and agricultural use of lands along the Willamette River, finds it necessary to permit the continuation of existing uses of lands that are included within such greenway; but, for the benefit of the people of this state, also to limit the intensification and change in the use of such lands so that such uses shall remain, to the greatest possible degree, compatible with the preservation of the natural, scenic, historical and recreational qualities of such lands.

Such plan or segment filed as required by this subsection shall be retained in the office of the county recording officer open for public inspection during reasonable business hours.

      (3) If the plan for the Willamette River Greenway is prepared and approved in segments, the total of all such approved segments shall constitute the plan for the Willamette River Greenway for the purposes of ORS 390.310 to 390.368.

Upon a change in the use of any such lands from farm use, the department may acquire scenic easements in such lands as provided in subsection (1) of this section. Nothing in this subsection is intended to limit the power of the department to acquire, by any means other than the exercise of the power of eminent domain, a scenic easement on lands described in this subsection while such lands are devoted to such farm use.

      (2) If any land acquired by the department under subsection (1) or (4) of this section is a part of a larger tract of land devoted to farm use on the date of the acquisition of such portion of the tract and such acquisition would render uneconomic an otherwise economic farming unit on the whole tract of land, upon the request of the owner of such tract of land, the department shall purchase the entire tract of land. The department shall, whenever practicable, acquire the remainder of any such tract of land with state funds so that the subsequent disposition of any such land will not be subject to restrictions imposed under agreements made for the receipt of nonstate funds otherwise available for the acquisition of such lands.

      (3) The department may dispose of lands acquired pursuant to subsection (2) of this section that are located outside the boundaries of the Willamette River Greenway as it considers advisable.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 390.121, the department may only acquire, by any means other than the exercise of eminent domain, for state parks and recreation areas, lands and interests in lands that are situated within the boundaries of the Willamette River Greenway and that are situated outside the boundaries of the parcels of land described in section 8a, chapter 558, Oregon Laws 1973.

      (a) As a part of the compensation, in valuing such lands as a whole, paid for any such lands acquired without condemnation proceedings initiated as provided in ORS 35.235, the estimated market value of economically extractable subsurface mineral aggregate deposits of reasonably foreseeable demand known to exist in such lands or shown by the owner to exist in such lands.

      (b) As a part of the compensation and damages, if any, in valuing such lands as a whole, for the appropriation of any such lands, acquired by the department after the commencement of condemnation proceedings under ORS 35.235 but not pursuant to an award in a condemnation action initiated under ORS 35.245, the estimated market value of economically extractable subsurface mineral aggregate deposits of reasonably foreseeable demand agreed upon by the department and the owner of lands so acquired.

      (c) As a part of the true value and damages, in valuing such lands as a whole, for the appropriation of such lands acquired by award in a condemnation action initiated under ORS 35.245, the estimated market value of economically extractable subsurface mineral aggregate deposits of reasonably foreseeable demand alleged in the answer of the defendant made pursuant to ORS 35.295 and proved by the defendant as a matter of defense to be a part of the true value of such lands so acquired.

      (6) This section does not apply to the acquisition of any lands or interests therein acquired for state parks or recreation areas prior to October 5, 1973, and to any lands or interests in land subject to a legally enforceable option held by the state on October 5, 1973, for the purposes of the acquisition of such lands or interests for state parks and recreation areas.

(1) The Legislative Assembly hereby declares it is the public policy of the State of Oregon to forever preserve and maintain the sovereignty of the state heretofore legally existing over the ocean shore of the state from the Columbia River on the north to the Oregon-California line on the south so that the public may have the free and uninterrupted use thereof.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that over the years the public has made frequent and uninterrupted use of the ocean shore and recognizes, further, that where such use has been legally sufficient to create rights or easements in the public through dedication, prescription, grant or otherwise, that it is in the public interest to protect and preserve such public rights or easements as a permanent part of Oregon’s recreational resources.

      (3) Accordingly, the Legislative Assembly hereby declares that all public rights or easements legally acquired in those lands described in subsection (2) of this section are confirmed and declared vested exclusively in the State of Oregon and shall be held and administered as state recreation areas.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly further declares that it is in the public interest to do whatever is necessary to preserve and protect scenic and recreational use of Oregon’s ocean shore. [1967 c.601 §§1,2(1),(2),(3); 1969 c.601 §4]

SCENIC WATERWAYS

 

      390.805 Definitions for ORS 390.805 to 390.925. As used in ORS 390.805 to 390.925, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Related adjacent land” means all land within one-fourth of one mile of the bank on the side of Waldo Lake, or a river or segment of river within a scenic waterway, except land that, in the State Parks and Recreation Department’s judgment, does not affect the view from the waters within a scenic waterway.

      (2) “Scenic easement” means the right to control the use of related adjacent land, including airspace above such land, for the purpose of protecting the scenic view from waters within a scenic waterway; but such control does not affect, without the owner’s consent, any regular use exercised prior to the acquisition of the easement, and the landowner retains the right to uses of the land not specifically restricted by the easement.

      (3) “Scenic waterway” means Waldo Lake, or a river or segment of river that has been designated as such in accordance with ORS 390.805 to 390.925 or any subsequent Act, and includes related adjacent land. [1971 c.1 §2; 1981 c.787 §55; 1983 c.334 §1; 1983 c.642 §10; 1989 c.904 §25; 1995 c.79 §203; 2001 c.104 §132]

 

      390.815 Policy; establishment of system. The people of Oregon find that many of the free-flowing rivers of Oregon and Waldo Lake and lands adjacent to such lake and rivers possess outstanding scenic, fish, wildlife, geological, botanical, historic, archaeologic, and outdoor recreation values of present and future benefit to the public. The people of Oregon also find that the policy of permitting construction of dams and other impoundment facilities at appropriate sections of the rivers of Oregon and Waldo Lake needs to be complemented by a policy that would preserve Waldo Lake and selected rivers or sections thereof in a free-flowing condition and would protect and preserve the natural setting and water quality of the lake and such rivers and fulfill other conservation purposes. It is therefore the policy of Oregon to preserve for the benefit of the public Waldo Lake and selected parts of the state’s free-flowing rivers. For these purposes there is established an Oregon Scenic Waterways System to be composed of areas designated in accordance with ORS 390.805 to 390.925 and any subsequent Acts. [1971 c.1 §1; 1983 c.334 §2]

      Note: 390.827 was enacted into law but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 390 or any series therein by law. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      390.835 Highest and best use of waters within scenic waterways; prohibitions; authority of various agencies; water rights; conditions; recreational prospecting; placer mining. (1) It is declared that the highest and best uses of the waters within scenic waterways are recreation, fish and wildlife uses. The free-flowing character of these waters shall be maintained in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife uses. No dam, or reservoir, or other water impoundment facility shall be constructed on waters within scenic waterways. No water diversion facility shall be constructed or used except by right previously established or as permitted by the Water Resources Commission, upon a finding that such diversion is necessary to uses designated in ORS 536.310 (12), and in a manner consistent with the policies set forth under ORS 390.805 to 390.925. The Water Resources Commission shall administer and enforce the provisions of this subsection.

      (2) Filling of the beds or removal of material from or other alteration of the beds or banks of scenic waterways for purposes other than recreational prospecting not requiring a permit shall be prohibited, except as permitted by the Director of the Department of State Lands upon a finding that such activity would be consistent with the policies set forth under ORS 390.805 to 390.925 for scenic waterways and in a manner consistent with the policies set forth under ORS 196.800 to 196.825 and 196.845 to 196.870 for removal of material from the beds and banks and filling of any waters of this state. The Director of the Department of State Lands shall administer and enforce the provisions of this subsection.

      (3)(a) Upon a finding of emergency circumstances, the Director of the Department of State Lands may issue a temporary permit for the removal, filling or alteration of the beds or banks within a scenic waterway. The temporary permit shall include conditions developed after consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the State Parks and Recreation Department.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “emergency circumstances” exist if prompt action is necessary to prevent irreparable harm, injury or damage to persons or property.

      (4) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the grant or denial of a permit under subsection (2) or (3) of this section may appeal in accordance with the procedure set forth in ORS 196.835.

      (5) Nothing in ORS 390.805 to 390.925 affects the authority of the State Fish and Wildlife Commission to construct facilities or make improvements to facilitate the passage or propagation of fish or to exercise other responsibilities in managing fish and wildlife resources. Nothing in ORS 390.805 to 390.925 affects the authority of the Water Resources Commission to construct and maintain stream gauge stations and other facilities related to the commission’s duties in administration of the water laws.

      (6) Upon a finding of necessity under subsection (1) of this section, the Water Resources Commission may issue a water right for human consumption not to exceed 0.005 cubic feet per second per household, or livestock consumption uses not to exceed one-tenth of one cubic foot per second per 1,000 head of livestock, as designated in ORS 536.310 (12) within or above a scenic waterway if the Water Resources Commission makes the following findings:

      (a) That issuing the water right does not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife.

      (b) That issuing the water right is consistent with provisions pertaining to water appropriation and water rights under ORS chapters 536 and 537 and rules adopted thereunder.

      (c) That construction, operation and maintenance of the diversion system will be carried out in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in ORS 390.805 to 390.925.

      (d) If the water right is for human consumption, an additional finding that:

      (A) The applicant cannot reasonably obtain water from any other source;

      (B) Denial of the water right would result in loss of reasonable expectations for use of the property; and

      (C) The system installed to divert water shall include monitoring equipment to permit water use measurement and reporting.

      (e) If the water right is for livestock consumption, an additional finding that:

      (A) The right is necessary to prevent the livestock from watering in or along the stream bed;

      (B) The applicant cannot reasonably obtain water from any other source; and

      (C) The applicant has excluded livestock from the stream and its adjacent riparian zone.

      (7) In making the findings required under subsection (6) of this section, the Water Resources Commission shall consider the existing or potential cumulative impacts of issuing the water right.

      (8) The Water Resources Commission may not allow human consumption and livestock uses authorized under subsection (6) of this section in excess of a combined cumulative total of one percent of the average daily flow or one cubic foot per second, whichever is less, unless:

      (a) The Water Resources Commission, the State Parks and Recreation Department, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of State Lands unanimously agree to exceed that amount; and

      (b) Exceeding that amount will not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife.

      (9)(a) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a water right application for the use of ground water as defined in ORS 537.515, except upon a finding by the Water Resources Director based on a preponderance of evidence that the use of ground water will measurably reduce the surface water flows necessary to maintain the free-flowing character of a scenic waterway in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife.

      (b) The Water Resources Department shall review every application for the use of ground water to determine whether to make the finding specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The finding shall be based upon the application of generally accepted hydrogeologic methods using relevant and available field information concerning the proposed use.

      (c) In making the determination required by paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Water Resources Department shall consider the timing of projected impacts of the proposed use in relation to other factors, including but not limited to: Changing climate, recharge, incidental precipitation, out-of-stream appropriations and return flows.

      (d) If the Water Resources Director makes the finding specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Water Resources Director shall issue an order denying the application unless:

      (A) Mitigation is provided in accordance with subsection (10) of this section; or

      (B) The applicant submits evidence to overcome the finding under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (e) Except as provided under subsection (13) of this section, if the Water Resources Director does not make the finding specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Water Resources Director shall issue an order approving the application if the application otherwise meets the requirements of ORS 537.505 to 537.795.

      (f) A protest of any order issued under this subsection may be filed in the same manner as a protest on any application for a right to appropriate ground water.

      (g) Each water right permit and certificate for appropriation of ground water issued after July 19, 1995, for which a source of appropriation is within or above a scenic waterway shall be conditioned to allow the regulation of the use if analysis of data available after the permit or certificate is issued discloses that the appropriation will measurably reduce the surface water flows necessary to maintain the free-flowing character of a scenic waterway in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife in effect as of the priority date of the right or as those quantities may be subsequently reduced.

      (h) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the use of ground water for a use exempted under ORS 537.545.

      (10) The Water Resources Commission or Water Resources Director shall consider mitigation measures and may include mitigation measures as conditions in any water right permit or certificate to ensure the maintenance of the free-flowing character of the scenic waterway in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife.

      (11) The Water Resources Commission and the Water Resources Director shall carry out their responsibilities under ORS 536.220 to 536.590 with respect to the waters within scenic waterways in conformity with the provisions of this section.

      (12) As used in this section, “measurably reduce” means that the use authorized under subsection (9) of this section will individually or cumulatively reduce surface water flows within the scenic waterway in excess of a combined cumulative total of one percent of the average daily flow or one cubic foot per second, whichever is less, unless:

      (a) The Water Resources Department, the State Parks and Recreation Department, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of State Lands unanimously agree to exceed that amount; and

      (b) Exceeding that amount will not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife.

      (13) Before authorizing an appropriation that will reduce streamflows within a scenic waterway in amounts up to but not exceeding the amounts described in subsection (12) of this section, the Water Resources Director shall find:

      (a) That the appropriation will not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife.

      (b) That the appropriation is consistent with provisions pertaining to water appropriations and water rights under ORS chapters 536 and 537 and the rules adopted thereunder.

      (c) That construction, operation and maintenance of the appropriation will be carried out in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in ORS 390.805 to 390.925.

      (14) No placer mining shall be permitted on waters within scenic waterways other than recreational placer mining.

      (15) No person shall be required to obtain a permit for recreational prospecting resulting in the fill, removal or other alteration of less than one cubic yard of material at any one individual site and, cumulatively, not more than five cubic yards of material from within the bed or wet perimeter of any single scenic waterway in a single year. Recreational prospecting shall not occur at any site where fish eggs are present.

      (16) No provision of this section shall be construed to exempt recreational placer mining on a scenic waterway, other than recreational prospecting not requiring a permit, from compliance with the provisions of ORS 196.800 to 196.825 and 196.845 to 196.870 or rules adopted pursuant to ORS 196.800 to 196.825 and 196.845 to 196.870.

      Sec. 4. Notwithstanding ORS 390.835, a permit or temporary permit for dredging issued by the Department of State Lands for the purpose of recreational placer mining within a scenic waterway is not valid after December 31, 2003, if the review described in section 3 of this 2001 Act has been completed and reported to the Seventy-second Legislative Assembly or, if the review has not been completed and reported to the Seventy-second Legislative Assembly, after December 31, 2005. [2001 c.499 §4]

 

      390.845 Administration of scenic waterways and related adjacent lands; limitations on use; condemnation; rules. (1) Except as provided in ORS 390.835, scenic waterways shall be administered by the State Parks and Recreation Department, each in such manner as to protect and enhance the values which caused such scenic waterway to be included in the system. In such administration primary emphasis shall be given to protecting the aesthetic, scenic, fish and wildlife, scientific and recreation features, based on the special attributes of each area.

      (2) After consultation with the State Board of Forestry, the State Department of Agriculture and the affected counties and with the concurrence of the Water Resources Commission, the department shall adopt rules governing the management of related adjacent land. Such rules shall be adopted in accordance with ORS chapter 183. Such rules shall reflect management principles, standards and plans applicable to scenic waterways, their shore lines and related adjacent land and, if necessary, establish varying intensities of protection or development based on special attributes of each area. Such management principles, standards and plans shall protect or enhance the aesthetic and scenic values of the scenic waterways and permit compatible agricultural, forestry and other land uses. Specifically, and not in limitation of the foregoing, such rules shall provide that:

      (a) No roads, railroads or utilities shall be constructed within any scenic waterway except where necessary to serve the permissible uses, as defined in subsection (2) of this section and in the rules of the department, of the related adjacent land or unless department approval of such use is obtained as provided in subsection (4) or (5) of this section. The department wherever practicable shall require the sharing of land and airspace by such roads, railroads and utilities. All permissible roads, railroads and utilities shall be located in such a manner as to minimize the disturbance of the natural beauty of a scenic waterway;

      (b) Forest crops shall be harvested in such manner as to maintain as nearly as reasonably is practicable the natural beauty of the scenic waterway;

      (c) Occupants of related adjacent land shall avoid pollution of waters within a scenic waterway;

      (d) The surface of related adjacent land shall not be disturbed for prospecting or mining unless the department’s approval is obtained under subsection (4) or (5) of this section; and

      (e) Unless department approval of the proposed use is obtained under subsection (4) or (5) of this section, no commercial, business or industrial structures or buildings other than structures or buildings erected in connection with an existing use shall be erected or placed on related adjacent land. All structures and buildings erected or placed on such land shall be in harmony with the natural beauty of the scenic waterway and shall be placed a sufficient distance from other structures or buildings so as not to impair substantially such natural beauty. No signs or other forms of outdoor advertising that are visible from waters within a scenic waterway shall be constructed or maintained.

      (3) No person shall put related adjacent land to uses that violate ORS 390.805 to 390.925 or the rules of the department adopted under ORS 390.805 to 390.925 or to uses to which the land was not being put before December 3, 1970, or engage in the cutting of trees, or mining, or prospecting on such lands or construct roads, railroads, utilities, buildings or other structures on such lands, unless the owner of the land has given to the department written notice of such proposed use at least one year prior thereto and has submitted to the department with the notice a specific and detailed description of such proposed use or has entered into agreement for such use with the department under subsection (5) of this section. The owner may, however, act in emergencies without the notice required by ORS 390.805 to 390.925 when necessary in the interests of public safety.

      (4) Upon receipt of the written notice provided in subsection (3) of this section, the department shall first determine whether in its judgment the proposed use would impair substantially the natural beauty of a scenic waterway. If the department determines that the proposal, if put into effect, would not impair substantially the natural beauty of the scenic waterway, the department shall notify in writing the owner of the related adjacent land that the owner may immediately proceed with the proposed use as described to the department. If the department determines that the proposal, if put into effect, would impair substantially the natural beauty of the scenic waterway, the department shall notify in writing the owner of the related adjacent land of such determination and no steps shall be taken to carry out such proposal until at least one year after the original notice to the department. During such period:

      (a) The department and the owner of the land involved may agree upon modifications or alterations of the proposal so that implementation thereof would not in the judgment of the department impair substantially the natural beauty of the scenic waterway; or

      (b) The department may acquire by purchase, gift or exchange, the land involved or interests therein, including scenic easements, for the purpose of preserving the natural beauty of the scenic waterway.

      (5) The department, upon written request from an owner of related adjacent land, shall enter into negotiations and endeavor to reach agreement with such owner establishing for the use of such land a plan that would not impair substantially the natural beauty of the scenic waterway. At the time of such request for negotiations, the owner may submit a plan in writing setting forth in detail proposed uses. Three months after the owner makes such a request for negotiations with respect to use of land, either the department or the owner may give written notice that the negotiations are terminated without agreement. Nine months after the notice of termination of negotiations the owner may use land in conformity with any specific written plan submitted by the owner prior to or during negotiations. In the event the department and the owner reach agreement establishing a plan for land use, such agreement is terminable upon at least one year’s written notice by either the department or the owner.

      (6) With the concurrence of the Water Resources Commission, the department may institute condemnation proceedings and by condemnation acquire related adjacent land:

      (a) At any time subsequent to nine months after the receipt of notice of a proposal for the use of such land that the department determines would, if carried out, impair substantially the natural beauty of a scenic waterway unless the department and the owner of such land have entered into an agreement as contemplated by subsection (4) or (5) of this section or the owner shall have notified the department of the abandonment of such proposal; or

      (b) At any time related adjacent land is used in a manner violating ORS 390.805 to 390.925, the rules of the department or any agreement entered into by the department pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of this section; or

      (c) At any time related adjacent land is used in a manner which, in the judgment of the department, impairs substantially the natural beauty of a scenic waterway, if the department has not been given at least one year’s advance written notice of such use and if there is not in effect department approval of such use pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of this section.

      (7) In such condemnation the owner of the land shall not receive any award for the value of any structure, utility, road or other improvement constructed or erected upon the land after December 3, 1970, unless the department has received written notice of such proposed structure, utility, road or other improvement at least one year prior to commencement of construction or erection of such structure, utility, road or other improvement or unless the department has given approval for such improvement under subsection (4) or (5) of this section. If the person owned the land on December 3, 1970, and for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately prior thereto, the person shall receive no less for the land than its value on December 3, 1970. The department shall not acquire by condemnation a scenic easement in land. When the department acquires any related adjacent land that is located between a lake or river and other land that is owned by a person having the right to the beneficial use of waters in the river by virtue of ownership of the other land:

      (a) The right to the beneficial use of such waters shall not be affected by such condemnation; and

      (b) The owner of the other land shall retain a right of access to the lake or river necessary to use, store or divert such waters as the owner has a right to use, consistent with concurrent use of the land so condemned as a part of the Oregon Scenic Waterways System.

      (8) Any owner of related adjacent land, upon written request to the department, shall be provided copies of rules then in effect or thereafter adopted by the department pursuant to ORS 390.805 to 390.925.

      (9) The department shall furnish to any member of the public upon written request and at expense of the member a copy of any notice filed pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.

      (10) If a scenic waterway contains lands or interests therein owned by or under the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe, the United States, another state agency or local governmental agency, the department may enter into agreement with the tribe or the federal, state or local agency for the administration of such lands or interests therein in furtherance of the purposes of ORS 390.805 to 390.925. [1971 c.1 §5; 1971 c.459 §1; 1973 c.756 §2; 1981 c.236 §3; 1983 c.334 §4]

      (a) Peace officers, members or employees of a governmental body or their agents while engaged in the discharge of official duties; or

      (b) Any member of the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.

      (3) A person who violates this section commits a Class C violation. [1981 c.798 §3; 1987 c.291 §3; 1999 c.1051 §99]

 

      390.855 Designation of additional scenic waterways. The State Parks and Recreation Department shall undertake a continuing study and submit periodic reports to the Governor, with the concurrence of the Water Resources Commission, recommending the designation of additional rivers or segments of rivers and related adjacent land by the Governor as scenic waterways subject to the provisions of ORS 390.805 to 390.925. Consistent with such recommendation, the Governor may designate any river or segment of a river and related adjacent land as a scenic waterway subject to the provisions of ORS 390.805 to 390.925. The department shall consult with the State Fish and Wildlife Commission, the State Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Quality Commission, the Department of State Lands, and such other persons or agencies as it considers appropriate. The State Parks and Recreation Department shall conduct hearings in the counties in which the proposed additional rivers or segments of rivers are located. The following criteria shall be considered in making such report:

      (1) The river or segment of river is relatively free-flowing and the scene as viewed from the river and related adjacent land is pleasing, whether primitive or rural-pastoral, or these conditions are restorable.

      (2) The river or segment of river and its setting possess natural and recreation values of outstanding quality.

      (3) The river or segment of river and its setting are large enough to sustain substantial recreation use and to accommodate existing uses without undue impairment of the natural values of the resource or quality of the recreation experience. [1971 c.1 §6]

 

      390.865 Authority of legislature over designation of additional scenic waterways. The designation of a river or segment of a river and related adjacent land, pursuant to ORS 390.855, shall not become effective until the day following the adjournment sine die of the regular session of the Legislative Assembly next following the date of the designation or that was in session when the designation was made. The Legislative Assembly by joint resolution may disapprove any such designation or a part thereof, and in that event the designation, or part thereof so disapproved, shall not become effective.

      (2) “Recreation area” means the Deschutes River Scenic Waterway Recreation Area created under ORS 390.932. [1987 c.624 §§1,18; 1989 c.904 §26; 2001 c.104 §133]

 

      390.932 Creation of Deschutes River Scenic Waterway Recreation Area. There is created the Deschutes River Scenic Waterway Recreation Area consisting of the segment of the Deschutes River scenic waterway under ORS 390.826 that is designated as the segment from immediately below the existing Pelton reregulating dam downstream approximately 100 miles to its confluence with the Columbia River, excluding the City of Maupin as its boundaries are constituted on October 4, 1977. [1987 c.624 §17]

 

      390.934 Management of Deschutes River Scenic Waterway Recreation Area; plan; rules; budget. (1) The State Parks and Recreation Department shall have primary management responsibility for the State of Oregon to manage the Deschutes River Scenic Waterway Recreation Area. In managing the recreation area, the department shall cooperate with other managing agencies having jurisdiction to manage all or part of the recreational area.

      (2) The department shall adopt a management plan by rule. The department shall implement the plan and shall prepare a budget for implementation taking into consideration the provisions of the management plan. [1987 c.624 §§3,19]

      390.938 Guidelines for management and development. The Deschutes River Scenic Waterway Recreation Area shall be managed and developed in accordance with the following guidelines:

      (1) To the extent allowed under ORS 390.805 to 390.925, the recreational area shall be administered to allow continuance of compatible existing uses, while allowing a wide range of compatible river-oriented public outdoor recreation opportunities, to the extent that these do not impair substantially the natural beauty of the scenic waterway or diminish its aesthetic, fish and wildlife, scientific and recreational values.

      (2) The management plan shall stress a segment by segment design and shall include provisions for the development of appropriate facilities and services in the recreation area to meet resource needs for protection and preservation and user needs. This development may include but need not be limited to:

      (a) River and car camp development;

      (b) Sanitation stations for human waste and garbage;

      (c) Parking and access road improvement;

      (d) Signs indicating land ownership;

      (e) Tree and riparian zone protection and restoration;

      (f) Educational programs; and

      (g) Initiation of additional volunteer programs.

      (3) Before restricting access through the use of a permit system, all other management options shall be considered.

      (4) Special emphasis shall be placed on protecting the recreation area and all adjacent property from recreationist-caused wildfires. This goal shall be equal in priority to the other primary goals set forth in this section. This protection shall include but not be limited to:

      (a) Permanent adoption of a fire rule that provides the same protection as the fire rule in force during the 1986 fire season.

      (b) Requiring boater passes to include the name of the group leader, date and section of river used.

      (c) The establishment of information centers near major points of entry into the recreation area to provide users with information and education regarding the fire rules and general rules of the river.

      (d) Conducting cadet patrols at the levels considered necessary to facilitate reasonable compliance with recreation area rules. [1987 c.624 §§4,20]

 

      390.940 Relationship to other laws. The State Parks and Recreation Department and state and local managing agencies shall manage the Deschutes River Scenic Waterway Recreation Area according to the provisions of ORS 390.805 to 390.925 and 390.930 to 390.940 and rules adopted under ORS 390.805 to 390.925 and 390.930 to 390.940. Federal and tribal managing agencies with jurisdiction over their respective lands and waters shall be encouraged to manage their lands and waters in a manner consistent with the provisions of ORS 390.805 to 390.925 and 390.930 to 390.940. [1987 c.624 §§5,21]

 

RECREATION TRAILS

 

      390.950 Short title. ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) may be cited as the Oregon Recreation Trails System Act. [1971 c.614 §1]

 

      390.953 [1971 c.614 §2; 1989 c.904 §27; repealed by 2001 c.104 §134]

 

      390.956 Policy. (1) In order to provide for the ever-increasing outdoor recreation needs of an expanding resident and tourist population and in order to promote public access to, travel within and enjoyment and appreciation of, the open-air, outdoor areas of Oregon, trails should be established both near the urban areas of this state and within, adjacent to or connecting highly scenic areas more remotely located.

      (2) The purpose of ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) is to provide the means for attaining these objectives by instituting a system of recreation trails in this state, by designating certain trails as the initial components of that system, and by prescribing the methods of which, and standards according to which, additional components may be added to the system. [1971 c.614 §3]

 

      390.959 Composition of trails system; establishment of markers. The system of Oregon recreation trails shall be composed of trails established as provided in ORS 390.962 and 390.965. The State Parks and Recreation Department, in consultation with appropriate federal, state and local governmental agencies and public and private organizations, shall establish a uniform marker for the system of Oregon recreation trails. [1971 c.614 §4]

 

      390.962 Criteria for establishing trails; location; statutes authorizing trails for motorized vehicles unaffected. (1) Upon finding that such trails will meet the criteria established in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) and such supplementary criteria as the State Parks and Recreation Department may prescribe, the department is encouraged and empowered to establish and designate Oregon recreation trails:

      (a) Over lands owned by the State of Oregon, by the federal government or by any county, municipality or other local governmental body, with the consent of the state agency, federal agency, county, municipality or other local governmental body having jurisdiction over the lands involved; or

      (b) Over lands owned by private persons, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2).

      (2) In establishing such trails, the department shall give special recognition to the need for the establishment of recreation trails in or near, or reasonably accessible to, urban areas. Upon the establishment of any such trail, the department shall designate the primary kind of trail it is to be, based upon the mode or modes of travel to be permitted on such trail, including one or more of the following:

      (a) Footpath.

      (b) Horseback riding trail.

      (c) Bicycle path.

      (3) Nothing in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) affects any other statute authorizing trails for motorized vehicles which is not inconsistent with ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2). [1971 c.614 §5]

 

      390.965 Hearing required; information to be considered. (1) The State Parks and Recreation Department may establish trails after public meetings in the areas of the state where trails are planned and only in accordance with the following criteria:

      (a) Emphasis shall be given to the development of trails across public lands.

      (b) No trails shall cross private land occupied by a residential dwelling, or upon which a residential dwelling is under construction, within 300 feet of such residential dwelling, without the consent of the owner.

      (c) Trails shall be selected to minimize the adverse effects on adjacent landowners or users and their operations.

      (d) Development and management of trails shall be designed to harmonize with and complement any established forest, agricultural, or other use plan that is compatible with the purposes of ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2).

      (2) Before establishing a trail the department shall consider at a public meeting the following information:

      (a) The proposed route of such trail (including maps and illustrations) and the recommended mode or modes of travel to be permitted thereon;

      (b) The areas adjacent to such trails, to be utilized for scenic, historic, natural, cultural or developmental purposes;

      (c) The characteristics that, in the judgment of the department, make the proposed trail suitable as an Oregon recreation trail;

      (d) The current status of land ownership and current and potential use along the designated route;

      (e) The estimated cost of acquisition of lands or interest in lands, if any;

      (f) The plans for developing and maintaining the trail and the cost thereof;

      (g) Any anticipated problems of policing the use of such trail and any anticipated hazards to the use of any privately owned lands adjacent to such trail; and

      (h) The extent to which the state or its political subdivisions and public and private organizations might reasonably be expected to participate in acquiring the necessary lands and in the administration thereof. [1971 c.614 §6]

 

      390.968 Selection of rights of way for trails. (1) The State Parks and Recreation Department shall select the rights of way for trails designated as Oregon Recreation Trails by ORS 390.962 (1)(a) and (b). Such rights of way shall be:

      (a) Of sufficient width and so located as to protect natural conditions, scenic and historic features, and any primitive character of the trail area; to provide campsites, shelters, and related public-use facilities along trails in more remote areas; and to provide reasonable public access.

      (b) Located to avoid, in so far as reasonably practicable, established highways, motor roads, mining areas, power transmission lines, existing commercial and industrial developments, range fences and improvements, private logging operations, and any other activities that would be incompatible with the protection of the trailside environment in its natural condition and the use of the trail for outdoor recreation.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, it is recognized that in many instances (especially in urban areas and for some types of trails across or near private land) it may be advisable to locate segments of trails in or near existing rights of way for roads, highways, public utilities or telecommunications utilities, excluding power transmission lines; and it is recognized that trail rights of way on occasion may be located, or from time to time relocated, through, or adjacent to, lands used for private timber (including logging), agriculture, commercial or industrial operations and that such location or relocation of a trail right of way, of itself, shall not impose any limitation upon an otherwise lawful use of the adjacent private land except to the extent of the terms of any agreement with the private landowner as provided in ORS 390.971 (1) and except as may be provided by any zoning ordinance, law or regulation.

      (3) The location and width of an Oregon recreation trail right of way across federal lands under the jurisdiction of a federal agency shall be by agreement between that agency and the department.

      (4) In selecting a right of way, the department shall endeavor to obtain the advice and assistance of the local governments, private organizations, landowners, the land users concerned, and the advisory council established under ORS 390.977.

      (5) The department shall hold a public hearing in the area of the state where the selection of such right of way is to be made. Subject to ORS 390.971, after public hearing, the department may revise the location and width of a right of way from time to time as required by circumstances, with the consent of the head of any federal agency involved, and with such advice and assistance of the local governments, private organizations, landowners, land users, and the advisory council, as the department considers necessary or advisable. [1971 c.614 §7; 1987 c.447 §124]

 

      390.971 Department duties and powers; rules. (1) Within the exterior boundaries of areas under its administration that are included in the right of way selected for an Oregon recreation trail as provided in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2), the State Parks and Recreation Department may do any of the following:

      (a) Enter into written cooperative agreements with landowners, federal agencies, other state agencies, local governments, private organizations and individuals in order to provide for the development, operation, maintenance, location and relocation of the trail. Where the trail crosses commercial forestland, such agreement shall make reasonable provision for temporary relocation reasonably required for commercial forest management.

      (b) Subject to limitations set forth in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2), acquire lands or interests in lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds or exchange, or with funds obtained under ORS 390.980.

      (2) The department, in the exercise of its exchange authority, may accept title to any nonstate-owned property within a trail right of way, and, in exchange therefor, the department may convey to the grantor of such property any state-owned property under its jurisdiction or the jurisdiction of any state agency consenting to such exchange that the department or the applicable consenting state agency classifies as suitable for exchange or other disposal. The values of the properties so exchanged either shall be approximately equal or, if they are not approximately equal, the values shall be equalized by the payment of cash to the grantor or to the department or applicable consenting state agency as the circumstances require.

      (3) If lands included in an Oregon recreation trail right of way are outside the exterior boundaries of state or federally administered areas, the department shall attempt, and any local governments involved shall be encouraged, to enter into written cooperative agreements with landowners, local government, private organizations and individuals in order to develop, administer and maintain the trails and to acquire, develop and administer such lands or interests therein. However, if the department or local governments fail or are unable to enter into such agreements or to acquire such lands or interests therein within one year after the selection of the right of way, the department may acquire private lands or interests therein by donation, exchange or purchase with donated or appropriated funds and may develop and administer such lands or interests therein. Exchanges shall be governed by the provisions of subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) Oregon recreation trails shall be administered, protected, developed and maintained by the department, or as provided under subsection (1)(a) of this section, to retain their natural, scenic and historic features. Along trails in more remote areas, provision may be made for campsites, shelters and related public-use facilities. Other uses, including reasonable crossings for motor vehicles, public utilities and water pipes and ditches, that will not substantially interfere with the nature and purposes of the trails may be permitted or authorized, as appropriate. The use of motorized vehicles by the general public along any such Oregon recreation trail is prohibited. However, the department shall authorize the use of motorized vehicles when, in its judgment, such vehicles are necessary to meet emergencies, trail construction and maintenance needs or to enable adjacent landowners or land users to have reasonable access to their lands or timber rights. The fact that private lands are included in an Oregon recreation trail by cooperative agreement of a landowner does not preclude the owner of such lands or agents of the owner from using motorized vehicles on or across such trails or adjacent lands from time to time in accordance with such agreement. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, the state laws, rules and regulations applicable to lands or areas included in any Oregon recreation trail shall continue to apply. Nothing in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) prohibits the use of roads existing on private lands on September 9, 1971, which may cross or traverse portions of the trail right of way, nor shall ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) prevent trails from crossing such roads.

      (5) The department shall endeavor to induce agreements with appropriate state and federal agencies to provide for youth work projects to assist in the construction and maintenance of trails that are part of the Oregon recreation trails system.

      (6) The department shall endeavor, when it considers such to be appropriate, to develop and enhance the educational values and opportunities of Oregon recreation trails. In this connection the department shall cooperate with schools, educators and other interested persons or groups in developing and utilizing techniques and materials to demonstrate to and inform the trail-using public of various scenic and natural features visible along or from such trails, including geological, botanical, historical, zoological and similar features.

      (7) The department shall place and endeavor to maintain signs at such places as it considers appropriate along Oregon recreation trails advising users of the Oregon laws of criminal trespass and encouraging users to protect the trails and the rights and property of adjacent landowners.

      (8) The department, with the concurrence of any federal agency administering lands through which an Oregon recreation trail passes, and after consultation with the local governments, private organizations and landowners that the department knows or believes to be concerned, and the advisory council established under ORS 390.977, may adopt rules that may be revised from time to time governing protection, management, use, development and administration of an Oregon recreation trail.

      (9) The department, on lands not within a forest protection district, upon recommendation of the State Forester, shall have the authority to close trails during periods of high fire danger. The department shall also have the authority to close trails if it deems it necessary to protect the safety of the public.

      (10) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 477, forestland on which a fire exists that was caused by a person using, for recreational purposes, a trail established pursuant to ORS 390.950 to 390.989, shall not be considered an operation area as defined by ORS 477.001, if the fire did not start within an operation. [1971 c.614 §9; 1973 c.46 §7; 1983 c.740 §123; 1997 c.274 §37; 2003 c.14 §169]

 

      390.974 Intergovernmental cooperation to obtain property for use in trail system. The State Parks and Recreation Department is authorized and encouraged to consult and to cooperate with any state, federal or local governmental agency or body and with any privately owned utility having jurisdiction or control over or information concerning the use, abandonment or disposition of roadways, utility rights of way or other properties suitable for the purpose of improving or expanding the Oregon recreation trails system in order to assure, to the extent practicable, that any such properties having value for Oregon recreation trail purposes may be made available for such use. [1971 c.614 §11]

 

      390.977 Oregon Recreation Trails Advisory Council; members; appointment; terms; duties; expenses; officers; quorum; meetings. (1) There is established an Oregon Recreation Trails Advisory Council consisting of seven members, at least one from each congressional district in the state. However, not less than two of such members shall be from separate counties bordering upon the ocean shore. Members of the council shall be appointed by the State Parks and Recreation Commission and shall serve at the pleasure of the commission for terms of four years. Before the expiration of the term of a member, the commission shall appoint a successor. A member shall be eligible for reappointment. If there is a vacancy for any cause, the commission shall make an appointment to become immediately effective for the unexpired term.

      (2) The commission and the State Parks and Recreation Department shall consult with the council from time to time with respect to matters relating to Oregon recreation trails, including the designation and establishment of Oregon recreation trails, the selection of rights of way, the selection, erection and maintenance of markers along the trail routes and the administration of the trails.

      (3) Members of the council shall serve without compensation, but the department may pay expenses as provided in ORS 292.495.

      (4) The council shall select one of its members as chairperson.

      (5) A majority of the members of the council constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.

      (6) The council shall meet at times and places specified by the call of the chairperson or a majority of the members of the council. [1971 c.614 §8; 1981 c.545 §7; 1991 c.257 §1]

 

      390.980 Funds for purposes of ORS 390.950 to 390.989; acceptance and use of donated funds; indemnity to owners of land damaged by trail users. In addition to State of Oregon funds available for the purposes of ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2), the State Parks and Recreation Department may use such portion of moneys made available to it by any federal agency which may be used for such purposes, including matching funds, as the department determines are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2). In addition to the foregoing, the department may receive and may encourage the receipt of donated funds or property from individuals, groups or organizations (including trail users) for specified or nonspecified uses in connection with the acquisition, development, maintenance and administration of Oregon recreation trails. The department if it considers it advisable, may provide under its rules and regulations, for the use of a portion of any such donated funds received for nonspecified purposes to grant to an owner of private land adjacent to an Oregon recreation trail, funds indemnifying such owner for damage clearly caused to the land of the owner, and property therein, by users of such trail and which such landowner has not been able to recover from the user causing such damage. [1971 c.614 §12]

 

      390.983 Trail property tax assessment. For ad valorem tax purposes, real property that is subject to an easement, or a written cooperative agreement, for purposes of ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) shall be valued at its real market value, less any reduction in value caused by the easement or the written cooperative agreement, and assessed in accordance with ORS 308.232. The easement shall be exempt from assessment and taxation the same as any other property owned by the state. [1971 c.614 §13; 1981 c.804 §100; 1991 c.459 §395]

 

      390.986 Injunctive relief for violation of ORS 390.950 to 390.989. The State Parks and Recreation Department has power to obtain injunctions against violations of any provisions of ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and any rules and regulations adopted under ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and agreements made under ORS 390.950 to 390.989. [1971 c.614 §14]

 

      390.989 Eminent domain does not apply to department powers or duties under ORS 390.950 to 390.989. Any power of eminent domain otherwise vested in the State Parks and Recreation Department does not apply to any power or duty vested in the department by ORS 390.950 to 390.989. [1971 c.614 §16]
