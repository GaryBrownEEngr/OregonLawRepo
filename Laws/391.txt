LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT

 

      391.090 Legislative findings; use of lottery moneys for light rail project; policy and intent. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The development, acquisition and construction of light rail systems and their attendant rights of way, equipment and facilities in the urban and metropolitan areas of the State of Oregon do and will accomplish the purpose of creating jobs and furthering economic development in Oregon by, among other advantages:

      (a) Providing an important element of the public infrastructure that provides the basic framework for continuing and expanding economic activity in this state;

      (b) Increasing the economy and efficiency of public transportation, improving the attractiveness of urban and metropolitan areas to new businesses and supporting the operations and prosperity of existing businesses in those areas by making those businesses more accessible to their customers and employees;

      (c) Alleviating the inefficiencies of congestion and crowding associated with, and reducing the burdens of expansion and maintenance of, existing public transportation systems and facilities, as well as reducing energy consumption and air pollution fostered by the use of motor vehicles; and

      (d) Creating employment opportunities in urban and metropolitan areas through the funding of projects for the development and construction of the light rail systems.

      (2) Additionally, the provision of state and local moneys for the proposed Westside corridor light rail project identified in ORS 391.120 (2)(a) will encourage the contribution of otherwise unavailable federal matching grant moneys, the use of which will, for the reasons stated in subsection (1) of this section, forward the purpose of creating jobs and furthering economic development in Oregon.

      (3) Based on the legislative findings described in this section, the use of net proceeds from the operation of the state lottery for the support of the Westside corridor light rail project, as provided in ORS 391.130, is an appropriate use of state lottery funds under section 4 (3), Article XV of the Oregon Constitution and ORS 461.510.

      (4) It is the intent and policy of the Legislative Assembly to insure the funding and support of the Westside corridor light rail project identified in ORS 391.120 (2)(a) in the manner provided in ORS 391.130 to 391.150, to the extent required for the state to realize the benefit of all federal matching funds made available for that project, and to the extent necessary to complete the project. [1991 c.575 §1]

 

      391.100 [1979 c.586 §1; 1981 c.262 §1; repealed by 2012 c.107 §100]

 

      391.110 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that economic growth and livability depend on a solid transportation infrastructure to aid in the production and distribution of goods and services and the efficient movement of people.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly also finds that an efficient surface transportation system in our metropolitan areas must balance highways and arterial roads with mass transit and light rail facilities. Mass transit and light rail improvements can lessen the cost of highway expansion, reconstruction and maintenance by significantly decreasing traffic flow.

      (3) Therefore, the Legislative Assembly shall establish the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund as a means of facilitating the development of a balanced surface transportation system that includes the appropriate application of highways, light rail and mass transit. [1989 c.868 §2]

 

      391.120 Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund; purpose; requirements for expenditures from fund; reversion of unobligated balance. (1) The Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund, separate and distinct from the General Fund, is established in the State Treasury. All moneys in the fund are appropriated continuously to the Department of Transportation for the purposes specified in this section. Interest received on moneys credited to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund shall accrue to and become part of the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund.

      (2) The Department of Transportation may expend moneys in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund to finance the preliminary engineering phase, final design phase, advanced right of way acquisition phase or construction and acquisition of equipment and facilities phase of projects for extensions to the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District’s light rail system, as designated in the Regional Transportation Plan adopted by the metropolitan service district in 1989, as amended from time to time. The Director of Transportation may enter into written agreements with the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District that commit the department to pay anticipated funds from the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund to the district for the purpose of financing such costs of extending the district’s light rail system, including servicing any obligations entered into by the district to finance the costs of extending the district’s light rail system, which written agreements may provide for the remittance of such funds on such periodic basis, in such amounts, over such period of years and with such priority over other commitments of such funds as the director shall specify in the commitment. Any such written agreements or commitments, when executed by the director and accepted by the district, shall be solely conditioned upon actual funds available in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund and shall be valid, binding and irrevocable in accordance with its terms, subject only to the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. The extensions to the light rail system for which projects may be authorized and financed from the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund include:

      (a) The Westside corridor.

      (b) The Interstate 5 North corridor.

      (c) The Interstate 205 corridor.

      (d) The Milwaukie corridor.

      (e) The Barbur corridor.

      (f) The Lake Oswego corridor.

      (g) Appropriate branches to the Banfield corridor.

      (h) Appropriate branches to the corridors specified in paragraphs (a) to (f) of this subsection.

      (3) Notwithstanding any written agreement entered into by the Director of Transportation under subsection (2) of this section, no moneys shall be expended from the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund for the preliminary engineering phase, final design phase, advanced right of way acquisition phase or construction and acquisition phase of projects unless the Director of Transportation determines:

      (a) That all state and local approvals are in place for the phase of the specific project for which funding is being sought;

      (b) That assurances are in place for obtaining all moneys, other than moneys for which the determination is being made, necessary to enable completion of the phase of the specific project for which funding is being sought and that the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District has agreed to provide an amount of money equal to that being provided by the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund for the phase of the specific project for which money is being sought;

      (c) With respect to the phase of the specific project for which funding is being sought, that the body of local officials and state agency representatives designated by the metropolitan service district which functions wholly or partially within the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District and known as the Joint Policy Advisory Committee on Transportation has certified that the phase of the specific project is a regional priority; and

      (d) With respect to construction phases of any project, the elements of the project that are designated for state participation and an estimated total amount of the state’s funding obligation.

      (4) When the actual expenditures for a phase of a specific light rail project fall short of the estimated expenditures for the project, those moneys, other than federal moneys, that are not required for that phase of the project shall remain in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund for use in completing other projects described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) On or before August 31 in each year, the Director of Transportation shall certify to the Governor and the State Treasurer whether or not there existed, as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year, an unobligated balance of moneys in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund that was derived from the moneys required to be transferred to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund under ORS 391.130. If the Director of Transportation certifies that there existed such an unobligated balance of moneys derived from the moneys required to be transferred to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund under ORS 391.130, an amount equal to the unobligated balance as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year shall revert to the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund created by ORS 461.540, and the State Treasurer shall credit such amount to that fund on or before the September 15 next following the date of the certification by the Director of Transportation.

      (6) The Director of Transportation shall certify the unobligated balance of the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund, and that unobligated balance shall revert to the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund created by ORS 461.540 if the Director of Transportation determines that all projects referred to in subsection (2) of this section have been completed and the projects have been accepted by the Director of Transportation and all claims, suits and actions arising out of the projects have been resolved.

      (7) For purposes of subsections (5) and (6) of this section, moneys in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund derived from the moneys required to be transferred to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund under ORS 391.130 shall be obligated to the extent such moneys are needed to fund the amounts committed to be paid in the current or any future fiscal year under any written agreement or commitment entered into by the Director of Transportation under subsection (2) of this section or to pay any amounts owing under or with respect to any revenue bonds issued under ORS 391.140.

      (8) The Department of Transportation may deduct from the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund the costs associated with administering the fund. [1989 c.868 §3; 1991 c.575 §6]

 

      391.125 Regional Light Rail Extension Bond Account; purpose. (1) The Regional Light Rail Extension Bond Account is created as a separate and distinct subaccount in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund. In each fiscal year in which any amounts of principal or interest are due and payable on any revenue bonds issued under ORS 391.140, the Director of Transportation shall cause to be transferred from the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund to the Regional Light Rail Extension Bond Account an amount, which, when added to the moneys on deposit in the account that are available to be used for such purpose, shall be sufficient to pay when due all amounts of principal and interest coming due on such bonds in that fiscal year.

      (2) All moneys on deposit from time to time in the Regional Light Rail Extension Bond Account, together with all investment earnings thereon, shall be pledged and are continuously appropriated to the payment of the bonds issued under ORS 391.140. All investment earnings on moneys on deposit from time to time in the Regional Light Rail Extension Bond Account shall be retained in that account and applied to pay the principal of and interest on bonds issued under ORS 391.140. [1991 c.575 §3]

 

      391.130 Allocation of lottery moneys to Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund; authorized expenditures; end of allocations upon certification by Director of Transportation. (1) In each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1991, there is allocated, from the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund created by ORS 461.540, the amount of $8 million. However, commencing with the first fiscal year next following the fiscal year in which bonds are first issued under ORS 391.140, there shall be allocated from such fund the amount of $10 million in each fiscal year. In each fiscal year after bonds are first issued, the Director of Transportation shall certify any funds allotted in excess of amounts necessary to pay the annual debt service on the outstanding bonds and to fund the amounts committed to be paid in the current or any future fiscal year under any written agreement or commitment entered into by the Director of Transportation pursuant to ORS 391.120 (2). The certified amount shall immediately be returned to the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund. All amounts allocated under this section shall be transferred to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund established by ORS 391.120.

      (2) The annual amounts required to be transferred to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund under subsection (1) of this section, together with all investment earnings on the amounts on deposit from time to time in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund, are continuously appropriated only for the purposes of:

      (a) Funding the Westside corridor extension of light rail referred to in ORS 391.120; and

      (b) Paying the principal and interest on revenue bonds issued under ORS 391.140.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annual allocation made by this section shall be satisfied and credited as and when net proceeds from the operation of the state lottery are received and before any other allocation, appropriation or disbursement of the net proceeds from the operation of the state lottery is made in the applicable fiscal year.

      (4) For purposes of this section, net proceeds from the operation of the state lottery in each fiscal year include all revenues derived from the operation of the state lottery in each fiscal year less:

      (a) The revenues used in that fiscal year for the payment of prizes and the expenses of the state lottery as provided in Article XV, section 4 (4)(d), of the Oregon Constitution, ORS 461.500 and 461.510 (3) and (4); and

      (b) The revenues required to be applied, distributed or allocated as provided in ORS 461.543.

      (5) The transfer of moneys to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund authorized by this section shall cease when the Director of Transportation certifies in writing that transfers of moneys under this section are no longer necessary because:

      (a) Moneys in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund are sufficient for the payment of all amounts committed to be paid under all written agreements or commitments entered into between the Director of Transportation and the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District pursuant to ORS 391.120 with respect to the Westside corridor extension of light rail referred to in ORS 391.120 (2)(a), and to pay all amounts of principal of and interest on the outstanding revenue bonds issued under ORS 391.140; and

      (b) The Westside corridor extension of light rail referred to in ORS 391.120 (2)(a) has been completed and such project has been accepted by the Department of Transportation, and all claims, suits and actions arising out of such project that could create a liability payable out of the moneys in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund have been resolved.

      (6) The Director of Transportation shall deliver a copy of such certification to the Governor and the State Treasurer. Upon receipt of the director’s written certification that transfer of moneys to the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund under this section is no longer necessary, the State Treasurer shall thereafter credit moneys received by the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund under this section to the Administrative Services Economic Development Fund created by ORS 461.540. [1991 c.575 §2; 1993 c.18 §92; 1997 c.249 §124; 2014 c.56 §2]

 

      391.140 Revenue bonds for specified light rail project; amount; purpose; issuance by State Treasurer; pledge of revenues. (1) In accordance with ORS chapter 286A, the State Treasurer, at the request of the Director of Transportation, shall issue revenue bonds from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed:

      (a) The principal sum of $115 million;

      (b) The costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the bonds and other administrative expenses of the State Treasurer in connection with the issuance of the bonds; and

      (c) The amount of any reserves determined to be necessary or advantageous in connection with the revenue bonds.

      (2) The Director of Transportation shall submit to the State Treasurer from time to time written requests to issue the revenue bonds in amounts sufficient to provide in a timely fashion the moneys required to fund the obligations of the Department of Transportation under any written agreements or commitments entered into under ORS 391.120 (2) for the purpose of financing the state share of the costs of the Westside corridor light rail project identified in ORS 391.120 (2)(a).

      (3) Moneys received from the issuance of revenue bonds, including any investment earnings thereon, may be expended only for the purpose of financing the costs of development, acquisition and construction of the Westside corridor light rail project identified in ORS 391.120 (2)(a), and to pay the costs of issuing the bonds and other administrative expenses of the State Treasurer in carrying out the provisions of ORS 391.120 and this section, including the funding of any reserves determined to be necessary or advantageous in connection with the revenue bonds.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 286A.100, 286A.102 and 286A.120 or any other provision of law, revenue bonds issued under this section, regardless of whether issued in one or more issues, shall be secured equally and ratably by the pledge of moneys described in this subsection and ORS 391.130. The bonds shall be secured by a pledge of, and a lien on, and shall be secured and payable only from, moneys on deposit from time to time in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund established by ORS 391.120. The revenue bonds shall not be a general obligation of this state, and shall not be secured by or payable from any funds or assets of this state other than the moneys on deposit from time to time in the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund.

      (5) The moneys in the Regional Light Rail Extension Bond Account shall be used and applied by the Director of Transportation to pay when due the principal of and interest on any revenue bonds issued under this section.

      (6) The interest on all revenue bonds issued under this section and on any refunding bonds issued pursuant to ORS chapter 286A is exempt from personal income taxation imposed by this state under ORS chapter 316.

      (7) The proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of the revenue bonds, including any proceeds required to fund any reserves determined to be necessary or advantageous in connection with the revenue bonds, shall be deposited in a special, segregated subaccount of the Regional Light Rail Extension Construction Fund. The moneys on deposit from time to time in the subaccount, including any investment earnings thereon, shall be disbursed as needed for the purposes described in subsection (3) of this section upon the written request of the Director of Transportation. [1991 c.575 §4; 2007 c.783 §179]

 

      391.150 Joint management of specified light rail project; contracting procedures. (1) The Department of Transportation and the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District shall jointly manage the construction phases of the Westside corridor light rail project. The final project management plans of the managing agencies shall provide that the district shall manage and oversee construction of the light rail right of way and facilities and that the department shall manage and oversee the construction of highway improvements related to the extension of the light rail system. The department and the district shall describe in a memorandum of understanding or grant agreement the functions and responsibilities assigned to each of the managing agencies and shall establish an organizational and management system for the project under which significant actions during the construction phase occur only with the knowledge of both of the managing agencies.

      (2) Subject to ORS 279.835 to 279.855 and ORS chapters 279A, 279B and 279C and any applicable prohibitions against preferences in contracts related to the construction phase of the Westside corridor light rail project, the managing agencies shall develop procedures that afford qualified businesses in Oregon the opportunity to compete for project contracts to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with federal laws and regulations governing Federal Transit Administration grants.

      (3) The managing agencies shall seek the cooperation and assistance of contracting and construction associations in this state when establishing the contracting procedures for the Westside corridor light rail project. The managing agencies shall also establish and implement programs to provide contracting and construction businesses with information relating to the project.

      (4) The managing agencies, to the maximum extent feasible, shall encourage disadvantaged business enterprises to bid for contracts and to otherwise participate in the Westside corridor light rail project. [1991 c.575 §5; 1993 c.741 §65; 2003 c.794 §271]

Refunding bonds may be issued whether the bonds to be refunded are then subject to redemption or are thereafter subject to redemption or maturity, and regardless of the purpose for which the bonds to be refunded were issued by the authority. All such bonds and the interest coupons applicable thereto, if any, are made and shall be construed to be negotiable instruments. [1977 c.662 §9]

 

      391.580 Pledges for bonds.

In the resolution of the district board pledging all or any part of its tax revenues as security for any bonds issued by the authority, the district may reserve the right to pledge from time to time on a parity basis all or any part of its tax revenues as security for any one or more series of bonds issued thereafter by the authority or the district, and in the event the right so reserved by the district is exercised all bonds secured by a pledge of such tax revenues shall be equally and ratably secured by such tax revenues without preference or priority of any kind of any bond or series of bonds secured thereby over any other bond or series of bonds secured thereby. A pledge of tax revenues by a district as a security for the payment of any bonds issued by the authority shall not be considered to be the incurring of bonded indebtedness by the district. Any pledge made pursuant to this section shall be valid and binding from and after the date of issuance of the bonds secured thereby and the income, revenues, receipts or taxes pledged shall be immediately subject to the lien of such pledge without the physical delivery thereof, the filing of any notice or any further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding against all persons having claims of any kind against the pledgor whether in tort, contract or otherwise, irrespective of whether such persons have notice thereof. The resolution under which the bonds are authorized to be issued and any indenture executed as security for the bonds, may contain any agreements and provisions with respect to the maintenance of the properties covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portions leased by the authority to a district, the pledge of the agreement of the district to make such payments as shall be necessary to pay principal, interest and premiums, if any, on the bonds, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, designation of a trustee, and any other provision the board shall deem advisable. Each pledge and agreement made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds of the authority shall continue effective until the principal, interest and premiums, if any, on the bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid or provision for such payment duly made. [1977 c.662 §10; 1985 c.655 §1]

 

      391.590 Bonds not general obligation of state. All bonds issued by the Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority under the provisions of ORS 267.227 and 391.500 to 391.660 shall not constitute a debt, liability or general obligation of this state, or a pledge of the faith and credit of this state, but shall be payable solely from the income revenues, receipts or assets pledged for their payment. Each bond issued shall contain on the face a statement that the State of Oregon or the authority shall not be obligated to pay the same nor the interest thereon except from the income revenues, receipts or assets pledged therefor, and that neither the general obligation, full faith and credit nor the taxing power of this state is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bond. [1977 c.662 §11]

 

      391.600 Tax exempt status of income, property and bond interest. (1) The income and, to the extent permitted by the Constitution, the property of the Oregon Mass Transportation Financing Authority shall be exempt from all taxation in the State of Oregon.
