      (2) All matters relating to the organization, discipline and government of the organized militia, not otherwise provided for in this chapter and ORS chapters 398 and 399 or in military department regulations issued pursuant thereto, shall be decided by the customs and usage of the appropriate force or forces of the Armed Forces of the United States.

An officer serving as Acting Adjutant General under this section shall continue to receive the salary authorized for an Assistant Adjutant General, when the officer is a state employee, but shall otherwise receive the salary authorized for the Adjutant General. The Acting Adjutant General shall serve until the Adjutant General is again able to perform the duties of the office, or if such office is vacant, until an Adjutant General is regularly appointed and qualified.

      (c) Army or Air Force officers who have retired and are residents of the State of Oregon.

An Acting Adjutant General designated under this provision shall have the same qualifications as are required for the appointment of an Adjutant General.

      (3) The Acting Adjutant General serving under the terms of this section shall be compensated as determined by the Governor, but the amount shall not exceed that authorized for a regularly appointed Adjutant General.

      (4) The Acting Adjutant General, before entering upon the duties of office, shall give to the state a fidelity bond in such penal sum as may be fixed by law, or if not so fixed, as may be approved by the Governor, with a corporate surety who is authorized to do business in this state. The premium for such bond shall be paid by the military department. [1961 c.454 §12; 1963 c.62 §2]
