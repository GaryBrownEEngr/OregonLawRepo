If a court determines that the ability of a service member to pay interest on an obligation or liability at a rate in excess of six percent per year is not materially affected because of the active service of the member, the court may order an interest rate that is just.

      (5) A creditor must recompute the payment schedule to amortize the balance of the obligation or liability over the remainder of the obligation or liability at a rate of interest determined under subsection (2) or (4) of this section. [2003 c.387 §4; 2005 c.79 §2; 2009 c.541 §20]
