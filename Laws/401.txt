      (2) It is declared to be the policy and intent of the Legislative Assembly that preparations for emergencies and governmental responsibility for responding to emergencies be placed at the local level.

The Governor is responsible for the emergency services system within the State of Oregon. The executive officer or governing body of each county or city of this state is responsible for the emergency services system within that jurisdiction.

      (2) In carrying out their responsibilities for emergency services systems, the Governor and the executive officers or governing bodies of the counties or cities may delegate any administrative or operative authority vested in them by this chapter and provide for the subdelegation of that authority.

DISASTER OR EMERGENCY RELATED WORK CONDUCTED BY OUT-OF-STATE BUSINESSES

 

      401.680 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) During times of storm, flood, fire, earthquake, hurricane or other disaster or emergency, many businesses bring resources, property and personnel from other states throughout the United States into Oregon on a temporary basis to expedite the often enormous and overwhelming task of cleaning up, restoring and repairing damaged buildings, equipment and property or deploying or building replacement facilities in this state.

      (2) This may involve the need for out-of-state businesses, including out of-state affiliates of businesses based in this state, to bring in resources, property or personnel that previously have had no connection to this state, to perform activities in this state including repairing, renovating, installing, building, rendering services or performing other business activities and for which personnel may be located in this state for extended periods of time to perform these activities.

      (3) While operating in this state on a temporary basis solely for purposes of helping this state recover from a disaster or emergency, these businesses and individual employees should not be burdened by any requirements for business and employee taxes as a result of activities in this state for a temporary period.

      (4) This state’s nexus and residency thresholds are intended for businesses and individuals that are in this state as part of the conduct of regular business operations or that intend to reside in this state and are not directed at businesses and individuals coming into this state on a temporary basis to provide assistance in response to a declared state of emergency or declared major disaster.

      (5) To ensure that businesses may focus on quick response to the needs of this state and its residents during a declared disaster or emergency, it is appropriate for the Legislative Assembly to deem that this activity for a reasonable period of time before, during and after the disaster or emergency for repairing and restoration of the often devastating damage to critical infrastructure in this state as defined in ORS 401.685 does not establish presence, residency, doing business in this state or any other criteria for purposes of state and local taxes or licensing and regulatory requirements. [2015 c.468 §1]

 

      Note: 401.680 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 401 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      401.685 Definitions. As used in ORS 401.685 to 401.695:

      (2) “Declared disaster or emergency” means a major disaster or emergency declared to exist in this state by the President of the United States or a state of emergency declared by the Governor as provided in ORS 401.165.

      (3) “Disaster or emergency related work” means repairing, renovating, installing, building or rendering other services to critical infrastructure that has been damaged, impaired or destroyed as a direct result of a declared disaster or emergency.

      (4) “Disaster response period” means a period that begins 10 days prior to the date that the Governor declares a state of emergency, or the date that the President of the United States declares an emergency or major disaster, whichever occurs first, and that extends 60 calendar days after the date of the termination of the declared disaster or emergency, or any longer period authorized by the Governor.

      (5) “Out-of-state business” means a foreign business entity that, except for disaster or emergency related work, transacts no business in this state and the services of which are requested by a registered business or by a state or local government entity for purposes of performing disaster or emergency related work in this state.

      (6) “Out-of-state employee” means an individual who prior to the declared disaster or emergency resides outside this state and performs no work in this state, except for disaster or emergency related work performed during the disaster response period.

EARTHQUAKES

 

(Drills)

 

      401.900 State and local agency earthquake drills; rules. (1) Each state or local agency shall drill agency employees working in office buildings on emergency procedures so that the employees may respond to an earthquake emergency without confusion or panic.

      (2) The state or local agency shall conduct the drills annually in accordance with Office of Emergency Management rules.

      (3) The drills must include familiarization with routes and methods of exiting the building and the earthquake emergency response procedure recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency known as “drop, cover and hold on.”

      (4) Consistent with rules of the Office of Emergency Management, the state or local agency may drill earthquake emergency response procedures in addition to “drop, cover and hold on” when the state or local agency determines, based on evaluation of specific engineering and structural issues related to an office building, that “drop, cover and hold on” may not be the most effective earthquake emergency response procedure to prevent or limit injury or loss of life.

      (5) The Office of Emergency Management may, by rule or on application, grant exemptions from the drill requirement for good cause.

      (6) As used in this section, “state or local agency” means a state or local office, department, division, bureau, board or commission that is assigned, renting, leasing, owning or controlling office space for carrying out its duties. “State or local agency” includes the Legislative Assembly when in regular session. [Formerly 401.538; 2013 c.266 §1]

 

      401.902 Private employer earthquake drills; exemptions; rules.

      (3) The drills must include familiarization with routes and methods of exiting the building and the earthquake emergency response procedure recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency known as “drop, cover and hold on.”

      (4) Consistent with rules of the Office of Emergency Management, the person may drill earthquake emergency response procedures in addition to “drop, cover and hold on” when the person determines, based on evaluation of specific engineering and structural issues related to an office building, that “drop, cover and hold on” may not be the most effective earthquake emergency response procedure to prevent or limit injury or loss of life.

      (5) The Office of Emergency Management may, by rule or on application, grant exemptions from the drill requirement for good cause. [Formerly 401.543; 2013 c.266 §2]

(1) The Oregon Business Development Department shall develop a grant program for the disbursement of funds for the seismic rehabilitation of critical public buildings, including hospital buildings with acute inpatient care facilities, fire stations, police stations, sheriffs’ offices, other facilities used by state, county, district or municipal law enforcement agencies and buildings with a capacity of 250 or more persons that are routinely used for student activities by kindergarten through grade 12 public schools, community colleges, education service districts and institutions of higher education, including but not limited to public universities listed in ORS 352.002. The Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority established in the department by ORS 285A.096 shall administer the grant program developed under this section. The funds for the seismic rehabilitation of critical public buildings under the grant program are to be provided from the issuance of bonds pursuant to the authority provided in Articles XI-M and XI-N of the Oregon Constitution.

      (2) The grant program shall include the appointment of a grant committee. The grant committee may be composed of any number of persons with qualifications that the authority determines necessary. However, the authority shall include persons with experience in administering state grant programs and representatives of entities with responsibility over critical public buildings. The authority shall also include as permanent members representatives of:

      (a) The Office of Emergency Management;

      (b) The State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries;

      (c) The Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission;

      (d) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services;

ABNORMAL DISRUPTION OF MARKET

 

      401.960 Definitions for ORS 401.960, 401.962, 401.965 and 401.970. For the purposes of this section and ORS 401.962, 401.965 and 401.970:

      (1) “Abnormal disruption of the market” means any emergency that prevents ready availability of essential consumer goods or services.

      (2) “Essential consumer goods or services” means goods or services that:

      (a) Are or may be bought or acquired primarily for personal, family or household purposes, including but not limited to residential construction materials or labor, shelter for payment such as a hotel room, food, water and petroleum products such as gasoline or diesel fuel; and

      (b) Are necessary for the health, safety or welfare of consumers. [2009 c.718 §20]

 

      401.962 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that during an abnormal disruption of the market, some merchants and wholesalers have taken unconscionable advantage of consumers by charging grossly excessive prices for essential consumer goods and services.

      (2) To prevent merchants and wholesalers from taking unconscionable advantage of consumers during an abnormal disruption of the market, the Legislative Assembly declares that the public interest requires that charging unconscionably excessive prices be prohibited and made subject to regulation as an unlawful trade practice. [Formerly 401.106]

 

      401.965 Abnormal disruption of market. (1) As used in subsections (1) to (4) of this section, the terms “merchant” and “wholesaler” do not include a public body as that term is defined in ORS 174.109, a public utility as defined in ORS 757.005 (1)(a)(A) or an electric utility as defined in ORS 757.600.

      (2) A merchant or wholesaler may not sell or offer to sell essential consumer goods or services for an amount that represents an unconscionably excessive price during a declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market under subsections (5) to (7) of this section.

      (3) It is a question of law whether a price is unconscionably excessive. Proof that a price is unconscionably excessive may be shown by evidence that:

      (a) The amount charged for essential consumer goods or services exceeds by 15 percent or more the price at which the goods or services were sold or offered for sale by the merchant or wholesaler in the usual course of business immediately prior to or during a declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market; or

      (b) The amount charged for the essential consumer goods or services exceeds by 15 percent or more the price at which the same or similar consumer goods or services were readily obtainable by other consumers in or near the geographical area covered by the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market.

      (4) Evidence described in subsection (3) of this section constitutes prima facie proof of a violation of subsections (1) to (4) of this section. Evidence described in subsection (3) of this section is not prima facie evidence of a violation of subsections (1) to (4) of this section if the amount charged by the merchant or wholesaler is:

      (a) Attributable to additional costs imposed by the merchant’s or wholesaler’s suppliers or necessarily incurred in procuring the essential consumer goods or services immediately prior to or during the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market; or

      (b) The result of increased internal costs or expenses related to the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market or the result of increased costs unrelated to the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market.

      (5) If the Governor determines that an abnormal disruption of the market has occurred, the Governor may declare an abnormal disruption of the market by a proclamation, as part of a state of emergency declared under ORS 401.165, or both.

      (6) The Governor’s declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market under subsection (5) of this section shall specify:

      (a) The geographical area covered by the declaration. The area may be no larger than necessary to effectively respond to the abnormal disruption of the market.

      (b) The date and time at which the abnormal disruption of the market commenced. The date of commencement of the abnormal disruption of the market may precede the date on which the declaration is made.

      (c) That the declaration will terminate automatically 30 days after the date on which the Governor makes the declaration unless the Governor extends the declaration in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection or unless the Governor or the Legislative Assembly terminates the declaration sooner.

      (d) That the Governor may extend the declaration for additional 30-day periods by subsequent declarations that the abnormal disruption of the market continues to exist.

      (7) The Governor’s declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market is subject to termination:

      (a) By the Governor when the Governor determines that an abnormal disruption of the market no longer exists.

      (b) At any time by joint resolution of the Legislative Assembly.

      (c) Automatically 30 days after the date on which the Governor makes the declaration unless the Governor or the Legislative Assembly terminates the declaration sooner. The Governor may extend the declaration for subsequent 30-day periods by declaring for each such extension that the abnormal disruption of the market continues to exist. An extension the Governor declares in accordance with this paragraph also terminates 30 days after the date on which the Governor declared the extension unless the Governor declares another extension or unless the Governor or the Legislative Assembly terminates the extension sooner. [Formerly 401.107]

 

      401.970 Applicability of remedies. The remedies provided in ORS 401.965 (1) to (4) and in the amendments to ORS 646.607 by section 6, chapter 223, Oregon Laws 2007, are in addition to any other remedies that may exist under the law. [Formerly 401.108]

 

ANIMAL RESCUE

 

      401.975 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) During an evacuation after a major disaster or an emergency, many pet owners are reluctant to leave their pets and are willing to risk their lives to protect their pets.

      (2) Animals are important to their owners and the presence of an animal brings comfort to an owner and may enhance recovery for an owner distressed over injury or damage caused by a major disaster or an emergency.

      (3) Significant loss of livestock as a result of a major disaster or an emergency would seriously threaten the economy of Oregon. Therefore, a livestock emergency operations plan will ensure that livestock are provided for during a major disaster or an emergency.

      (4) It is essential that the Office of Emergency Management and the State Department of Agriculture work together to develop emergency operations plans for animals and livestock that provide for animals and livestock during a major disaster or an emergency. [Formerly 401.271]

 

      401.977 Animal emergency operations plan. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Companion animal” means a domestic animal commonly kept as a household pet.

      (b) “Service animal” means an animal that assists or performs tasks for a person with a sensory, emotional, mental or physical disability.

      (2) The Office of Emergency Management, in cooperation with the State Department of Agriculture and local governments, shall prepare a written animal emergency operations plan that provides for the evacuation, transport and temporary sheltering of companion animals and service animals during a major disaster or an emergency.

      (3) The office, in developing the plan, shall emphasize the protection of human life and shall consider:

      (a) Allowing owners of service animals to be evacuated, transported and sheltered with their service animals;

      (b) Establishing a sufficient number of evacuation shelters equipped to temporarily shelter companion animals and service animals in close proximity to a human sheltering facility;

      (c) Allowing owners and their companion animals to be evacuated together whenever possible;

      (d) Establishing an identification system to ensure that owners who are separated from their companion animals or service animals during an evacuation are provided with all information necessary to locate and reclaim their animals;

      (e) Transporting companion animals or service animals, in cages or carriers that safely and securely confine the animals, in an impending major disaster or emergency;

      (f) Recommending that animal shelters, humane societies, veterinary offices, boarding kennels, breeders, grooming facilities, animal testing facilities and any other entity that normally houses companion animals or service animals create evacuation plans for the animals housed at their facilities;

      (g) Establishing recommended minimum holding periods for companion animals or service animals that are sheltered during a major disaster or an emergency; and

      (h) Creating and promoting an educational campaign for owners of companion animals or service animals that will:

      (A) Encourage owners to plan for and incorporate their animals in the owners’ personal plans in the event of a major disaster or an emergency; and

      (B) Inform owners of companion animals or service animals about the animal emergency operations plan prepared under this section. [Formerly 401.272]

 

      401.978 Livestock emergency operations plan. (1) As used in this section, “livestock” means cattle, horses, sheep and any other animals designated by the State Department of Agriculture.

      (2) The State Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Office of Emergency Management and local governments, shall prepare a written livestock emergency operations plan that provides for the evacuation, transport and temporary sheltering of livestock during a major disaster or an emergency.

      (3) The department, in developing the plan, shall consider:

      (a) Methods for providing adequate food and water for livestock during a major disaster or an emergency;

      (b) Methods for providing livestock with adequate shelter or protection from harsh weather conditions during a major disaster or an emergency;

      (c) Creating and promoting an educational campaign for owners of livestock that will:

      (A) Encourage owners to plan for and incorporate their livestock in the owners’ personal plans in the event of a major disaster or an emergency; and

      (B) Inform owners of livestock about the livestock emergency operations plan prepared under this section; and

      (d) Any other methods or arrangements that the department determines would protect livestock during a major disaster or an emergency. [Formerly 401.274]
