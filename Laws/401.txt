RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES

      (2) It is declared to be the policy and intent of the Legislative Assembly that preparations for emergencies and governmental responsibility for responding to emergencies be placed at the local level. The state shall prepare for emergencies, but shall not assume authority or responsibility for responding to an emergency unless the appropriate response is beyond the capability of the city and county in which the emergency occurs, the city or county fails to act, or the emergency involves two or more counties.

      401.035 Responsibility for emergency services systems. (1) The emergency services system is composed of all agencies and organizations involved in the coordinated delivery of emergency services. The Governor is responsible for the emergency services system within the State of Oregon. The executive officer or governing body of each county or city of this state is responsible for the emergency services system within that jurisdiction.

      (2) In carrying out their responsibilities for emergency services systems, the Governor and the executive officers or governing bodies of the counties or cities may delegate any administrative or operative authority vested in them by this chapter and provide for the subdelegation of that authority.

      (b) The person meets such other criteria as may be established by the authority.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other law prohibiting a person from providing health care services without a license, certificate or other authorization from a health professional regulatory board, a person entered in the emergency health care provider registry under subsection (1) of this section may provide health care services during a state of emergency declared under ORS 401.165 or a state of public health emergency proclaimed under ORS 433.441 without a license, certification or other authorization if:

      (c) Verification of previous licenses, certifications or other authorization by a health professional regulatory board;

      (2) Pursuant to the Emergency Management Assistance Compact and the Pacific Northwest Emergency Management Arrangement, the Oregon Health Authority may direct emergency health care providers registered under ORS 401.654 who are willing to provide health care services in another state to proceed to another state where emergency health care services are required by reason of an emergency in that state; and

DISASTER OR EMERGENCY RELATED WORK CONDUCTED BY OUT-OF-STATE BUSINESSES

 

      401.680 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) During times of storm, flood, fire, earthquake, hurricane or other disaster or emergency, many businesses bring resources, property and personnel from other states throughout the United States into Oregon on a temporary basis to expedite the often enormous and overwhelming task of cleaning up, restoring and repairing damaged buildings, equipment and property or deploying or building replacement facilities in this state.

      (2) This may involve the need for out-of-state businesses, including out of-state affiliates of businesses based in this state, to bring in resources, property or personnel that previously have had no connection to this state, to perform activities in this state including repairing, renovating, installing, building, rendering services or performing other business activities and for which personnel may be located in this state for extended periods of time to perform these activities.

      (3) While operating in this state on a temporary basis solely for purposes of helping this state recover from a disaster or emergency, these businesses and individual employees should not be burdened by any requirements for business and employee taxes as a result of activities in this state for a temporary period.

      (4) This state’s nexus and residency thresholds are intended for businesses and individuals that are in this state as part of the conduct of regular business operations or that intend to reside in this state and are not directed at businesses and individuals coming into this state on a temporary basis to provide assistance in response to a declared state of emergency or declared major disaster.

      (5) To ensure that businesses may focus on quick response to the needs of this state and its residents during a declared disaster or emergency, it is appropriate for the Legislative Assembly to deem that this activity for a reasonable period of time before, during and after the disaster or emergency for repairing and restoration of the often devastating damage to critical infrastructure in this state as defined in ORS 401.685 does not establish presence, residency, doing business in this state or any other criteria for purposes of state and local taxes or licensing and regulatory requirements. [2015 c.468 §1]

 

      Note: 401.680 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 401 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      401.685 Definitions. As used in ORS 401.685 to 401.695:

      (1) “Critical infrastructure” means property and equipment owned or used by communications networks, electric generation, transmission and distribution systems, gas distribution systems, water pipelines and related support facilities that service multiple customers or citizens, including real and personal property such as buildings, offices, lines, poles, pipes, structures and equipment.

      (2) “Declared disaster or emergency” means a major disaster or emergency declared to exist in this state by the President of the United States or a state of emergency declared by the Governor as provided in ORS 401.165.

      (3) “Disaster or emergency related work” means repairing, renovating, installing, building or rendering other services to critical infrastructure that has been damaged, impaired or destroyed as a direct result of a declared disaster or emergency.

      (4) “Disaster response period” means a period that begins 10 days prior to the date that the Governor declares a state of emergency, or the date that the President of the United States declares an emergency or major disaster, whichever occurs first, and that extends 60 calendar days after the date of the termination of the declared disaster or emergency, or any longer period authorized by the Governor.

      (5) “Out-of-state business” means a foreign business entity that, except for disaster or emergency related work, transacts no business in this state and the services of which are requested by a registered business or by a state or local government entity for purposes of performing disaster or emergency related work in this state.

      (6) “Out-of-state employee” means an individual who prior to the declared disaster or emergency resides outside this state and performs no work in this state, except for disaster or emergency related work performed during the disaster response period.

      (7) “Registered business” means a business entity that is registered with or authorized by the Secretary of State to transact business in this state as of the date immediately prior to the declared disaster or emergency. [2015 c.468 §3]

 

      401.690 Exemption from certain taxes, registration and licensing requirements. (1) Disaster or emergency related work conducted by an out-of-state business may not be used as the sole basis for:

      (a) Notwithstanding ORS 317.018 and 317.080, a finding that the out-of-state business is doing business in this state;

      (b) Imposition of the taxes imposed under ORS 314.725 or ORS chapter 316 or 317;

      (c) Notwithstanding ORS 60.704, 63.704, 65.704, 67.705 and 70.355, a requirement that the out-of-state business register with or obtain authority to transact business from the Secretary of State during the disaster response period; or

      (d) A requirement that the out-of-state business or an out-of-state employee comply with state or local business or professional licensing or registration requirements or state and local taxes or fees including unemployment insurance, state or local occupational licensing fees and ad valorem tax on equipment brought into this state for use during the disaster response period and subsequently removed from this state.

      (2) For purposes of any state or local tax on or measured by, in whole or in part, net or gross income or receipts, all activity of the out-of-state business that is conducted in this state, or equipment brought into this state, pursuant to ORS 401.685 to 401.695 shall be disregarded with respect to the filing requirements of ORS 317.710 and 317.715 and the apportionment provisions of ORS 314.605 to 314.675. Receipts from disaster or emergency related work may not be sourced to and may not otherwise impact or increase the amount of income, revenue or receipts apportioned to this state.

      (3) For purposes of ORS chapter 316, an out-of-state employee is not taxed as a resident, nonresident or part-year resident and is not considered to have established domicile or residence in this state. Wages paid for disaster or emergency related work are not subject to the withholding provisions of ORS 316.162 to 316.221.

      (4) Out-of-state businesses and out-of-state employees shall be required to pay transaction taxes and fees including fuel taxes, transient lodging taxes, car rental taxes or applicable fees during the disaster response period, unless an exemption applies to the taxes or fees during the disaster response period.

      (5) Any out-of-state business that transacts business in this state or out-of-state employee who remains in this state after the end of the disaster response period will become subject to this state’s normal standards for establishing domicile or residency or doing business in this state and will become responsible for any business or employee tax requirements that ensue.

      (6) ORS 401.990 does not apply to ORS 401.685 to 401.695. [2015 c.468 §4]

 

      401.695 Reporting by registered business to Oregon Department of Administrative Services. (1) A registered business that requests services of an out-of-state business that enters this state pursuant to ORS 401.685 to 401.695 shall provide to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services a statement that the out-of-state business entered or remained in this state for purposes of responding to a disaster or emergency. The registered business shall provide the statement within 30 days of any out-of-state business entering this state. The statement must include the name, state of domicile, principal business address, federal tax identification number, date of entry and contact information of the out-of-state business.

      (2) An out-of-state business that, or an out-of-state employee who, remains in this state after the disaster response period has ended shall complete state and local registration, licensing and filing requirements that ensue as a result of establishing the requisite business presence, domicile or residency in this state applicable under the existing rules.

This section does not authorize the Governor to assign and make available the fire-fighting resources of a fire district that possesses only one self-propelled pumping unit.

      (2) The Governor may assign and make available local resources under this section without declaring a state of emergency and without regard to the criteria established in ORS 401.032 for assuming authority or responsibility for responding to an event. The State Fire Marshal, or a designee of the State Fire Marshal, may direct and command the use of the local resources made available by the Governor under this section regardless of whether the county, city or district to which the resources are made available has declared a state of emergency under ORS 401.309.

      (3) The State Fire Marshal shall prepare plans for effectively carrying out this section and shall provide advice and counsel to the Governor for the most practical utilization of local resources under this section. [Formerly 401.638]

If county, city or district personnel are assigned and used under ORS 401.930 to respond to a structural collapse or threat of imminent structural collapse in another county, city or district, the personnel have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as they have when performing their duties in the county, city or district in which they are normally employed. [Formerly 401.639]

 

      401.935 Liability for expenses incurred and for loss or damage to local equipment; filing claim.

ABNORMAL DISRUPTION OF MARKET

 

      401.960 Definitions for ORS 401.960, 401.962, 401.965 and 401.970. For the purposes of this section and ORS 401.962, 401.965 and 401.970:

      (1) “Abnormal disruption of the market” means any emergency that prevents ready availability of essential consumer goods or services.

      (2) “Essential consumer goods or services” means goods or services that:

      (a) Are or may be bought or acquired primarily for personal, family or household purposes, including but not limited to residential construction materials or labor, shelter for payment such as a hotel room, food, water and petroleum products such as gasoline or diesel fuel; and

      (b) Are necessary for the health, safety or welfare of consumers. [2009 c.718 §20]

 

      401.962 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that during an abnormal disruption of the market, some merchants and wholesalers have taken unconscionable advantage of consumers by charging grossly excessive prices for essential consumer goods and services.

      (2) To prevent merchants and wholesalers from taking unconscionable advantage of consumers during an abnormal disruption of the market, the Legislative Assembly declares that the public interest requires that charging unconscionably excessive prices be prohibited and made subject to regulation as an unlawful trade practice. [Formerly 401.106]

 

      401.965 Abnormal disruption of market. (1) As used in subsections (1) to (4) of this section, the terms “merchant” and “wholesaler” do not include a public body as that term is defined in ORS 174.109, a public utility as defined in ORS 757.005 (1)(a)(A) or an electric utility as defined in ORS 757.600.

      (2) A merchant or wholesaler may not sell or offer to sell essential consumer goods or services for an amount that represents an unconscionably excessive price during a declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market under subsections (5) to (7) of this section.

      (3) It is a question of law whether a price is unconscionably excessive. Proof that a price is unconscionably excessive may be shown by evidence that:

      (a) The amount charged for essential consumer goods or services exceeds by 15 percent or more the price at which the goods or services were sold or offered for sale by the merchant or wholesaler in the usual course of business immediately prior to or during a declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market; or

      (b) The amount charged for the essential consumer goods or services exceeds by 15 percent or more the price at which the same or similar consumer goods or services were readily obtainable by other consumers in or near the geographical area covered by the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market.

      (4) Evidence described in subsection (3) of this section constitutes prima facie proof of a violation of subsections (1) to (4) of this section. Evidence described in subsection (3) of this section is not prima facie evidence of a violation of subsections (1) to (4) of this section if the amount charged by the merchant or wholesaler is:

      (a) Attributable to additional costs imposed by the merchant’s or wholesaler’s suppliers or necessarily incurred in procuring the essential consumer goods or services immediately prior to or during the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market; or

      (b) The result of increased internal costs or expenses related to the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market or the result of increased costs unrelated to the declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market.

      (5) If the Governor determines that an abnormal disruption of the market has occurred, the Governor may declare an abnormal disruption of the market by a proclamation, as part of a state of emergency declared under ORS 401.165, or both.

      (6) The Governor’s declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market under subsection (5) of this section shall specify:

      (a) The geographical area covered by the declaration. The area may be no larger than necessary to effectively respond to the abnormal disruption of the market.

      (b) The date and time at which the abnormal disruption of the market commenced. The date of commencement of the abnormal disruption of the market may precede the date on which the declaration is made.

      (c) That the declaration will terminate automatically 30 days after the date on which the Governor makes the declaration unless the Governor extends the declaration in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection or unless the Governor or the Legislative Assembly terminates the declaration sooner.

      (d) That the Governor may extend the declaration for additional 30-day periods by subsequent declarations that the abnormal disruption of the market continues to exist.

      (7) The Governor’s declaration of an abnormal disruption of the market is subject to termination:

      (a) By the Governor when the Governor determines that an abnormal disruption of the market no longer exists.

      (b) At any time by joint resolution of the Legislative Assembly.

      (c) Automatically 30 days after the date on which the Governor makes the declaration unless the Governor or the Legislative Assembly terminates the declaration sooner. The Governor may extend the declaration for subsequent 30-day periods by declaring for each such extension that the abnormal disruption of the market continues to exist. An extension the Governor declares in accordance with this paragraph also terminates 30 days after the date on which the Governor declared the extension unless the Governor declares another extension or unless the Governor or the Legislative Assembly terminates the extension sooner. [Formerly 401.107]

 

      401.970 Applicability of remedies. The remedies provided in ORS 401.965 (1) to (4) and in the amendments to ORS 646.607 by section 6, chapter 223, Oregon Laws 2007, are in addition to any other remedies that may exist under the law. [Formerly 401.108]

 

ANIMAL RESCUE

 

      401.975 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) During an evacuation after a major disaster or an emergency, many pet owners are reluctant to leave their pets and are willing to risk their lives to protect their pets.

      (2) Animals are important to their owners and the presence of an animal brings comfort to an owner and may enhance recovery for an owner distressed over injury or damage caused by a major disaster or an emergency.

      (3) Significant loss of livestock as a result of a major disaster or an emergency would seriously threaten the economy of Oregon. Therefore, a livestock emergency operations plan will ensure that livestock are provided for during a major disaster or an emergency.

      (4) It is essential that the Office of Emergency Management and the State Department of Agriculture work together to develop emergency operations plans for animals and livestock that provide for animals and livestock during a major disaster or an emergency. [Formerly 401.271]

 

      401.977 Animal emergency operations plan. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Companion animal” means a domestic animal commonly kept as a household pet.

      (b) “Service animal” means an animal that assists or performs tasks for a person with a sensory, emotional, mental or physical disability.

      (2) The Office of Emergency Management, in cooperation with the State Department of Agriculture and local governments, shall prepare a written animal emergency operations plan that provides for the evacuation, transport and temporary sheltering of companion animals and service animals during a major disaster or an emergency.

      (3) The office, in developing the plan, shall emphasize the protection of human life and shall consider:

      (a) Allowing owners of service animals to be evacuated, transported and sheltered with their service animals;

      (b) Establishing a sufficient number of evacuation shelters equipped to temporarily shelter companion animals and service animals in close proximity to a human sheltering facility;

      (c) Allowing owners and their companion animals to be evacuated together whenever possible;

      (d) Establishing an identification system to ensure that owners who are separated from their companion animals or service animals during an evacuation are provided with all information necessary to locate and reclaim their animals;

      (e) Transporting companion animals or service animals, in cages or carriers that safely and securely confine the animals, in an impending major disaster or emergency;

      (f) Recommending that animal shelters, humane societies, veterinary offices, boarding kennels, breeders, grooming facilities, animal testing facilities and any other entity that normally houses companion animals or service animals create evacuation plans for the animals housed at their facilities;

      (g) Establishing recommended minimum holding periods for companion animals or service animals that are sheltered during a major disaster or an emergency; and

      (h) Creating and promoting an educational campaign for owners of companion animals or service animals that will:

      (A) Encourage owners to plan for and incorporate their animals in the owners’ personal plans in the event of a major disaster or an emergency; and

      (B) Inform owners of companion animals or service animals about the animal emergency operations plan prepared under this section. [Formerly 401.272]

 

      401.978 Livestock emergency operations plan. (1) As used in this section, “livestock” means cattle, horses, sheep and any other animals designated by the State Department of Agriculture.

      (2) The State Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Office of Emergency Management and local governments, shall prepare a written livestock emergency operations plan that provides for the evacuation, transport and temporary sheltering of livestock during a major disaster or an emergency.

      (3) The department, in developing the plan, shall consider:

      (a) Methods for providing adequate food and water for livestock during a major disaster or an emergency;

      (b) Methods for providing livestock with adequate shelter or protection from harsh weather conditions during a major disaster or an emergency;

      (c) Creating and promoting an educational campaign for owners of livestock that will:

      (A) Encourage owners to plan for and incorporate their livestock in the owners’ personal plans in the event of a major disaster or an emergency; and

      (B) Inform owners of livestock about the livestock emergency operations plan prepared under this section; and

      (d) Any other methods or arrangements that the department determines would protect livestock during a major disaster or an emergency. [Formerly 401.274]
