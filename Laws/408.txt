If the application is approved it shall be forthwith forwarded to the Director of Veterans’ Affairs, who shall check it. The director shall determine whether or not the institution of learning or career school is accredited and if the tuition and other charges are reasonable. The director shall also determine whether or not the institution of learning or career school is reasonably qualified to provide the instruction desired by the beneficiary. The director shall be satisfied that the beneficiary has reasonable qualifications to pursue the course of study chosen and that such course, if satisfactorily completed, is likely to enable the beneficiary to become a more useful citizen. If all said conditions are met to the satisfaction of the director, the director may approve the application and file it in the office of the director; otherwise the director shall deny it.

      (2) Upon approval of an application, benefits are payable beginning with the first day of the applicant’s attendance during the current term of an institution of learning or career school, after a finding by the director, supported by evidence satisfactory to the director, that any delay in making application was caused by excusable oversight or neglect.

If the director determines, after such investigation as the director deems necessary, that any such institution or place is not furnishing bona fide courses of instruction to the beneficiary or beneficiaries, or that any beneficiary is abusing the privileges granted by ORS 408.020, no money shall be paid to any beneficiary who is not receiving bona fide instruction or who is abusing such privileges. In making the investigations, the director may use the services of any state or county agency, and the agencies are required to render any such service requested by the director.

      (3) A public employer is not required to comply with subsection (2) of this section if the employer conducts interviews only as part of the process of selecting a candidate for a civil service position from an eligibility list.

      (4) A public employer may consult with the Oregon Military Department and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to determine whether certain military education or experience produces a transferable skill.

      (5) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs shall provide training to veterans on how to show evidence of transferable skills in an application for a civil service position or eligibility list.

      408.238 “Military duty” defined for ORS 408.240 to 408.280. As used in ORS 408.240 to 408.280, “military duty” means training and service performed by an inductee, enlistee or reservist or any entrant into a temporary component of the Armed Forces of the United States, and authorized time spent reporting for and returning from such training or service, or, if a rejection occurs, from the place reported therefor; but does not include active duty training as a reservist in the Armed Forces of the United States or as a member of the National Guard of the United States where the call is for a period of 15 days or less. [Formerly 408.210]

 

      408.240 Status and rights of public officer and employee during and after military duty; programs for supplemental pay. (1)(a) Whenever a public officer or employee leaves a position, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, in order to perform military duty, the office or position may not become vacant, nor shall the officer or employee be subject to removal as a consequence of leaving the position. Unless the officer or employee dies, resigns or is relieved or discharged from such duty under other than honorable conditions, during the term for which the officer or employee was elected, appointed or employed, the officer or employee shall be considered absent on leave until release from active service has permitted the officer or employee to resume the duties of the office or position.

      (b) While absent on leave, a public officer or employee may, but is not absolutely entitled to, receive the pay or other emolument of the office or position, and shall not become liable, as an officer or employee, on an official bond or otherwise, for the acts or omissions of any other person.

      (2) Subsection (1)(a) of this section does not apply unless the officer or employee, upon the termination of military duty, is qualified to perform the duties of the office or position, and makes application within 90 days after the officer or employee is relieved from military duty, or from hospitalization continuing after discharge for a period of not more than one year. If the officer or employee is not qualified to perform the duties of the office or position by reason of the officer’s or employee’s service, but is qualified to perform the duties of any other public position, the officer or employee shall be restored to the other position, the duties of which the officer or employee is qualified to perform, as will provide the officer or employee like seniority, status and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances in the case.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, subsection (1) of this section does not apply if the total of the officer’s or employee’s military duty exceeds five years. Subsection (1) of this section is applicable with regard to military duty that exceeds five years if the period of additional duty was imposed by law or resulted from inability of the officer or employee to obtain orders relieving the officer or employee from active duty.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) The State of Oregon shall continue coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan to a public officer or employee of the State of Oregon and any other individual provided coverage under the officer’s or employee’s plan on the day before the date the officer or employee goes on leave for a period not exceeding a total of 24 months while the public officer or employee is absent on leave.

      (b) An employer other than the State of Oregon may provide coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan to an officer or employee and any other individual provided coverage under the officer’s or employee’s plan on the day before the date the officer or employee goes on leave for the period during which the officer or employee is absent on leave.

      (5)(a) The State of Oregon, a county, a municipality or another political subdivision of the state may establish and administer a donated leave program that:

      (A) Allows an officer or employee who is absent on leave to receive donated leave; and

      (B) Allows an officer or employee to voluntarily donate vacation time to an eligible officer or employee who is absent on leave.

      (b) An officer or employee who is absent on leave and who receives donated leave under paragraph (a) of this subsection may receive an amount of donated leave that supplements any compensation received for performing military duty, but may not receive more than the amount of base salary the officer or employee was earning on the date the officer or employee began the leave of absence.

      408.250 Rights and duties of person replacing public officer in military service. During the period any public officer is absent on leave pursuant to ORS 408.240, a substitute shall serve in the place and stead of the public officer. Such substitute shall be appointed by the authority having power to have appointed the substitute as successor had such office become vacant. The substitute shall qualify by taking an oath of office, and by giving bond in an amount and conditioned as required by law for the officer for whom the substitute has been appointed, or, in the event no bond is required by law, then as the appointing authority directs. The substitute shall be designated by the title of the office, followed by the words “pro tem.” The substitute shall be invested with the authority, duties and responsibilities, and shall receive the emoluments of the office, in lieu of the officer for whom the person is the substitute.

 

      408.260 Termination of term of office of substitute for officer in military service. When the absence on leave of a public officer, granted by ORS 408.240, has terminated, or a successor has been duly appointed and qualified to fill the vacancy created by the death or resignation of such officer, the appointment of the substitute shall terminate, and the substitute immediately shall deliver to such officer or successor all records and other incidents of the office, together with a full and detailed statement of accounting covering the entire period of service as substitute.

 

      408.270 Restoration of employee’s seniority and tenure. Upon the termination of any leave granted by ORS 408.240, every public employee shall be restored to the position without loss of seniority or other benefits. It is the intention of the Legislative Assembly that such employee shall be restored in such manner as to give the employee the status in employment that the employee would have enjoyed if the employee had continued in such employment continuously from the time of entering the Armed Forces until the time of restoration to such employment. Any person so restored to the position shall not be discharged from such position without cause within one year after such restoration. Any employee who has not completed the probationary period in the position at the time of leaving for military duty, shall, upon returning to such position, be required to serve the remainder of such probationary period, notwithstanding the granting of continuous time credit for time served in the Armed Forces.

 

      408.280 Reelection of public officer while in military service. Whenever the term of office of an elected public officer expires during military service in the Armed Forces of the United States for which a leave of absence has been granted pursuant to ORS 408.240 and the officer is reelected to such office, the officer shall continue in such office and on such leave of absence. The pro tem officer acting in the place and stead shall continue to act in said capacity during the continuation of such leave of absence of such public officer. Whenever the leave of absence of the reelected public officer has terminated, and the reelected public officer has qualified for the resumption of the duties of said office as required by law, and has conformed to the requirements of ORS 408.240, the appointment of the substitute of the reelected officer shall terminate in the same manner as provided in ORS 408.260.

 

      408.290 Benefits for public employees on temporary active duty in Armed Forces. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, for initial active duty for training and for all periods of annual active duty for training as a member of the National Guard, National Guard Reserve or of any reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or of the United States Public Health Service, any officer or employee of the state, or of any county, municipality or other subdivision of the state, is entitled, upon application therefor, to a leave of absence from duties for a period not exceeding 15 days in any one training year, without loss of time, pay or regular leave and without impairment of efficiency rating or other rights or benefits to which the officer or employee is entitled.

      (2) Unless the officer or employee has been employed by the state or by any county, municipality or other political subdivision of the state for a period of six months next preceding application, no officer or employee is entitled to receive pay for any period during which the officer or employee is on military leave.

      (3) As used in this section, “training year” means the federal fiscal year for any particular unit of the National Guard or a reserve component. [Amended by 1955 c.104 §1; 1969 c.368 §1; 1993 c.197 §1; 2011 c.18 §2]

A person may not be deprived of such benefits until the person has ceased to be domiciled in the county for a period of one year. [Amended by 2009 c.41 §15]

 

      408.720 Tax levy to finance activities of veterans’ service officer; use of proceeds; use of county general funds. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, in addition to the taxes now authorized to be levied by law, a county governing body may levy in each year a tax not exceeding one-eightieth of one percent (0.000125) of the real market value of all taxable property within the county, computed in accordance with ORS 308.207. The tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner as other county taxes and is subject to the limits set forth in ORS 310.150.

      (2) The taxes collected shall be set apart in the county treasury as a special fund for the purpose of financing the employment and the activities of the service officer appointed under ORS 408.410. If an unobligated balance remains in the special fund at the end of a fiscal year, the unobligated balance may be carried forward to the next fiscal year and expended for the purposes described in this subsection.

      (3) A county governing body need not levy the tax authorized under subsection (1) of this section in any fiscal year when, at the beginning of the fiscal year, the unobligated balance in the special fund described in subsection (2) of this section is sufficient to finance the employment and activities of the service officer for the entire fiscal year.

      (4) If the unobligated balance in the special fund at the beginning of a fiscal year is not sufficient to finance the employment and activities of the service officer for the entire fiscal year or if the levy authorized by subsection (1) of this section is not made by a county governing body for any year for the objects specified in subsection (2) of this section, all expenses incurred under ORS 408.410 and 408.720 to 408.740 shall be paid from the general funds in the treasury of the county the same as though such levy had been duly made. [Amended by 1963 c.9 §24; 1991 c.459 §398; 1995 c.557 §2]

 

      408.730 Procedure when indigent veterans are cared for by veterans organizations.

The commander or executive head shall also file a notice in writing that such veterans organization will undertake the relief of the indigent persons provided for in ORS 408.720, and by the fourth Monday in January of each year shall file with the county clerk a similar notice, and render and file a detailed statement of the relief furnished during the preceding year, including the amount thereof, the names of the persons to whom furnished and on whose recommendation, and such other facts and suggestions as are deemed material.

      (2) The commander or executive head shall also file a bond, with one or more sureties, to be approved by the county court or judge thereof, or board of county commissioners, in a sum not less than $100 and not more than $1,000. The amount of the bond shall be fixed by the court, judge or board. It shall run to the county, and be conditioned by stating that if said commander or executive head faithfully applies all funds that come into the hands of the commander or executive head for that purpose, to the relief of the indigent persons named in ORS 408.720, it is void. If the bond is enforced there shall be recovered from the principal and sureties thereon the amount which is found to be misappropriated, which shall be paid into the county treasury.

      (3) If the county operates on a fiscal year ending on June 30, the notice, statement and bond required by this section may be filed on the fourth Monday in July of each year rather than on the fourth Monday of January. If the statement required by subsection (1) of this section is filed at the time provided in this subsection, this statement shall cover the preceding fiscal year.

      (4) On the approval and filing of the bond, and on the recommendation of the relief committee of any such veterans organization, orders shall be drawn in favor of the commander or executive head in the same manner as orders are now drawn for the relief of the poor. The orders shall designate thereon the names of the persons for whom the relief is intended and, in like manner, a sum not exceeding $100 may be drawn to pay the funeral expenses of an indigent veteran, and the indigent spouses and surviving spouses in marriages and minor children of such veterans. [Amended by 1955 c.56 §1; 2009 c.41 §16; 2015 c.629 §47]

 

      408.740 Appointment and duties of county veterans’ relief officer. The relief fund may be disbursed by an officer to be appointed by the county court or board of county commissioners. The commanders or executive heads of the various veterans organizations shall constitute an advisory board to consult and advise with the court or board relative to administration and disbursement of the fund. Such officer shall investigate all requests for relief, and no warrant shall be paid from the fund except upon the order of such officer. The officer shall give such bond as may be required and approved by the court or board, and may be removed at any time by the court or board. If any vacancy occurs in such office, the court or board shall appoint a successor to such officer. Such officer shall be paid a salary from funds of the county other than the relief fund, to be fixed by the court or board, and audited and paid in the manner that county officers are paid, as provided by law.
