      409.454 Legislative findings on respite care. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Supporting the efforts of families and caregivers to care for individuals with special needs at home is efficient, cost effective and humane. Families receiving occasional respite care relief are less likely to request admission of an individual with special needs to nursing homes, foster care or other out-of-home care at public expense.

      (2) Respite care reduces family and caregiver stress, enhances family and caregiver coping ability and strengthens family ability to meet the challenging demands of caring for individuals with special needs.

      (3) Respite care reduces the risk of abuse and neglect of children, senior citizens and other vulnerable groups.

      (4) Coordinated, noncategorical respite care services must be available locally to provide reliable short-term relief when it is needed by families and caregivers regardless of where they live in Oregon. [1997 c.745 §2]

      (b) Does not include:

For purposes of this subsection, if a long term care facility patient is admitted and discharged on the same day, the patient shall be deemed to occupy a bed for one day. [2003 c.736 §15; 2005 c.757 §3; 2007 c.70 §358; 2007 c.780 §7]

      (3) Funds in the Long Term Care Facility Quality Assurance Fund and the matching federal financial participation under Title XIX of the Social Security Act may be used to fund Medicaid-certified long term care facilities using only the reimbursement methodology described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section to achieve a rate of reimbursement greater than the rate in effect on June 30, 2003.
