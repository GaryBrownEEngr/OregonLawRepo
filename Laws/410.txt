SERVICES FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

 

(Generally)

 

      410.010 State policy for seniors and people with disabilities. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that, in keeping with the traditional concept of the inherent dignity of the individual in our democratic society, the older citizens of this state are entitled to enjoy their later years in health, honor and dignity, and citizens with disabilities are entitled to live lives of maximum freedom and independence.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that the policy of this state is to provide and encourage programs necessary to fulfill the commitment stated in subsection (1) of this section and that the purpose of policies stated in this section and ORS 410.020 is to provide a guide for the establishment and implementation of programs for older citizens and citizens with disabilities in this state. It further declares that the programs shall be initiated, promoted and developed through:

      (a) Volunteers and volunteer groups;

      (b) Partnership with local governmental agencies;

      (c) Coordinated efforts of state agencies;

      (d) Coordination and cooperation with federal programs;

      (e) Partnership with private health and social service agencies;

      (f) A designated state agency that will encourage and work with older citizens and their organizations, that will coordinate state and local programs, that will encourage and monitor federal programs and that will act as an advocate for older Oregon citizens; and

      (g) A designated state agency that will encourage and work with citizens with disabilities and their organizations, that will coordinate state and local programs, that will encourage and monitor federal programs and that will act as an advocate for Oregon citizens with disabilities.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares that it shall be the policy of this state to give special attention to the special concerns of our most frail and vulnerable older citizens. Furthermore, it shall be the policy of this state to support strongly the full development and participation of citizens with disabilities in all aspects of social, political and community life.

      (4) Recognizing the diversity in geography, economy and lifestyles in Oregon and the diversity of local senior citizen networks, the Legislative Assembly declares that it is the policy of this state to avoid complete uniformity in planning and administering programs for older citizens and to encourage and emphasize local control to achieve the most effective blend of state and local authority, not precluding the ability of the state to perform its mandated responsibilities for planning and administration. Multipurpose senior centers may be considered as focal points for the delivery of services to older citizens in each community where practicable. Disability services should also be consolidated where possible to provide efficient and convenient delivery of services to citizens with disabilities. [1981 c.191 §1; 1985 c.180 §1; 1989 c.224 §70; 2007 c.70 §163]

 

      410.020 Implementation of state policy. In carrying out the policies stated in ORS 410.010, the state shall:

      (1) Coordinate the effective and efficient provision of community services to older citizens and citizens with disabilities so that the services will be readily available to the greatest number over the widest geographic area; assure that information on these services is available in each locality, utilizing whenever possible existing information services; and assure that each new service receives maximum publicity at the time it is initiated.

      (2) Assure that older citizens and citizens with disabilities retain the right of free choice in planning and managing their lives; by increasing the number of options in lifestyles available to older citizens and citizens with disabilities; by aiding older citizens and citizens with disabilities to help themselves; by strengthening the natural support system of family, friends and neighbors to further self-care and independent living; by assuring that older citizens and citizens with disabilities are able to make informed choices regarding the delivery of in-home care services by providing information about their responsibilities as employers of in-home care providers or, alternatively, about the responsibilities of an in-home care agency to provide services; and by encouraging all programs that seek to maximize self-care and independent living within the mainstream of life.

      (3) Assure that health and social services be available that:

      (a) Allow the older citizen and citizen with a disability to live independently at home or with others as long as the citizen desires without requiring inappropriate or premature institutionalization.

      (b) Encourage, by expansion of existing programs for older citizens and citizens with disabilities, by school programs, by meals-on-wheels, by counseling or by other means, public and private development of nutrition programs for older citizens and citizens with disabilities that prevent or minimize illness or social isolation.

      (c) Assure that if institutionalization is necessary, the institution should be of the highest quality where the older citizen and citizen with a disability may live in dignity.

      (d) Protect the older citizen and citizen with a disability from physical and mental abuse and from fraudulent practices.

      (4) Foster both preventive and primary health care, including mental and physical health care, to keep older citizens and citizens with disabilities active and contributing members of society; and encourage full restorative services for those older citizens and citizens with disabilities who require institutional care to increase the possibility of their return to independent living.

      (5) Encourage public and private development of suitable housing for older citizens and citizens with disabilities, designed and located consistent with their special needs and available at costs they can afford.

      (6) In implementing subsections (1) to (5) of this section, develop and seek support for plans to assure access to information, counseling and screening, as appropriate, by persons potentially in need of long term care without regard to the person’s income.

      (7) Recognize the necessity for a variety of ways to help older citizens and citizens with disabilities maintain sufficient income to meet their needs.

      (8) Encourage local transportation systems and volunteer groups to meet the daily transportation needs of older citizens and citizens with disabilities and to make accessible to them a broad range of services and programs, including social, health and religious services and programs.

      (9) Encourage and develop meaningful employment opportunities for older citizens and citizens with disabilities in positions commensurate with their abilities; eliminate discrimination to such employment; and whenever possible, employ older citizens in programs that affect older citizens and citizens with disabilities in programs that affect citizens with disabilities.

      (10) Involve older citizens and citizens with disabilities in the decision-making process for programs affecting their lives. Recognizing the ability of older citizens and citizens with disabilities to be advisors to the Legislative Assembly, agencies and professional staff, the Legislative Assembly intends that whenever possible older citizens and citizens with disabilities should assist in the development of policies affecting their lives.

      (11) Assure to older citizens and citizens with disabilities the right to pursue activities within the widest range of civic, cultural, entertainment and recreational opportunities by opening such opportunities to participation by older citizens and citizens with disabilities, by encouraging older citizens and citizens with disabilities to utilize their capabilities by participating in government and by assuring them the right to serve.

      (12) Make public educational facilities available to older citizens and citizens with disabilities and their organizations so older citizens and citizens with disabilities may pursue their educational interests; and encourage all institutions of learning and other appropriate agencies to develop and provide by outreach as well as by traditional means special education programs to meet the needs and interests of older citizens by addressing the problems and opportunities of aging and by responding to older citizens’ interests in liberal arts as well as their interests in hobby and recreation courses.

      (13) Encourage the development of barrier-free construction and the removal of architectural barriers so that more facilities are accessible to older citizens and citizens with disabilities.

      (14) Promote development of programs to educate persons who work with older citizens in gerontology and geriatrics and encourage qualified persons to seek such education.

      (15) Encourage immediate application by both public and private agencies of knowledge acquired from research that can sustain and improve the health and happiness of older citizens and citizens with disabilities.

      (16) Recognize that older citizens who retire should be able to do so in honor and dignity.

      (17) Encourage and support:

      (a) Distribution of literature which accurately presents facts concerning aging and disabilities of citizens.

      (b) Efforts of schools, churches and other institutions, in teaching children and youth about the process of aging and disabilities of citizens so as to correct fallacies handed down from one generation to another.

      (c) Intergenerational programming and participation by community organizations and institutions to promote better understanding and warm social interaction and to counteract the tendency to isolation of individuals who are elderly or who have disabilities.

      (d) Correction of stereotyping of individuals who are elderly or who have disabilities in school texts and other books, newspapers, magazines, radio and television by encouraging review and analysis of these media by publishers, company ownership or other appropriate agencies.

      (e) Efforts which show that many misconceptions and stereotypes have no basis in fact so older citizens and citizens with disabilities will be freed from the destructive tendency to socially conform by embracing these fallacies. [1981 c.191 §2; 1983 c.312 §2; 1985 c.180 §2; 1989 c.224 §71; 2007 c.70 §164; 2007 c.416 §1]

 

      410.030 Legislative findings on long term care options. The Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon finds the following regarding older citizens and citizens with disabilities:

      (1) That there are many older Oregonians and Oregonians with disabilities who face difficulties in maintaining self-care and independent living within the mainstream of life, and who have not yet exhausted their financial resources. These persons are often dependent upon providers of care for advice regarding 24-hour care. These persons and providers are not always aware of options to, or within, such care;

      (2) That inappropriate or premature institutionalization of persons who have not exhausted their financial resources often leads to exhaustion of those resources, and to the expectation by these persons and providers that continued financing of inappropriate institutional care shall be available under Title XIX. However, under these circumstances, transfer of the person to appropriate, less costly noninstitutional or alternative institutional care, if available, is necessary in order that limited public funds can be utilized to provide appropriate care to as many persons in need as possible; and

      (3) That to minimize the need for such disruptive transfers, it is in the interest of older Oregonians and Oregonians with disabilities and of providers of care that the Department of Human Services, or any designated state agency, develop plans for assuring access to information, counseling and screening, as appropriate, by persons potentially in need of long term care without regard to the person’s income. [1983 c.312 §1; 1985 c.180 §3; 1989 c.224 §72; 2007 c.70 §165]

      (11) “Type A area agency” means an area agency:

      (b) That provides a service to elderly persons.

      (a) For which the local government agrees to accept local administrative responsibility for Title XIX;

[1981 c.784 §1; 1985 c.180 §4; 1989 c.224 §73; 1993 c.116 §2; 2001 c.900 §75; 2007 c.70 §166; 2011 c.36 §1; 2011 c.658 §37; 2011 c.720 §82]

 

      410.050 General policy. (1) The State of Oregon finds:

      (a) That the needs of the elderly population can be best served and planned for at the local community level;

      (b) That a longer life expectancy and a growing elderly population demands services be provided in a coordinated manner and a single local agency system for such services be instituted;

      (c) That local resources and volunteer help will augment state funds and needed personnel;

      (d) That local flexibility in providing services should be encouraged; and

      (e) That a single state agency should regulate and provide leadership to ensure that the elderly citizens of Oregon will receive the necessary care and services at the least cost and in the least confining situation.

      (2) The State of Oregon further finds that within budgetary constraints, it is appropriate that savings in nursing home services allocations within a planning and service area be reallocated to alternative care services under Title XIX and Oregon Project Independence in that area. [1981 c.784 §2; 1993 c.116 §3; 2005 c.22 §272]

 

      410.060 Policy for persons with disabilities served by department. (1) It is the policy of the State of Oregon that persons with disabilities served by the Department of Human Services shall also receive necessary services, as appropriate for their needs, from other state agencies.

      (3)(a) Prior to approval of an appropriate living arrangement, as defined in ORS 410.040, administered by the Department of Human Services, all persons with disabilities shall be assessed by preadmission screening to ensure the appropriateness of the living arrangement.

      (b) If a person with a disability is diagnosed as, or is reasonably believed to be, a person with a developmental disability, preadmission screening shall include a diagnostic evaluation as described in ORS 427.105.

      (4) The Department of Human Services in coordination with the Department of Education shall work with nursing homes that have one or more residents under 18 years of age to develop a program appropriate to the needs of those residents. [1981 c.784 §4; 1985 c.180 §5; 1989 c.224 §74; 2001 c.900 §76; 2007 c.70 §167; 2011 c.658 §38; 2013 c.36 §67]

      (2) In developing the comprehensive plan, the department shall work with stakeholders, advocates for seniors and advocates for persons with physical disabilities.

      (11)(a) If revenue generated by the payments described in subsection (5) of this section is insufficient to pay the costs of home care services purchased by private payers through the program, and other costs associated with administering the program, the commission may modify the payment rates described in subsection (5) of this section as necessary to generate sufficient revenue to pay the costs.

      (b) If the commission determines that modifying the payment rates will not generate sufficient revenue to pay the costs of the program, the commission may suspend the program following 30 days advance written notice to private payers and home care workers participating in the program.

      (c) If the commission suspends the program under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the commission shall report to the Legislative Assembly in the manner provided in ORS 192.245, no later than 30 days after the suspension begins:

STATE POLICY ON PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

      (1) All persons regardless of any disability have the right to live their lives with dignity and to participate in society and all state programs to the fullest extent possible.

      (2) There is a need for education of state employees and the public generally about the capacity of persons with disabilities to participate and compete in the mainstream of society.

      (3) Stereotypes and negative labels have no place in state laws and words such as “victim,” “afflicted,” “crippled” and “handicapped” that have connotations of unclean, unworthy, unproductive and begging are judgmental. Wherever possible, words such as these shall be avoided.

      (4) The language of state laws shall reflect a positive outlook about persons with disabilities. The worth and uniqueness of each individual citizen is to be emphasized by using words and phrases that emphasize the person first and then identify any disability when relevant. [1989 c.224 §1; 2005 c.411 §3]

 

      410.715 Person suffering brain injury to be considered person with disability. It is the policy of the state that any person experiencing an injury defined as an injury to the brain caused by extrinsic forces where the injury results in the loss of cognitive, psychological, social, behavioral or physiological function for a sufficient time to affect that person’s ability to perform activities of daily living shall be considered a person with a disability. [1991 c.402 §1; 2007 c.70 §182]

 

      410.720 Mental health and addiction services for senior citizens and persons with disabilities. It is the policy of this state to provide mental health and addiction services for all Oregon senior citizens and persons with disabilities through a comprehensive and coordinated statewide network of local mental health services and alcohol and drug abuse education and treatment. These services should involve family and friends and be provided in the least restrictive and most appropriate settings.

      (2) The Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority shall facilitate the formation of local community partnerships between the senior, disability, mental health, alcohol and drug abuse and health care communities by supporting the development of program approaches that meet minimum standards adopted by the Oregon Health Authority under ORS 430.357 including, but not limited to:

      (a) Mental health and addiction screenings and assessments in long term care settings;

      (b) Outreach services to seniors and persons with disabilities in their homes, including gatekeeper programs, neighborhood programs and programs designed for rural communities;

      (c) Multilingual and multicultural medical and psychiatric services for ethnic minorities with physical disabilities and hearing impairments;

      (d) Education and training for health care consumers, health care professionals and mental health and addiction services providers on mental health and addiction issues, programs and services for seniors and persons with disabilities; and

      (e) Education and consultation services for primary care physicians and naturopathic physicians treating seniors and persons with disabilities.

      (3) In carrying out the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the department and the authority shall:

      (a) Develop plans for service coordination within the department and the authority;

      (b) Recommend budget provisions for the delivery of needed services offered by the department and the authority; and

      (c) Develop plans for expanding mental health and addiction services for seniors and persons with disabilities to meet the increasing demand. [1991 c.775 §2; 2001 c.104 §143; 2001 c.900 §85; 2005 c.691 §6; 2011 c.673 §12; 2011 c.720 §89; 2017 c.356 §32]

 

TRUST FUNDS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

The purpose of the Self-Sufficiency Trust Fund is to provide a life-care planning option to meet the supplemental service needs of individuals with disabilities by enabling parents, families and others to plan more secure futures for their dependents with disabilities or other named beneficiaries with disabilities without fear of loss of benefits or invasion of trust principal.

      (4) The agreement, naming one or more beneficiaries residing in this state who have developmental disabilities, mental illness or physical disabilities or persons otherwise eligible for benefits or services due to disability, shall specify the supplementary care, support or treatment to be provided for each named beneficiary with the moneys deposited in the Self-Sufficiency Trust Fund.

If the agreement so provides, the moneys in each account may be expended for purposes other than providing supplementary care, support and treatment upon a showing of extreme, unforeseen hardship. The Department of Human Services shall by rule establish criteria for determining what conditions constitute extreme, unforeseen hardship allowing expenditure of moneys for purposes other than providing supplementary care, support and treatment.

      (7) In the event that the Director of Human Services determines that the money in the account of a named beneficiary cannot be used for supplementary care, support or treatment of the beneficiary in a manner consistent with the agreement, the remaining money in the account, together with any accumulated interest, shall be promptly returned to the self-sufficiency trust which deposited the money in the Self-Sufficiency Trust Fund.

      (9) The receipt by a beneficiary of supplementary care, support or treatment provided with money from the Self-Sufficiency Trust Fund shall not in any way reduce, impair or diminish the benefits to which the beneficiary is otherwise entitled by law. No interest in the principal or income of this trust shall be anticipated, assigned or encumbered, or shall be subject to any creditor’s claim or to legal process, prior to its actual receipt by the beneficiary. Furthermore, because of the special needs of the beneficiary, no part of the corpus thereof, nor principal nor undistributed income shall be subject to the claims of voluntary or involuntary creditors for the provision of care and services, including residential care, by any public entity, office, department or agency of the State of Oregon or of any other state, or of the United States or any other governmental agency.

MISCELLANEOUS

 

      410.851 Policy on patient-based reimbursement system for long term care facilities; rules. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that patients admitted to and cared for by long term care facilities in Oregon are more impaired than in the past. In keeping with the traditional commitment of the State of Oregon to the care and protection of its citizens who are frail or elderly or who have disabilities, as expressed in ORS 410.010, the Legislative Assembly declares that a patient-based reimbursement system emphasizing quality incentives is appropriate for long term care facilities. Such a system would reward long term care facilities for outcomes, such as maintaining or improving a patient’s condition, and meet the legitimate costs of caring for patients.

      (2) As used in this section, “patient-based reimbursement” means reimbursement for direct patient care according to the needs of the patient, based on multiple levels of patient health, functioning and impairment.

      (3) A patient-based reimbursement system does not require the Department of Human Services to assess each patient and reimburse long term care facilities according to the constantly changing conditions of the patients except for changes between skilled and intermediate levels of care which shall result in prompt readjustment of rates.

      (4) The department shall establish by rule definitions of levels of care and the payment rates for the patient-based reimbursement system. The rates shall be designed to maintain and enhance access to community-based care services.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 410.555, the department, in cooperation with representatives of community-based care providers, shall implement policies that offer incentives to providers for entering into Medicaid contracts with the department and that enable a patient, to the greatest extent possible, to remain in the residential setting offering the scope of services that best meets the patient’s needs. [1987 c.523 §2 (enacted in lieu of 410.850); 2007 c.70 §186; 2008 c.18 §11; 2011 c.201 §10]

 

PENALTIES

 

      410.890 Civil penalty. Violation of ORS 410.520 shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000, imposed in the manner provided in ORS 441.705 to 441.745. [1989 c.912 §9; 1991 c.67 §105]

 

      410.990 [1981 c.183 §12; 1999 c.1051 §177; renumbered 124.990 in 2001]
