      (1) “Board” means the JOBS Plus Advisory Board established in ORS 411.886.

      (2) “Job opportunities and basic skills program” means the program described in ORS 412.006.

      (3) “JOBS Plus” or “program” means the JOBS Plus Program established in ORS 411.878.

      (4) “Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program” has the meaning given that term in ORS 411.806. [1995 c.561 §2 and 1995 c.816 §15; 2009 c.21 §47; 2009 c.599 §9a]

 

      Note: Chapter 561, Oregon Laws 1995, and sections 14 to 33, chapter 816, Oregon Laws 1995, were enacted by the Legislative Assembly as duplicate JOBS Plus Programs. Legislative Counsel has compiled the relevant sections of both chapters as ORS 316.680, 411.877 to 411.896 and 657.925. Legislative Counsel has not substituted ORS section references for provisions in chapter 816, Oregon Laws 1995, that technically are not related to the JOBS Plus Program.

 

      411.878 Intent; state program creation; rules. (1) In establishing and implementing a program to be known as the JOBS Plus Program, the Legislative Assembly recognizes that early attachment to work and development of knowledge and skills are the most effective means of helping people make the transition from dependence on public assistance and subsiding in poverty to regular employment and self-reliance. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to promote greater economic self-sufficiency among Oregon families by:

      (a) Increasing the employability of unemployed and underemployed Oregonians through on-the-job training;

      (b) Invigorating the public-private workforce partnership through development of jobs with both private for-profit and public employers;

      (c) Ensuring that program participants through their employment development plans have opportunities to improve work skills, education and employability and to establish recent work histories with work site training, mentoring, individual education accounts and provision of necessary support service benefits that include child care, workers’ compensation, job placement and a guarantee that participation in the JOBS Plus Program does not result in a reduction in net income to a participant when compared with the participant’s combined income from the temporary assistance for needy families program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; and

      (d) Expeditiously placing program participants in subsidized and unsubsidized employment.

      (2) The JOBS Plus Program is created as a program in which residents of the State of Oregon shall, in lieu of receiving benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and payments from the temporary assistance for needy families program, be provided jobs and paid in a way that promotes self-sufficiency and encourages unemployed Oregonians to improve their positions in the workforce. The JOBS Plus Program shall be a public assistance to work strategy for the State of Oregon and operate under the job opportunities and basic skills program and rules adopted thereunder to the extent such rules are not inconsistent with ORS 411.877 to 411.896. These rules include but are not limited to rules regarding participation requirements and support services. [1995 c.561 §3 and 1995 c.816 §16; 1997 c.581 §17; 2009 c.21 §48; 2009 c.599 §9]

      (4)(a) Individuals desiring work through the program shall contact the nearest Department of Human Services office serving the county in which they reside if they are temporary assistance for needy families program or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program applicants or recipients or noncustodial parents of individuals receiving temporary assistance for needy families.

      (b) With the assistance of the local JOBS Plus Implementation Councils and the JOBS Plus Advisory Board, the Department of Human Services shall develop a job inventory of sufficient size to accommodate all of the participants who desire to work in the program. In consultation with the participant, the department shall try to match the profile of each participant with the needs of an employer when assigning a participant to work with the employer.

      (c) Either the employer or the participant may terminate the assignment by contacting the appropriate Department of Human Services office.

      (d)(A) If after four months in a placement, a participant has not been hired for an unsubsidized position, the employer shall allow the worker to undertake eight hours of job search per week. Participating employers shall consider such time as hours worked for the purposes of paying wages.

Failure of the participant to cooperate with the requirements of the JOBS Plus Program may result in the participant’s removal, in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of Human Services, from the JOBS Plus Program and suspension of the participant’s temporary assistance for needy families grant and supplemental nutrition assistance. A temporary assistance for needy families and supplemental nutrition assistance recipient who has been removed from the program for failing to cooperate shall be eligible to reapply to participate in the program and shall have eligibility for program services determined without regard to the length of time the person was not participating following removal.

The department shall determine and pay in advance supplemental payments to participants on a monthly basis as necessary to ensure equivalent net program wages.

      (d) Recruit volunteer mentors from among their regular employees to assist the participants in becoming oriented to work and the workplace; and

      (e) Sign an agreement to abide by all requirements of the program, including the requirement that the program not supplant existing jobs. All agreements shall include provisions noting the employer’s responsibility to repay reimbursements in the event the employer violates program rules. When a professional placement service, professional employment organization or temporary employment agency is acting as an employer pursuant to subsection (13) of this section, agreements under this paragraph shall require a three-party agreement between the professional placement service, professional employment organization or temporary employment agency, the organization where the participant has been placed to perform services and the State of Oregon. The three-party agreement shall include provisions requiring that all JOBS Plus reimbursements received by the professional placement service, professional employment organization or temporary employment agency be credited to the organization where the participant has been placed to perform services.

Contributions to such an account shall be tax deferred or tax-exempt to the extent permitted by federal and state law.

      (b) Any participant for whom an Oregon JOBS Individual Education Account contribution is made shall be eligible for access to education benefits from that participant’s individual education account for up to five years after the participant has left the JOBS Plus Program and has held a full-time, unsubsidized job for at least 30 days.

      (c) When any participant has qualified for use of that participant’s individual education account, an amount equal to that participant’s individual education account balance shall be transferred to the Director of the Office of Student Access and Completion for that participant’s use.

PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ACCESSIBILITY

 

      411.965 Policy on program accessibility. The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (1) That many persons eligible for public assistance or medical assistance programs, especially those with the lowest incomes and the greatest need for assistance, are precluded from receiving benefits because of program inaccessibility;

      (2) That program inaccessibility stems from barriers that arise in learning of the availability of benefits, in applying for benefits and in maintaining eligibility once eligibility is established;

      (3) That a gap often exists between the reading and literacy skills possessed by potential applicants to programs and the skills demanded for completion of agency application forms and procedures.
