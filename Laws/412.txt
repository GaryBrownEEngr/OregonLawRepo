      (1) “Aid” means money payments with respect to, or on behalf of, a dependent child or children and includes:

      (2) “Caretaker relative” means a dependent child’s parent or other relative by blood, marriage or adoption, as defined by the Department of Human Services by rule, who lives in a residence maintained by one or more of the relatives as the child’s or the relative’s own home.

      (3)(a) “Dependent child” means a needy child:

      (A) Whose caretaker relatives are not able to provide adequate care and support for the child without public assistance, as defined in ORS 411.010;

      412.002 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The temporary assistance for needy families program is the state’s primary safety net for families with children who live in extreme poverty; and

      (b) Outcomes for disadvantaged parenting youth improve when the parenting youth have opportunities to connect to employment, training and education programs.

      (2) In order to provide a path out of poverty for families, adults and parenting youth and to maximize the services available to assist families, adults and parenting youth in moving out of poverty, the Department of Human Services shall work with other agencies and organizations to provide the resources, referrals or services described in ORS 412.006. [2015 c.765 §1; 2019 c.602 §1]

      412.007 Determination of amount of aid; rules. (1) The eligibility for and amount of aid to be granted for any dependent child or relative pursuant to ORS 412.006 shall be determined, in accordance with the rules of the Department of Human Services, taking into account:

      (a) The income, resources and maintenance available to such child and relative from whatever source derived, allowable deductions and the statewide income and payment standards.

      (b) The income and financial condition of the stepparent, if any, of the child for whom aid is sought.

      (2) Subsection (1)(b) of this section is not intended to relieve any parent of any legal obligation with respect to the support of the natural or adopted children of the parent.

      (3) In determining the eligibility for and amount of aid to be granted under subsection (1) of this section and under ORS 411.070, the department shall disregard:

      (a) From income, no less than $50 of the amount of child support received for each child per month, up to a total of $200 or the maximum established by federal law, for the family;

      (b) As resources, moneys held in a pension or retirement account; and

      Note: 412.007 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      412.009 Engagement in JOBS; disqualification; rules. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) There is evidence that families who experience the most disqualifications from the job opportunity and basic skills program are often those with the most barriers to employment; and

      (b) The loss of income from a program disqualification adds strain and creates instability in families already experiencing extreme poverty, and this affects the health and food security of the dependent children in the family.

      (2) The Department of Human Services by rule shall adopt proven methods of encouraging participants’ full engagement in the job opportunity and basic skills program, including the development of an individualized case plan and an ongoing process to ensure that the case plan is appropriate.

      (3)(a) The department shall facilitate the participation of needy caretaker relatives and may not reduce the family’s aid payment as a method of encouraging full engagement in the job opportunity and basic skills program pursuant to subsection (2) of this section until the department determines that the needy caretaker relative that is not fully engaged:

      (A) Has no identified barriers or refuses to take appropriate steps to address identified barriers to participation in the program; and

      (B) Refuses without good cause, as defined by the department by rule, to meet the requirements of an individualized and appropriate case plan.

      (b) The department may not reduce aid payments under this subsection to families:

      (A) Receiving aid pursuant to ORS 412.014 or 412.124;

      (B) In which the caretaker relative participates in suitable activities for the number of hours required each month to satisfy federally required participation rates; or

      (C) Until the department has screened for and, if appropriate, assessed barriers to participation, including but not limited to physical or mental health needs, substance abuse, domestic violence or learning needs.

      (c) The department may not reduce aid payments under this subsection before assessing the risk of harm posed to the children in the household by the reduction in aid payments and taking steps to ameliorate the risk.

      (4) Following notice and an opportunity for a hearing under ORS chapter 183 and subject to subsection (2) of this section, the department may reduce the aid payment to the family of an individual who refuses to participate in suitable activities required by the individual’s case plan or may terminate the aid payment to the family of a noncompliant individual in accordance with procedures adopted by the department by rule.

      (5) A caretaker relative may request a hearing to contest the basis for a reduction in or termination of an aid payment under this section within 90 days of a reduction in or termination of aid.

      (6) Every six months, the department shall report to the Family Services Review Commission established under ORS 411.075 the status of and outcomes for families for whom aid has been reduced or terminated under subsection (4) of this section. The department shall work with the commission to establish the details to be provided in the report. [Formerly 418.045; 2011 c.604 §2; 2015 c.765 §12; 2019 c.602 §9]

      412.011 Support service payments to prevent loss of employment. The Department of Human Services may provide support service payments, as prescribed by rule, for transportation, housing or other costs as necessary to prevent the loss of employment that will result in the family qualifying for temporary assistance for needy families program aid under ORS 412.006. [2015 c.765 §2; 2019 c.602 §3]

 

      Note: 412.011 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      412.014 State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program; rules. (1) There is created in the Department of Human Services the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program. The department shall provide aid under this section to families that are eligible for temporary assistance for needy families under ORS 412.001 to 412.069 and that include a needy caretaker relative who is unable to maintain substantial gainful activity due to a disability or combination of disabilities that meet the criteria of section 216 of the Social Security Act.

      (2) The department shall assist families receiving aid under this section in qualifying for federal Supplemental Security Income and Social Security disability benefits, including obtaining necessary medical records and evaluations. The department shall maintain a list of lawyers admitted to the bar of any state and approved by the Social Security Administration and nonprofit legal services organizations that represent Oregon residents in administrative hearings before the Social Security Administration Office of Disability Adjudication and Review.

      (3) The department shall adopt rules for determining the amount of aid granted under this section that is not less than the amount of aid granted under ORS 412.006 (1).

      (4) Participation in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program shall be voluntary. The department shall provide information to potential participants in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program about the opportunities for employment while receiving Supplemental Security Income and about employment resources available to State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program participants. The information must be in a format accessible to the potential participant.

      (5) Participants in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program must cooperate with the department in establishing eligibility for Supplemental Security Income including, but not limited to, signing an interim assistance reimbursement agreement. The department by rule may establish policies for monitoring and encouraging full engagement in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program, including activities that promote family stability. The department shall offer participants the opportunity to participate in any suitable activity in the job opportunity and basic skills program under ORS 412.009. [2007 c.861 §8; 2009 c.11 §54; 2011 c.46 §1; 2011 c.604 §§3,4; 2019 c.602 §4]

      (2) To enroll in and attend an educational institution as an allowable work activity, a parent must:

      (a) Be accepted for full-time attendance into or be enrolled full-time at an educational institution;

      (3) A parent who is enrolled at an educational institution under this section shall receive temporary assistance for needy families under ORS 412.001 to 412.069 as well as be eligible for other support services under the temporary assistance for needy families program.

      (5) The department shall adopt rules to implement and administer this section.

      (6) As used in this section, “educational institution” has the meaning given that term in ORS 348.105. [2003 c.212 §1; 2009 c.11 §55; 2019 c.602 §5]

 

      Note: 412.016 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      412.024 Assignment of support rights; cooperation required for establishing paternity of child or obtaining support; exceptions; sanctions; rules. (1) An applicant or recipient of aid, except for recipients of aid under the JOBS Plus Program established in ORS 411.878, must assign to the state any rights to support that may be due from any other person to a family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid. If aid is paid and received for the support of a child, the rights to child support that any person may have for the child are deemed to have been assigned by operation of law to the state. Notice of the assignment by operation of law shall be given to the applicant at the time of application for public assistance, and shall be given to any obligee who may hold some interest in such support rights by depositing a notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the last-known address of such person. Assignment of support rights to the state shall be as set forth in rules adopted by the Department of Human Services and the Department of Justice.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an applicant or recipient who receives aid shall cooperate with the Department of Human Services and the Department of Justice in establishing the paternity of the applicant’s or recipient’s child born out of wedlock and in obtaining support or other payments or property due the applicant or child. An applicant or recipient is not required to cooperate if there is good cause or some other exception to the cooperation requirement that takes into account the best interest of the child. The Department of Human Services shall adopt rules defining good cause, other exceptions to cooperation and noncooperation by an applicant or recipient, and setting the sanction for noncooperation. The sanction may include total ineligibility of the family for aid, but in no situation may the sanction be less than a 25 percent reduction of the monthly grant amount. At the time an applicant applies for aid, the Department of Human Services shall inform the applicant, in writing, of the requirement of and exceptions to cooperation and the sanctions for noncooperation, and shall inform recipients, in writing, whenever eligibility for aid is redetermined.

      (3) This section shall apply to recipients of aid pursuant to the temporary assistance for needy families program as long as the aid is funded in whole or in part with federal grants under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act. [Formerly 418.042; 2009 c.80 §7; 2011 c.604 §5; 2015 c.765 §13]

 

      412.025 [1961 c.633 §5; 1963 c.446 §1; 1965 c.40 §1; 1973 c.651 §4; 2005 c.22 §280; repealed by 2005 c.381 §30]

 

      412.026 Payment of aid to individual other than relative; rules. Subject to rules of the Department of Human Services and to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed pursuant to the temporary assistance for needy families program:

      (1) Money payments of aid with respect to the temporary assistance for needy families program, including payments to meet the needs of the relative, and the relative’s spouse, with whom a dependent child is living, may be made to an individual other than such relative or spouse if it is determined by the department that the relative to whom such payments are made has such inability to manage funds that continuation of such payments to the relative would be contrary to the welfare of such child and that, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid through payments in the manner authorized by this section. Such determination shall be subject to review and hearing, upon application of such relative, in the manner prescribed pursuant to ORS 412.069. However, the pendency of such application, review or hearing shall not stay the effect of such determination.

      (2) The department may designate any responsible individual, including any public officer or employee, as a representative payee if such individual is willing to act in such capacity. Representative payees shall receive no compensation for their services, but shall be allowed expenses actually and necessarily incurred by them in the performance of their duties under ORS 412.029. Such expenses shall be paid from funds appropriated to the department for administrative expenditures.

      (3) During the time payments of aid pursuant to the temporary assistance for needy families program with respect to a dependent child or relative are made to a representative payee, the department shall:

      (a) Undertake and continue special efforts to develop greater ability on the part of such relative to manage funds in such manner as to protect the welfare of the relative and the family of the relative; and

      (b) Periodically review the determination made pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and terminate payments to the representative payee if it is established by such review that the conditions justifying such determination no longer exist. [Formerly 418.050]

 

      412.028 Petition for and appointment of guardian or conservator; costs; compensation. (1) If, after such period as may be prescribed by the Department of Human Services, it appears to the department that the need for money payments of aid to a representative payee is continuing or likely to continue in any case, the department may petition for the judicial appointment of a guardian or a conservator of the estate of the relative referred to in ORS 412.026 (1). If a guardian or a conservator of the estate of the relative is appointed and duly qualified, money payments of aid otherwise payable to the relative, or representative payee, shall be paid to the guardian or the conservator until the department determines that the conditions which would justify money payments of aid to a representative payee under ORS 412.026 no longer exist.

      (2) Subject to funds made available to the department for administrative expenditures, the department shall, with respect to any guardianship or conservatorship established under this section:

      (a) Pay all costs and fees reasonably incurred in obtaining the appointment of the guardian or the conservator, including any necessary bond premiums;

      (b) Pay all costs and fees necessarily incurred by the guardian or the conservator in administering money payments of aid received by the guardian or conservator under this section; and

      (c) Compensate the guardian or the conservator, for the fees in administering the money payments, according to schedules of fees prescribed by rule or regulation of the department. [Formerly 418.054]

 

      412.029 Expenditures limited to needs of beneficiary; rules. Each money payment of aid made to a representative payee or to a guardian or a conservator under ORS 412.026 or 412.028 shall be expended by the representative payee, guardian or conservator solely to make purchases to meet the needs of the individuals with respect to whom the payment is made. However, the individuals may receive from the representative payee, guardian or conservator such portions of the money payments, and at such intervals, as may be permitted by rules adopted by the Department of Human Services. [Formerly 418.059; 2015 c.765 §14; 2019 c.602 §11]

 

      412.030 [Repealed by 1961 c.633 §14]

 

      412.034 Denial of aid when unemployed parent refuses employment. Aid under ORS 412.006 shall not be granted with respect to, or on behalf of, a dependent child living with an unemployed parent if, and for as long as, the unemployed parent of such child refuses without good cause to accept employment in which the unemployed parent is able to engage and which is offered through any employment office defined in ORS 657.010 or which is otherwise offered by any employer if such offer is determined by the Department of Human Services after notification by such employer to be a bona fide offer of such employment. [Formerly 418.075]

      (2) During any period in which aid may be granted under ORS 412.006 with respect to, or on behalf of, a dependent child living with an unemployed caretaker relative, the Department of Human Services and the Director of the Employment Department shall enter into cooperative arrangements looking toward employment of or training services for the unemployed caretaker relative and shall provide for the registration and periodic reregistration of such caretaker relative at employment offices established pursuant to ORS 657.705 to 657.725 to effect maximum utilization of the job placement services and other services and facilities of such offices. [Formerly 418.085; 2015 c.765 §15]

      412.161 Policy on two-parent families. The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (1) That the provision of public assistance to children in very low income families would help keep families together and reduce hardship in times of high unemployment;

      (2) That the lack of public assistance to two-parent unemployed families does not produce significant financial savings for the State of Oregon since family break-up increases the number of single-parent families receiving public assistance;

      (3) That children in two-parent unemployed families have needs as urgent as those of children in single-parent unemployed families;

      (4) That the provision of public assistance to two-parent unemployed families may provide access to medical care for these families, health being one of the prerequisites to seeking and maintaining employment;

      (5) That because federal law requires active participation in employment and other alternatives to be eligible for federal funds for public assistance, the availability of federal funds helps those families who are trying hardest to help themselves be self-supporting; and

      (6) That additional funds need to be made available in the temporary assistance for needy families program to effectuate this policy. [Formerly 418.180; 2015 c.765 §21]
