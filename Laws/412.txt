      (a) The temporary assistance for needy families program is the state’s primary safety net for families with children who live in extreme poverty; and

      (b) Outcomes for disadvantaged parenting youth improve when the parenting youth have opportunities to connect to employment, training and education programs.

      (2) In order to provide a path out of poverty for families, adults and parenting youth and to maximize the services available to assist families, adults and parenting youth in moving out of poverty, the Department of Human Services shall work with other agencies and organizations to provide:

      (a) Cash aid to families;

      (b) Strength-based case management;

      (c) Work and work preparation services;

      (d) Family stability resources and support; and

      Note: 412.002 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      412.005 [1961 c.633 §2; 1965 c.94 §1; 1969 c.69 §1; 1969 c.597 §246; 1973 c.651 §3; 2001 c.900 §98; repealed by 2005 c.381 §30]

 

      412.006 Eligibility for aid; assessment; JOBS participation; rules. (1) Aid pursuant to the temporary assistance for needy families program shall be granted under this section to families with dependent children residing in this state.

      (2) Except as provided in subsections (6) and (7) of this section, a needy caretaker relative may be required to participate in the job opportunity and basic skills program that is described in subsections (3) to (5) of this section.

      (3) The department shall use a basic assessment tool to determine if a needy caretaker relative applying for or receiving aid under this section has or may have a barrier to employment or to family stability. If the basic assessment tool indicates that there is or may be a barrier, the needy caretaker relative shall be referred for an in-depth assessment by a person with relevant expertise or specialized training.

      (4) Based upon the assessment described in subsection (3) of this section, the department, in cooperation with appropriate partner agencies or professionals, may work with the participant to create an effective individualized case plan that establishes goals and identifies suitable activities that promote family stability and financial independence.

      (5) For individuals with disabilities, the goal of the individualized case plan must be to promote greater independence.

      (6) A needy caretaker relative receiving aid under ORS 412.001 to 412.069 may volunteer for but may not be required to participate in the job opportunity and basic skills program:

      (a) More than 10 hours per week during the first two months of the third trimester of the parent’s pregnancy;

      (A) The department may require a parent to participate in suitable activities, with a preference for educational activities, 16 weeks after the birth of a child if the parent is under 20 years of age; and

      (B) The department may require a parent of a child under 12 months of age to participate in evidence-based parenting classes or family stability activities;

      (e) If participation is likely to cause undue hardship or is contrary to the best interests of the child or needy caretaker relative; or

      (f) If the department determines that a needy caretaker relative is exempt according to criteria adopted by rule.

      (7) The department shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section. [Formerly 418.040; 2009 c.11 §53; 2015 c.765 §11]

 

      Note: Sections 1 and 8, chapter 604, Oregon Laws 2011, provide:

      Sec. 1. Notwithstanding ORS 411.070, 412.006, 412.009 and 412.016, the Department of Human Services may:

      (1) Prescribe by rule an employability assessment and orientation process that the department shall use to determine the level of participation by individuals applying for or receiving aid pursuant to the temporary assistance for needy families program and required to participate in the job opportunity and basic skills program described in ORS 412.006. This process must occur prior to any assessment described in ORS 412.006 (3) that is conducted by the department.

      (2) Require all families to participate in the employability assessment and orientation process as a condition for the family’s receipt of aid.

      (3) Limit in the job opportunity and basic skills program, for existing and future applicants and recipients of aid, based on the results of the employability assessment or other criteria:

      (a) The number of participants;

      (b) The activities; or

      (c) The level of participation.

      (4) Require an individual in a one-parent family to participate in the job opportunity and basic skills program while caring for a dependent child who is under two years of age.

      (5) Not approve enrollment in and attendance at an educational institution as an allowable work activity for purposes of ORS 412.001 to 412.069, except for recipients who have a case plan in effect on June 30, 2011, that approves enrollment in and attendance at an educational institution as an allowable work activity under ORS 412.016.

      (6) Deny or terminate aid to a family in which a caretaker relative is separated from employment without good cause, subject to exceptions prescribed by the department by rule. The family shall be ineligible to receive aid for a period of 120 days beginning on the date the caretaker relative is separated from employment without good cause.

      (7) Establish an income eligibility limit equal to 185 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for aid to a dependent child residing with a caretaker relative who is not the child’s parent. [2011 c.604 §1; 2012 c.107 §82; 2013 c.722 §23; 2015 c.765 §22]

      Sec. 8. Section 1, chapter 604, Oregon Laws 2011, as amended by section 82, chapter 107, Oregon Laws 2012, section 23, chapter 722, Oregon Laws 2013, and section 22, chapter 765, Oregon Laws 2015, is repealed on July 1, 2019. [2011 c.604 §8; 2013 c.722 §25; 2015 c.765 §24; 2017 c.725 §7]

 

      412.007 Determination of amount of aid; rules. (1) The eligibility for and amount of aid to be granted for any dependent child or relative pursuant to ORS 412.006 shall be determined, in accordance with the rules of the Department of Human Services, taking into account:

      (a) The income, resources and maintenance available to such child and relative from whatever source derived, allowable deductions and the statewide income and payment standards.

      (b) The income and financial condition of the stepparent, if any, of the child for whom aid is sought.

      (2) Subsection (1)(b) of this section is not intended to relieve any parent of any legal obligation with respect to the support of the natural or adopted children of the parent.

      (3) In determining the eligibility for and amount of aid to be granted under subsection (1) of this section and under ORS 411.070, the department shall:

      (a) Disregard no less than $50 of the amount of child support received for each child per month, up to a total of $200 or the maximum established by federal law, for the family; and

      (b) Disregard any other amounts of income and resources of the family as the department may prescribe by rule. [2015 c.765 §4]

 

      Note: 412.007 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      412.009 Engagement in JOBS; disqualification; rules. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) There is evidence that families who experience the most disqualifications from the job opportunity and basic skills program are often those with the most barriers to employment; and

      (b) The loss of income from a program disqualification adds strain and creates instability in families already experiencing extreme poverty, and this affects the health and food security of the dependent children in the family.

      (2) The Department of Human Services by rule shall adopt proven methods of encouraging participants’ full engagement in the job opportunity and basic skills program, including the development of an individualized case plan in accordance with ORS 412.006 and an ongoing process to ensure that the case plan is appropriate.

      (3)(a) The department shall facilitate the participation of needy caretaker relatives and may not reduce the family’s aid payment as a method of encouraging full engagement in the job opportunity and basic skills program pursuant to subsection (2) of this section until the department determines that the needy caretaker relative that is not fully engaged:

      (A) Has no identified barriers or refuses to take appropriate steps to address identified barriers to participation in the program; and

      (B) Refuses without good cause, as defined by the department by rule, to meet the requirements of an individualized and appropriate case plan.

      (b) The department may not reduce aid payments under this subsection to families:

      (A) Receiving aid pursuant to ORS 412.014 or 412.124;

      (B) In which the caretaker relative participates in suitable activities for the number of hours required each month to satisfy federally required participation rates; or

      (C) Until the department has screened for and, if appropriate, assessed barriers to participation, including but not limited to physical or mental health needs, substance abuse, domestic violence or learning needs.

      (c) The department may not reduce aid payments under this subsection before assessing the risk of harm posed to the children in the household by the reduction in aid payments and taking steps to ameliorate the risk.

      (4) Following notice and an opportunity for a hearing under ORS chapter 183 and subject to subsection (2) of this section, the department may reduce the aid payment to the family of an individual who refuses to participate in suitable activities required by the individual’s case plan or may terminate the aid payment to the family of a noncompliant individual in accordance with procedures adopted by the department by rule.

      (5) A caretaker relative may request a hearing to contest the basis for a reduction in or termination of an aid payment under this section within 90 days of a reduction in or termination of aid.

      (6) Every six months, the department shall report to the Family Services Review Commission established under ORS 411.075 the status of and outcomes for families for whom aid has been reduced or terminated under subsection (4) of this section. The department shall work with the commission to establish the details to be provided in the report. [Formerly 418.045; 2011 c.604 §2; 2015 c.765 §12]

 

      412.010 [Repealed by 1961 c.633 §14]

 

      412.011 Support service payments to prevent loss of employment. The Department of Human Services may provide support service payments for transportation, housing or other costs as necessary to prevent the loss of employment that will result in the family qualifying for temporary assistance for needy families program aid under ORS 412.006. [2015 c.765 §2]

 

      Note: 412.011 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      412.014 State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program; rules. (1) There is created in the Department of Human Services the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program. The department shall provide aid under this section to families that are eligible for temporary assistance for needy families under ORS 412.001 to 412.069 and that include a needy caretaker relative who is unable to maintain substantial gainful activity due to a disability or combination of disabilities that meet the criteria of section 216 of the Social Security Act.

      (2) The department shall assist families receiving aid under this section in qualifying for federal Supplemental Security Income and Social Security disability benefits, including obtaining necessary medical records and evaluations. The department shall maintain a list of lawyers admitted to the bar of any state and approved by the Social Security Administration and nonprofit legal services organizations that represent Oregon residents in administrative hearings before the Social Security Administration Office of Disability Adjudication and Review.

      (3) The department shall adopt rules for determining the amount of aid granted under this section that is not less than the amount of aid granted under ORS 412.006 (1).

      (4) Participation in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program shall be voluntary. The department shall provide information to potential participants in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program about the opportunities for employment while receiving Supplemental Security Income and about employment resources available to State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program participants. The information must be in a format accessible to the potential participant.

      (5) Participants in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program must cooperate with the department in establishing eligibility for Supplemental Security Income including, but not limited to, signing an interim assistance reimbursement agreement. The department by rule may establish policies for monitoring and encouraging full engagement in the State Family Pre-SSI/SSDI program, including activities that promote family stability. The department shall offer participants the opportunity to participate in any suitable activity in the job opportunity and basic skills program under ORS 412.009. [2007 c.861 §8; 2009 c.11 §54; 2011 c.46 §1; 2011 c.604 §3]

      (2) To enroll in and attend an educational institution as an allowable work activity, a parent must:

      (a) Be accepted for full-time attendance into or be enrolled full-time at an educational institution;

      (c) Make satisfactory academic progress, as defined by the educational institution, toward a degree or certificate.

      (3) A parent who is enrolled at an educational institution under this section shall receive temporary assistance for needy families under ORS 412.001 to 412.069 as well as be eligible for all other support services under the temporary assistance for needy families program. Assistance under this section does not include tuition and fees associated with enrollment at an educational institution.

      (4) The Department of Human Services shall inform all parents applying for or participating in the temporary assistance for needy families program of the option to enroll in an educational institution and the requirements under subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) The department shall adopt rules to implement and administer this section.

      (6) As used in this section, “educational institution” has the meaning given that term in ORS 348.105. [2003 c.212 §1; 2009 c.11 §55]

 

      Note: 412.016 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

[2003 c.212 §2; 2009 c.335 §1]

 

      Note: 412.017 was added to and made a part of 412.001 to 412.161 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      412.020 [Repealed by 1961 c.633 §14]

 

      412.024 Assignment of support rights; cooperation required for establishing paternity of child or obtaining support; exceptions; sanctions; rules. (1) An applicant or recipient of aid, except for recipients of aid under the JOBS Plus Program established in ORS 411.878, must assign to the state any rights to support that may be due from any other person to a family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid. If aid is paid and received for the support of a child, the rights to child support that any person may have for the child are deemed to have been assigned by operation of law to the state. Notice of the assignment by operation of law shall be given to the applicant at the time of application for public assistance, and shall be given to any obligee who may hold some interest in such support rights by depositing a notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the last-known address of such person. Assignment of support rights to the state shall be as set forth in rules adopted by the Department of Human Services and the Department of Justice.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an applicant or recipient who receives aid shall cooperate with the Department of Human Services and the Department of Justice in establishing the paternity of the applicant’s or recipient’s child born out of wedlock and in obtaining support or other payments or property due the applicant or child. An applicant or recipient is not required to cooperate if there is good cause or some other exception to the cooperation requirement that takes into account the best interest of the child. The Department of Human Services shall adopt rules defining good cause, other exceptions to cooperation and noncooperation by an applicant or recipient, and setting the sanction for noncooperation. The sanction may include total ineligibility of the family for aid, but in no situation may the sanction be less than a 25 percent reduction of the monthly grant amount. At the time an applicant applies for aid, the Department of Human Services shall inform the applicant, in writing, of the requirement of and exceptions to cooperation and the sanctions for noncooperation, and shall inform recipients, in writing, whenever eligibility for aid is redetermined.

      (3) This section shall apply to recipients of aid pursuant to the temporary assistance for needy families program as long as the aid is funded in whole or in part with federal grants under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act. [Formerly 418.042; 2009 c.80 §7; 2011 c.604 §5; 2015 c.765 §13]

      412.026 Payment of aid to individual other than relative; rules. Subject to rules of the Department of Human Services and to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed pursuant to the temporary assistance for needy families program:

      (1) Money payments of aid with respect to the temporary assistance for needy families program, including payments to meet the needs of the relative, and the relative’s spouse, with whom a dependent child is living, may be made to an individual other than such relative or spouse if it is determined by the department that the relative to whom such payments are made has such inability to manage funds that continuation of such payments to the relative would be contrary to the welfare of such child and that, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid through payments in the manner authorized by this section. Such determination shall be subject to review and hearing, upon application of such relative, in the manner prescribed pursuant to ORS 412.069. However, the pendency of such application, review or hearing shall not stay the effect of such determination.

      (2) The department may designate any responsible individual, including any public officer or employee, as a representative payee if such individual is willing to act in such capacity. Representative payees shall receive no compensation for their services, but shall be allowed expenses actually and necessarily incurred by them in the performance of their duties under ORS 412.029. Such expenses shall be paid from funds appropriated to the department for administrative expenditures.

      (a) Pay all costs and fees reasonably incurred in obtaining the appointment of the guardian or the conservator, including any necessary bond premiums;

However, the individuals may receive from the representative payee, guardian or conservator such portions of the money payments and at such intervals as may be permitted by rules adopted by the Department of Human Services.

      (3) If the needy caretaker relatives cease to participate in employment or suitable activities for a sufficient number of hours each month to satisfy federally required participation rates, the department shall determine eligibility under ORS 412.006 based upon information available to the department. If the department does not have sufficient information available to determine eligibility for aid under ORS 412.006, the department shall provide notice and an opportunity for hearing prior to terminating aid. The notice must state the information that the department lacks and that the caretaker relatives must provide to complete the determination for aid.

      412.161 Policy on two-parent families. The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (1) That the provision of public assistance to children in very low income families would help keep families together and reduce hardship in times of high unemployment;

      (2) That the lack of public assistance to two-parent unemployed families does not produce significant financial savings for the State of Oregon since family break-up increases the number of single-parent families receiving public assistance;

      (3) That children in two-parent unemployed families have needs as urgent as those of children in single-parent unemployed families;

      (4) That the provision of public assistance to two-parent unemployed families may provide access to medical care for these families, health being one of the prerequisites to seeking and maintaining employment;

      (5) That because federal law requires active participation in employment and other alternatives to be eligible for federal funds for public assistance, the availability of federal funds helps those families who are trying hardest to help themselves be self-supporting; and

      (6) That additional funds need to be made available in the temporary assistance for needy families program to effectuate this policy. [Formerly 418.180; 2015 c.765 §21]
