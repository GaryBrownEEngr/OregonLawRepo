      (c) The committee shall use a public process that includes an opportunity for public comment to identify health outcome and quality measures that may be applied to services provided by coordinated care organizations or paid for by health benefit plans sold through the health insurance exchange or offered by the Oregon Educators Benefit Board or the Public Employees’ Benefit Board.

      (A) Utilize existing state and national health outcome and quality measures, including measures adopted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, that have been adopted or endorsed by other state or national organizations and have a relevant state or national benchmark;

      (B) Given the context in which each measure is applied, are not prone to random variations based on the size of the denominator;

      (C) Utilize existing data systems, to the extent practicable, for reporting the measures to minimize redundant reporting and undue burden on the state, health benefit plans and health care providers;

      (D) Can be meaningfully adopted for a minimum of three years;

      (E) Use a common format in the collection of the data and facilitate the public reporting of the data; and

      (F) Can be reported in a timely manner and without significant delay so that the most current and actionable data is available.

      (e) The committee shall evaluate on a regular and ongoing basis the health outcome and quality measures adopted under this section.

      (f) The committee may convene subcommittees to focus on gaining expertise in particular areas such as data collection, health care research and mental health and substance use disorders in order to aid the committee in the development of health outcome and quality measures. A subcommittee may include stakeholders and staff from the Oregon Health Authority, the Department of Human Services, the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the Early Learning Council or any other agency staff with the appropriate expertise in the issues addressed by the subcommittee.

      (g) This subsection does not prevent the Oregon Health Authority, the Department of Consumer and Business Services, commercial insurers, the Public Employees’ Benefit Board or the Oregon Educators Benefit Board from establishing programs that provide financial incentives to providers for meeting specific health outcome and quality measures adopted by the committee.

      (5) Members of the committees described in subsections (2) to (4) of this section who are not members of the Oregon Health Policy Board are not entitled to compensation but shall be reimbursed from funds available to the board for actual and necessary travel and other expenses incurred by them by their attendance at committee meetings, in the manner and amount provided in ORS 292.495. [2009 c.595 §7; 2015 c.3 §43; 2015 c.389 §2]

      (a) Define core attributes of a patient centered primary care home and a behavioral health home to promote a reasonable level of consistency of services provided by patient centered primary care homes and behavioral health homes in this state. In defining core attributes related to ensuring that care is coordinated, the authority shall focus on determining whether these patient centered primary care homes and behavioral health homes offer comprehensive primary and preventive care, integrated health care and disease management services;

      (b) Establish a simple and uniform process to identify patient centered primary care homes that meet the core attributes defined by the authority under paragraph (a) of this subsection;

      (c) Develop uniform quality measures that build from nationally accepted measures and allow for standard measurement of patient centered primary care home and behavioral health home performance;

      (d) Develop uniform quality measures for acute care hospital and ambulatory services that align with the patient centered primary care home and behavioral health home quality measures developed under paragraph (c) of this subsection; and

      (e) Develop policies that encourage the retention of, and the growth in the numbers of, primary care providers.

      (2)(a) The Director of the Oregon Health Authority shall appoint an advisory committee to advise the authority in carrying out subsection (1) of this section.

Claims for expenses shall be paid out of funds appropriated to the authority for the purposes of the advisory committee.

      (d) The advisory committee shall use public input to guide policy development.

      (3) The authority will also establish, as part of the patient centered primary care home program, learning collaboratives in which state agencies, private health insurance carriers, third party administrators, patient centered primary care homes and behavioral health homes can:

      (a) Share information about quality improvement;

      (b) Share best practices that increase access to culturally competent and linguistically appropriate care;

      (c) Share best practices that increase the adoption and use of the latest techniques in effective and cost-effective patient centered care;

      (f) Coordinate efforts to conduct research on patient centered primary care homes and behavioral health homes and evaluate strategies to implement patient centered primary care homes and behavioral health homes that include integrated health care to improve health status and quality and reduce overall health care costs; and

      (g) Share best practices for maximizing integration to ensure that patients have access to comprehensive primary and preventive care, integrated health care and disease management services.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly declares that collaboration among public payers, private health carriers, third party purchasers and providers to identify appropriate reimbursement methods to align incentives in support of patient centered primary care homes and behavioral health homes is in the best interest of the public. The Legislative Assembly therefore declares its intent to exempt from state antitrust laws, and to provide immunity from federal antitrust laws, the collaborative and associated payment reforms designed and implemented under subsection (3) of this section that might otherwise be constrained by such laws. The Legislative Assembly does not authorize any person or entity to engage in activities or to conspire to engage in activities that would constitute per se violations of state or federal antitrust laws including, but not limited to, agreements among competing health care providers or health carriers as to the prices of specific levels of reimbursement for health care services.

      (5) The authority may contract with a public or private entity to facilitate the work of the learning collaborative described in subsection (3) of this section and may apply for, receive and accept grants, gifts, payments and other funds and advances, appropriations, properties and services from the United States, the State of Oregon or any governmental body or agency or from any other public or private corporation or person for the purpose of establishing and maintaining the collaborative.

(1) The Legislative Assembly finds that persons with limited English proficiency, or who communicate in sign language, are often unable to interact effectively with health care providers. Because of language differences, persons with limited English proficiency, or who communicate in sign language, are often excluded from health care services, experience delays or denials of health care services or receive health care services based on inaccurate or incomplete information.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly further finds that the lack of competent health care interpreters among health care providers impedes the free flow of communication between the health care provider and patient, preventing clear and accurate communication and the development of empathy, confidence and mutual trust that is essential for an effective relationship between health care provider and patient.

      (3) It is the policy of the Legislative Assembly to require the use of certified health care interpreters or qualified health care interpreters whenever possible to ensure the accurate and adequate provision of health care to persons with limited English proficiency and to persons who communicate in sign language.

      (4) It is the policy of the Legislative Assembly that health care for persons with limited English proficiency be provided according to the guidelines established under the policy statement issued August 30, 2000, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights, entitled, “Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Policy Guidance on the Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination As It Affects Persons With Limited English Proficiency,” and the 1978 Patient’s Bill of Rights.
