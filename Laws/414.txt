GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      414.018 Legislative intent; findings. (1) It is the intention of the Legislative Assembly to achieve the goals of universal access to an adequate level of high quality health care at an affordable cost.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (a) A significant level of public and private funds is expended each year for the provision of health care to Oregonians;

      (b) The state has a strong interest in assisting Oregon businesses and individuals to obtain reasonably available insurance or other coverage of the costs of necessary basic health care services;

      (c) The lack of basic health care coverage is detrimental not only to the health of individuals lacking coverage, but also to the public welfare and the state’s need to encourage employment growth and economic development, and the lack results in substantial expenditures for emergency and remedial health care for all purchasers of health care including the state; and

      (d) The use of integrated and coordinated health care systems has significant potential to reduce the growth of health care costs incurred by the people of this state.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly finds that achieving its goals of improving health, increasing the quality, reliability, availability and continuity of care and reducing the cost of care requires an integrated and coordinated health care system in which:

      (a) Medical assistance recipients and individuals who are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid participate.

      (b) Health care services, other than Medicaid-funded long term care services, are delivered through coordinated care contracts that use alternative payment methodologies to focus on prevention, improving health equity and reducing health disparities, utilizing patient centered primary care homes, behavioral health homes, evidence-based practices and health information technology to improve health and health care.

      (c) High quality information is collected and used to measure health outcomes, health care quality and costs and clinical health information.

      (d) Communities and regions are accountable for improving the health of their communities and regions, reducing avoidable health gaps among different cultural groups and managing health care resources.

      (e) Care and services emphasize preventive services and services supporting individuals to live independently at home or in their community.

      (f) Services are person centered, and provide choice, independence and dignity reflected in individual plans and provide assistance in accessing care and services.

      (g) Interactions between the Oregon Health Authority and coordinated care organizations are done in a transparent and public manner.

      (h) Moneys provided by the federal government for medical education are allocated to the institutions that provide the education.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly further finds that there is an extreme need for a skilled, diverse workforce to meet the rapidly growing demand for community-based health care. To meet that need, this state must:

      (a) Build on existing training programs; and

      (b) Provide an opportunity for frontline care providers to have a voice in their workplace in order to effectively advocate for quality care.

      (5) As used in subsection (3) of this section:

      (a) “Community” means the groups within the geographic area served by a coordinated care organization and includes groups that identify themselves by age, ethnicity, race, economic status, or other defining characteristic that may impact delivery of health care services to the group, as well as the governing body of each county located wholly or partially within the coordinated care organization’s service area.

      (b) “Region” means the geographical boundaries of the area served by a coordinated care organization as well as the governing body of each county that has jurisdiction over all or part of the coordinated care organization’s service area. [1993 c.815 §1; 2011 c.602 §1; 2015 c.798 §9]

(Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan)

 

      414.330 Legislative findings on prescription drugs. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The cost of prescription drugs in the medical assistance program is growing and will soon be unsustainable;

      (2) The benefit of prescription drugs when appropriately used decreases the need for other expensive treatments and improves the health of Oregonians; and

      (3) Providing the most effective drugs in the most cost-effective manner will benefit both patients and taxpayers. [2001 c.897 §1; 2009 c.595 §298a]

 

      Note: 414.330 to 414.334 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 414 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      414.332 Policy for Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan. It is the policy of the State of Oregon that a Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan will ensure that:

      (1) Oregonians have access to the most effective prescription drugs appropriate for their clinical conditions;

      (2) Decisions concerning the clinical effectiveness of prescription drugs are made by licensed health practitioners, are informed by the latest peer-reviewed research and consider the health condition of a patient or characteristics of a patient, including the patient’s gender, race or ethnicity; and

      (3) The cost of prescription drugs in the medical assistance program is managed through market competition among pharmaceutical manufacturers by considering, first, the effectiveness and safety of a given drug and, second, any substantial cost differences between drugs within the same therapeutic class. [2001 c.897 §2; 2009 c.595 §298b; 2011 c.720 §137]

 

      Note: See note under 414.330.

 

      414.334 Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan for medical assistance program. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt a Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan for the medical assistance program. The purpose of the plan is to ensure that enrollees in the medical assistance program receive the most effective prescription drug available at the best possible price.

      (2) In adopting the plan, the authority shall consider recommendations of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee.

      (3) The authority shall consult with representatives of the regulatory boards and associations representing practitioners who are prescribers under the medical assistance program and ensure that practitioners receive educational materials and have access to training on the Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan.

      (4) Notwithstanding the Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan adopted by the authority, a practitioner may prescribe any drug that the practitioner indicates is medically necessary for an enrollee as being the most effective available.

      (5) An enrollee may appeal to the authority a decision of a practitioner or the authority to not provide a prescription drug requested by the enrollee.

      (6) This section does not limit the decision of a practitioner as to the scope and duration of treatment of chronic conditions, including but not limited to arthritis, diabetes and asthma. [2001 c.897 §3; 2009 c.595 §299; 2009 c.827 §§4,10; 2011 c.720 §§138,139]

      414.337 Limitation on rules regarding Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan. The Oregon Health Authority may not adopt or amend any rule that requires a prescribing practitioner to contact the authority to request an exception for a medically appropriate or medically necessary drug that is not listed on the Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan drug list for that class of drugs adopted under ORS 414.334, unless otherwise authorized by enabling legislation setting forth the requirement for prior authorization.
