      (a) A coordinated care organization becomes eligible for a reinsurance payment when the coordinated care organization’s costs in a calendar year exceed the attachment point. The amount of the payment shall be the product of the coinsurance rate and the coordinated care organization’s costs that exceed the attachment point, up to the reinsurance cap.

      (b) After the authority adopts by rule the attachment point, reinsurance cap or coinsurance rate for a calendar year, the authority may not:

      (A) Change the attachment point or the reinsurance cap during the calendar year; or

      (B) Increase the coinsurance rate during the calendar year.

      (1) A compliance self-evaluative audit document is privileged information and is not discoverable or admissible as evidence in any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding.

[2019 c.478 §17]

 

      415.063 Permissible use of compliance self-evaluative audit document by Oregon Health Authority; consideration of document in determining of civil penalty. (1) ORS 415.062 does not prohibit the Oregon Health Authority from acquiring any compliance self-evaluative audit document or examining any person in connection with the document. If the authority determines that the actions of a coordinated care organization are egregious, the authority may introduce and use the document in any administrative proceeding or civil action under ORS 415.012 to 415.430 or rules adopted pursuant to ORS 415.011.

      (2) Any compliance self-evaluative audit document submitted to the authority under this section and in the possession of the authority remains the property of the coordinated care organization and is not subject to disclosure or production under ORS 192.311 to 192.478.

      (3)(a) The authority shall consider the corrective action taken by a coordinated care organization to eliminate problems identified in the compliance self-evaluative audit document as a mitigating factor when determining a civil penalty or other action against the coordinated care organization.

      (b) The authority may, in the authority’s sole discretion, decline to impose a civil penalty or take other action against a coordinated care organization based on information obtained from a compliance self-evaluative audit document if the coordinated care organization has taken reasonable corrective action to eliminate the problems identified in the document.

      (4) Disclosure of a compliance self-evaluative audit document to a governmental agency, whether voluntarily or pursuant to compulsion of law, does not constitute a waiver of the privilege set forth in ORS 415.062 for any other purpose.

      (5) The authority may not be compelled to produce a compliance self-evaluative audit document. [2019 c.478 §18]

 

      415.064 Waiver of privilege; permitted disclosures. (1) The privilege set forth in ORS 415.062 does not apply to the extent that the privilege is expressly waived by the coordinated care organization that prepared or caused to be prepared the compliance self-evaluative audit document.

      (2) The privilege set forth in ORS 415.062 does not apply in any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding commenced by the Attorney General relating to Medicaid fraud, without regard to whether the proceeding is brought on behalf of the state, a state agency or a federal agency. A coordinated care organization may request an in camera review of any document or other evidence to be released or used under this subsection and may request that appropriate protective orders be entered governing release and use of the material.

      (3) In any civil proceeding a court of record may, after an in camera review, require disclosure of material for which the privilege set forth in ORS 415.062 is asserted if the court determines that the material is not subject to the privilege, or that the privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose, including but not limited to an assertion of the privilege for a compliance audit that was conducted for the purpose of concealing a violation of any federal, state or local law or rule. This subsection may not be construed to prohibit the Oregon Health Authority from acquiring, examining and using compliance self-evaluative audit documents under ORS 415.062.

      (4) In a criminal proceeding, a court of record may, after an in camera review, require disclosure of material for which the privilege set forth in ORS 415.062 is asserted if the court determines that:

      (a) The privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose, including but not limited to an assertion of the privilege for a compliance audit that was conducted for the purpose of concealing a violation of any federal, state or local law or rule;

      (b) The material is not subject to the privilege; or

      (c) The material contains evidence relevant to commission of a criminal offense, and:

      (A) A district attorney or the Attorney General has a compelling need for the information;

      (B) The information is not otherwise available; or

      (C) The district attorney or Attorney General is unable to obtain the substantial equivalent of the information by any other means without incurring unreasonable cost and delay. [2019 c.478 §19]

 

      415.065 Petition for in camera hearing on privilege of compliance self-evaluative audit document; hearing on petition; compelled disclosure. (1) Within 30 days after a district attorney or the Attorney General serves on a coordinated care organization a written request by certified mail for disclosure of a compliance self-evaluative audit document, the coordinated care organization that prepared or caused the document to be prepared may file in circuit court a petition requesting an in camera hearing on whether the compliance self-evaluative audit document or portions of the document are privileged under ORS 415.062 or subject to disclosure. Failure by the coordinated care organization to file a petition waives the privilege only with respect to the specific request.

      (2) A petition filed by a coordinated care organization under this section must contain the following information:

      (a) The date of the compliance self-evaluative audit document.

      (b) The identity of the person that conducted the audit.

      (c) The general nature of the activities covered by the compliance audit.

      (d) An identification of the portions of the compliance self-evaluative audit document for which the privilege is being asserted.

      (3) Within 45 days after the filing of a petition by a coordinated care organization under this section, the court shall schedule an in camera hearing to determine whether the compliance self-evaluative audit document or portions of the document are privileged under ORS 415.062.

      (4) The court, after an in camera review pursuant to this section, may require disclosure of material for which the privilege established by ORS 415.062 is asserted if the court determines that any of the conditions set forth in ORS 415.064 or 415.066 are met. Upon making such a determination, the court may compel the disclosure of only those portions of a compliance self-evaluative audit document relevant to issues in dispute in the underlying proceeding. Any disclosure that is compelled by the court will not be considered to be a public document or be deemed to be a waiver of the privilege for any other civil, criminal or administrative proceeding. A party unsuccessfully opposing disclosure may apply to the court for an appropriate order protecting the document from further disclosure.

      (5) A coordinated care organization asserting the privilege established under ORS 415.062 has the burden of establishing that the privilege applies. If the coordinated care organization establishes that the privilege applies, a party seeking disclosure under ORS 415.064 has the burden of proving the elements set forth in ORS 415.064. [2019 c.478 §20]

 

      415.066 Exceptions to privilege of compliance self-evaluative audit document. The privilege established under ORS 415.062 does not apply to any of the following:

      (1) Documents, communications, data, reports or other information expressly required to be collected, developed, maintained or reported to the Oregon Health Authority or other regulatory agency under ORS 415.012 to 415.430, rules adopted pursuant to ORS 415.011 or other state or federal law;

      (2) Information obtained by observation or monitoring by the authority or any regulatory agency; or

The Oregon Health Authority, in connection with supervising a coordinated care organization or conducting a delinquency proceeding, may appoint one or more special deputy directors to act for the authority and may employ counsel, clerks and assistants as the authority deems necessary. Unless otherwise provided by the authority, a person so appointed is not a state employee solely by reason of the appointment. The compensation of the special deputies, counsel, clerks or assistants and all expenses of supervising the coordinated care organization or taking possession of a delinquent coordinated care organization and conducting delinquency proceedings must be paid out of the funds or assets of the coordinated care organization. A special deputy acting within limits the authority imposes with respect to supervising a coordinated care organization or conducting delinquency proceedings has a receiver’s powers and is subject to a receiver’s duties. [2019 c.478 §37]

 

      415.300 Rehabilitation proceeding. (1) An order to rehabilitate a coordinated care organization shall direct the Oregon Health Authority to take possession of the property of the coordinated care organization and to conduct the business of the coordinated care organization, and to take such steps toward removing the causes and conditions that made rehabilitation necessary as directed by the court.

      (2) If at any time the authority deems that further efforts to rehabilitate the coordinated care organization would be useless, the authority may apply to the court for an order of liquidation under ORS 415.335.

      (3) The authority may apply at any time for an order terminating the rehabilitation proceeding and permitting the coordinated care organization to resume possession of its property and the conduct of its business, but the order may not be granted except after a full hearing. [2019 c.478 §29]

 

      415.330 Grounds for order to liquidate. The Oregon Health Authority may apply for an order directing the authority to liquidate the business of a coordinated care organization, regardless of whether there has been a prior order directing the authority to rehabilitate the coordinated care organization, upon any of the grounds specified in ORS 415.280, or if the coordinated care organization:

      (1) Has ceased transacting business for a period of one year;

      (2) Under any laws except ORS 415.203 to 415.430 or rules adopted pursuant to ORS 415.011, has:

      (a) Commenced voluntary liquidation or dissolution;

      (b) Attempted to commence or prosecute an action or proceeding to liquidate its business or affairs;

      (c) Commenced dissolving its corporate charter; or

      (d) Commenced procuring the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or sequestrator; or

      (3) Is insolvent. [2019 c.478 §49]

 

      415.333 Powers of Oregon Health Authority in liquidation proceeding. The Oregon Health Authority, after taking possession of the property and business of any coordinated care organization, shall:

      (1) Subject to a court’s direction, immediately conduct the business of the coordinated care organization or take steps authorized by law to rehabilitate, liquidate or conserve the coordinated care organization;

      (2) Be vested with the coordinated care organization’s title and interest in and to all assets and property of every kind, both tangible and intangible;

      (3) Possess, in the name of the coordinated care organization or in the name of the authority, all rights, privileges, powers and authority granted to coordinated care organizations in this state or otherwise possessed by coordinated care organizations generally, without regard to any limitations prescribed in the articles or bylaws of the coordinated care organization; and

      (4) Perform and do all acts that the authority deems necessary, advisable or expedient. [2019 c.478 §30]

 

      415.335 Order to liquidate. (1) An order to liquidate the business of a coordinated care organization shall direct the Oregon Health Authority to:

      (a) Take possession of the property of the coordinated care organization;

      (b) Liquidate the business of the coordinated care organization;

      (c) Deal with the coordinated care organization’s property and business in the name of the authority or in the name of the coordinated care organization as the court may direct; and

      (d) Give notice to all creditors who may have claims against the coordinated care organization to present such claims.

      (2) The authority may apply to the court for an order dissolving the corporate existence of a coordinated care organization at the time the authority applies for an order to liquidate or at any time after an order to liquidate has been granted. [2019 c.478 §51]

 

      415.340 Oregon Health Authority to be appointed receiver in delinquency proceeding; powers and duties. (1) Whenever a receiver is to be appointed in delinquency proceedings for a coordinated care organization, the court shall appoint the Oregon Health Authority as the receiver. The court shall direct the receiver to take possession of the property of the coordinated care organization and to administer the property as ordered by the court.

      (2) Any deed or other instrument executed in a delinquency proceeding or by an order of liquidation shall be valid and effectual for all purposes as though the same had been executed by the person affected by any proceedings or by the officers of the coordinated care organization pursuant to the direction of its governing board. A record of the order directing possession to be taken, or a certified copy of the order, filed in the office where instruments affecting title to property are required to be filed or recorded, shall have the same effect as the filing or recording of a deed, bill of sale or other evidence of title.

      (3) If any real property sold by the authority is located in a county other than the county where the proceeding is pending, the authority shall file a certified copy of the order of the appointment, or order authorizing or ratifying the sale, with the recording officer for the county where the property is located.

      (4) The authority as receiver shall be responsible on the official bond of the authority for the proper administration of all property coming into the possession or control of the authority. The court may at any time require an additional bond from the authority or the deputies of the authority if deemed desirable for the protection of the property. [2019 c.478 §45]

 

      415.341 Immunity from civil liability for receivers. (1) The following persons are entitled to protection under this section:

      (a) All receivers responsible for the conduct of a delinquency proceeding under ORS 415.203 to 415.430, including present and former receivers.

      (b) All employees of the receiver described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. For purposes of this section, such employees include all present and former special deputies and assistant special deputies appointed by the Oregon Health Authority and all persons whom the authority, special deputies or assistant special deputies have employed to assist in a delinquency proceeding. Unless designated as special deputies, attorneys, accountants, auditors and other professional persons or firms who are retained by the receiver as independent contractors and their employees are not entitled to protection under this section.

      (2) The receiver and employees of the receiver shall have official immunity and shall be immune from civil action and liability, both personally and in their official capacities, for any tort claim or demand, whether groundless or otherwise, arising out of any alleged act, error or omission of the receiver or any employee occurring in the performance of duties. For purposes of this section, “tort” has the meaning given that term in ORS 30.260.

      (3) The receiver and employees of the receiver shall be indemnified from the assets of the coordinated care organization against any tort claim arising out of any alleged act, error or omission of the receiver or any employee occurring in the performance of duties, whether personally or in the official capacity of the receiver or employee. Any indemnification made under this subsection is an administrative expense of the coordinated care organization.

      (4) The provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not apply in case of malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty.

      (5) In any legal action in which the receiver is a defendant, the portion of any settlement relating to the alleged act, error or omission of the receiver is subject to the approval of the court before which the delinquency proceeding is pending. The court may not approve the portion of the settlement if it determines:

      (a) That the claim did not occur in the performance of the receiver’s duties; or

      (b) That the claim was caused by malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty by the receiver.

      (6) This section may not be construed or applied to deprive the receiver or any employee of any immunity, indemnity, benefits of law, rights or any defense otherwise available. [2019 c.478 §36]

 

      415.350 Right to assets of CCO fixed as of date of order to liquidate. The rights and liabilities of the coordinated care organization, its creditors and all other persons interested in its assets shall, unless otherwise directed by the court, be fixed as of the date on which an order directing the liquidation of the coordinated care organization is filed in the office of the clerk of the court that made the order, subject to the provisions of ORS 415.404 with respect to the rights of claimants holding contingent claims. [2019 c.478 §50]

 

CLAIMS AGAINST INSOLVENT COORDINATED CARE ORGANIZATION

 

      415.400 Filing proof of claim against CCO declared by court to be insolvent. (1) A court may make an order declaring a coordinated care organization insolvent at the time it grants an order of liquidation or at any time during the liquidation proceedings. When the order is issued, the Oregon Health Authority shall provide notice, in the manner determined by the court, to all persons who may have claims against the coordinated care organization and who have not filed proper proofs of their claims. The notice must instruct the persons to present their claims to the authority, at a specified place, within four months from the date of the entry of the insolvency order or within a longer time as the court prescribes. The notice must specify the last day that persons may file proofs of claims.

      (2) A claimant filing a proof of claim after the last day specified for filing a claim may share in the distribution of the assets after all allowed claims for which proofs were timely filed are paid in full. [2019 c.478 §31]

 

      415.401 Requirements for proof of claim. (1) All claims against a coordinated care organization against which delinquency proceedings have been begun shall:

      (a) Set forth in reasonable detail:

      (A) The amount of the claim or the basis upon which the amount can be ascertained;

      (B) The facts upon which the claim is based; and

      (C) The priorities asserted, if any;

      (b) Be verified by the affidavit of the claimant or someone authorized to act on behalf of the claimant and having knowledge of the facts; and

      (c) Be supported by documentation.

      (2) All claims shall be filed with the receiver on or before the last date for filing as specified in ORS 415.400.

      (3) After the expiration of any period for filing of claims, the receiver shall report the claims timely filed to the court, with recommendations for the actions to be taken by the court. Upon receipt of the report, the court shall fix a time for hearing the claims and shall direct the claimants or the receiver, as specified by the court, to give notice to interested persons, in the manner determined by the court, of the time and place of the hearing, the amount and nature of the claim, the priorities asserted, if any, and the recommendation of the receiver with respect to the claim.

      (4) All interested persons shall be entitled to appear at the hearing, and the court shall enter an order allowing, allowing in part or disallowing the claim. The order is an appealable order. [2019 c.478 §38]

 

      415.402 Preference of claims. Except as provided in ORS 415.406 for secured claims, the claims to be paid in full in delinquency proceedings against a coordinated care organization prior to the payment of any other claims, and the order of payment, shall be:

      (1) The expenses of administering the delinquency proceedings;

      (2) Claims that are legally due and owing by the coordinated care organization to the United States;

      (3) Compensation or wages owed to employees other than officers of the coordinated care organization, for services rendered within three months prior to the commencement of the delinquency proceeding, but not exceeding $5,000 for each employee;

      (4) Claims legally due and owed by the coordinated care organization to the state; and

      (5) Claims, including special deposit claims, owed to any person that by the laws of the state is entitled to priority. [2019 c.478 §42]

 

      415.403 Priority of preferred claims. All claims that are preferred under the laws of the state, whether owing to residents or nonresidents, shall be given equal priority of payment from the general assets of a coordinated care organization in a delinquency proceeding against the coordinated care organization regardless of where the assets are located. [2019 c.478 §39]

 

      415.404 Contingent claims. (1) A contingent claim against a coordinated care organization shall be filed, presented and reported in the same manner and within the same time limitations as provided in ORS 415.400 for a noncontingent claim. Contingent claims shall be allowed to share in a distribution of assets in the same manner as noncontingent claims of the same class and priority, provided that the contingent claim becomes an absolute claim either as a result of proof presented or litigation.

      (2) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section prevents or bars the Oregon Health Authority from compromising a disputed claim with a claimant, whether contingent or noncontingent, if the compromise is justified and supported by the facts and circumstances.

      (3) If full or partial distribution to noncontingent claimants is authorized or directed by the court prior to satisfaction of the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, the authority shall retain a sum equal to the amount that would have been paid on the contingent claims if the requirements in subsection (1) of this section had been met. The amount withheld shall be distributed to the person or persons found by the court to be entitled to a distribution when:

      (a) The contingent claims are fully established as provided in subsection (1) of this section; or

      (b) The authority is satisfied that the contingent claims are without merit or cannot be proved or established, or the statute of limitations would bar further consideration or recovery on the claim.

      (4)(a) A judgment entered after the commencement of a delinquency proceeding is conclusive evidence in the liquidation proceeding, either of liability or of the amount of damages.

      (b) A judgment entered after the date of entry of a liquidation order may not be considered in the liquidation proceedings as evidence of liability or of the amount of damages. [2019 c.478 §44]

 

      415.405 Priority of special deposit claims. The owners of special deposit claims against a coordinated care organization for which a receiver is appointed shall be given priority against their several special deposits in accordance with the provisions of the statutes governing the creation and maintenance of the deposits. If there is a deficiency in any deposit so that claims secured by the deposit are not fully discharged, the claimants may share in the general assets of the coordinated care organization after:

      (1) The payment of claims of general creditors; and

      (2) Claimants against other special deposits, who have received smaller percentages from their respective special deposits, have been paid percentages of their claims equal to the percentage paid from the special deposit. [2019 c.478 §46]

 

      415.406 Priority of secured claims. The owner of a secured claim against a coordinated care organization for which a receiver has been appointed may surrender the security and file a claim as a general creditor, or the claim may be discharged by resort to the security, in which case the deficiency, if any, shall be treated as a claim against the general assets of the coordinated care organization on the same basis as claims of unsecured creditors. [2019 c.478 §47]

 

      415.420 Attachment or garnishment prohibited during delinquency proceeding. During the pendency of a delinquency proceeding against a coordinated care organization, an action or proceeding to obtain an attachment, garnishment or execution may not be commenced or maintained in the courts of this state against the delinquent coordinated care organization or its assets. An attachment, garnishment or execution obtained prior to the commencement of a delinquency proceeding or at any time thereafter shall be void as against any rights arising in the delinquency proceeding unless the attachment, garnishment or execution obtained by the action or proceeding was obtained more than four months prior to the commencement of the delinquency proceeding. [2019 c.478 §40]

 

      415.422 Voidable transfers or liens. (1) A transfer of or lien upon the property of a coordinated care organization, other than as provided in ORS 415.420, is voidable if the transfer or lien is:

      (a) Made or created within four months prior to the commencement of a delinquency proceeding;

      (b) Made with the intent of giving to a transferee or lienor or enabling the transferee or lienor to obtain a greater percentage of the debt than any other creditor of the same class; and

      (c) Accepted by a transferee or lienor who has reasonable cause to believe that the transferee or lienor will obtain a greater percentage of the debt than any other creditor of the same class.

      (2) Every director, officer, employee or other person acting on behalf of a coordinated care organization who participates in a transfer or lien described in subsection (1) of this section, and every person receiving any property of the coordinated care organization or the benefit of the transfer or lien, shall be personally liable as described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) The Oregon Health Authority, as a receiver in a delinquency proceeding, may avoid any transfer of, or lien upon, the property of a coordinated care organization described in subsection (1) of this section and may recover the property or value of the property transferred or attached unless the person in possession of the property or the lien was a bona fide holder for value prior to the commencement of the delinquency proceeding. [2019 c.478 §41]

 

      415.424 Offsets of mutual debts or credits. Offsets may not be allowed in cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the coordinated care organization and another person in connection with a delinquency proceeding, except with respect to reinsurance. [2019 c.478 §43]

 

      415.430 Liability of member of CCO to pay provider for cost of care. (1) For the purpose of this section only, and only in the event of a finding of impairment by the Oregon Health Authority, as described in ORS 415.203, or of a final order of liquidation, any covered health care service furnished within this state by a provider to a member of a coordinated care organization shall be considered to have been furnished pursuant to a contract between the provider and the coordinated care organization with whom the member was enrolled when the services were furnished.

      (2) Each contract between a coordinated care organization and a provider of health care services shall provide that if the coordinated care organization fails to pay for covered health care services as set forth in the coordinated care organization’s contract with the authority, the member is not liable to the provider for any amounts owed by the coordinated care organization.

      (3) If the contract between the contracting provider and the coordinated care organization has not been reduced to writing or fails to contain the provisions required by subsection (2) of this section, the member is not liable to the authority for any amounts owed by the coordinated care organization.

      (4) A contracting provider or agent, trustee or assignee of the contracting provider may not maintain a civil action against a member to collect any amounts owed by the coordinated care organization for which the member is not liable to the contracting provider under this section.

      (5) Nothing in this section impairs the right of a provider to charge, collect from, attempt to collect from or maintain a civil action against a member for any of the following:

      (a) Health care services not covered by the medical assistance program.

      (b) Health care services rendered after the termination of the contract between the coordinated care organization and the provider, unless the health care services were rendered during the confinement in an inpatient facility and the confinement began prior to the date of termination or unless the provider has assumed post-termination treatment obligations under the contract.

      (6) Nothing in this section prohibits a member from seeking noncovered health care services from a provider and accepting financial responsibility for these services.

      (7) A coordinated care organization may not limit the right of a provider of health care services to contract with the patient for payment of services not within the scope of coverage under the medical assistance program. [2019 c.478 §52]
