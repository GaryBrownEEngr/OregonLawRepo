RECOVERY FROM ESTATES

 

      416.310 Estate of deceased person liable for aid received; relatives not relieved from obligation of support. (1) Except as otherwise provided by ORS 411.708, the estate of every deceased person who received aid from the state or any county or whose burial expenses have been paid by the state or any county, other than aid received pursuant to ORS 412.006, 444.120 or 444.220, is liable for the actual cost of such aid so rendered or the actual expenses of such burial. The state or the county shall have a just and valid claim against such estate therefor.

      (2) Nothing in this section relieves the parents, children, brothers or sisters of any needy person from their obligation to support such person, or prevents the county court from recovering for such support.

      (3) Nothing in this section authorizes the recovery of the amount of any aid from the estate or surviving spouse of a recipient to the extent that the need for aid resulted from a crime committed against the recipient. [Formerly 411.480; 1985 c.522 §5; 1993 c.249 §6; 2005 c.381 §25]

 

      416.320 Manner of approval and payment of county claims against estate. All claims of the type mentioned in ORS 416.310 shall be itemized and verified by the county clerk and presented by the county clerk to the administrator or executor of the estate; except that the claims shall be verified by the county accountant in counties having a county accountant authorized by ORS chapter 210. The claims shall be approved and paid by the administrator or executor in the manner and in the order of preference provided by law for approval and payment of claims and charges against estates of deceased persons. [Formerly 411.490; 1983 c.310 §19]

 

      416.330 [Formerly 411.500; repealed by 1983 c.537 §7]

 

      416.340 Collection of claim against estate of deceased; waiver of claim. (1) With respect to any claim against the estate of a deceased person, the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority may:

      (a) Secure payment of the claim in whole or in part by the acceptance of assignments, conveyances, notes, mortgages and other transfers of property or interests therein.

      (b) Waive the claim to the extent that the department or the authority finds that enforcement would tend to defeat the purpose of the public assistance or medical assistance laws.

      (2) To the extent that the need for aid resulted from a crime committed against the recipient, a claim for recovery of the amount of such aid defeats the purpose of the public assistance or medical assistance laws. [1963 c.114 §2; 1985 c.522 §6; 2011 c.720 §153; 2013 c.688 §86]

 

      416.350 Recovery of medical assistance; estate claims; transfer of assets. (1) The Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority may recover from any person the amounts of medical assistance the department or the authority incorrectly paid to or on behalf of the person.

      (2) Except as prohibited by ORS 178.380, medical assistance pursuant to ORS chapter 414 paid to or on behalf of an individual who was 55 years of age or older when the individual received the assistance, or paid to or on behalf of a person of any age who was a permanently institutionalized inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities or other medical institution, may be recovered from the estate of the individual or from any recipient of property or other assets held by the individual at the time of death including the estate of the surviving spouse. Claim for such medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of the individual may be established against the estate, but the claim may not be adjusted or recovered until after the death of the surviving spouse, if any, and only at a time when the individual has no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or who is blind or permanently and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of such aid without adequate consideration are voidable and may be set aside under ORS 411.620 (2).

      (3) Nothing in this section authorizes the recovery of the amount of any aid from the estate or surviving spouse of a recipient to the extent that the need for aid resulted from a crime committed against the recipient.

      (4) In any action or proceeding under this section to recover medical assistance paid, it is the legal burden of the person who receives the property or other assets from a medical assistance recipient to establish the extent and value of the recipient’s legal title or interest in the property or assets in accordance with rules established by the authority.

      (5) Amounts recovered under this section do not include the value of benefits paid to or on behalf of a beneficiary under a policy or certificate of qualified long term care insurance as defined in ORS 743.652, that were disregarded in determining eligibility for or the amount of medical assistance provided to the beneficiary.

      (6) As used in this section:

      (a) “Estate” includes all real and personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death including assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the deceased individual through joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust or other similar arrangement.

      (b) “Medical assistance” includes the state’s monthly contribution to the federal government to defray the costs of outpatient prescription drug coverage provided to a person who is eligible for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage and who receives medical assistance. [Formerly 414.105; 2011 c.720 §154; 2013 c.688 §87; 2017 c.367 §5]

 

      416.351 Possible limitation on recovery of certain medical assistance; federal law. (1) Subject to the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, if 42 U.S.C. 1396p (b)(1)(B) as in effect on January 1, 1995, is repealed without replacement or is declared unconstitutional, the Director of the Oregon Health Authority shall limit the recovery of medical assistance paid pursuant to ORS chapter 414 from the estate of an individual or a recipient of property or other assets held by an individual at the time of death, including a surviving spouse of the individual, to the recovery of medical assistance payments paid on behalf of the individual on or after the date that the individual attained 65 years of age.

      (2) The director shall limit the recovery of medical assistance as described under subsection (1) of this section only if the director determines, after receiving the written opinion of the Attorney General, that the recovery limitation will not violate any federal law in effect on the operative date of the recovery limitation. The director may condition, limit, modify or terminate any recovery limitation as the director considers necessary to avoid a violation of federal law. [Formerly 414.106]
