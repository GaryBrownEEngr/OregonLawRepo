THE INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR JUVENILES

 

      417.010 “Juvenile” defined for ORS 417.010 to 417.080. As used in ORS 417.010 to 417.080, “juvenile” includes any person who is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. [1959 c.434 §8]

 

      417.020 Declaration of public policy. (1) It hereby is found and declared that:

      (a) Juveniles who are not under proper supervision and control, or who have absconded, escaped or run away, are likely to endanger their own health, morals and welfare, and the health, morals and welfare of others; and

      (b) The cooperation of this state with other states is necessary to provide for the welfare and protection of juveniles and of the people of this state.

      (2) It is therefore the policy of this state, in adopting the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, to cooperate fully with other states in returning juveniles to such other states whenever their return is sought, to accept the return of juveniles whenever a juvenile residing in this state is found or apprehended in another state and to take all measures to initiate proceedings for the return of such juveniles. [1959 c.434 §1]

 

      417.030 The Interstate Compact for Juveniles. The Governor hereby is authorized and directed to execute for, on behalf of and in the name of the State of Oregon, a compact with any state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

The contracting states solemnly agree:

THE INTERSTATE COMPACT

FOR JUVENILES

ARTICLE I

PURPOSE

      The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.

      It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:

      A. Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;

      B. Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;

      C. Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;

      D. Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;

      E. Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;

      F. Equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;

      G. Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;

      H. Ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;

      I. Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;

      J. Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;

      K. Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance;

      L. Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and

      M. Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

ARTICLE III

INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR

JUVENILES

      A. The compacting states hereby create the “Interstate Commission for Juveniles.” The commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the compacting states. The commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.

      B. The Interstate Commission shall consist of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state and in consultation with the State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision created hereunder. The commissioner shall be the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator or designee from that state who shall serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to the applicable law of the compacting state.

      C. In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the Interstate Commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners, but who are members of interested organizations. Such non-commissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general, Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials, and crime victims. All non-commissioner members of the Interstate Commission shall be ex-officio (non-voting) members. The Interstate Commission may provide in its bylaws for such additional ex-officio (non-voting) members, including members of other national organizations, in such numbers as shall be determined by the commission.

      D. Each compacting state represented at any meeting of the commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of the compacting states shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the Interstate Commission.

      E. The commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. The chairperson may call additional meetings and, upon the request of a simple majority of the compacting states, shall call additional meetings. Public notice shall be given of all meetings and meetings shall be open to the public.

      F. The Interstate Commission shall establish an executive committee, which shall include commission officers, members and others as determined by the bylaws. The executive committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session, with the exception of rulemaking and/or amendment to the compact. The executive committee shall oversee the day-to-day activities of the administration of the compact managed by an executive director and Interstate Commission staff; administers enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and rules, and performs such other duties as directed by the Interstate Commission or set forth in the bylaws.

      G. Each member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission. A member shall vote in person and shall not delegate a vote to another compacting state. However, a commissioner, in consultation with the State Council, shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the compacting state at a specified meeting. The bylaws may provide for members’ participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication.

      H. The Interstate Commission’s bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests.

      I. Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The Interstate Commission and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public where it determines by two-thirds vote that an open meeting would be likely to:

      1. Relate solely to the Interstate Commission’s internal personnel practices and procedures;

      2. Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;

      3. Disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential;

      4. Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;

      5. Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

      6. Disclose investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes;

      7. Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of or for the use of, the Interstate Commission with respect to a regulated person or entity for the purpose of regulation or supervision of such person or entity;

      8. Disclose information, the premature disclosure of which would significantly endanger the stability of a regulated person or entity; or

      9. Specifically relate to the Interstate Commission’s issuance of a subpoena, or its participation in a civil action or other legal proceeding.

      J. For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the Interstate Commission’s legal counsel shall publicly certify that, in the legal counsel’s opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision. The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes that shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.

      K. The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of juveniles as directed through its rules, which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements. Such methods of data collection, exchange and reporting shall insofar as is reasonably possible conform to up-to-date technology and coordinate its information functions with the appropriate repository of records.

      a. Establishing the fiscal year of the Interstate Commission;

      b. Establishing an executive committee and such other committees as may be necessary;

      c. Providing for the establishment of committees governing any general or specific delegation of any authority or function of the Interstate Commission;

      d. Providing reasonable procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the Interstate Commission, and ensuring reasonable notice of each such meeting;

      e. Establishing the titles and responsibilities of the officers of the Interstate Commission;

      f. Providing a mechanism for concluding the operations of the Interstate Commission and the return of any surplus funds that may exist upon the termination of the compact after the payment and/or reserving of all of its debts and obligations;

      g. Providing “start-up” rules for initial administration of the compact; and

      h. Establishing standards and procedures for compliance and technical assistance in carrying out the compact.

      Section B. Officers and Staff

      1. The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson and a vice chairperson, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson’s absence or disability, the vice-chairperson shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the Interstate Commission, provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for any ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties and responsibilities as officers of the Interstate Commission.

      2. The Interstate Commission shall, through its executive committee, appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation as the Interstate Commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate Commission, but shall not be a member and shall hire and supervise such other staff as may be authorized by the Interstate Commission.

      Section C. Qualified Immunity, Defense and Indemnification

      1. The Commission’s executive director and employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that any such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.

      2. The liability of any commissioner, or the employee or agent of a commissioner, acting within the scope of such person’s employment or duties for acts, errors or omissions occurring within such person’s state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the Constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees and agents. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.

      3. The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director or the employees or representatives of the Interstate Commission and, subject to the approval of the Attorney General of the state represented by any commissioner of a compacting state, shall defend such commissioner or the commissioner’s representatives or employees in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.

      4. The Interstate Commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a compacting state, or the commissioner’s representatives or employees, or the Interstate Commission’s representatives or employees, harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.

ARTICLE VI

RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE

INTERSTATE COMMISSION

      A. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate and publish rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.

      B. Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rule making shall substantially conform to the principles of the “Model State Administrative Procedures Act,” 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the Interstate Commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the United States Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the Commission.

      C. When promulgating a rule, the Interstate Commission shall, at a minimum:

      1. Publish the proposed rule’s entire text stating the reason(s) for that proposed rule;

      2. Allow and invite any and all persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be added to the record, and be made publicly available;

      3. Provide an opportunity for an informal hearing if petitioned by 10 or more persons; and

      4. Promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on input from state or local officials, or interested parties.

      D. Allow, not later than 60 days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person to file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission’s principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission’s action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.

      E. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.

      5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.

      Section B. Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination and Default

      1. If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:

      a. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;

      b. Alternative Dispute Resolution;

      c. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; and

      d. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or the Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature and the State Council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.

      4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.

      5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.

      Section C. Judicial Enforcement

      The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.

      Section D. Dissolution of Compact

      1. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.

      2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

      3. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.

      4. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

      5. The State of Oregon is bound by the bylaws and rules promulgated under this compact only to the extent that the operation of the bylaws and rules does not impose an obligation exceeding any limitation on state power or authority contained in the Oregon Constitution as interpreted by the state courts of Oregon.

      (b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.

      (c) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis on which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.

      (d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.

ARTICLE II

DEFINITIONS

      As used in this compact:

      (a) “Child” means a person who, by reason of minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship or similar control.

      (b) “Sending agency” means a party state, officer or employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association, charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings, or causes to be sent or brought any child to another party state.

      (c) “Receiving state” means the state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement with state or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or persons.

      (d) “Placement” means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical facility.

ARTICLE III

CONDITIONS FOR PLACEMENT

      (a) No sending agency shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.

      (b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:

      (1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.

      (2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.

      (3) The name and address of the person, agency or institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring, or place the child.

      (c) Any public officer or agency in a receiving state which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this article may request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency of or in the sending agency’s state, and shall be entitled to receive therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it may deem necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.

      (d) The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.

ARTICLE IV

PENALTY FOR ILLEGAL PLACEMENT

      The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.

ARTICLE V

RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

      (a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency’s state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.

      (b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.

      (c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.

ARTICLE VI

INSTITUTIONAL CARE

OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN

      A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that:

      (1) Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency’s jurisdiction; and

      (2) Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.

ARTICLE VII

COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR

      The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this compact shall designate an officer who shall be general coordinator of activities under this compact in the jurisdiction of the officer and who, acting jointly with like officers of other party jurisdictions, shall have power to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly therefore declares that, as a matter of statewide concern, it is in the best interests of the people of this state that equal access for both males and females under 18 years of age to appropriate facilities, services and treatment be available through all state agencies providing or funding human services and juvenile corrections programs for children and adolescents.

      (3) Recognizing this concern, the Legislative Assembly further declares that:

      (a) Any state administrative agency that regularly provides services to minors shall, when the agency submits its annual budget to the Legislative Assembly, specify the percentages of moneys allocated to, and expended for, the two separate groups, males under 18 years of age and females under 18 years of age;

      (b) All state agencies providing human services and juvenile corrections programs shall identify existing disparities in the allocations of moneys and services to, and expended for, the two groups, males under 18 years of age and females under 18 years of age, and shall document such disparities, if any, for the purpose of reporting the information to the next odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly; and

      (c) The state agencies described in subsection (1) of this section shall:

      (A) Develop a plan to implement equal access to appropriate services and treatment, based on presenting behaviors, for both males under 18 years of age and females under 18 years of age, by January 1, 1995; and

      (d) Family support services shall be provided in a manner that develops comprehensive, responsive and flexible support to families in their role as primary caregivers for family members with disabilities or chronic illnesses.

      (c) Assisting the parent in providing any documentation required by the child’s state of residence. [2015 c.393 §1]

 

      417.355 Principles of family law system. The Sixty-eighth Legislative Assembly accepts the recommendations of the Task Force on Family Law and recognizes that a comprehensive family law system must reflect the following principles:

      (1) The welfare of children shall be paramount in the resolution of family conflicts.

      (2) Children must learn to develop healthy relationships and to resolve conflicts in peaceful ways.

      (3) Whenever possible and appropriate, children shall continue to have both parents in their lives and parents shall be encouraged to work out agreements between themselves regarding their children.

      (4) The safety and economic well-being of family members shall be given priority.

      (5) Family members in conflict must have appropriate forums in which to grieve and accept change.

      (6) All families deserve respect and the support of social policy. [1995 c.800 §1]

 

FAMILY- OR CLIENT-CENTERED SERVICE SYSTEM

 

      417.360 Findings and policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The current delivery system for human services is fragmented and uncoordinated, producing service duplication and inappropriate or inadequate responses to individuals and to families;

      (b) Clients with multiple needs must interact with a variety of agencies and frequently feel powerless to negotiate the complicated array of services;

      (c) The system is too often perceived as victimizing the persons it is intended to serve;

      (d) Dedicated direct service workers become the target of disillusionment by clients even though the workers are equally frustrated by their lack of control over bureaucratic requirements; and

      (e) The state needs to rethink and restructure traditional methods of delivering human services. Organizations that have traditionally not viewed themselves as partners, such as social services and education, must be strongly encouraged to integrate their programs.

      (2) It shall be the policy of this state to foster a family-or client-centered service delivery system at the community level with the goal of providing more efficient and responsive services, driven by the needs of the individuals and families served and not by funding tied to traditional, categorical programs. Family services available through community level delivery systems should include, but need not be limited to, education, information and referral services. [1991 c.359 §1; 1995 c.800 §1a]

 

      417.362 System requirements. A family- or client-centered service system must be a system that:

      (1) Insures active participation of clients in service planning, decision making and service delivery;

      (2) Empowers direct service workers to gain access to a broad continuum of services and flexible funding to meet the needs of individuals and families served;

      (3) Pools funds of multiple service delivery agencies;

      (4) Generates policies for program planning and implementation at the community level rather than mandating policies at the state level; and

      (5) Supports and enhances family harmony with the goal of preserving the health and integrity of all family units. [1991 c.359 §2; 1995 c.800 §2]

FAMILY DECISION-MAKING MEETING

 

      417.365 “Family decision-making meeting” defined for ORS 417.365 to 417.375. As used in ORS 417.365 to 417.375, “family decision-making meeting” means a family-focused intervention facilitated by professional staff that is designed to build and strengthen the natural caregiving system for the child. Family decision-making meetings may include family group conferences, family unity meetings, family mediation or other professionally recognized interventions that include extended family and rely upon the family to make decisions about planning for its children. The purpose of the family decision-making meeting is to establish a plan that provides for the safety, attachment and permanency needs of the child. [1997 c.799 §1]

 

      417.368 Consideration of meeting required for certain cases. (1) The Department of Human Services shall consider the use of a family decision-making meeting in each case in which a child is placed in substitute care for more than 30 days.

      (2) When the department determines that the use of a family decision-making meeting is appropriate, the meeting shall be held, whenever possible, before the child has been in substitute care for 60 days.

      (3) If the department elects not to conduct a family decision-making meeting, the reasons for that decision shall be clearly documented in the written service plan of the child developed by the department. [1997 c.799 §2]

 

      417.371 Notice to family members of meeting. (1) If the Department of Human Services determines that the use of a family decision-making meeting is appropriate, the department shall conduct and document reasonable inquiries to promptly locate and notify the parents, grandparents and any other family member who has had significant, direct contact with the child in the year prior to the substitute care placement.

      (2) All family members notified by the department may attend the meeting unless the department determines that the safety of any attendee will be compromised by the attendance of any family member.

      (3) Any family member the department deems a safety risk may provide written statements that address the subject of any family decision-making meeting, including the determination of placement of the child or components of a service plan for the child and family members.

      (4) As used in this section:

      (a) “Family member” means any person related to the child by blood, marriage or adoption, including but not limited to parents, grandparents, stepparents, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, cousins or great-grandparents. “Family member” also includes a child 12 years of age or older, or a child younger than 12 years of age when appropriate.

      (b) “Reasonable inquiries” means efforts that involve reviewing the case file for relevant information, contacting the parents or guardians and contacting additional sources of information that may lead to ascertaining the whereabouts of family members, if necessary. [1997 c.799 §3]

 

      417.375 Development of family plan; contents. (1) If the Department of Human Services conducts a family decision-making meeting under ORS 417.365 to 417.375, the meeting shall result in the development of a written family plan that may include a primary permanent plan, concurrent permanent plan, placement recommendations and service recommendations. The family plan or service agreement shall also include:

      (a) The expectations of the parents of the child and other family members;

      (b) Services the department will provide;

      (c) Timelines for implementation of the plan;

      (d) The benefits of compliance with the plan;

      (e) The consequences of noncompliance with the plan; and

      (f) A schedule of subsequent meetings, if appropriate.

      (2) Any family member participating in a family decision-making meeting shall sign a written acknowledgment of the content of the family plan developed at the family decision-making meeting and their attendance at the meeting.

      (3) The department shall incorporate the family plan developed at the family decision-making meeting into the department’s service plan for the child to the extent that the family plan protects the child, builds on family strengths and is focused on achieving permanency for the child within a reasonable time.

      (4) If the family plan is not incorporated in the department’s service plan for the child, the department shall document the reasons in the service plan.

      (5) The department shall send a copy of the family plan to the family participants, including those family members who participated in writing pursuant to ORS 417.371 (3), no later than 21 days after the conclusion of the family decision-making meeting. [1997 c.799 §4; 2001 c.686 §18]

SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

 

(Generally)

 

      417.705 Definitions for ORS 417.705 to 417.800. As used in ORS 417.705 to 417.800:

      (1) “Early Learning Hub” means an entity designated under ORS 417.827.

      (2) “Outcome” means the measure of a desired result.

      (3) “Services for children and families” does not include services provided by the Department of Education or school districts that are related to curriculum or instructional programs.

      (4) “Target” means a specific level of achievement desired for a specific time, expressed numerically. [1993 c.676 §30; 1999 c.1053 §3; 2003 c.148 §1; 2003 c.553 §1; 2012 c.37 §§43,79; 2013 c.728 §21]

 

      417.707 Duty of state agencies providing services for children and families. The purpose of ORS 417.705 to 417.800, as described in ORS 417.708 to 417.725, shall be implemented by all state agencies providing services for children and families to guide the providing of those services. [Formerly 417.755; 2012 c.97 §20]

 

      417.708 Legislative findings relating to young children. The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (1) The first three years of life are a crucial period in a child’s life, and during this period a child is sensitive to the protective mechanisms of parental and family support.

      (2) Brain development that takes place during the first year of life is rapid and extensive and has implications for lifelong physical, social-emotional and cognitive well-being. [2001 c.831 §2]

 

      417.710 Statement of purpose. Subject to the availability of funds therefor and the specific provisions of ORS 417.705 to 417.800, it is the purpose of ORS 417.705 to 417.800 to:

      (1) Authorize the Early Learning Council to set statewide guidelines for the planning, coordination and delivery of services for children and families in conjunction with other state agencies and other planning bodies;

      (2) Vest in Early Learning Hubs the authority to distribute state and federal funds, to coordinate services and to purchase services for children and families in the local area;

      (3) Provide a process for providing local services that are consistent with statewide guidelines;

      (4) Retain in the state the responsibility for funding of services for children and families through a combination of local, state and federal funding, including the leveraging of public and private funds available under ORS 417.705 to 417.800; and

      (5) Retain state supervision of child protection and other services that should be uniform throughout the state and that are necessarily the state’s responsibility. [1993 c.676 §1; 1999 c.1053 §4; 2003 c.553 §2; 2012 c.37 §§44,80; 2012 c.97 §21; 2013 c.728 §22]

 

      417.715 Policy; service system values and goals. (1) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to enable families and communities to protect, nurture and realize the full physical, social, emotional, cognitive and cultural developmental potential of children in Oregon. Toward this end, the Legislative Assembly shall develop and implement a statewide system of services that is preventive, integrated in local communities and accessible to children and families and that focuses on promoting the wellness of Oregon’s children.

      (2) The service system shall be based on promoting the wellness of Oregon’s children and families. The following values shall guide the design and implementation of this system:

      (a) A commitment to children that ranks them as Oregon’s first priority;

      (b) A commitment to reducing the number of Oregon’s children and families living in poverty;

      (c) A commitment to equitable treatment of gender in both services and funding;

      (d) A view that strengthening families is of paramount concern, but that child safety must come first if a conflict between the well-being of a child and the well-being of a family arises;

      (e) A recognition of the central role of families as the best place for children to develop;

      (f) A realization that good parenting skills are fundamental to a healthy society;

      (g) A sensitivity to diversity that requires culturally competent services respectful of genders, cultures, orientations and disabilities;

      (h) An offering of opportunities for children to develop self-worth and concern for others, and to reach their full potential;

      (i) A fundamental assumption that children should be provided the means to attain safety and good health; and

      (j) A commitment to early detection and treatment of families at risk for child abuse and neglect.

      (3) The service system shall emphasize:

      (a) Services designed to identify risks and nurture potential at the earliest time in a child’s life;

      (b) Services designed to respond to and reduce risks at the earliest possible point of detection;

      (c) A comprehensive continuum of services such as prevention, early intervention and treatment for children in all age groups;

      (d) The realization that funding one age group or gender of children at the expense of another is destructive of the wellness of children; and

      (e) That maintenance and enhancement of treatment services and augmentation of preventive services are paramount to the effective delivery of services to children and families.

      (4) The service system must begin at the local level, through cooperation and integration of all local and state providers, treat the whole person and be built on the strengths and natural supports of neighborhoods and communities. [1993 c.676 §1a]

 

      417.720 Characteristics of service system. The characteristics of the service system developed and implemented under ORS 417.705 to 417.800 are that the system:

      (1) Is nonstigmatizing;

      (2) Is available and accessible when needed and is based on the perspective of children and families and, whenever possible, allows families to design their own service programs, based on assessment of their needs and their solutions and resources for change;

      (3) Is outcome-oriented;

      (4) Is integrated;

      (5) Recognizes the contributions of the system’s workers;

      (6) Promotes in the community a sense of responsibility for self and others and is committed to the well-being of children as well as support for families;

      (7) Emphasizes local planning for children and families and integrates local needs with statewide goals;

      (8) Provides services locally in a process that encourages partnerships, alliances and efficient use of resources; and

      (9) Provides local service delivery systems that build on the unique strengths of the county or community. [1993 c.676 §2; 2012 c.97 §22]

 

      417.721 Collaboration with coordinated care organizations. The Oregon Health Authority, the Health Plan Quality Metrics Committee and the Early Learning Council shall work collaboratively with coordinated care organizations to develop performance metrics for prenatal care, delivery and infant care that align with early learning outcomes. [2013 c.728 §8; 2015 c.389 §12]

 

      Note: 417.721 and 417.723 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 417 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      417.723 Grant program to support alignment of systems. The Oregon Health Authority and the Early Learning Council shall establish a grant program to provide funding to support effective and scalable strategies that align voluntary statewide early learning systems and health systems for the purpose of improving the developmental outcomes for children from zero through three years of age. [2013 c.728 §9]

 

      Note: See note under 417.721.

 

      417.725 Key elements of system; family resource and community learning centers. (1) Key elements of the service system developed and implemented under ORS 417.705 to 417.800 are:

      (a) A two-to-seven-year incremental implementation process with measurable outcomes;

      (b) An implementation process resulting in a voluntary system based on nurturing human development; and

      (c) A service continuum based on promoting wellness for the children of Oregon whose parents have given their express written consent. Family resource centers and community learning centers as defined in ORS 329.007 are a viable, but not the exclusive, structure for delivering a service continuum.

      (2) If a system of family resource centers and community learning centers is selected by an Early Learning Hub to deliver services, the centers:

      (a) May serve as the prevention arm of the voluntary delivery system and may link and integrate neighborhood-based services with the intent that services be available to all families who have given their express written consent to promote their children’s wellness;

      (b) Shall involve parents in the care and education of their children;

      (c) Shall involve the local community in developing and overseeing family resource center programs and community learning center programs; and

      (d) Shall incorporate the requirements specified for community learning centers under ORS 329.156. [1993 c.676 §3; 2001 c.831 §10; 2003 c.153 §1; 2012 c.37 §81; 2012 c.97 §23; 2013 c.728 §23]

 

      417.727 Oregon Early Learning System. Based on the findings expressed in ORS 417.708, there is created the Oregon Early Learning System. The goals of the system are to:

      (1) Prevent child abuse and neglect;

      (2) Improve the health and development of young children;

      (3) Promote bonding and attachment in the early years of a child’s life;

      (4) Support parents in providing the optimum environment for their young children;

      (5) Link and integrate services and supports in the voluntary statewide early learning system pursuant to ORS 417.728;

      (6) Ensure that children are entering school ready to learn; and

      (7) Ensure that parents have access to affordable, quality child care. [2001 c.831 §4; 2012 c.37 §§44a,90a]

 

      417.728 Voluntary statewide early learning system; components; system of quality supports for exempt family child care providers; rules. (1) The Early Learning Council shall lead a joint effort with other state and local early childhood partners to establish the policies necessary for a voluntary statewide early learning system.

      (b) Any other early childhood benchmark or outcome that demonstrates progress toward meeting a target and that is identified by the Early Learning Council with input from early childhood partners.

      (3) The voluntary statewide early learning system shall include the following components:

      (a) A process to identify as early as possible children and families who would benefit from early learning services, including the required use of standardized screening and referral procedures used throughout the voluntary statewide early learning system;

      (b) A plan to support the identified needs of the child and family that coordinates case management personnel and the delivery of services to the child and family; and

      (c) Services to support children who are zero through six years of age and their families who give their express written consent, including:

      (A) Screening, assessment and home visiting services pursuant to ORS 417.795;

      (B) Specialized or targeted home visiting services;

      (C) Community-based services such as relief nurseries, family support programs and parent education programs;

      (D) Affordable, quality child care, as defined by the Early Learning Council;

      (E) Preschool and other early education services;

      (F) Health services for children and pregnant women;

      (J) Other state and local services.

      (4) In establishing the definition of affordable, quality child care under subsection (3)(c)(D) of this section, the Early Learning Council shall consult with child care providers and early childhood educators. The definition established by the council shall support parental choice of child care provider and shall consider differences in settings and services, including but not limited to child care for school-aged children, part-time care, odd-hour and respite care and factors of cultural appropriateness and competence.

      (5) No later than July 1, 2016, for the purpose of ensuring that affordable, quality home-based child care is available through a subsidy program administered by the Department of Human Services, the Early Learning Division, in consultation with the department, shall develop and implement a system of quality supports for exempt family child care providers as defined in ORS 329A.430. The system may use evidence-based practices or best practices that are consistent with state policies for child well-being and development and that are subject to collective bargaining. The system must include professional development opportunities for exempt family child care providers that are available for attendance in person and through the Internet.

      (6) The Early Learning Council shall:

      (a) Consolidate administrative functions relating to the voluntary statewide early learning system, to the extent practicable, including but not limited to training and technical assistance, planning and budgeting.

      (b) Adopt policies to establish training and technical assistance programs to ensure that personnel have skills in appropriate areas, including screening, family assessment, competency-based home visiting skills, cultural and gender differences and other areas as needed.

      (c) Identify research-based age-appropriate and culturally and gender appropriate screening and assessment tools that would be used as appropriate in programs and services of the voluntary statewide early learning system.

      (d) Develop a plan for the implementation of a common data system for voluntary early childhood programs.

      (e) Coordinate existing and new early childhood programs to provide a range of community-based supports.

      (g) Ensure that all plans for voluntary early childhood services are coordinated and consistent with federal and state law, including but not limited to plans for Oregon prekindergarten programs, federal Head Start programs, early childhood special education services, early intervention services and public health services.

      (h) Identify how the voluntary statewide early learning system for children who are zero through six years of age will link with systems of support for older children and their families.

      (i) During January of each odd-numbered year, report to the Governor and the Legislative Assembly on the voluntary statewide early learning system.

      (7) The State Board of Education, the Employment Department, the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority when adopting rules to administer voluntary early childhood programs under their individual authority shall adopt rules:

      (a) That are consistent with the requirements of the voluntary statewide early learning system created under this section; and

      (b) With the direction of the Early Learning Council.

      (8) Information gathered in conjunction with the voluntary comprehensive screening and assessment of children and their families may be used only for the following purposes:

      (a) Providing services to children and families who give their express written consent;
