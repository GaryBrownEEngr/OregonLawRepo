PREVENTION OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT

 

      418.189 Policy on child abuse and neglect. The Legislative Assembly recognizes that children are society’s most valuable resource and that child abuse and neglect is a threat to the physical, mental and emotional health of children. The Legislative Assembly further recognizes that assisting community-based private nonprofit and public organizations, agencies or school districts in identifying and establishing needed primary prevention programs will reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect, and the necessity for costly subsequent intervention in family life by the state. Child abuse and neglect prevention programs can be most effectively and economically administered through the use of trained volunteers and the cooperative efforts of the communities, citizens and the state. [1985 c.549 §2]

The department may notify law enforcement agencies as necessary to coordinate and assist in the investigation and enforcement of corrective actions undertaken by the department. If the child-caring agency is known or found to serve children also served by the Oregon Youth Authority, county juvenile departments or developmental disabilities services within the department, the department shall notify those entities of the report or suspected or founded abuses, deficiencies, violations or failures.

      (2) If the department finds, after investigation by the department or law enforcement agencies, that the abuses, deficiencies, violations or failures to comply are founded, the department may suspend, revoke or place conditions on the license, certificate or other authorization of the child-caring agency. The conditions placed on a license, certificate or authorization may include, but are not limited to, placing full or partial restrictions on admission of children, temporary suspension, limitation of operations subject to an intent to revoke or limitation of operations subject to correction of violations as specified in a plan of correction.

The department shall immediately notify any governmental agency that has a contract with the child-caring agency to provide care or services to a child of any suspension or revocation of, or conditions placed on, the license, certificate or other authorization of the child-caring agency.

      (3) If the department determines at any time during or after an investigation that the abuses, deficiencies, violations or failures to comply are or threaten a serious danger to any child or to the public, or place a child at risk with respect to the child’s health, safety or welfare, the department may immediately suspend or revoke the child-caring agency’s license, certificate or authorization, subject to the provisions of ORS chapter 183. The department shall immediately notify any governmental agency that has a contract with the child-caring agency to provide care or services to a child of any suspension or revocation of the license, certificate or other authorization of the child-caring agency under this subsection and of any conditions placed on the child-caring agency’s license, certificate or authorization pursuant to ORS 418.240.

Upon receipt of an employee report under this subsection, the director and department personnel shall immediately commence an investigation and take all reasonably prudent and necessary actions to ensure the health, safety and welfare of children at the child-caring agency. Failure to commence an investigation and take actions as required by this subsection constitutes official misconduct in the second degree under ORS 162.405. [Formerly 419.124; 1971 c.401 §20; 1975 c.310 §6; 1983 c.510 §9; 2016 c.106 §11; 2017 c.448 §2]

(1) If licensed for such purposes by the Department of Human Services, a child-caring agency may receive children from the children’s parents or legal guardians for special, temporary or continued care. The parents or guardians may sign releases or surrenders giving to the agency guardianship and control of the children during the period of care, which may be extended until the children arrive at legal age. Releases do not surrender the rights of parents or guardians in respect to the adoption of children and do not entitle the agency to give consent to the adoption of the children unless the release or surrender expressly recites that the release or surrender is given for the purpose of adoption. Child-caring agencies are authorized to place children for adoption or family foster care only if authorized by the department in the license issued by the department to the agency.

      (2) Severance of family ties with children by adoption or otherwise may be accomplished only by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (3) In the absence of the certificate provided for in subsection (4) of this section, it is unlawful to present a child released or surrendered to a child-caring agency by a parent, parents or guardian for a court to pass upon the adoption of the child until at least six months have elapsed after signing the release or surrender.

      (4) Parents or guardians who have given a child into the guardianship of a child-caring agency by release or surrender under this section for the purpose of adoption may, concurrently or subsequently and without any adoption proceeding having been initiated, agree that the release or surrender shall become irrevocable as soon as the child is placed by the agency in the physical custody of a person or persons for the purpose of adoption, and waive their right to personal appearance in court in matters of adoption of the child, by a duly signed and attested certificate. From and after physical placement for adoption, the certificate of irrevocability and waiver and the release or surrender may not be revoked by the parent or guardian unless fraud or duress is affirmatively proved.

      (5) No agreement to release or surrender a child for adoption, or other agreement or waiver of rights having the same effect, executed before March 24, 1971, in connection with the surrender of a child into the guardianship of a child-caring agency for purposes of adoption, may be revoked or held invalid for any reason except upon affirmative proof of fraud or duress. [Formerly 419.128; 1971 c.26 §1; 1975 c.310 §7; 1983 c.510 §10; 2016 c.106 §14]

      (2) The child-caring agency may retain a child released, surrendered or committed to the agency in institutional care, or may place the child in proctor foster homes temporarily or as a member of a family.

      (2) In placing a child with a proctor foster home that has been determined to meet minimum standards and that has been certified by a child-caring agency under this section and ORS 418.248, the child-caring agency shall:

      (a) Safeguard the welfare of the child by the thorough investigation of each applicant and home and its environment;

      (b) Carefully select the child to suit the new relationship and location;

      (c) Personally and adequately supervise the home and child until the child returns to the direct care of the child-caring agency or, if permanently placed, receives legal adoption or attains legal age; and

For those children who have remained in voluntary placement for 18 months, an administrative review by the Department of Human Services shall be required. The department shall review the same information required in reports on children placed pursuant to court order. [1981 c.777 §3]

 

      418.305 Access to child receiving care or services. (1) The Department of Human Services may require any child-caring agency subject to ORS 418.205 to 418.327, 418.470, 418.475 or 418.950 to 418.970 to disclose to the department the location and circumstances of any child for whom the agency is providing care or services.

(1) The Department of Human Services may not require any parent or legal guardian to transfer legal custody of a child in order to have the child placed in a child-caring agency under ORS 418.205 to 418.327, 418.470, 418.475, 418.480 to 418.500, 418.950 to 418.970 and 418.992 to 418.998 in a foster home, group home or institutional child care setting, when the sole reason for the placement is the need to obtain services for the child’s emotional, behavioral or mental disorder or developmental or physical disability. In all such cases, the child shall be placed pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement. When a child is placed pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, the department shall have responsibility for the child’s placement and care.

      (2) If a child is placed pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement in a qualified residential treatment program described in ORS 419B.356, the placement is subject to judicial approval under ORS 419B.360.

      (4) As used in this section, “voluntary placement agreement” means a binding, written agreement between the department and the parent or legal guardian of a minor child that does not transfer legal custody to the department but that specifies, at a minimum, the legal status of the child and the rights and obligations of the parent or legal guardian, the child and the department while the child is in placement. [1979 c.746 §1; 1993 c.348 §1; 1995 c.79 §213; 1999 c.59 §113; 2001 c.686 §6; 2016 c.106 §22; 2019 c.619 §9]

In all such cases, the child shall be placed pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement. When a child is placed pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, the department shall have responsibility for the child’s placement and care. When a child remains in voluntary placement for more than 180 days, the juvenile court shall make a judicial determination, within the first 180 days of the placement, that the placement is in the best interests of the child. In addition, the juvenile court shall hold a permanency hearing as provided in ORS 419B.476 no later than 14 months after the child’s original voluntary placement, and not less frequently than once every 12 months thereafter during the continuation of the child’s original voluntary placement, to determine the future status of the child.

      (2) As used in this section, “voluntary placement agreement” means a binding, written agreement between the department and the parent or legal guardian of a minor child that does not transfer legal custody to the department but that specifies, at a minimum, the legal status of the child and the rights and obligations of the parent or legal guardian, the child and the department while the child is in placement.

      418.485 Policy; annual report. It is the policy of the State of Oregon to strengthen family life and to ensure the protection of all children either in their own homes or in other appropriate care outside their homes. In affording such protection, the Director of Human Services shall, in cooperation with child-caring agencies and with Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying Families programs under ORS 418.575 to 418.598, develop a set of short-range and long-range priorities for the development of needed child care and services, such priorities to be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary. Such priorities are to be set out in a form enumerating the number of children in each category of need, the type of child care and services needed, the areas of the state where such care and services are needed, and the projected costs. The State of Oregon hereby commits itself to the purchase of care and services for children who need care and to encourage child-caring agencies and Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying Families programs under ORS 418.575 to 418.598 to develop programs required to meet the needs of the children of this state, and moneys may be appropriated therefor. In developing programs necessary to meet the needs of the children of this state, the Director of Human Services shall make every attempt feasible to develop local, community and county-based organizations. The Department of Human Services shall document and present an annual report to the committees of the Legislative Assembly that address efforts taken under this section.

The agreement shall prescribe the procedures for payment and the rate of payment and may contain such other conditions as the department and the agency, facility or program may agree. Payment must be made by electronic funds transfer from the department to the payee and may not be made by check.

      (2) The department shall by rule adopt payment standards for foster care that is provided under ORS 418.625 to 418.645. In establishing standards, the department may take into account the income, resources and maintenance available to and the necessary expenditures of a foster parent who is a relative, as defined by rule, of the child placed in care.

      418.500 Out-of-state care for children. If the Department of Human Services determines that need exists for care and treatment of a child who is eligible for such care and treatment that is not available through any public or private agency or facility in this state, it may enter into an agreement with a public or private agency outside this state for the purchase of care for the child. Such agreements shall contain the matter described in ORS 418.495 and shall apply to children described therein. [1971 c.457 §5]

STRENGTHENING, PRESERVING AND REUNIFYING FAMILIES PROGRAMS

 

      418.575 Definitions for ORS 418.575 to 418.598. As used in ORS 418.575 to 418.598:

      (1) “Child” means a child who qualifies for child welfare services provided by the Department of Human Services.

      (2) “Client-focused functional outcome measures” means objective, observable measures of outcomes for services provided to a child and a child’s family under ORS 418.575 to 418.598, including but not limited to measures relating to permanency.

      (3) “County partners” means employees or representatives of the Department of Human Services, the county, court appointed special advocates under ORS 419B.112, drug and alcohol treatment providers, mental health providers, providers of affordable housing and other persons or entities that provide services to children and families within a county of this state.

      (4) “Family” means, at a minimum but not to the exclusion of siblings as defined in ORS 419A.004 or other persons living in the same household with a child, the child and:

      (a) The child’s parent as defined in ORS 419A.004;

      (b) The child’s guardian appointed pursuant to ORS chapter 125; or

      (c) A person who has a caregiver relationship as defined in ORS 419B.116 with the child.

      (5) “Intensive in-home services” means services that keep a child and family together in the child’s and family’s home with a goal of 24-hour on-call support while the child and the child’s family engage in family strengthening activities and receive appropriate mental health and addiction treatment and other intensive support interventions.

      (6) “Performance-based contract” means a contract entered into under ORS 418.580 that:

      (a) Requires a program to demonstrate successful child-driven outcomes when compared to alternative placement options and long-term cost savings; and

      (b) Bases termination or renewal of the contract on demonstration of the factors described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (7) “Program” means a Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying Families program described in ORS 418.580. [2011 c.568 §2; 2012 c.97 §28]

 

      418.578 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) There is growing empirical evidence that severe trauma may result when children are removed from their families, and that this trauma may give rise to negative outcomes that last a lifetime, cause intergenerational patterns of addiction, abuse and neglect, and give rise to disrupted and broken families.

      (2) Improving permanency outcomes for children is best accomplished by providing services that allow children to remain with their families and in their homes when appropriate and safe.

      (3) Allowing families to remain intact while parents undergo mental health or addiction treatment, take steps to move out of poverty by obtaining employment and housing or receive family strengthening services preserves child-parent bonds with improved outcomes for children and families and positive long-term societal effects.

      (4) When placement in foster or substitute care outside the home must occur, this can be less traumatic and of shorter duration with the provision of family-focused treatment and services, and the provision of routine family contact and visitation as frequently as is appropriate. After children are returned to the family, they should receive continuing services to ensure safety and stabilization.

      (5) Children should receive continuing services sufficient to achieve stabilization after returning to the community.

      (6) A new systemwide model for providing child welfare services should be adopted that provides services and supports that have proved effective in keeping children safely with their parents, that reduces children’s risk of future entry into the criminal justice and child welfare systems, that lowers the risk of intergenerational abuse and that decreases the associated human and economic costs.

      (7) The efficacy of programs that allow families to remain together or that assist families with reunification has been demonstrated by pilot programs, including one that has operated in Jackson County since 2007 and other national best practice models.

      (8) Foster care savings that are reinvested can enhance and expand child welfare services.

      (9) Housing is essential to the safe reduction of the number of children in foster care. Partnerships between affordable housing providers and nonprofit service agencies must be formed where possible. Tenancy requirements and exclusion criteria related to criminal, credit and tenant histories, particularly when associated with substance abuse, must be reevaluated and modified where possible. [2011 c.568 §3]

      (b) Residential treatment whereby a member of a child’s family with care, custody or control of the child enters a treatment facility accompanied by the child with 24-hour supervision while the child and the member of the child’s family engage in family strengthening activities and receive appropriate mental health and addiction treatment support and services.

      (c) Supervised housing whereby a child and the child’s family remain together in program housing while they participate in family strengthening activities, receive mental health and addiction support and services and have the appropriate level of supervision to ensure the physical health, care and safety of the child.

      (c) Many public lands and environmental resources, including parks, rangelands, forests, wildlife habitats, fisheries, soils and waters are and will continue to be subject to resource production demand and public uses;

      (d) In order to instill and preserve superior work attitudes among Oregon’s disadvantaged and at-risk young adults and to maintain, protect and conserve the valuable resources of the State of Oregon, programs need to be implemented which will assure continued economic productivity and scenic beauty, as well as the public health, safety and social benefit;

      (e) To these ends, conservation work programs may prove successful and cost-effective both in providing jobs for disadvantaged and at-risk young adults and in assisting land preservation and management agencies to conserve and protect natural and urban facilities; and

      (f) As a result of such employment opportunities, benefits will redound to the state’s environmental maintenance and productivity, the state’s economy and to the disadvantaged and at-risk youth participants who benefit from the exposure to and respect for the work ethic in the context of safeguarding and improving the environmental resources of the state.

      (2) The general purposes of ORS 418.650 to 418.663 are:

      (a) To establish a disadvantaged and at-risk youth work program in order to perform conservation work of public value in the most cost-effective manner;

      418.708 Child’s savings account; establishment; capacity to contract; parental consent; liability of financial institution; monitoring of account. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that a child who is 12 years of age or older and who is in the custody of the Department of Human Services should be entitled to assistance from the department to establish a savings account at a financial institution as defined in ORS 706.008 for the following reasons:

      (a) Access to such accounts prepares a child to become financially independent once the child is no longer in the custody, care or supervision of the department.

      (b) It is an important life lesson for a child to learn to save moneys for the future.

      (c) Providing children who are in the custody of the department with the opportunity to establish a savings account is an important step toward their fiscal maturity.

      (2)(a) The Department of Human Services shall, in accordance with rules adopted by the department, ensure that a child who is 12 years of age or older, of whom the department has had custody for a minimum of six consecutive months, is entitled to assistance from the department to establish a savings account at a financial institution as defined in ORS 706.008.

      (b) Nothing in this section authorizes the department to require that a financial institution establish an account for a child.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a child described in subsection (2) of this section may contract with a financial institution to establish a savings account for the purpose of depositing and saving moneys for the child’s sole use and benefit. The contract is binding upon the child and cannot be voided or disaffirmed by the child based upon the child’s age or status as a minor.

      (4) The consent of the child’s parent, guardian or foster parent, or of any other person having legal custody of the child, is not necessary to contract to establish a savings account under this section. The parent, guardian, foster parent or other person having legal custody of the child is not liable under a contract by the child for a savings account unless the parent, guardian, foster parent or person having legal custody of the child is a party to the child’s contract.

      (5) The parent, guardian, foster parent or other person having legal custody of the child is not entitled to be an account holder on a savings account established under this section, or to have access to information about or moneys in the account, without the written authorization of the child who established the account. The child’s signature on account documents that make the parent, guardian, foster parent or other person having legal custody of the child an account holder on the account or that grant the parent, guardian, foster parent or other person having legal custody of the child the right to have access to information about or moneys in the account, constitutes written authorization as required by this subsection.

      (6) A financial institution that establishes a savings account for a child under this section is not liable to any person for establishing the account or for permitting the child to make deposits to or withdrawals from the account. The financial institution may rely on the child’s signature on account documents when permitting the child to make deposits to and withdrawals from the account or to receive account statements and information about the account. The financial institution is not required to ensure that moneys paid out of the account are properly applied.

      (7) The Department of Human Services is entitled to monitor use of moneys in a child’s savings account established under this section when required to ensure continuation of receipt of state and federal benefits received by or on behalf of the child. The department shall adopt rules setting forth methods by which the department may monitor use of moneys in a child’s account for this purpose. [2015 c.471 §1]

      (5) Upon formation and before reviewing its first case, a fatality review team shall adopt a written protocol for review of domestic violence fatalities. The protocol must be designed to facilitate communication among organizations and agencies involved in domestic violence cases so that incidents of domestic violence and domestic violence fatalities are identified and prevented. The protocol shall define procedures for case review and preservation of confidentiality, and shall identify team members.

      (6) Consistent with recommendations provided by the statewide interdisciplinary team under ORS 418.718, a local fatality review team shall provide the statewide team with information regarding domestic violence fatalities.

An oral or written communication or a document provided by a third party to a fatality review team is confidential, not subject to disclosure and not discoverable by a third party. All information and records acquired by a team in the exercise of its duties are confidential and may be disclosed only as necessary to carry out the purposes of the fatality review. However, recommendations of a team upon the completion of a review may be disclosed without personal identifiers at the discretion of two-thirds of the members of the team.

      (11) Information, documents and records otherwise available from other sources are not immune from discovery or introduction into evidence solely because the information, documents or records were presented to or reviewed by a fatality review team.

      (12) ORS 192.610 to 192.690 do not apply to meetings of a fatality review team.

      (13) Each fatality review team shall develop written agreements signed by member organizations and agencies that specify the organizations’ and agencies’ understanding of and agreement with the principles outlined in this section. [2005 c.547 §2]

(1) The district attorney in each county shall be responsible for developing county child abuse multidisciplinary teams to consist of but not be limited to law enforcement personnel, Department of Human Services child protective service workers, school officials, local health department personnel, county mental health department personnel who have experience with children and family mental health issues, child abuse intervention center workers, if available, and juvenile department representatives, as well as others specially trained in child abuse, child sexual abuse and rape of children investigation.

      (2) The teams shall develop a written protocol for immediate investigation of and notification procedures for child abuse cases, including child sexual abuse, and for interviewing child abuse victims. Each team also shall develop written agreements signed by member agencies that are represented on the team that specify:

      (4) All investigations of child abuse and interviews of child abuse victims shall be carried out by appropriate personnel using the protocols and procedures called for in this section. If trained personnel are not available in a timely fashion and, in the judgment of a law enforcement officer or child protective services worker, there is reasonable cause to believe a delay in investigation or interview of the child abuse victim could place the child in jeopardy of physical harm, the investigation may proceed without full participation of all personnel. This authority applies only for as long as reasonable danger to the child exists. A law enforcement officer or child protective services worker shall make a reasonable effort to find and provide a trained investigator or interviewer.

      (5) To ensure the protection and safe placement of a child, the Department of Human Services may request that team members obtain criminal history information on any person who is part of the household where the department may place or has placed a child who is in the department’s custody.

      (c) The information and records compiled under this subsection are exempt from ORS 192.311 to 192.478.

      (8) Each team shall develop policies that provide for an independent review of investigation procedures of sensitive cases after completion of court actions on particular cases. The policies shall include independent citizen input. Parents of child abuse victims shall be notified of the review procedure.

      (9) Each team shall designate at least one physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner who has been trained to conduct child abuse assessments, as defined in ORS 418.782, and who is, or who may designate another physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner who is, regularly available to conduct the medical assessment described in ORS 419B.023.

      (10) If photographs are taken pursuant to ORS 419B.028, and if the team meets to discuss the case, the photographs shall be made available to each member of the team at the first meeting regarding the child’s case following the taking of the photographs.

      (11) No later than September 1, 2008, each team shall submit to the Department of Justice a written summary identifying the designated medical professional described in subsection (9) of this section. After that date, this information shall be included in each regular report to the Department of Justice.

The team shall also develop a written strategy to ensure that each child in the county who is a suspected victim of child abuse will receive a medical assessment in compliance with ORS 419B.023. This strategy, and the estimated fiscal impact of any necessary recruitment and training, shall be submitted to the Department of Justice no later than September 1, 2008. This information shall be included in each regular report to the Department of Justice for each reporting period in which a team is not able to identify a designated medical professional described in subsection (9) of this section.

CHILDREN’S ADVOCACY CENTERS

 

      418.780 Purpose. (1) The Legislative Assembly recognizes that:

      (a) Protection of the child is of primary importance.

      (b) A serious need exists for a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to the prevention and investigation of child abuse, for intervention and for the treatment of children who are victims of child abuse in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of children. No child in this state should be denied access to a child abuse assessment because of an inability to pay. The cost of not assessing and treating abused children with the aid of specially trained personnel is too high.

      (2) The purpose of ORS 418.746 to 418.796 is to establish and maintain:

      (a) Sufficient county child abuse multidisciplinary teams to conduct timely investigations of allegations of child abuse and provide comprehensive services to victims of child abuse through coordinated child abuse multidisciplinary intervention plans.

      (b) Sufficient children’s advocacy centers and regional children’s advocacy centers in Oregon to ensure that every child referred to a center for concerns of neglect or abuse receives a skilled, complete and forensically sound child abuse assessment.

      (c) Sufficient coordination, expertise and support to provide training and technical assistance to county child abuse multidisciplinary teams. [1991 c.898 §1; 1993 c.33 §331; 1997 c.872 §32; 2001 c.624 §6; 2005 c.562 §4; 2019 c.141 §2]
