JUVENILE COURT REFEREES

 

      419A.150 Appointment; qualifications; hearings; orders; rehearings. (1) The judge of the juvenile court may appoint one or more persons as referee of the juvenile court. A referee shall be appointed in every county in which there is no resident juvenile court judge. A person appointed referee must be qualified by training and experience in the handling of juvenile matters, must have such further qualifications as may be prescribed by law and holds office as referee at the pleasure of the judge. The state shall pay the compensation of a referee appointed by the judge of a circuit court from funds available for the purpose. The county shall pay the compensation of a referee appointed by the judge of a county court.

      (2) The judge may direct that any case, or all cases of a class designated by the judge, be processed or heard in the first instance by a referee in the manner provided for the hearing of cases by the court. Upon conclusion of the hearing in each case, the referee shall transmit to the judge the findings, recommendations or order in writing of the referee.

      (3) When the referee conducts a hearing, the persons entitled to request rehearing as provided in subsection (7) of this section must be notified of the referee’s findings, recommendations or order, together with a notice to the effect that a rehearing may be had before a judge if requested within 10 days. A rehearing before a judge of the juvenile court may be determined on the same evidence introduced before the referee if a stenographic transcript of the proceedings was kept, but, in any case, additional evidence may be presented.

      (4) All orders of a referee become immediately effective, subject to the right of review provided in this section, and continue in full force and effect, unless stayed by order of the referee or by a juvenile court judge, until vacated or modified upon rehearing by order of a judge of the juvenile court. Any order entered by a referee becomes a final order of the juvenile court upon expiration of 10 days following its entry, unless a rehearing is ordered or requested.

      (5) The judge of the juvenile court or, in counties having more than one judge of the juvenile court, the presiding judge of the juvenile court may establish requirements that any or all orders of referees must be expressly approved by a judge of the juvenile court before becoming effective.

      (6) A judge of the juvenile court may, on the judge’s own motion, order a rehearing of any matter heard before a referee.

      (7) At any time prior to the expiration of 10 days after the entry of the order and findings of a referee into the court register, a child, ward, youth, youth offender, the parent, guardian, district attorney, Department of Human Services, juvenile department or other party affected by the order may request rehearing. The request for rehearing must be served upon all parties by the party requesting the rehearing.

      (8) All rehearings of matters heard before a referee shall be heard expeditiously by a judge of the juvenile court within 30 days after the filing of the request, unless the court orders a continuance. In no event may the rehearing occur later than 45 days after the date of the filing of the request. The rehearing is conducted de novo.

      (9) Notwithstanding subsection (7) of this section, when a referee finds that a youth is not within the jurisdiction of the court in a proceeding brought under ORS 419C.005, the district attorney may not request a rehearing. [1993 c.33 §43; 1993 c.546 §7; 2003 c.396 §24]

 

      419A.170 [1993 c.33 §44; 1993 c.546 §92; 1993 c.676 §41; 1997 c.130 §12; 2001 c.962 §91; 2003 c.396 §§25,26; 2005 c.755 §35; 2011 c.190 §1; repealed by 2012 c.97 §1]

Except as provided in ORS 153.108 (1), proceedings in adult criminal court and other juvenile court adjudicatory proceedings based on an act alleged in a petition or citation to have been committed by a child, ward, youth or youth offender or allegations arising out of the same conduct are barred when the juvenile court judge or referee has begun taking evidence in an adjudicatory hearing or has accepted a child, ward, youth or youth offender’s admission or answer of no contest to the allegations of the petition or citation. This section does not prevent appeal of any preadjudicatory order of the court that could be appealed in a criminal case, including, but not limited to, an order suppressing evidence. [1993 c.33 §46; 1999 c.1051 §134; 2003 c.396 §27]

 

APPEALS

 

      419A.200 Who may appeal; time limitations; procedure; effect of filing appeal; record on appeal; disclosure. (1) Except as provided in ORS 419A.190, any person or entity, including, but not limited to, a party to a juvenile court proceeding under ORS 419B.875 (1) or 419C.285 (1), whose rights or duties are adversely affected by a judgment of the juvenile court may appeal therefrom. An appeal from a circuit court must be taken to the Court of Appeals, and an appeal from a county court must be taken to the circuit court.

      (2) If the proceeding is in the circuit court and no record of the proceedings was kept, the court, on motion made not later than 15 days after the entry of the court’s judgment, shall grant a rehearing and shall direct that a record of the proceedings be kept. However, the court may not grant a rehearing in a case barred by ORS 419A.190 without the consent of the child, ward, youth or youth offender affected by such case. If a rehearing is held, the time for taking an appeal runs from the date of entry of the court’s judgment after the rehearing.

      (3)(a) The appeal may be taken by causing a notice of appeal, in the form prescribed by ORS 19.250, to be served:

      (A) On all parties who have appeared in the proceeding;

      (B) On the trial court administrator or other person serving as clerk of the juvenile court; and

      (C) On the juvenile court transcript coordinator, if a transcript is designated in connection with the appeal.

      (b) The original of the notice with proof of service must be filed with:

      (A) The Court of Appeals if the appeal is from a circuit court; or

      (B) The circuit court if the appeal is from a county court.

      (c) The notice must be filed not later than 30 days after the entry of the court’s judgment. On appeal from the county court, the circuit court shall hear the matter de novo and its judgment is appealable to the Court of Appeals in the same manner as if the proceeding had been commenced in the circuit court.

      (4) The counsel in the proceeding from which the appeal is being taken shall file and serve those documents necessary to commence an appeal if the counsel is requested to do so by the party the counsel represents. If the party requesting an appeal is represented by court-appointed counsel, court-appointed counsel may discharge the duty to commence an appeal under this subsection by complying with policies and procedures established by the office of public defense services for appeals of juvenile court judgments.

      (5)(a) Upon motion of a person, other than the state, entitled to appeal under subsection (1) of this section, the appellate court shall grant the person leave to file a notice of appeal after the time limits described in subsection (3) of this section if:

      (A) The person shows a colorable claim of error in the proceeding from which the appeal is taken; and

      (B) The person shows that the failure to file a timely notice of appeal is not personally attributable to the person.

      (b) A person other than the state is not entitled to relief under this subsection for failure to file timely notice of cross-appeal when the state appeals pursuant to ORS 419A.208.

      (c) The request for leave to file a notice of appeal after the time limits prescribed in subsection (3) of this section must be filed no later than 90 days after entry of the judgment being appealed and must be accompanied by the notice of appeal sought to be filed. A request for leave under this subsection may be filed by mail and is deemed filed on the date of mailing if the request is mailed as provided in ORS 19.260.

      (d) The court may not grant relief under this subsection unless the state has notice and opportunity to respond to the person’s request for relief.

      (6) An appeal to the Court of Appeals must be conducted in the same manner as an appeal under ORS chapter 19 except that the court shall advance the appeal on the court’s docket in the same manner as appeals in criminal cases.

      (7)(a) Except as provided in ORS 419A.208 (2), or when otherwise ordered by the appellate court, the filing of an appeal does not suspend an order or judgment of the juvenile court nor discharge the ward or youth offender from the custody of the person, institution or agency in whose custody the ward or youth offender may have been placed nor preclude the juvenile court after notice and hearing from entering such further orders relating to the ward or youth offender’s custody pending final disposition of the appeal as it finds necessary by reason only of matters transpiring subsequent to the order or judgment appealed from. The trial court administrator shall immediately file certified copies of any such order or judgment with the Court of Appeals.

      (b) Notwithstanding the filing of an appeal from a jurisdictional or dispositional judgment or an order entered pursuant to ORS 419B.449 or 419B.476, the juvenile court may proceed with the adjudication of a petition seeking termination of the parental rights of a parent of the ward who is subject to the judgment from which the appeal is taken.

      (c) The appeal of any judgment entered in a termination of parental rights proceeding under paragraph (b) of this subsection must be consolidated, if appropriate, with any pending appeal of an order or judgment entered under ORS 419B.325, 419B.449 or 419B.476. The consolidated appeal must be conducted and advanced on the court’s docket in the same manner as termination of parental rights cases.

      (8) On appeal of a judgment or final order, the appellate court may review any interlocutory order that:

      (a) Involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or final order appealed from; and

      (b) Was made after entry of the last appealable judgment or final order preceding entry of the judgment or final order being appealed.

      (9) The district attorney or Attorney General shall represent the state in the appeal.

      (10)(a) The court from which an appeal is taken shall prepare and transmit a record on appeal in the manner provided in ORS 19.365, except that, when the appeal is to the circuit court from a county court, the record on appeal shall be prepared and transmitted by the county court to the circuit court.

      (b) The court to which an appeal is taken under this section shall keep a record of the case on appeal that includes but is not limited to notices of appeal, briefs, motions, orders of the court and other papers filed with the court on appeal.

      (c) The record on appeal prepared and transmitted under paragraph (a) of this subsection, when it is in the custody of the court to which the appeal is taken, and the record of the case on appeal kept under paragraph (b) of this subsection are subject to the same limitations on inspection, copying and disclosure of records, reports and materials as those set forth under ORS 419A.255.

      (d) The court on appeal may consent to disclosure of:

      (A) Records described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, while in the custody of the court to which the appeal is taken, in the same manner and under the same circumstances as the juvenile court consents to disclosure under ORS 419A.255;

      (B) Records described in paragraph (b) of this subsection; or

      (C) An audio or video recording prepared of an oral proceeding on appeal, in the same manner as permitted under ORS 419A.256 (1)(b), (3) and (4).

      (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any decision, as that term is defined in ORS 19.450, issued by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, on appeal or review of a juvenile court decision, is not confidential and is not exempt from disclosure. [1993 c.33 §47; 1995 c.79 §214; 1995 c.422 §66; 1997 c.389 §10; 1997 c.761 §5; 1999 c.263 §1; 1999 c.859 §15a; 2001 c.480 §§3,3a; 2001 c.910 §3; 2003 c.396 §28; 2007 c.58 §1; 2009 c.231 §6; 2009 c.484 §12; 2013 c.417 §8; 2014 c.71 §6]

 

      419A.205 Judgments described; jurisdiction of juvenile court during pendency of appeal; disposition. (1) For the purpose of being appealed, the following are judgments:

      (a) A judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court;

      (b) A judgment disposing of a petition including, but not limited to, a disposition under ORS 419B.325 or 419C.411;

      (c) Any final disposition of a petition; and

      (d) A final order adversely affecting the rights or duties of a party and made in a proceeding after judgment including, but not limited to, a final order under ORS 419B.449 or 419B.476.

      (2) An appeal from a judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court does not deprive the juvenile court of jurisdiction to proceed with a disposition of the matter.

      (3) If an appeal is taken from a judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court before the juvenile court enters a judgment disposing of the matter under ORS 419B.325 or 419C.411, any necessary modification of the appeal must be made according to the rules of the appellate court.

      (4) When an appeal is taken from a judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court, if the appellate court:

      (a) Reverses the judgment, the judgment disposing of the matter is reversed; or

      (b) Modifies the judgment, a party may move for relief as otherwise provided by law. [2001 c.480 §2; 2003 c.348 §1; 2003 c.396 §29]

 

      419A.208 Orders subject to appeal by state; effect of appeal of preadjudicatory order. (1) In addition to the state’s right to appeal under ORS 419A.200, the state may appeal from any of the following orders of a judge or referee:

      (a) An order made prior to an adjudicatory hearing dismissing or setting aside a delinquency petition;

      (b) An order that sets aside a petition for delinquency if the order is made after an adjudicatory hearing in which the youth is found to be within the jurisdiction of the court;

      (c) An order made prior to an adjudicatory hearing suppressing or limiting evidence or refusing to suppress or limit evidence; or

      (d) An order made prior to an adjudicatory hearing for the return or restoration of things seized.

      (2) If the state pursuant to subsection (1) of this section appeals a preadjudicatory order, and the youth is in detention in the same proceeding pursuant to ORS 419C.109, 419C.136, 419C.139, 419C.170 and 419C.173, the juvenile court shall consider release of the youth from detention during the pendency of the appeal in accordance with the following provisions:

      (a) When the youth is charged with an act that would be murder if committed by an adult, release shall be denied when the proof is evident or the presumption strong that the youth committed the act.

      (b) The youth shall be released upon the youth’s personal recognizance unless release criteria show to the satisfaction of the juvenile court that the youth would not be likely to appear before the court as ordered upon later appearance dates and that such a release is therefore unwarranted. Release criteria include the following:

      (A) The youth’s education and employment status and history and financial condition;

      (B) The nature and extent of the youth’s family relationships;

      (C) The youth’s past and present residences;

      (D) The names of persons who agree to assist the youth in attending court at the proper time;

      (E) The nature of the current petition;

      (F) The youth’s juvenile record, if any, and, if the youth has previously been released pending trial, whether the youth appeared as required;

      (G) Any facts indicating the possibility of violations of law if the youth is released without restrictions;

      (H) Any facts tending to indicate that the youth has strong ties to the community; and

      (I) Any other facts tending to indicate the likelihood that the youth will appear before the court as ordered upon later appearance dates.

      (c) If the court finds that release of the youth on the youth’s personal recognizance is unwarranted, it shall order conditional release. The court may impose upon the released youth one or more of the following conditions, but shall impose the least onerous condition reasonably likely to ensure the youth’s later appearance:

      (A) Release of the youth into the care of a parent or other responsible person or organization for supervising the youth and assisting the youth in appearing in court. The supervisor shall immediately notify the court in the event that the youth breaches the terms of the conditional release.

      (B) Reasonable restrictions on the activities, movements, associations and residences of the youth.

      (C) Any other reasonable restriction designed to ensure the youth’s appearance. [2001 c.480 §5; 2003 c.396 §30]

 

      419A.209 Joint motion to vacate judgment or order; appeal after reconsideration. (1) Upon joint motion of the parties to an appeal from a judgment or order of the juvenile court, the court may vacate the judgment or order from which the appeal was taken and remand the matter to the juvenile court to reconsider the judgment or order, or any order entered by the juvenile court. Upon remand, the juvenile court shall have jurisdiction to enter a modified judgment or order.

      (2) After entry of a modified judgment or order on reconsideration, or upon reentry of the original judgment or order, either party may appeal in the same time and manner as an appeal from the original judgment or order. [2013 c.143 §2]

 

      419A.211 Appointment of counsel. (1) If the child, ward, youth, youth offender, parent or guardian is determined to be entitled to, and financially eligible for, appointment of counsel at state expense in an appeal as provided in ORS 419A.200 and 419A.208, the court, upon request of the person or upon its own motion, shall appoint suitable counsel to represent the person. Counsel appointed by the court shall be paid compensation determined by the public defense services executive director as provided in ORS 135.055 if the circuit court is the appellate court or as provided in ORS 138.500 if the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court is the appellate court. The court may not substitute one appointed counsel for another except pursuant to the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission.

      (2)(a) When the court appoints counsel to represent the child, ward, youth or youth offender, it may order the parent, if able, or guardian of the estate, if the estate is able, to pay to the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, through the clerk of the court, in full or in part the administrative costs of determining the ability of the parents or estate to pay for legal services and the costs of the legal and other services that are related to the provision of appointed counsel.

      (b) The test of the parent’s or estate’s ability to pay costs under paragraph (a) of this subsection is the same test as applied to appointment of counsel for defendants under ORS 151.216. If counsel is provided at state expense, the court shall apply this test in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.485.

      (c) If counsel is provided at state expense, the court shall determine the amount the parents or estate is required to pay for the costs of administrative, legal and other services related to the provision of appointed counsel in the same manner as this amount is determined under ORS 151.487.

      (d) The court’s order of payment is enforceable in the same manner as an order of support under ORS 419B.408 and 419C.600.

      (3) When the court appoints counsel and the child, ward, youth, youth offender, parent or guardian has been determined to be entitled to, and financially eligible for, appointed counsel at state expense, the compensation for counsel and costs and expenses necessary to the appeal shall be determined and paid as provided in ORS 135.055 if the circuit court is the appellate court or as provided in ORS 138.500 if the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court is the appellate court. [2001 c.480 §6; 2001 c.962 §56; 2003 c.396 §§31,32; 2003 c.449 §50; 2012 c.107 §45]

 

RESTRAINTS

 

      419A.240 Use of restraints during juvenile court proceedings. During any juvenile court proceeding under this chapter and ORS chapters 419B and 419C regarding a youth, youth offender or young person:

      (1)(a) Instruments of physical restraint, such as handcuffs, chains, irons, straitjackets, cloth restraints, leather restraints, plastic restraints and other similar items, may not be used during the juvenile court proceeding and must be removed prior to the youth, youth offender or young person being brought into the courtroom unless the court finds that the use of restraints is necessary due to an immediate and serious risk of dangerous or disruptive behavior and there are no less restrictive alternatives that will alleviate the immediate and serious risk of dangerous or disruptive behavior.

      (b) If the means do not exist to remove instruments of physical restraint as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection prior to the youth, youth offender or young person being brought into the courtroom, such restraints shall be removed prior to commencement of the proceeding.

      (c) Instruments of physical restraint removed under this subsection must remain removed for the duration of the proceeding.

      (2) In determining whether an immediate and serious risk of dangerous or disruptive behavior exists, the court may consider:

      (a) Whether the youth, youth offender or young person has a history of dangerous or disruptive behavior that has placed the youth, youth offender or young person or others in potentially harmful situations as evidenced by recent behavior;

      (b) Whether the youth, youth offender or young person presents a substantial risk of inflicting physical harm on himself or others; and

      (c) Whether the youth, youth offender or young person presents a substantial risk of flight from the courtroom or courtroom premises.

      (3) In determining whether a less restrictive alternative will alleviate the immediate and serious risk of dangerous or disruptive behavior, the court may consider the presence of court personnel, law enforcement officers, juvenile department staff or counselors, or bailiffs.

      (4) When the use of restraints is requested by a law enforcement agency, the juvenile department or other party to the juvenile court proceeding, the request must be made in writing and presented to the court and other parties prior to the youth, youth offender or young person’s appearance in the courtroom for the juvenile court proceeding. The request must describe discrete, recent, concrete and observable examples of behaviors or risk factors that justify the use of restraints.

      (5) The court shall provide the attorney for the youth, youth offender or young person an opportunity to be heard prior to ordering the use of restraints. If restraints are ordered, the court shall make written findings of fact in support of the order.

      (6) Any restraints used must allow the youth, youth offender or young person limited movement of the hands to read and handle documents and writings necessary to the juvenile court proceeding. Under no circumstances should a youth, youth offender or young person be restrained to a stationary object or another person.

      (7) Restraints may not be used as punishment, for convenience or as a substitute for staff supervision. [2017 c.257 §2]

 

      419A.245 Use of restraints during transport. During the transportation of a youth, youth offender, young person, ward or child by the Department of Human Services, the Oregon Health Authority or an agent of the department or authority:

      (1) Instruments of physical restraint, such as handcuffs, chains, irons, straitjackets, cloth restraints, leather restraints, plastic restraints and other similar items, may not be used unless:

      (a) The transportation is secure transportation to a detention facility, youth correction facility, secure hospital, secure intensive community inpatient facility or other secure facility; or

      (b) Restraints are necessary due to an immediate and serious risk of dangerous or disruptive behavior and there are no less restrictive alternatives that will alleviate the immediate and serious risk of dangerous or disruptive behavior.

      (2) Prior to the use of restraints during transportation, a transportation safety plan, including documentation of the need for restraints, must be created. The transportation safety plan must address intervention strategies designed to modify behavior without the use of restraints and recommend the least restrictive effective alternative.

      (3) Only staff who have been adequately trained in restraint device usage may use and apply restraints during transportation.

      (4) Restraints during transportation may not be used as punishment, for convenience or as a substitute for staff supervision.

      (5) This section applies to all circumstances of transportation of a ward or child by the Department of Human Services, the Oregon Health Authority or an agent of the department or authority, including but not limited to transportation between placements with child-caring agencies, foster homes, shelter homes, treatment and residential facilities or any other type of placement destination for a ward or child in the custody of the Department of Human Services.

      (6) As used in this section:

      (a) “Detention facility” has the meaning given that term in ORS 419A.004.

      (b) “Youth correction facility” has the meaning given that term in ORS 420.005. [2017 c.257 §3]

      (a) Pursuant to a search warrant;

      (b) According to laws concerning adults if the youth has been transferred to criminal court for prosecution;

      (c) Upon consent of both the child or youth and the child or youth’s parent after advice that they are not required to give such consent;

      (d) Upon request or consent of the child’s parent alone if the child is less than 10 years of age, and if the law enforcement agency delivers the original photographs or fingerprints to the parent and does not make or retain any copies thereof; or

      (e) By order of the juvenile court.

      (19) When all agencies subject to an expunction judgment have indicated their compliance or in any event no later than six weeks following the date the judgment was delivered as required by subsection (18) of this section, the juvenile court shall provide the person who is the subject of the record with a copy of the expunction judgment, a list of complying and noncomplying agencies, and a written notice of rights and effects of expunction. The juvenile court and juvenile department then shall expunge forthwith all records which they possess and which are subject to the judgment, except the original expunction judgment and the list of complying and noncomplying agencies which must be preserved under seal.

      (20) In addition to those agencies identified in ORS 419A.260 (1)(d), the juvenile, circuit, municipal and justice courts, and the district and city attorneys of this state, are bound by an expunction judgment of any juvenile court of appropriate jurisdiction in this state issuing an expunction judgment.

      (21) Upon entry of an expunction judgment, the contact that is the subject of the expunged record shall not be disclosed by any agency.

      (22) A person who is the subject of a record that has been expunged under this section may assert that the record never existed and that the contact, which was the subject of the record, never occurred without incurring a penalty for perjury or false swearing under the laws of this state.

      (23) Juvenile courts, by court rule or by order related to a particular matter, may direct that records concerning a subject person be destroyed. No records shall be destroyed until at least three years have elapsed after the date of the subject’s most recent termination. In the event the record has been expunged, the expunction judgment and list of complying and noncomplying agencies may not be destroyed, but shall be preserved under seal. The destruction of records under this subsection does not constitute expunction.

      (24) An expunction judgment and list of complying and noncomplying agencies shall be released from confidentiality only on order of the court originating the expunction judgment, based on a finding that review of a particular case furthers compliance with the expunction provisions of this chapter.

      (25) A subject has a right of action against any person who intentionally violates the confidentiality provisions of this section. In the proceeding, punitive damages up to an amount of $1,000 may be sought in addition to any actual damages. The prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees.

      (26) Intentional violation of the confidentiality provisions of this section by a public employee is cause for dismissal.

      (27) A person who intentionally releases all or part of an expunged record commits a Class C misdemeanor. [1993 c.33 §51; 1993 c.546 §9; 1997 c.249 §132; 1999 c.111 §2; 2001 c.480 §7; 2001 c.622 §45; 2007 c.609 §10; 2012 c.23 §1; 2013 c.390 §2; 2015 c.820 §33]

 

      419A.265 Eligibility for order of expunction for certain adjudications involving marijuana. Notwithstanding ORS 419A.262 (2)(a), a person is eligible for an order of expunction under ORS 419A.262 if the person was adjudicated for committing an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a criminal offense in which possession, delivery or manufacture of marijuana or a marijuana item as defined in ORS 475B.015 is an element and:

      (1) The court finds that at least one year has elapsed since the date of the person’s most recent termination;

      (2) The applicant has not been adjudicated or convicted for any other act or offense, excluding motor vehicle violations; and
