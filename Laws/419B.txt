      419B.007 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that for the purpose of facilitating the use of protective social services to prevent further abuse, safeguard and enhance the welfare of abused children, and preserve family life when consistent with the protection of the child by stabilizing the family and improving parental capacity, it is necessary and in the public interest to require mandatory reports and investigations of abuse of children and to encourage voluntary reports. [1993 c.546 §13]

 

      419B.010 Duty of officials to report child abuse; exceptions; penalty. (1) Any public or private official having reasonable cause to believe that any child with whom the official comes in contact has suffered abuse or that any person with whom the official comes in contact has abused a child shall immediately report or cause a report to be made in the manner required in ORS 419B.015. Nothing contained in ORS 40.225 to 40.295 or 419B.234 (6) affects the duty to report imposed by this section, except that a psychiatrist, psychologist, member of the clergy, attorney or guardian ad litem appointed under ORS 419B.231 is not required to report such information communicated by a person if the communication is privileged under ORS 40.225 to 40.295 or 419B.234 (6). An attorney is not required to make a report under this section by reason of information communicated to the attorney in the course of representing a client if disclosure of the information would be detrimental to the client.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a report need not be made under this section if the public or private official acquires information relating to abuse by reason of a report made under this section, or by reason of a proceeding arising out of a report made under this section, and the public or private official reasonably believes that the information is already known by a law enforcement agency or the Department of Human Services.

      (3) The duty to report under this section is personal to the public or private official alone, regardless of whether the official is employed by, a volunteer of or a representative or agent for any type of entity or organization that employs persons or uses persons as volunteers who are public or private officials in its operations.

      (4) The duty to report under this section exists regardless of whether the entity or organization that employs the public or private official or uses the official as a volunteer has its own procedures or policies for reporting abuse internally within the entity or organization.

      (5) A person who violates subsection (1) of this section commits a Class A violation. Prosecution under this subsection shall be commenced at any time within 18 months after commission of the offense. [1993 c.546 §14; 1999 c.1051 §180; 2001 c.104 §149; 2001 c.904 §15; 2005 c.450 §7; 2012 c.92 §11]

 

      419B.015 Report form and content; notice. (1)(a) A person making a report of child abuse, whether the report is made voluntarily or is required by ORS 419B.010, shall make an oral report by telephone or otherwise to the local office of the Department of Human Services, to the designee of the department or to a law enforcement agency within the county where the person making the report is located at the time of the contact. The report shall contain, if known, the names and addresses of the child and the parents of the child or other persons responsible for care of the child, the child’s age, the nature and extent of the abuse, including any evidence of previous abuse, the explanation given for the abuse and any other information that the person making the report believes might be helpful in establishing the cause of the abuse and the identity of the perpetrator.

      (b) When a report of child abuse is received by the department, the department shall notify a law enforcement agency within the county where the report was made. When a report of child abuse is received by a designee of the department, the designee shall notify, according to the contract, either the department or a law enforcement agency within the county where the report was made. When a report of child abuse is received by a law enforcement agency, the agency shall notify the local office of the department within the county where the report was made.

      (c) When a report of child abuse is received by the department or by a law enforcement agency, the department or law enforcement agency, or both, may collect information concerning the military status of the parent or guardian of the child who is the subject of the report and may share the information with the appropriate military authorities. Disclosure of information under this paragraph is subject to ORS 419B.035 (7).

      (2) When a report of child abuse is received under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the entity receiving the report shall make the notification required by subsection (1)(b) of this section according to rules adopted by the department under ORS 419B.017.

      (3)(a) When a report alleging that a child or ward in substitute care may have been subjected to abuse is received by the department, the department shall notify the attorney for the child or ward, the child’s or ward’s court appointed special advocate, the parents of the child or ward and any attorney representing a parent of the child or ward that a report has been received.

      (b) The name and address of and other identifying information about the person who made the report may not be disclosed under this subsection. Any person or entity to whom notification is made under this subsection may not release any information not authorized by this subsection.

      419B.020 Duty of department or law enforcement agency receiving report; investigation; notice to parents; physical examination; child’s consent; notice at conclusion of investigation. (1) If the Department of Human Services or a law enforcement agency receives a report of child abuse, the department or the agency shall immediately:

      (a) Cause an investigation to be made to determine the nature and cause of the abuse of the child; and

      (b) Notify the Office of Child Care if the alleged child abuse occurred in a child care facility as defined in ORS 329A.250.

      (2) If the abuse reported in subsection (1) of this section is alleged to have occurred at a child care facility:

      (b) The department and the agency shall each report the outcomes of their investigations to the Office of Child Care.

      (3) If the law enforcement agency conducting the investigation finds reasonable cause to believe that abuse has occurred, the law enforcement agency shall notify by oral report followed by written report the local office of the department. The department shall provide protective social services of its own or of other available social agencies if necessary to prevent further abuses to the child or to safeguard the child’s welfare.

      (4) If a child is taken into protective custody by the department, the department shall promptly make reasonable efforts to ascertain the name and address of the child’s parents or guardian.

      (5)(a) If a child is taken into protective custody by the department or a law enforcement official, the department or law enforcement official shall, if possible, make reasonable efforts to advise the parents or guardian immediately, regardless of the time of day, that the child has been taken into custody, the reasons the child has been taken into custody and general information about the child’s placement, and the telephone number of the local office of the department and any after-hours telephone numbers.

      (b) Notice may be given by any means reasonably certain of notifying the parents or guardian, including but not limited to written, telephonic or in-person oral notification.

      (6) If a law enforcement officer or the department, when taking a child into protective custody, has reasonable cause to believe that the child has been affected by sexual abuse and rape of a child as defined in ORS 419B.005 (1)(a)(C) and that physical evidence of the abuse exists and is likely to disappear, the court may authorize a physical examination for the purposes of preserving evidence if the court finds that it is in the best interest of the child to have such an examination. Nothing in this section affects the authority of the department to consent to physical examinations of the child at other times.

      (7) A minor child of 12 years of age or older may refuse to consent to the examination described in subsection (6) of this section.

      (5) A law enforcement agency, upon completing an investigation and closing the file in a specific case relating to child abuse or neglect, shall make reports and records in the case available upon request to any law enforcement agency or community corrections agency in this state, to the Department of Corrections or to the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision for the purpose of managing and supervising offenders in custody or on probation, parole, post-prison supervision or other form of conditional or supervised release. A law enforcement agency may make reports and records compiled under the provisions of ORS 419B.010 to 419B.050 available to law enforcement, community corrections, corrections or parole agencies in an open case when the law enforcement agency determines that the disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation in the case.

      (B) A person may disclose records made available to the person under subsection (1)(i) of this section if the records are disclosed for the purpose of advancing the public interest.

      (7) An officer or employee of the Department of Human Services or of a law enforcement agency or any person or entity to whom disclosure is made pursuant to subsections (1) to (6) of this section may not release any information not authorized by subsections (1) to (6) of this section.

      (8) As used in this section, “law enforcement agency” has the meaning given that term in ORS 181A.010.

      (9) A person who violates subsection (6)(a) or (7) of this section commits a Class A violation. [1993 c.546 §§20,20a; 1995 c.278 §51; 1997 c.328 §8; 1999 c.1051 §181; 2003 c.14 §224; 2003 c.412 §1; 2003 c.591 §8; 2005 c.317 §1; 2005 c.659 §2; 2009 c.348 §§3,4; 2009 c.393 §1; 2012 c.3 §2; 2013 c.624 §84; 2014 c.45 §43; 2017 c.108 §5; 2017 c.356 §43; 2017 c.377 §1; 2017 c.616 §2]

      (2) In any judicial proceedings resulting from a report made pursuant to ORS 419B.010 to 419B.050, either spouse shall be a competent and compellable witness against the other. [1993 c.546 §21; 2009 c.442 §37; 2015 c.629 §49]

 

      419B.045 Investigation conducted on school premises; notification; role of school personnel. (1) If an investigation of a report of child abuse is conducted on school premises, the school administrator shall first be notified that the investigation is to take place, unless the school administrator is a subject of the investigation.

The school administrator or a school staff member designated by the administrator may, at the investigator’s discretion, be present to facilitate the investigation. The investigator shall be advised by a school administrator or a school staff member of a child’s disabling conditions, if any, prior to any interview with the child. A school administrator or school staff member may not notify any person, including a child’s parents or guardian, other than the department or law enforcement agency of an investigation described in this section and may not disclose any information obtained during an investigation, nor shall the information become part of the child’s school records. The school administrator or school staff member may testify at any subsequent court proceeding relating to the investigation and may be interviewed by the respective litigants prior to any court proceeding.

      (2) A school district, school administrator or school staff member may not be held liable for civil damages as a result of compliance with the notification and disclosure prohibitions in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Subsections (1) and (2) of this section apply solely to an investigation that involves an interview of the suspected victim in the report of child abuse or witnesses and do not apply to an investigation or interview of a person who is suspected of having committed the abuse that is the subject of the report. [1993 c.546 §22; 2003 c.14 §225; 2017 c.515 §1]

 

      419B.050 Authority of health care provider to disclose information; immunity from liability. (1) Upon notice by a law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, a member agency of a county multidisciplinary child abuse team or a member of a county multidisciplinary child abuse team that a child abuse investigation is being conducted under ORS 419B.020, a health care provider must permit the law enforcement agency, the department, the member agency of the county multidisciplinary child abuse team or the member of the county multidisciplinary child abuse team to inspect and copy medical records, including, but not limited to, prenatal and birth records, of the child involved in the investigation without the consent of the child, or the parent or guardian of the child. A health care provider who in good faith disclosed medical records under this section is not civilly or criminally liable for the disclosure.

      (2) As used in this section, “health care provider” has the meaning given that term in ORS 192.556. [1997 c.873 §27; 1999 c.537 §3; 2001 c.104 §150; 2005 c.562 §27]

      (a) Has been approved in writing by the Director of Human Services or the director’s designee;

      (b) Sets forth sufficient facts and evidence, the truth of which has been affirmed by the employee; and

JUVENILE COURT

 

(Generally)

 

      419B.090 Juvenile court; jurisdiction; policy. (1) The juvenile court is a court of record and exercises jurisdiction as a court of general and equitable jurisdiction and not as a court of limited or inferior jurisdiction. The juvenile court is called “The _________ Court of _________ County, Juvenile Department.”

      (2)(a) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to recognize that children are individuals who have legal rights. Among those rights are the right to:

      (A) Permanency with a safe family;

      (B) Freedom from physical, sexual or emotional abuse or exploitation; and

      (C) Freedom from substantial neglect of basic needs.

      (b) Parents and guardians have a duty to afford their children the rights listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection. Parents and guardians have a duty to remove any impediment to their ability to perform parental duties that afford these rights to their children. When a parent or guardian fails to fulfill these duties, the juvenile court may determine that it is in the best interests of the child to remove the child from the parent or guardian either temporarily or permanently.

      (c) The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that a child coming within the jurisdiction of the court may receive such care, guidance, treatment and control as will lead to the child’s welfare and the protection of the community.

      (3) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to safeguard and promote each child’s right to safety, stability and well-being and to safeguard and promote each child’s relationships with parents, siblings, grandparents, other relatives and adults with whom a child develops healthy emotional attachments.

      (4) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to guard the liberty interest of parents protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and to protect the rights and interests of children, as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The provisions of this chapter shall be construed and applied in compliance with federal constitutional limitations on state action established by the United States Supreme Court with respect to interference with the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, including, but not limited to, the right to:

      (a) Guide the secular and religious education of their children;

      (b) Make health care decisions for their children; and

      (c) Discipline their children.

      (5) It is the policy of the State of Oregon, in those cases not described as extreme conduct under ORS 419B.502, to offer appropriate reunification services to parents and guardians to allow them the opportunity to adjust their circumstances, conduct or conditions to make it possible for the child to safely return home within a reasonable time. Although there is a strong preference that children live in their own homes with their own families, the state recognizes that it is not always possible or in the best interests of the child or the public for children who have been abused or neglected to be reunited with their parents or guardians. In those cases, the State of Oregon has the obligation to create or provide an alternative, safe and permanent home for the child.

      (6) The State of Oregon recognizes the value of the Indian Child Welfare Act and hereby incorporates the policies of that Act. [1997 c.873 §2a; 1999 c.859 §22; 2001 c.686 §21; 2007 c.71 §112; 2007 c.806 §3; 2015 c.795 §1]

 

      419B.100 Jurisdiction; bases; Indian children. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section and ORS 107.726, the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and:

      (a) Who is beyond the control of the person’s parents, guardian or other person having custody of the person;

      (b) Whose behavior is such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others;

      (c) Whose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others;

      (d) Who is dependent for care and support on a public or private child-caring agency that needs the services of the court in planning for the best interest of the person;

      (e) Whose parents or any other person or persons having custody of the person have:

      (A) Abandoned the person;

      (B) Failed to provide the person with the care or education required by law;

      (C) Subjected the person to cruelty, depravity or unexplained physical injury; or

      (D) Failed to provide the person with the care, guidance and protection necessary for the physical, mental or emotional well-being of the person;

      (f) Who has run away from the home of the person;

      (g) Who has filed a petition for emancipation pursuant to ORS 419B.550 to 419B.558; or

      (h) Who is subject to an order entered under ORS 419C.411 (7)(a).

      (2) The court shall have jurisdiction under subsection (1) of this section even though the child is receiving adequate care from the person having physical custody of the child.

      (3) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not prevent a court of competent jurisdiction from entertaining a civil action or suit involving a child.

      (4) The court does not have further jurisdiction as provided in subsection (1) of this section after a minor has been emancipated pursuant to ORS 419B.550 to 419B.558.

      (5)(a) An Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of the tribe, except where the jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the state by existing federal law.

      (b) Upon the petition of either parent, the Indian custodian or the Indian child’s tribe, the juvenile court, absent good cause to the contrary and absent objection by either parent, shall transfer a proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian child’s tribe, to the jurisdiction of the tribe.

      (c) The juvenile court shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of an Indian tribe applicable to an Indian child custody proceeding to the same extent that the juvenile court gives full faith and credit to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of any other entity. [1993 c.33 §53; 1993 c.546 §10; 1993 c.643 §5; 2005 c.843 §31; 2011 c.291 §5; 2013 c.1 §61]

 

      419B.110 Emergency medical care; court may authorize. Whether or not a petition has been filed, if a child requires emergency medical care, including surgery, and no parent is available or willing to consent to the care, a judge of the juvenile court may authorize the care. The judge may thereafter direct the filing of a new petition. [1993 c.546 §24]

 

      419B.112 Court appointed special advocate; duties; immunity; access to information; funding; rules. (1) In every case under ORS chapter 419B, the court shall appoint a court appointed special advocate. The court appointed special advocate is deemed a party in these proceedings and may be represented by counsel, file pleadings and request hearings and may subpoena, examine and cross-examine witnesses. If the court appointed special advocate is represented by counsel, counsel shall be paid from funds in the Court Appointed Special Advocate Fund established under ORS 184.498. Counsel representing a court appointed special advocate may not be paid from moneys in the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, from moneys appropriated to the Public Defense Services Commission or from Judicial Department operating funds.

      (2) Subject to the direction of the court, the duties of the court appointed special advocate are to:

      (a) Investigate all relevant information about the case;

      (b) Advocate for the child or ward, ensuring that all relevant facts are brought before the court;

      (c) Facilitate and negotiate to ensure that the court, the Department of Human Services, if applicable, and the child or ward’s attorney, if any, fulfill their obligations to the child or ward in a timely fashion; and

      (d) Monitor all court orders to ensure compliance and to bring to the court’s attention any change in circumstances that may require a modification of an order of the court.

      (3) If a juvenile court does not have a sufficient number of qualified court appointed special advocates available to it, the court may, in fulfillment of the requirements of this section, appoint a juvenile department employee or other suitable person to represent the child or ward’s interest in court pursuant to ORS 419A.012 or 419B.195.

      (4) Any person appointed as a court appointed special advocate in any judicial proceeding on behalf of the child or ward is immune from any liability for defamation or statements made in good faith by that person, orally or in writing, in the course of the case review or judicial proceeding.

      (5) Any person appointed as a court appointed special advocate, CASA Volunteer Program director, CASA Volunteer Program employee or member of the board of directors or trustees of any CASA Volunteer Program is immune from any liability for acts or omissions or errors in judgment made in good faith in the course or scope of that person’s duties or employment as part of a CASA Volunteer Program.

      (6) Whenever the court appoints a court appointed special advocate or other person under subsections (1) to (3) of this section to represent the child or ward, the court may require a parent, if able, or guardian of the estate, if the estate is able, to pay, in whole or in part, the reasonable costs of court appointed special advocate services, including reasonable attorney fees. The court’s order of payment is enforceable in the same manner as an order of support under ORS 419B.408.

      (7) Upon presentation of the order of appointment by the court appointed special advocate, any agency, hospital, school organization, division, office or department of the state, doctor, nurse or other health care provider, psychologist, psychiatrist, police department or mental health clinic shall permit the court appointed special advocate to inspect and copy, and may consult with the court appointed special advocate regarding, any records relating to the child or ward involved in the case, without the consent of the child, ward or parents.

      (8) All records and information acquired or reviewed by a court appointed special advocate during the course of official duties are deemed confidential under ORS 419A.255.

      (9) For the purposes of a Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.) grant to this state under P.L. 93-247, or any related state or federal legislation, a court appointed special advocate or other person appointed pursuant to subsections (1) to (3) of this section is deemed a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the child or ward in proceedings before the court. [2012 c.97 §2; 2012 c.107 §105; 2017 c.630 §9]

 

      Note: 419B.112 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 419B or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      419B.115 [1993 c.546 §25; 1997 c.479 §2; 1997 c.873 §21; 1999 c.859 §7; 2001 c.214 §1; 2001 c.622 §§39,39a; 2001 c.962 §83; renumbered 419B.875 in 2001]

 

      419B.116 Intervention; caregiver relationship; rights of limited participation. (1)(a) As used in this section, “caregiver relationship” means a relationship between a person and a child or ward:

      (A) That has existed:

      (i) For the 12 months immediately preceding the initiation of the dependency proceeding;

      (ii) For at least six months during the dependency proceeding; or

      (iii) For half of the child or ward’s life if the child or ward is less than six months of age;

      (B) In which the person had physical custody of the child or ward or resided in the same household as the child or ward;

      (C) In which the person provided the child or ward on a daily basis with the love, nurturing and other necessities required to meet the child or ward’s psychological and physical needs; and

      (D) On which the child depended to meet the child or ward’s needs.

      (b) “Caregiver relationship” does not include a relationship between a child or ward and a person who is the nonrelated foster parent of the child or ward unless the relationship continued for a period of at least 12 consecutive months.

      (2) A person asserting that the person has a caregiver relationship with a child or ward may file a motion for intervention in a juvenile dependency proceeding.

      (3) Filing a motion under subsection (2) of this section is the sole means by which a person may become a party to a juvenile dependency proceeding as an intervenor. An order granting intervention under this section is exclusively for juvenile dependency proceedings and does not confer standing or rights of intervention in any other action. Intervention is not allowed in proceedings under ORS 419B.500.

      (4) A motion for intervention under subsection (2) of this section must state:

      (a) The person’s relationship to the child or ward and the person’s involvement in the child or ward’s life;

      (b) The reason that intervention is sought;

      (c) How the person’s intervention is in the best interests of the child or ward;

      (d) Why the existing parties cannot adequately present the case; and

      (e) What specific relief is being sought.

      (5)(a) If a party wishes to oppose a motion for intervention, the party must file a written objection to the motion stating the grounds for the objection no later than 21 days after the motion is filed. If no written objection is filed as provided in this paragraph, the court may grant the motion without a hearing. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if a written objection is filed as provided in this paragraph, the court shall hold a hearing on the motion.

      (b) If a motion for intervention does not state a prima facie case as to the facts that must be proved under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the court may deny the motion without a hearing.

      (c) If the court holds a hearing on the motion for intervention, the court may grant the motion for intervention if the person moving to intervene in the case proves by a preponderance of the evidence that:

      (A) A caregiver relationship exists between the person and the child or ward;

      (B) The intervention is in the best interests of the child or ward;

      (C) The reason for intervention and the specific relief sought are consistent with the best interests of the child or ward; and

      (D) The existing parties cannot adequately present the case.

      (6) A person granted intervention is a party to the case and, except as provided in subsection (11) of this section, may be granted such relief as the court determines to be appropriate and in the best interests of the child or ward.

      (7) A person who is not a party under ORS 419B.875 or a person who intends to file a motion for appointment as a community guardian under ORS 419B.371 may seek rights of limited participation by filing a written motion for limited participation in a juvenile court proceeding. Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, the motion must state:

      (a) The reason that limited participation is being sought;

      (b) How the person’s limited participation is in the best interests of the child or ward;

      (c) Why the parties cannot adequately present the case; and

      (d) The specific rights of limited participation that are being sought.

      (8)(a) If a party wishes to oppose a motion filed under subsection (7) of this section, the party must file a written objection to the motion stating the grounds for the objection no later than 21 days after the motion is filed. If no written objection is filed as provided in this paragraph, the court may grant the motion without a hearing.

      (b) If a motion seeking rights of limited participation does not state a prima facie case as to the facts that must be proved under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the court may deny the motion without a hearing.

      (c) If the court holds a hearing on the motion seeking rights of limited participation, the court may grant the motion if the person seeking rights of limited participation proves by a preponderance of the evidence that:

      (A) The person’s limited participation is in the best interests of the child or ward;

      (B) The reason for limited participation and the specific rights sought are consistent with the best interests of the child or ward; and

      (C) The parties cannot adequately present the case.

      (9) The requirements of subsections (7)(c) and (8)(c)(C) of this section do not apply to a motion or court order seeking or granting limited participation when the right of limited participation sought and granted would be for the purpose of establishing a community guardianship under ORS 419B.371.

      (10) If the court grants a motion under subsection (8) of this section, the court shall specify in the order the rights of limited participation that are being granted.

      (11)(a) At any time, a person granted intervention or a person granted rights of limited participation may move to be considered a temporary placement or visitation resource for the child or ward.

      (b) At any time after a court has determined at a permanency hearing that the permanent plan for the child or ward should be something other than to return home, a person granted intervention may move to be considered the permanent placement resource for the child or ward.

      (12) The court may modify or set aside any order granting intervention or rights of limited participation as provided in ORS 419B.923. [2001 c.624 §3; 2003 c.14 §226; 2003 c.231 §3; 2003 c.315 §2; 2003 c.396 §35a; 2005 c.449 §2; 2005 c.676 §2; 2009 c.92 §1; 2009 c.182 §1; 2012 c.86 §2]

 

      419B.117 Notice to parents or guardian of child; when given; contents. (1) At the first appearance by the parents or guardian of a child before the court, the court shall inform the parents or guardian verbally and provide a standard notice describing:

      (a) The obligation of the parents or guardian to pay for compensation and reasonable expenses for counsel for the child, support of the child while the child is in the custody of a state-financed or state-supported residence and any other obligations to pay money that may arise as a result of the child being within the jurisdiction of the court;

      (b) The assignment of support rights under ORS 419B.406;

      (c) The right of the parents or guardian to appeal a decision on jurisdiction or disposition made by the court; and

      (d) The time for filing an appeal of a decision by the court.

      (2) The court shall prepare and provide the standard notice required under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The court shall place a notation in the record of the case of the date that the parents or guardian were provided information under this section. [1997 c.748 §2]

 

      419B.118 Venue. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, a juvenile court proceeding shall commence in the county of wardship if, at the commencement of the proceeding, wardship exists as a result of proceedings under this chapter, or, in the absence of such wardship, in the county where the child resides.

      (2) If the proceeding is based on allegations of jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 (1)(a), (b) or (c), the proceeding may also commence in the county in which the alleged act or behavior took place.

      (3) If the proceeding is based on allegations of jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 (1)(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), the proceedings may also commence in the county where the child is present when the proceeding begins.

      (4) A termination of parent-child relationship proceeding may be commenced in the county of wardship or where the child or ward resides or is found unless the child is an Indian child subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act and the tribal court has assumed jurisdiction. [1993 c.33 §54; 1993 c.546 §26; 2003 c.396 §36]

 

      419B.121 Return of runaway children to another state. Notwithstanding ORS 419C.145, the court may order the detention of a child who resides in another state if the court finds probable cause to believe that the child has run away from home or from a placement.

      419B.175 Initial disposition of child taken into custody. (1) This subsection establishes the authority and procedures that apply to a person designated by a court to effect disposition of a child taken into protective custody or brought before the court under ORS 419B.160, 419B.165, 419B.168 or 419B.171.

(Shelter Hearings)

 

      419B.180 Shelter and detention facilities. The juvenile court of each county shall designate the place or places in which children are to be placed in detention or shelter care when taken into protective custody. If the county is adjacent to another state, the court may designate a place or places in the adjoining state where children, pursuant to an agreement between such place or places and the juvenile department of the county, may be placed in detention when taken into custody. A county juvenile department shall not enter into an agreement with an out-of-state place for detention of juveniles, as provided in this section, unless the place or places conform to standards of this state for such a place and unless the agreement includes a provision that the place be subject to inspection by officers of this state under ORS 419A.061. [1993 c.33 §68; 1993 c.546 §34]

 

      419B.183 Speedy hearing required. A child or ward may not be held in detention or shelter care more than 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and judicial holidays, except on order of the court made pursuant to a hearing. [1993 c.33 §70; 2003 c.396 §41]

 

      419B.185 Evidentiary hearing. (1) When a child or ward is taken, or is about to be taken, into protective custody pursuant to ORS 419B.150, 419B.160, 419B.165, 419B.168 and 419B.171 and placed in detention or shelter care, a parent, child or ward shall be given the opportunity to present evidence to the court at the hearings specified in ORS 419B.183, and at any subsequent review hearing, that the child or ward can be returned home without further danger of suffering physical injury or emotional harm, endangering or harming others, or not remaining within the reach of the court process prior to adjudication. At the hearing:

      (a) The court shall make written findings as to whether the Department of Human Services has made reasonable efforts or, if the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, active efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child or ward from the home and to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home. When the court finds that no services were provided but that reasonable services would not have eliminated the need for protective custody, the court shall consider the department to have made reasonable efforts or, if the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, active efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for protective custody. The court shall include in the written findings a brief description of the preventive and reunification efforts made by the department.

      (b) In determining whether a child or ward shall be removed or continued out of home, the court shall consider whether the provision of reasonable services can prevent or eliminate the need to separate the family.

      (c) In determining whether the department has made reasonable efforts or, if the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, active efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child or ward from the home and to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home, the court shall consider the child or ward’s health and safety the paramount concerns.

      (d) The court shall make a written finding in every order of removal that describes why it is in the best interests of the child or ward that the child or ward be removed from the home or continued in care.

      (e) When the court determines that a child or ward shall be removed from the home or continued in care, the court shall make written findings whether the department made diligent efforts pursuant to ORS 419B.192. The court shall include in its written findings a brief description of the efforts made by the department.

      (f) The court shall determine whether the child or ward is an Indian child as defined in ORS 419A.004 or in the applicable State-Tribal Indian Child Welfare Agreement.

      (g) The court may receive testimony, reports and other evidence without regard to whether the evidence is admissible under ORS 40.010 to 40.210 and 40.310 to 40.585 if the evidence is relevant to the determinations and findings required under this section. As used in this paragraph, “relevant evidence” has the meaning given that term in ORS 40.150.

      (2) To aid the court in making the written findings required by subsection (1)(a), (d) and (e) of this section, the department shall present written documentation to the court outlining:

      (a) The efforts made to prevent taking the child or ward into protective custody and to provide services to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home;

      (b) The efforts the department made pursuant to ORS 419B.192; and

      (c) Why protective custody is in the best interests of the child or ward. [1993 c.33 §71; 1993 c.295 §5; 1993 c.546 §123; 1997 c.873 §19; 1999 c.859 §8; 2001 c.686 §3; 2003 c.355 §1; 2003 c.396 §42; 2007 c.806 §4]

(Placement of Child or Ward)

 

      419B.192 Placement of child or ward; preference given to relatives and caregivers; written findings of court required. (1) If the court finds that a child or ward is in need of placement or continuation in substitute care, there shall be a preference given to placement of the child or ward with relatives and persons who have a caregiver relationship with the child or ward as defined in ORS 419B.116. The Department of Human Services shall make diligent efforts to place the child or ward with such persons and shall report to the court the efforts made by the department to effectuate that placement.

      (2) If a child or ward in need of placement or continuation in substitute care has a sibling also in need of placement or continuation in substitute care, the department shall make diligent efforts to place the siblings together and shall report to the court the efforts made by the department to carry out the placement, unless the court finds that placement of the siblings together is not in the best interests of the child or the ward or the child’s or the ward’s sibling.

      (3) In attempting to place the child or ward pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the department shall consider, but not be limited to considering, the following:

      (a) The ability of the person being considered to provide safety for the child or ward, including a willingness to cooperate with any restrictions placed on contact between the child or ward and others, and to prevent anyone from influencing the child or ward in regard to the allegations of the case;

      (b) The ability of the person being considered to support the efforts of the department to implement the permanent plan for the child or ward;

      (c) The ability of the person being considered to meet the child or ward’s physical, emotional and educational needs, including the child or ward’s need to continue in the same school or educational placement;

      (d) Which person has the closest existing personal relationship with the child or ward if more than one person requests to have the child or ward placed with them pursuant to this section; and

      (e) The ability of the person being considered to provide a placement for the child’s or ward’s sibling who is also in need of placement or continuation in substitute care.

      (4) When the court is required to make findings regarding the department’s diligent efforts to place a child or ward with relatives or persons with a caregiver relationship under subsection (1) of this section, and the court determines that, contrary to the placement decision of the department, placement with a relative is not in the best interest of the child or ward under ORS 419B.349, the court shall make written findings setting forth the reasons why the court finds that placement of the child or ward with an available relative is not in the best interest of the child.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3) of this section, in cases where the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, the placement preferences of the Indian Child Welfare Act shall be followed. [1997 c.479 §4; 1999 c.569 §9; 2003 c.396 §43; 2005 c.449 §1; 2005 c.521 §2; 2007 c.806 §5; 2009 c.565 §1]

 

      419B.194 Participation in extracurricular activities; reasonable and prudent parent standard; fees; rules. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Extracurricular activities” means age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities as follows:

      (A) Activities or items that are generally accepted as suitable for children or wards of the same chronological age or level of maturity or that are determined to be developmentally appropriate for a child or ward, based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral capacities that are typical for an age or age group; and

      (B) In the case of a specific child or ward, activities or items that are suitable for the child or ward based on the developmental stages attained by the child or ward with respect to the cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral capacities of the child or ward.

      (b) “Reasonable and prudent parent standard” means the standard, characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety and best interests of a child or ward while encouraging the emotional and developmental growth of the child or ward, that a substitute care provider shall use when determining whether to allow a child or ward in substitute care to participate in extracurricular activities.

      (2)(a) The Department of Human Services shall, in accordance with rules adopted by the department, ensure that a substitute care provider for a child or ward in the care or custody of the department:

      (A) Provides an opportunity for the child or ward to participate in at least one ongoing extracurricular activity based on availability and the interests of the child or ward; and

      (B) Applies a reasonable and prudent parent standard when determining such participation.

      (b) The department and the substitute care provider shall confer to determine the party that will be responsible for payment of any fee or charge related to a child’s or ward’s participation in an extracurricular activity under this section.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (2) of this section shall be construed to prohibit a child or ward from participating, or a substitute care provider from allowing a child or ward to participate, in a summer camp or religious services. However, participation in a summer camp or religious services alone does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) of this section. [2015 c.472 §2]

 

(Counsel)

 

      419B.195 Appointment of counsel for child or ward; access of appointed counsel to records of child or ward. (1) If the child, ward, parent or guardian requests counsel for the child or ward but is without sufficient financial means to employ suitable counsel possessing skills and experience commensurate with the nature of the petition and the complexity of the case, the court may appoint suitable counsel to represent the child or ward at state expense if the child or ward is determined to be financially eligible under the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission. Whenever requested to do so, the court shall appoint counsel to represent the child or ward in a case filed pursuant to ORS 419B.100. The court may not substitute one appointed counsel for another except pursuant to the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission.

      (2) Upon presentation of the order of appointment under this section by the attorney for the child or ward, any agency, hospital, school organization, division or department of the state, doctor, nurse or other health care provider, psychologist, psychiatrist, police department or mental health clinic shall permit the attorney to inspect and copy any records of the child or ward involved in the case, without the consent of the child or ward or parents. This subsection does not apply to records of a police agency relating to an ongoing investigation prior to charging. [1993 c.33 §72; 1993 c.234 §1; 1993 c.546 §38; 2001 c.962 §43; 2003 c.396 §§44,45; 2003 c.449 §§9,46]

 

      419B.198 Responsibility for payment of costs related to provision of appointed counsel for child or ward. (1) When the court appoints counsel to represent a child or ward, it may order the parent, if able, or guardian of the estate, if the estate is able, to pay to the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, through the clerk of the court, in full or in part the administrative costs of determining the ability of the parents or estate to pay for legal services and the costs of the legal and other services that are related to the provision of appointed counsel.

      (2) The test of the parent’s or estate’s ability to pay costs under subsection (1) of this section is the same test as applied to appointment of counsel for defendants under ORS 135.050 or under the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines adopted under ORS 151.216. If counsel is provided at state expense, the court shall apply this test in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.485.

      (3) If counsel is provided at state expense, the court shall determine the amount the parents or estate is required to pay for the costs of administrative, legal and other services related to the provision of appointed counsel in the same manner as this amount is determined under ORS 151.487.

      (4) The court’s order of payment is enforceable in the same manner as an order of support under ORS 419B.408. [1993 c.33 §73; 1997 c.761 §6; 2001 c.962 §44; 2003 c.396 §§46,47; 2003 c.449 §10; 2012 c.107 §46]

      419B.331 When protective supervision authorized; conditions that may be imposed. When the court determines it would be in the best interest and welfare of a ward, the court may place the ward under protective supervision. The court may direct that the ward remain in the legal custody of the ward’s parents or other person with whom the ward is living, or the court may direct that the ward be placed in the legal custody of some relative or some person maintaining a foster home approved by the court, or in a child care center or a youth care center authorized to accept the ward. The court may specify particular requirements to be observed during the protective supervision consistent with recognized juvenile court practice, including but not limited to restrictions on visitation by the ward’s parents, restrictions on the ward’s associates, occupation and activities, restrictions on and requirements to be observed by the person having the ward’s legal custody, and requirements for visitation by and consultation with a juvenile counselor or other suitable counselor. [1993 c.33 §106; 2003 c.396 §55]

 

      419B.334 Placement out of state. When the court determines it would be in the best interest and welfare of a ward, the court may, if there is an interstate compact or agreement or an informal arrangement with another state permitting the ward to reside in another state while under protective supervision, or to be placed in an institution or with an agency in another state, place the ward under protective supervision in such other state. [1993 c.33 §107; 2003 c.396 §56]

 

      419B.337 Commitment to custody of Department of Human Services. (1) When the court determines it would be in the best interest and for the welfare of a ward, the court may place the ward in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services for care, placement and supervision. When the court enters an order removing a ward from the ward’s home or an order continuing care, the court shall make a written finding as to whether:

      (a) Removal of the ward from the ward’s home or continuation of care is in the best interest and for the welfare of the ward;

      (b) Reasonable efforts, considering the circumstances of the ward and parent, have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the ward from the home or to make it possible for the ward to safely return home. In making this finding, the court shall consider the ward’s health and safety the paramount concerns; and

      (c) Diligent efforts have been made to place the ward pursuant to ORS 419B.192.

      (2) The court may specify the particular type of care, supervision or services to be provided by the Department of Human Services to wards placed in the department’s custody and to the parents or guardians of the wards, but the actual planning and provision of such care, supervision or services is the responsibility of the department. The department may place the ward in a child care center authorized to accept the ward.

      (3) The court may make an order regarding visitation by the ward’s parents or siblings. The Department of Human Services is responsible for developing and implementing a visitation plan consistent with the court’s order.

      (4) Uniform commitment blanks, in a form approved by the Director of Human Services, shall be used by all courts for placing wards in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services.

      (5) If the ward has been placed in the custody of the Department of Human Services, the court shall make no commitment directly to any residential facility, but shall cause the ward to be delivered into the custody of the department at the time and place fixed by rules of the department. A ward so committed may not be placed in a Department of Corrections institution.

      (6) Commitment of a ward to the Department of Human Services continues until dismissed by the court or until the ward becomes 21 years of age.

      (7) A court may dismiss commitment of a ward to the Department of Human Services if:

      (a)(A) Dismissal is appropriate because the ward has been safely reunited with a parent or because a safe alternative to reunification has been implemented for the ward; and

      (B) The ward is at least 14 years of age but less than 21 years of age and the court finds that:

      (i) The department has provided case planning pursuant to ORS 419B.343 that addresses the ward’s needs and goals for a transition to successful adulthood, including needs and goals relating to housing, physical and mental health, education, employment, community connections and supportive relationships;

      (ii) The department has provided appropriate services pursuant to the case plan;

      (iii) The department has involved the ward in the development of the case plan and in the provision of appropriate services; and

      (iv) The ward has safe and stable housing and is unlikely to become homeless as a result of dismissal of commitment of the ward to the department; or

      (b) The ward has been committed to the custody of the Oregon Youth Authority. [1993 c.33 §108; 1993 c.546 §129; 1999 c.859 §10; 2003 c.396 §57; 2005 c.679 §1; 2007 c.806 §6; 2015 c.254 §6]

 

      419B.340 Reasonable or active efforts determination. (1) If the court awards custody to the Department of Human Services, the court shall include in the disposition order a determination whether the department has made reasonable efforts or, if the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, active efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the ward from the home. If the ward has been removed prior to the entry of the order, the order shall also include a determination whether the department has made reasonable or active efforts to make it possible for the ward to safely return home. In making the determination under this subsection, the court shall consider the ward’s health and safety the paramount concerns.

      (2) In support of its determination whether reasonable or active efforts have been made by the department, the court shall enter a brief description of what preventive and reunification efforts were made and why further efforts could or could not have prevented or shortened the separation of the family.

      (3) When the first contact with the family has occurred during an emergency in which the ward could not remain without jeopardy at home even with reasonable services being provided, the department shall be considered to have made reasonable or active efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal.

      (4) When the court finds that preventive or reunification efforts have not been reasonable or active, but further preventive or reunification efforts could not permit the ward to remain without jeopardy at home, the court may authorize or continue the removal of the ward.

      (5) If a court determines that one of the following circumstances exist, the juvenile court may make a finding that the department is not required to make reasonable efforts to make it possible for the ward to safely return home:

      (a) Aggravated circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:

      (A) The parent by abuse or neglect has caused the death of any child;

      (b) The parent has been convicted in any jurisdiction of one of the following crimes:

      (A) Murder of another child of the parent, which murder would have been an offense under 18 U.S.C. 1111(a);

      (C) Aiding, abetting, attempting, conspiring or soliciting to commit an offense described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph; or

      (D) Felony assault that results in serious physical injury to the ward or another child of the parent; or

      (c) The parent’s rights to another child have been terminated involuntarily.

      (6) If, pursuant to a determination under subsection (5) of this section, the juvenile court makes a finding that the department is not required to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the ward from the home or to make it possible for the ward to safely return home, and the department determines that it will not make such efforts, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing as provided in ORS 419B.470 no later than 30 days after the judicial finding under subsection (5) of this section.

      (7) When an Indian child is involved, the department must satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proven unsuccessful. Foster care placement may not be ordered in a proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including the testimony of expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the Indian child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical injury to the Indian child. [1993 c.33 §109; 1993 c.546 §124; 1999 c.859 §11; 2001 c.686 §14; 2003 c.396 §58]

 

      419B.343 Recommendations of committing court; case planning; plan contents. (1) To ensure effective planning for wards, the Department of Human Services shall take into consideration recommendations and information provided by the committing court before placement in any facility. The department shall ensure that the case planning in any case:

      (a) For the reunification of the family bears a rational relationship to the jurisdictional findings that brought the ward within the court’s jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100;

      (b) Incorporates the perspective of the ward and the family and, whenever possible, allows the family to assist in designing its own service programs, based on an assessment of the family’s needs and the family’s solutions and resources for change; and

      (c) Is integrated with other agencies in cooperation with the caseworkers.

      (2) Except in cases when the plan is something other than to reunify the family, the department shall include in the case plan:

      (a) Appropriate services to allow the parent the opportunity to adjust the parent’s circumstances, conduct or conditions to make it possible for the ward to safely return home within a reasonable time; and

      (b) A concurrent permanent plan to be implemented if the parent is unable or unwilling to adjust the parent’s circumstances, conduct or conditions in such a way as to make it possible for the ward to safely return home within a reasonable time.

      (3) For a ward 14 years of age or older, the department shall ensure that:

      (a) Case planning for the ward addresses the ward’s needs and goals for a transition to successful adulthood, including needs and goals related to housing, physical and mental health, education, employment, community connections and supportive relationships; and

      (b) The ward’s case plan includes a document that describes the rights of the ward as specified in ORS 418.201 and a signed acknowledgment by the ward that the ward has been provided with a copy of the document and that rights contained in the document have been explained to the ward in an age-appropriate manner.

      (4) The case plan for a ward in substitute care must include the health and education records of the ward, including the most recent information available regarding:

      (a) The names and addresses of the ward’s health and education providers;

      (b) The grade level of the ward’s academic performance;

      (c) The ward’s school record;

      (d) Whether the ward’s placement takes into account proximity to the school in which the ward is enrolled at the time of placement;

      (e) The ward’s immunizations;

      (f) Any known medical problems of the ward;

      (g) The ward’s medications; and

      (h) Any other relevant health and education information concerning the ward that the department determines is appropriate to include in the records. [1993 c.33 §110; 1995 c.770 §1; 1997 c.873 §13; 1999 c.859 §12; 2001 c.686 §15; 2003 c.396 §59; 2003 c.544 §3a; 2007 c.611 §5; 2015 c.254 §7]

 

      419B.346 Medical planning. Whenever a ward who is in need of medical care or other special treatment by reason of physical or mental condition is placed in the custody of the Department of Human Services by the juvenile court, the department shall prepare a plan for care or treatment within 14 days after assuming custody of the ward. The court may indicate in general terms the type of care which it regards as initially appropriate. A copy of the plan, including a time schedule for its implementation, shall be sent to the juvenile court that committed the ward to the department. The court may at any time request regular progress reports on implementation of the plan. The department shall notify the court when the plan is implemented, and shall report to the court concerning the progress of the ward annually thereafter. If the plan is subsequently revised, the department shall notify the court of the revisions and the reasons for the revisions. [1993 c.33 §111; 2003 c.396 §60]

 

      419B.349 Court authority to review placement or proposed placement. (1) Commitment of a child or ward to the Department of Human Services does not terminate the court’s continuing jurisdiction to protect the rights of the child or ward or the child or ward’s parents or guardians. Notwithstanding ORS 419B.337 (5), if upon review of a placement or proposed placement of a child or ward made or to be made by the department the court determines that the placement or proposed placement is not in the best interest of the child or ward, the court may direct the department to place or maintain the child or ward in the care of the child or ward’s parents, in foster care with a foster care provider who is a relative, in foster care with a foster care provider who is or has been a current caretaker for the child, in foster care with a foster care provider who is not a relative or current caretaker, in residential care, in group care or in some other specific type of residential placement, but unless otherwise required by law, the court may not direct a specific placement. The actual planning and placement of the child or ward is the responsibility of the department. Nothing in this subsection affects any contractual right of an individual or a private agency to refuse or terminate a placement.

      (2) The court may not exercise its discretion to direct the department to place or maintain a child or ward where the effect of the direction will be to remove the child or ward from, or prevent the placement of the child or ward with, a person described in ORS 419B.440 (2)(c). [1993 c.33 §112; 1997 c.497 §1; 1997 c.764 §1; 2003 c.396 §61; 2007 c.235 §1; 2007 c.806 §13; 2015 c.795 §6]

 

      419B.350 [1997 c.873 §15; 1999 c.859 §13; repealed by 2001 c.686 §25]

 

      419B.352 Hospitalization; mental health examination. The court may direct that the child or ward be examined or treated by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician assistant licensed under ORS 677.505 to 677.525, naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685 or nurse practitioner licensed under ORS 678.375 to 678.390, or receive other special care or treatment in a hospital or other suitable facility. If the court determines that mental health examination and treatment should be provided by services delivered through the Department of Human Services, the department shall determine the appropriate placement or services in consultation with the court and other affected agencies. If an affected agency objects to the type of placement or services, the court shall determine the appropriate type of placement or service. During the examination or treatment of the child or ward, the department may, if appropriate, be appointed guardian of the child or ward. [1993 c.33 §113; 2001 c.900 §123; 2003 c.396 §62; 2014 c.45 §44; 2017 c.356 §44]

Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, the facts supporting any finding made to establish a permanent guardianship for an Indian child, including the finding that continued custody by the parents or Indian custodian would result in serious emotional or physical harm to the Indian child, must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

      (5) Unless vacated under ORS 419B.368, a guardianship established under this section continues as long as the ward is subject to the court’s jurisdiction as provided in ORS 419B.328. [1997 c.873 §3; 1999 c.59 §119; 1999 c.859 §23; 2003 c.229 §6; 2003 c.396 §63a; 2007 c.333 §1]

      (3) If an Indian child is involved, the guardianship must be in compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act. The facts supporting any finding made to establish a guardianship for an Indian child, including the finding that continued custody by the parents or Indian custodian would result in serious emotional or physical harm to the Indian child, must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

      (4) In a proceeding under this section, the court may receive testimony and reports as provided in ORS 419B.325.

      (5) If the court has approved a plan of guardianship under ORS 419B.476, the court may grant the motion for guardianship if the court determines, after a hearing, that:

      (a) The ward cannot safely return to a parent within a reasonable time;

      (b) Adoption is not an appropriate plan for the ward;

      (c) The proposed guardian is suitable to meet the needs of the ward and is willing to accept the duties and authority of a guardian; and

      (d) Guardianship is in the ward’s best interests. In determining whether guardianship is in the ward’s best interests, the court shall consider the ward’s wishes.

      (6) Unless vacated pursuant to ORS 419B.368, a guardianship established under this section continues as long as the ward is subject to the court’s jurisdiction as provided in ORS 419B.328. [2003 c.229 §2; 2007 c.333 §2]

 

      419B.367 Letters of guardianship; reports by guardian; review of reports; legal status and liability of guardian. (1) Upon granting a motion for guardianship under ORS 419B.366 or upon granting a petition for guardianship under ORS 419B.365, the court shall issue letters of guardianship to the guardian.

(Legal Custodian of Child)

 

      419B.372 Guardianship as incident of custody. (1) When the court grants legal custody to the Department of Human Services, it may also grant guardianship of the ward to the department, to remain in effect solely while the ward remains in the legal custody of the department.

      (2) When the court grants legal custody to a private institution or agency or to a suitable person or entity, the court may grant guardianship of the ward to the private institution or agency to which the ward is committed or to the suitable person or entity if it appears necessary to do so in the interests of the ward.

      (3) Unless guardianship is granted as provided in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the court as an incident of its wardship has the duties and authority of the guardian as provided in ORS 419B.376 and 419B.379. [Formerly 419B.370]

(Support)

 

      419B.400 Authority to order support; collection. (1) The court may, after a hearing on the matter, require the parents or other person legally obligated to support a child alleged to be within the jurisdiction of the court under ORS 419B.100 or a ward to pay toward the child or ward’s support such amounts at such intervals as the court may direct, even though the child or ward is over 18 years of age as long as the child or ward is a child attending school, as defined in ORS 107.108.

      (2) At least 21 days before the hearing, the court shall notify the Administrator of the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice, or the branch office providing support services to the county where the hearing will be held, of the hearing. Before the hearing the administrator shall inform the court, to the extent known:

      (a) Whether there is pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the child or ward, including a proceeding brought under ORS 25.287, 107.085, 107.135, 107.431, 108.110, 109.100, 109.103, 109.165, 125.025, 416.400 to 416.465 or 419C.590 or ORS chapter 110; and

      (b) Whether there exists in this state or any other jurisdiction a support order, as defined in ORS 110.503, involving the child or ward.

      (3) The Judicial Department and the Department of Justice may enter into an agreement regarding how the courts give the notice required under subsection (2) of this section to the Department of Justice and how the Department of Justice gives the information described in subsection (2)(a) and (b) to the courts.

      (4) The court, in determining the amount to be paid, shall use the scale and formula provided for in ORS 25.275 and 25.280. Unless otherwise ordered, the amounts so required to be paid shall be paid to the Department of Justice or the county clerk, whichever is appropriate, for transmission to the person, institution or agency having legal custody of the child or ward.

      419B.402 Support order is judgment. Any order for support entered pursuant to ORS 419B.400 shall be entered as a judgment and the court does not have the power to set aside, alter or modify the judgment, or any portion thereof, which provides for any payment of money, either for minor children or the support of a party, which has accrued prior to the filing of a motion to set aside, alter or modify the judgment. [1993 c.33 §122; 2003 c.576 §252]

 

      419B.404 Support for child or ward in state financed or supported institution. Any order for support entered pursuant to ORS 419B.400 for a child or ward in the care and custody of the Department of Human Services may be made contingent upon the child or ward residing in a state financed or supported residence, shelter or other facility or institution. A certificate signed by the Director of Human Services, the Administrator of the Division of Child Support or the administrator’s authorized representative shall be sufficient to establish such periods of residence and to satisfy the order for periods of nonresidence. [1993 c.33 §123; 2003 c.396 §71]

 

      419B.406 Assignment of support order to state. When a child or ward is in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services and the child or ward is the beneficiary of an order of support in a judgment of dissolution or other order and the department is required to provide financial assistance for the care and support of the child or ward, the state is assignee of and subrogated to the child or ward’s proportionate share of the support obligation including sums that have accrued whether or not the support order or judgment provides for separate monthly amounts for the support of each of two or more children or wards or a single monthly gross payment for the benefit of two or more children or wards, up to the amount of assistance provided by the department. The assignment shall be as provided in ORS 412.024. [1993 c.33 §124; 1999 c.80 §76; 2003 c.73 §67; 2003 c.396 §72; 2003 c.572 §18; 2003 c.576 §448]

 

      419B.408 Enforcement of support order. (1) An order of support entered pursuant to ORS 419B.400 may be enforced by execution or in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of a judgment granting an equitable remedy or by an order to withhold pursuant to ORS 25.372 to 25.427.

      (2) No property of the child or ward’s parents, or either of them, or other person legally obligated to support the child or ward is exempt from levy and sale or other process to enforce collection of the amounts ordered by the court to be paid toward the support of the child or ward. [1993 c.33 §125; 1993 c.798 §31; 2003 c.396 §73]

      (d) If the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward should be adoption, the court’s determination of whether one of the circumstances in ORS 419B.498 (2) is applicable.

      (e) If the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward should be establishment of a legal guardianship, the court’s determination of why neither placement with parents nor adoption is appropriate.

      (f) If the court determines that the permanency plan for a ward should be placement with a fit and willing relative, the court’s determination of why placement with the ward’s parents, or for adoption, or placement with a legal guardian, is not appropriate.

      (g) If the court determines that the permanency plan for a ward 16 years of age or older should be another planned permanent living arrangement, the court’s determinations:

      (A) Why another planned permanent living arrangement is in the ward’s best interests and a compelling reason, that must be documented by the department, why it would not be in the best interests of the ward to be returned home, placed for adoption, placed with a legal guardian or placed with a fit and willing relative; and

      (B) That the department has taken steps to ensure that:

      (i) The ward’s substitute care provider is following the reasonable and prudent parent standard; and

      (ii) The ward has regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities, including consultation with the ward in an age-appropriate manner about the opportunities the ward has to participate in the activities.

      (h) If the current placement is not expected to be permanent, the court’s projected timetable for return home or for placement in another planned permanent living arrangement. If the timetable set forth by the court is not met, the department shall promptly notify the court and parties.

      (i) If an Indian child is involved, the tribal affiliation of the ward.

      (j) If the ward has been placed in an interstate placement, the court’s determination of whether the interstate placement continues to be appropriate and in the best interests of the ward.

      (6) In making the determinations under subsection (5)(g) of this section, the court shall ask the ward about the ward’s desired permanency outcome.

      (7) If an Indian child is involved, the court shall follow the placement preference established by the Indian Child Welfare Act.

      (8) Any final decision of the court made pursuant to the permanency hearing is appealable under ORS 419A.200. On appeal of a final decision of the court under this subsection, the court’s finding, if any, under ORS 419B.340 (5) that the department is not required to make reasonable efforts to make it possible for the ward to safely return home is an interlocutory order to which a party may assign error. [1993 c.33 §137; 1993 c.546 §128; 1999 c.568 §2; 1999 c.859 §15; 2001 c.480 §9; 2001 c.622 §50; 2001 c.686 §16; 2001 c.910 §5; 2003 c.396 §81; 2003 c.544 §1a; 2007 c.611 §8; 2007 c.806 §11; 2015 c.254 §5]

 

(Termination of Parental Rights)

 

      419B.498 Termination of parental rights; petition by Department of Human Services; when required. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the Department of Human Services shall simultaneously file a petition to terminate the parental rights of a child or ward’s parents and identify, recruit, process and approve a qualified family for adoption if the child or ward is in the custody of the department and:

      (a) The child or ward has been in substitute care under the responsibility of the department for 15 months of the most recent 22 months;

      (b) A parent has been convicted of murder of another child of the parent, voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent, aiding, abetting, attempting, conspiring or soliciting to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter of the child or ward or of another child of the parent or felony assault that has resulted in serious physical injury to the child or ward or to another child of the parent; or

      (c) A court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the child or ward is an abandoned child.

      (2) The department shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights of a parent in the circumstances described in subsection (1) of this section unless:

      (a) The child or ward is being cared for by a relative and that placement is intended to be permanent;

      (b) There is a compelling reason, which is documented in the case plan, for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child or ward. Such compelling reasons include, but are not limited to:

      (A) The parent is successfully participating in services that will make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable time as provided in ORS 419B.476 (5)(c);

      (B) Another permanent plan is better suited to meet the health and safety needs of the child or ward, including the need to preserve the child’s or ward’s sibling attachments and relationships; or

      (C) The court or local citizen review board in a prior hearing or review determined that while the case plan was to reunify the family the department did not make reasonable efforts or, if the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, active efforts to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home; or

      (c) The department has not provided to the family of the child or ward, consistent with the time period in the case plan, such services as the department deems necessary for the child or ward to safely return home, if reasonable efforts to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home are required to be made with respect to the child or ward.

      (3) No petition to terminate the parental rights of a child or ward’s parents pursuant to subsection (1) of this section or pursuant to ORS 419B.500, 419B.502, 419B.504, 419B.506 or 419B.508 may be filed until the court has determined that the permanency plan for the child or ward should be adoption after a permanency hearing pursuant to ORS 419B.476. [1999 c.859 §21; 2001 c.686 §17; 2003 c.396 §82; 2003 c.544 §2; 2007 c.234 §1; 2007 c.806 §12]

 

      419B.500 Termination of parental rights generally. The parental rights of the parents of a ward may be terminated as provided in this section and ORS 419B.502 to 419B.524, only upon a petition filed by the state or the ward for the purpose of freeing the ward for adoption if the court finds it is in the best interest of the ward. If an Indian child is involved, the termination of parental rights must be in compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act. The rights of one parent may be terminated without affecting the rights of the other parent. [1993 c.33 §138; 1993 c.546 §56; 1997 c.873 §6; 2003 c.396 §83; 2011 c.438 §5]

 

      419B.502 Termination upon finding of extreme conduct. The rights of the parent or parents may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the parent or parents are unfit by reason of a single or recurrent incident of extreme conduct toward any child. In such case, no efforts need to be made by available social agencies to help the parent adjust the conduct in order to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable amount of time. In determining extreme conduct, the court shall consider the following:

      (1) Rape, sodomy or sex abuse of any child by the parent.

      (2) Intentional starvation or torture of any child by the parent.

      (3) Abuse or neglect by the parent of any child resulting in death or serious physical injury.

      (4) Conduct by the parent to aid or abet another person who, by abuse or neglect, caused the death of any child.

      (5) Conduct by the parent to attempt, solicit or conspire, as described in ORS 161.405, 161.435 or 161.450 or under comparable laws of any jurisdiction, to cause the death of any child.

      (6) Previous involuntary terminations of the parent’s rights to another child if the conditions giving rise to the previous action have not been ameliorated.

      (7) Conduct by the parent that knowingly exposes any child of the parent to the storage or production of methamphetamines from precursors. In determining whether extreme conduct exists under this subsection, the court shall consider the extent of the child or ward’s exposure and the potential harm to the physical health of the child or ward. [1993 c.33 §139; 1995 c.767 §1; 1997 c.873 §5; 1999 c.859 §16; 2001 c.575 §1; 2001 c.686 §23; 2003 c.396 §84]

 

      419B.504 Termination upon finding of unfitness. The rights of the parent or parents may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the parent or parents are unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child or ward and integration of the child or ward into the home of the parent or parents is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change. In determining such conduct and conditions, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:

      (1) Emotional illness, mental illness or mental retardation of the parent of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child or ward for extended periods of time.

      (2) Conduct toward any child of an abusive, cruel or sexual nature.

      (3) Addictive or habitual use of intoxicating liquors, cannabis or controlled substances to the extent that parental ability has been substantially impaired.

      (4) Physical neglect of the child or ward.

      (5) Lack of effort of the parent to adjust the circumstances of the parent, conduct, or conditions to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable time or failure of the parent to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.

      (6) Criminal conduct that impairs the parent’s ability to provide adequate care for the child or ward. [1993 c.33 §140; 1997 c.873 §7; 2001 c.686 §24; 2003 c.396 §85; 2007 c.70 §199; 2017 c.21 §56]

 

      419B.506 Termination upon finding of neglect. The rights of the parent or parents may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the parent or parents have failed or neglected without reasonable and lawful cause to provide for the basic physical and psychological needs of the child or ward for six months prior to the filing of a petition. In determining such failure or neglect, the court shall disregard any incidental or minimal expressions of concern or support and shall consider but is not limited to one or more of the following:

      (1) Failure to provide care or pay a reasonable portion of substitute physical care and maintenance if custody is lodged with others.

      (2) Failure to maintain regular visitation or other contact with the child or ward that was designed and implemented in a plan to reunite the child or ward with the parent.

      (3) Failure to contact or communicate with the child or ward or with the custodian of the child or ward. In making this determination, the court may disregard incidental visitations, communications or contributions. [1993 c.33 §141; 1997 c.873 §8; 2003 c.396 §86]

 

      419B.508 Termination upon finding of abandonment. The rights of the parent or parents may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the parent or parents have abandoned the child or ward or the child or ward was left under circumstances such that the identity of the parent or parents of the child or ward was unknown and could not be ascertained, despite diligent searching, and the parent or parents have not come forward to claim the child or ward within three months following the finding of the child or ward. [1993 c.33 §142; 2003 c.396 §87]

 

      419B.510 Termination upon finding child conceived as result of rape. (1) The rights of the parent may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the child or ward was conceived as the result of an act that led to the parent’s conviction for rape under ORS 163.365 or 163.375 or other comparable law of another jurisdiction.

      (2) Termination of parental rights under subsection (1) of this section does not relieve the parent of any obligation to pay child support.

      (3) Termination of parental rights under subsection (1) of this section is an independent basis for termination of parental rights and the court need not make any of the considerations or findings described in ORS 419B.502, 419B.504, 419B.506 or 419B.508. [2011 c.438 §2]

 

      419B.515 [1993 c.33 §143; 1993 c.546 §57; repealed by 2001 c.622 §57]

 

      419B.517 Mediation to be encouraged. The use of mediation shall be encouraged in cases involving:

      (1) A parent or guardian in a juvenile dependency proceeding in which the child is taken into protective custody or placed in substitute care; or

      (2) The termination of parental rights. [1995 c.767 §4; 2005 c.656 §1]

 

      Note: 419B.517 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 419B by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      419B.518 Appointment of counsel for parents. (1) If the parents are determined to be financially eligible, and request the assistance of appointed counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent them at state expense. Appointment of counsel under this section is subject to ORS 135.055, 151.216 and 151.219.

      (2) The court may not substitute one appointed counsel for another except pursuant to the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines adopted under ORS 151.216. [1993 c.33 §144; 2001 c.962 §55; 2005 c.449 §4]

 

      419B.521 Conduct of termination hearing. (1) The court shall hold a hearing on the question of terminating the rights of the parent or parents. The court may not hold the hearing any earlier than 10 days after service or final publication of the summons. The facts on the basis of which the rights of the parents are terminated, unless admitted, must be established by clear and convincing evidence and a stenographic or other report authorized by ORS 8.340 shall be taken of the hearing.

      (2) Not earlier than provided in subsection (1) of this section and not later than six months from the date on which summons for the petition to terminate parental rights is served, the court before which the petition is pending shall hold a hearing on the petition except for good cause shown. When determining whether or not to grant a continuance for good cause, the judge shall take into consideration the age of the child or ward and the potential adverse effect delay may have on the child or ward. The court shall make written findings when granting a continuance.

      (3) The court, on its own motion or upon the motion of a party, may take testimony from any child appearing as a witness and may exclude the child’s parents and other persons if the court finds such action would be likely to be in the best interests of the child. However, the court may not exclude the attorney for each party and any testimony taken under this subsection shall be recorded.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if an Indian child is involved, termination of parental rights must be supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that continued custody of the child is likely to result in serious emotional or physical harm to the child. [1993 c.33 §145; 1993 c.546 §58; 1995 c.767 §2; 1997 c.873 §9; 2003 c.396 §88]

 

      419B.524 Effect of termination order. Unless there is an appeal from the order terminating the rights of the parent or parents, the order permanently terminates all rights of the parent or parents whose rights are terminated and the parent or parents have no standing to appear as such in any legal proceeding concerning the ward. [1993 c.33 §146; 2003 c.396 §89]

 

      419B.527 Disposition of ward after termination. (1) After the entry of an order terminating the rights of the parent or parents of the ward, the court may:

      (a) Place the ward in the legal custody and guardianship of a public or private institution or agency authorized to consent in loco parentis to the adoption of children. An order pursuant to this paragraph is a “permanent commitment” for the purposes of ORS 109.118, 109.305, 109.321 to 109.330 and 109.350 to 109.390; or

      (b) Make any order directing disposition of the ward that it is empowered to make under this chapter.

      (2) If the rights of only one parent have been terminated, the authority to consent to the adoption of the ward as provided in subsection (1)(a) of this section is effective only with respect to the parent whose rights have been terminated. [1993 c.33 §147; 2003 c.396 §90; 2013 c.346 §13]

 

      419B.529 Adoption after permanent commitment or surrender; procedure; certain fees prohibited. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 109.309, a prospective adoptive parent is not required to file a petition for adoption when:

      (a) One of the following has occurred:

      (A) A juvenile court that is a circuit court has entered an order of permanent commitment of a ward to the Department of Human Services under ORS 419B.527; or

      (B) The parent has signed and the department has accepted a release and surrender to the department, and the parent has signed:

      (i) A certificate of irrevocability and waiver as provided in ORS 418.270 regarding a child; or

      (ii) A certificate of waiver under the Indian Child Welfare Act regarding a child;

      (b) The department has completed a home study as defined in ORS 109.304 that finds the prospective parent is suitable to adopt the child or ward and the department consents to the adoption of the child or ward by the prospective parent;

      (c) Written evidence of a home study and a placement report requesting the juvenile court to enter a judgment of adoption have been filed in the juvenile court proceeding; and

      (d) At the time the placement report is filed under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the prospective adoptive parent files the adoption report form required under ORS 109.400.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a prospective adoptive parent is required to file an Adoption Summary and Segregated Information Statement with accompanying exhibits as provided under ORS 109.317.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 21.135, the clerk of the juvenile court may not charge or collect first appearance fees for a proceeding under this section.

      (4) After the filing of written evidence of a home study and the placement report requesting the court to enter a judgment of adoption, the juvenile court that entered the order of permanent commitment, or the juvenile court having jurisdiction over a ward for whom the department has accepted a release and surrender and a certificate signed by the parent as provided in subsection (1)(a)(B) of this section, may proceed as provided in ORS 109.307 and 109.350 and may enter a judgment of adoption.

      (5) Records of adoptions filed and established under this section shall be kept in accordance with, and are subject to, ORS 109.319. [1997 c.873 §24; 1999 c.859 §24; 2003 c.396 §91; 2003 c.576 §449; 2011 c.595 §18; 2013 c.346 §8]

 

      419B.530 Representation by Attorney General. (1) Whenever a juvenile court has before it an action to terminate parental rights, the juvenile court or the Department of Human Services may request the services of the Attorney General.

      (2) Whenever an action to terminate parental rights is before a juvenile court pursuant to ORS 419B.500, 419B.502, 419B.504, 419B.506 and 419B.508, the Attorney General shall have the same authority to assist the court as is granted to the district attorney under ORS 8.685. [1993 c.33 §148]

      419B.552 Application for emancipation judgment; effect of judgment. (1) A juvenile court, upon the written application of a minor who is domiciled within the jurisdiction of such court, is authorized to enter a judgment of emancipation in the manner provided in ORS 419B.558. A judgment of emancipation shall serve only to:

      (a) Recognize the minor as an adult for the purposes of contracting and conveying, establishing a residence, suing and being sued, and making a will, and recognize the minor as an adult for purposes of the criminal laws of this state.

      (b) Terminate as to the parent and child relationship the provisions of ORS 109.010 until the child reaches the age of majority.

      419B.555 Hearing; notice to parent; duty to advise minor of liabilities of emancipated person; filing fee. (1) The juvenile court shall conduct a preliminary hearing on the minor’s application for emancipation within 10 days of the date on which it is filed or as soon as possible thereafter.

No action of the court pursuant to this subsection may be extended beyond the date set for a final hearing.

      (2) The final hearing shall be held no later than 60 days or as soon as possible after the date on which the application is filed.

(1) The juvenile court in its discretion may enter a judgment of emancipation where the minor is at least 16 years of age and the court finds that the best interests of the minor will be served by emancipation. In making its determination, the court shall take into consideration the following factors:

      (a) Whether the parent of the minor consents to the proposed emancipation;

      (b) Whether the minor has been living away from the family home and is substantially able to be self-maintained and self-supported without parental guidance and supervision; and

      (c) Whether the minor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that the minor is sufficiently mature and knowledgeable to manage the minor’s affairs without parental assistance.

      (2) Upon entry of a judgment of emancipation by the court, the applicant shall be given a copy of the judgment. The judgment shall instruct that the applicant obtain an Oregon driver’s license or an Oregon identification card through the Department of Transportation and that the Department of Transportation make a notation of the minor’s emancipated status on the license or identification card.

JUVENILE COURT DEPENDENCY PROCEDURE

 

      419B.800 Applicability of ORS 419B.800 to 419B.929. (1) ORS 419B.800 to 419B.929 govern procedure and practice in all juvenile court proceedings under this chapter. The Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply in these proceedings.

      (2) ORS 419B.800 to 419B.929 apply to all proceedings under this chapter pending on or filed on or after January 1, 2002, except when, in the opinion of the court, application in a case pending on January 1, 2002, would not be feasible or would work an injustice.

      (3) ORS 419B.800 to 419B.929 do not preclude a court in which they apply from regulating pleading, practice and procedure in any manner not inconsistent with ORS 419B.800 to 419B.929. [2001 c.622 §2]

 

      419B.803 Jurisdiction. (1) A juvenile court having subject matter jurisdiction has jurisdiction over:

      (a) A party, who has been served in the matter as provided in ORS 419B.812 to 419B.839 to the extent that prosecution of the action is not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state and the Constitution of the United States;

      (b) A child under 12 years of age who is the subject of a petition filed pursuant to ORS 419B.100; and

      (c) Any other party specified in ORS 419B.875 (1).

      (2) Juvenile court jurisdiction is subject to ORS 109.701 to 109.834. [2001 c.622 §3]

 

      419B.806 Consolidation; when required; procedures. (1) As used in this section, “consolidated” means that actions are heard before one judge of the circuit court to determine issues regarding a child or ward.

      (2) In any action filed in the juvenile court in which the legal or physical custody of a child or ward is at issue and there is also a child custody, parenting time, visitation, restraining order, filiation or Family Abuse Prevention Act action involving the child or ward in a domestic relations, filiation or guardianship proceeding, the matters shall be consolidated. Actions must be consolidated under this subsection regardless of whether the actions to be consolidated were filed or initiated before or after the filing of the petition under ORS 419B.100.

      (3) Consolidation does not merge the procedural or substantive law of the individual actions. Parties to the individual consolidated actions do not have standing, solely by virtue of the consolidation, in every action subject to the order of consolidation. Parties must comply with provisions for intervention or participation in a particular action under the provisions of law applicable to that action.

      (4) Upon entry of an order of consolidation, all pending issues pertaining to the actions subject to the order shall be heard together in juvenile court. The court shall hear the juvenile matters first unless the court finds that it is in the best interest of the child or ward to proceed otherwise.

      (5) A judge shall make and modify orders and findings in actions subject to the order of consolidation upon the filing of proper motions and notice as provided by law applicable to the actions.

      (6) The judge shall set out separately from orders entered under this chapter or ORS chapter 419C any orders or judgments made in other actions subject to the consolidation order. The trial court administrator shall file the orders and judgments in the appropriate actions subject to the consolidation order. An order or judgment in an individual juvenile court action is final if it finally disposes of the rights and duties of the parties to that action, without reference to whether the order or judgment disposes of the rights and duties of the parties to another action with which the action has been consolidated.

      (7)(a) When the actions described in subsection (2) of this section exist in two or more circuit courts, the judges assigned to the actions shall confer to determine the appropriate court in which to consolidate and hear the actions. The judges shall confer not later than 10 judicial days after a court has received notice of the existence of an action in another circuit court.

      (b) If the judges agree on the circuit court in which the actions should be consolidated, the judges shall take such action as is necessary to consolidate the actions in the circuit court.

      (c) If the judges do not agree on the circuit court in which the actions should be consolidated, the actions must be consolidated in the court in which the juvenile action is filed or, if more than one juvenile action is pending, in the court in which the first juvenile action was filed.

      (8) Nothing in this section requires the consolidation of any administrative proceeding under ORS chapter 25 or 416 with a juvenile court or other action. [Formerly 419B.260; 2003 c.396 §92; 2007 c.547 §12]

 

      419B.809 Petition; contents; form; dismissal. (1) Any person may file a petition in the juvenile court alleging that a child named therein is within the jurisdiction of the court under ORS 419B.100.

      (2) The petition and all subsequent court documents in the proceeding must be entitled “In the matter of_____, a child.” The petition must be in writing, signed by the petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney and verified.

      (3) When the petition is filed by a peace officer, district attorney, attorney general, juvenile department counselor, employee of the Department of Human Services or employee of the Oregon Youth Authority, the petition may be verified upon the information and belief of the petitioner. In all other cases, the petition must be based on the personal knowledge of the petitioner.

      (4) The petition alleging jurisdiction must set forth in ordinary and concise language such of the following facts as are known and indicate any that are not known. The petition shall:

      (a) Contain the name, age and residence of the child.

      (b) Contain the facts that bring the child within the jurisdiction of the court, including sufficient information to put the parties on notice of the issues in the proceeding.

      (c) Contain the name and residence of the child’s parent and, in cases under ORS 419B.100, the names of persons with whom, and the places where, the child has resided for the previous five years.

      (e) Indicate whether a person other than a parent has or claims to have physical custody of the child and, if so, the name and residence of the person having physical custody of the child.

      (f) Indicate whether the petitioner has participated in any capacity in any other proceeding concerning the custody of or parenting time or visitation with the child and, if so, the court, case number and date of any child custody determination.

      (g) Indicate whether the petitioner knows of any proceeding that could affect the current proceeding and, if so, the court, case number and date of the proceeding.

      (5) At any time after a petition is filed, the court may make an order providing for temporary custody of the child.

      (6) The court, on motion of an interested party or on its own motion, may at any time direct that the petition be amended. If the amendment results in a substantial departure from the facts originally alleged, the court shall grant such continuance as the interests of justice may require.

      (7) Prior to an adjudicatory hearing on the petition, the court may dismiss the petition provided that every party has had an opportunity to investigate and present a case supporting the petition or has waived the opportunity to investigate and the right to present a case. At or after an adjudicatory hearing, the court may dismiss the petition at any other stage of the proceedings.

      (8) The petition for jurisdiction must be in substantially the following form.

When substituted service is used, the person effecting service shall cause to be mailed a true copy of the summons and a true copy of the petition and a statement of the date, time, and place at which substituted service was made. The summons, petition and statement must be mailed by first class mail to the dwelling house or usual place of abode of the person who has been served as soon as is practicable after the substituted service was made. When the computation of a period of time is based on service of summons, substituted service is complete upon such mailing.

      (3) If the person to be served maintains an office for conducting business, office service may be made by leaving a true copy of the summons and a true copy of the petition at the office during normal working hours with the person who is apparently in charge. When office service is used, the person effecting service shall cause to be mailed a true copy of the summons and a true copy of the petition and a statement of the date, time, and place at which office service was made. The summons, petition and statement must be mailed by first class mail to the person who has been served at the person’s dwelling house or usual place of abode, place of business or such other place under the circumstances that is most reasonably calculated to apprise the person of the existence and pendency of the juvenile proceeding. The summons, petition and statement must be mailed as soon as is practicable after the office service was made. When the computation of a period of time is based on service of summons, office service is complete upon such mailing.

      (4) Service by mail must be made by mailing a true copy of the summons and a true copy of the petition to the person to be served by first class mail and another true copy of the petition and another true copy of the summons by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by express mail.

The summons must be published three times in successive calendar weeks. If the person effecting service knows of a specific location other than the county where the action is commenced where publication might reasonably result in actual notice to the person to be served, the person effecting service shall so state in the affidavit required by paragraph (a) of this subsection, and the court may order publication in a comparable manner at such location in addition to, or in lieu of, publication in the county where the action is commenced.

      (d) If the court orders service by publication and the person effecting service does not know and cannot upon diligent inquiry ascertain the current address of a person being served, a copy of the summons and the petition must be mailed by the methods specified in subsection (4) of this section to the person being served at that person’s last known address.

      419B.845 Restraining order when child abuse alleged. (1)(a) When a petition has been filed alleging that the child has been physically or sexually abused, the court may enter an order restraining the alleged perpetrator of the abuse from having contact with the child or attempting to contact the child and requiring the alleged perpetrator to move from the household in which the child resides. The court may issue a restraining order only if the court finds that:

      (A) There is probable cause to believe the abuse occurred and that the person to be restrained committed the abuse; and

      (B) The order is in the best interest of the child.

      (b) Upon finding that to do so would aid in protecting the victim of the alleged abuse, the court may enter, in addition to a restraining order described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, other appropriate orders including, but not limited to, orders that control contact between the alleged abuser and other children in the household.

      (c) The court shall include in an order entered under this subsection the following information about the person to be restrained:

      (A) Name;

      (B) Address;

      (E) Sex;

      (F) Height and weight; and

      (G) Color of hair and eyes.

The restrained person is entitled to remove the person’s essential personal effects under this paragraph on one occasion only and is required to be accompanied by a peace officer. The restrained person and the peace officer shall remain for no longer than 20 minutes and the peace officer may temporarily interrupt the removal of essential personal effects at any time. Nothing in this paragraph affects a peace officer’s duty to arrest under ORS 133.055 and 133.310. A peace officer who accompanies a restrained person under this paragraph has immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, for any actions the person commits during the removal of the person’s essential personal effects.

      (2) If the court enters an order under this section:

      (a) The clerk of the court shall provide without charge the number of certified copies of the petition and order necessary to effect service and shall have a copy of the petition and order delivered to the sheriff or other person qualified to serve the order for service upon the person to be restrained; and

      (b) The sheriff or other person qualified to serve the order shall serve the person to be restrained personally unless that person is present at the hearing. After accepting the order, if the sheriff or other person cannot complete service within 10 days, the sheriff or other person shall hold the order for future service and file a return to the clerk of the court showing that service was not completed.

      (3) Within 30 days after an order is served under this section, the restrained person may file a written request with the court and receive a court hearing on any portion of the order. If the restrained person requests a hearing under this subsection:

      (a) The clerk of the court shall notify the parties and, if the restrained person is not a party, the restrained person of the date and time of the hearing; and

      (b) The court shall hold the hearing within 21 days after the request and may cancel or modify the order.

      (4) Upon receipt of a copy of the order and notice of completion of any required service by a member of a law enforcement agency, the sheriff shall immediately enter the order into the Law Enforcement Data System maintained by the Department of State Police. If the order was served on the person to be restrained by a person other than a member of a law enforcement agency, the county sheriff shall enter the order into the Law Enforcement Data System upon receipt of a true copy of the affidavit of proof of service. Entry into the Law Enforcement Data System constitutes notice to all law enforcement agencies of the existence of the order. Law enforcement agencies shall establish procedures adequate to ensure that an officer at the scene of an alleged violation of the order may be informed of the existence and terms of the order. The order is fully enforceable in any county in this state.

      (5) A restraining order issued pursuant to this section remains in effect for a period of one year or until the order is modified, amended or terminated by court order.

      (6) A court that issued a restraining order under this section may renew the order for a period of up to one year if the court finds that there is probable cause to believe the renewal is in the best interest of the child. The court may renew the order on motion alleging facts supporting the required finding. If the renewal order is granted, subsections (2) and (3) of this section apply.

      (7) If a restraining order issued pursuant to this section is terminated before its expiration date, the clerk of the court shall immediately deliver a copy of the termination order to the sheriff. The sheriff shall promptly remove the original order from the Law Enforcement Data System.

Unless the order provides otherwise, the security amount for release shall be $5,000.

      (9) When a restraining order entered under this section prohibits the restrained person from contacting the protected person in writing, the restrained person does not violate the restraining order by serving on the protected person a copy of a notice of appeal of the restraining order or any other document required by law to be served on the adverse party to an appeal if:

      (a) Neither the restrained person nor the protected person is represented by counsel;

      (b) The restrained person serves the document by mail; and

      (c) The contents of the document are not intended to harass or intimidate the protected person. [Formerly 419B.190; 2007 c.255 §13; 2011 c.269 §7; 2013 c.366 §75]

 

      419B.846 Service of restraining order. (1) A sheriff may serve a restraining order issued under ORS 419B.845 in the county in which the sheriff was elected and in any county that is adjacent to the county in which the sheriff was elected.

Before transmitting a restraining order to a sheriff under this subsection by telephonic facsimile or electronic mail, the person sending the copy must receive confirmation from the sheriff’s office that an electronic communication device is available and operating. For purposes of this subsection, “electronic communication device” means a device by which any kind of electronic communication can be made, including but not limited to communication by telephonic facsimile and electronic mail.

The officer or person serving or executing the order or paper has the same authority and is subject to the same liabilities as if the copy were the original. The original, if an order, must be filed in the court from which it was issued and a certified copy of the order must be preserved in the office from which it was sent. The operator may use either the original or certified copy to transmit the order or paper.

      (4) Proof of service or execution of process must be made as provided in ORS 419B.833 or 419B.851. [2001 c.622 §14; 2017 c.737 §11]

      (5) The filing of any papers with the court must be made by filing them with the clerk of the court or the person exercising the duties of that office. The clerk or the person exercising the duties of that office shall indorse the time of day, day of the month, month and year upon the paper.

      (7) Whenever under ORS 419B.800 to 419B.929 service is required or permitted to be made upon a party, unless the party or the party’s attorney is exempted from service by electronic mail or electronic service by an order of the court, the service may be made by one of the following means:

      (a) Electronic mail. Service by electronic mail is complete under this subsection on confirmation of receipt of the electronic mail or, if the party has consented to service by electronic mail, on transmission of the electronic mail. A party or a party’s attorney must provide the name and electronic mail address of that party or that attorney on any document served by electronic mail.

      419B.854 Computing statutory time periods. (1) In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by any applicable statute, by the local rules of any court or by order of court, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is not included. The last day of the period so computed is included, unless it is a Saturday or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday or a legal holiday. If the period of time relates to serving a public officer or filing a document at a public office and if the last day falls on a day when that particular office is closed before the end of or for all of the normal work day, the last day is excluded in computing the period of time, in which event the period runs until the close of office hours on the next day the office is open for business. When the period of time prescribed or allowed, without including the extra time allowed by subsection (2) of this section, is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays and legal holidays are excluded in the computation. As used in this subsection, a “legal holiday” means a day described in ORS 187.010 or 187.020.

      (2) Except for service of summons, whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon the party and the notice or paper is served by mail, three days are added to the prescribed period. [2001 c.622 §16]

      (2) When a party does not know the name of another party and alleges that lack of knowledge in a petition, answer, motion or other paper, the other party may be designated by any name. When the other party’s true name is discovered, the process and all petitions, answers, motions, other papers and proceedings in the case may be amended by substituting the true name. [2001 c.622 §19]

 

      419B.866 Signing pleadings required; effect of signing or not signing. (1) If a party is represented by an attorney, every answer, motion and other paper of the party must be signed by an attorney of record who is an active member of the Oregon State Bar. If a party is not represented by an attorney, the party shall sign the petition, answer, motion or other paper and state the address of the party. Only petitions need be verified. Motions must be accompanied by an affidavit unless the parties agree otherwise.

      (2) If a petition, answer, motion or other paper is not signed, it must be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant.

      (3)(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, by signing, filing or otherwise submitting an argument in support of a petition, answer, motion or other paper, an attorney or party makes the certifications to the court identified in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this subsection and further certifies that the certifications are based on the person’s reasonable knowledge, information and belief formed after the making of any inquiry that is reasonable under the circumstances.

      (b) A party or attorney certifies that the petition, answer, motion or other paper is not being presented for any improper purpose including, but not limited to, harassing or causing unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.

      (c) An attorney certifies that the claims and other legal positions taken in the petition, answer, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.

      (d) A party or attorney certifies that the allegations and other factual assertions in the petition, answer, motion or other paper are supported by evidence. An allegation or other factual assertion that the party or attorney does not wish to certify is supported by evidence must be specifically identified. The party or attorney certifies that the party or attorney reasonably believes that an allegation or other factual assertion so identified will be supported by evidence after further investigation and discovery. [2001 c.622 §20]

 

      419B.869 Responding to pleadings; time limit. (1) No later than 30 days after a petition alleging jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 is filed, each party about whom allegations have been made shall admit or deny the allegations. Unless the court specifies how admissions or denials are to be made pursuant to ORS 419B.800, admissions and denials may be made orally in court or in writing.

      (2) Allegations in a petition that are not admitted or denied are denied. [2001 c.622 §21]

 

      419B.872 Amendment of pleadings. (1) A petition, answer, motion or other paper may be amended by a party within a reasonable time before an adjudication on the petition, answer, motion or other paper. Whenever an amended petition, answer, motion or other paper is filed, it shall be served upon all parties. When the interests of justice require additional time to prepare, due to the amendments to the petition, answer, motion or other paper, the court shall grant such additional time as is reasonable.

      (2) The court, on motion of an interested party or on its own motion, may at any time direct that the petition be amended. If the amendment results in a substantial departure from the facts originally alleged, the court shall grant such continuance as the interests of justice may require. [Formerly 419B.245]

      (A) The child or ward;

      (B) The parents or guardian of the child or ward;

      (C) A putative father of the child or ward who has demonstrated a direct and significant commitment to the child or ward by assuming, or attempting to assume, responsibilities normally associated with parenthood, including but not limited to:

      (i) Residing with the child or ward;

      (ii) Contributing to the financial support of the child or ward; or

      (E) The juvenile department;

      (F) A court appointed special advocate, if appointed;

      (G) The Department of Human Services or other child-caring agency if the agency has temporary custody of the child or ward; and

      (H) The tribe in cases subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act if the tribe has intervened pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act.

      (b) An intervenor who is granted intervention under ORS 419B.116 is a party to a proceeding under ORS 419B.100. An intervenor under this paragraph is not a party to a proceeding under ORS 419B.500.

      (2) The rights of the parties include, but are not limited to:

      (a) The right to notice of the proceeding and copies of the petitions, answers, motions and other papers;

      (b) The right to appear with counsel and, except for intervenors under subsection (1)(b) of this section, to have counsel appointed as otherwise provided by law;

      (4) If no appeal from the judgment or order is pending, a putative father whom a court of competent jurisdiction has found not to be the child or ward’s legal or biological parent or who has filed a petition for filiation that was dismissed is not a party under subsection (1) of this section.

      (5)(a) A person granted rights of limited participation under ORS 419B.116 is not a party to a proceeding under ORS 419B.100 or 419B.500 but has only those rights specified in the order granting rights of limited participation.

      (b) Persons moving for or granted rights of limited participation are not entitled to appointed counsel but may appear with retained counsel.

      (6) If a foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative is currently providing care for a child or ward, the Department of Human Services shall give the foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative notice of a proceeding concerning the child or ward. A foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative providing care for a child or ward has the right to be heard at the proceeding. Except when allowed to intervene, the foster parent, preadoptive parent or relative providing care for the child or ward is not considered a party to the juvenile court proceeding solely because of notice and the right to be heard at the proceeding.

      (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a grandparent is not a party to the juvenile court proceeding unless the grandparent has been granted rights of intervention under ORS 419B.116.

      (f) As used in this subsection, “grandparent” means the legal parent of the child’s or ward’s legal parent, regardless of whether the parental rights of the child’s or ward’s legal parent have been terminated under ORS 419B.500 to 419B.524.

      (8) Interpreters for parties and persons granted rights of limited participation shall be appointed in the manner specified by ORS 45.275 and 45.285.

      419B.876 Visitation or other contact between grandparent and ward; findings; order; appeal. (1) The grandparent of a ward who has been placed in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services for care, placement and supervision pursuant to ORS 419B.337 and who is in substitute care as defined in ORS 419A.004 may, at any hearing concerning the ward except for a hearing under ORS 419B.500, request that the court order visitation or other contact or communication between the grandparent and the ward, provided the grandparent has notified the department and parties in the proceeding of the grandparent’s intent to make the request at the hearing at least 30 days before the date of the hearing.

      (2) If the notice required under subsection (1) of this section has been given, the court may grant the grandparent’s request in whole or in part if the court finds that:

      (a) Prior to the establishment of wardship:

      (A) An ongoing relationship existed between the grandparent and the ward that included regular visits or other contact or communication; or

      (B) Despite the grandparent’s efforts, no ongoing relationship existed between the grandparent and the ward due to circumstances beyond the grandparent’s control;

      (e) Ordering visitation or other contact or communication between the grandparent and the ward is in the ward’s best interests; and

      (f) Ordering visitation or other contact or communication between the grandparent and the ward would not unreasonably burden the resources of the Department of Human Services.

      (3) Unless otherwise agreed by the Department of Human Services and the grandparent, the costs of transportation, lodging, food or other expenses required to implement visitation ordered by the court under this section shall be the responsibility of the grandparent.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 419A.200, a grandparent may not appeal from or otherwise challenge on appeal an order or judgment of the court denying in whole or in part a request for visitation or other contact or communication made under this section.

      (5) The court may receive testimony, reports or other material relating to the ward’s mental, physical and social history and prognosis without regard to the competency or relevancy of the testimony, reports or other material under the rules of evidence for the purpose of making the findings required by subsection (2) of this section.

      (6) As used in this section, “grandparent” means the legal parent of the child’s or ward’s legal parent, regardless of whether the parental rights of the child’s or ward’s legal parent have been terminated under ORS 419B.500 to 419B.524. [2013 c.436 §3; 2015 c.216 §2]

      419B.878 Applicability of Indian Child Welfare Act. When a court conducts a hearing, the court shall inquire whether a child is an Indian child subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act. If the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the court shall enter an order requiring the Department of Human Services to notify the Indian child’s tribe of the pending proceedings and of the tribe’s right to intervene and shall enter an order that the case be treated as an Indian Child Welfare Act case until such time as the court determines that the case is not an Indian Child Welfare Act case. [2001 c.622 §22]

(1) In all proceedings brought under ORS 419B.100 or 419B.500, each party, including the state, shall disclose to each other party and to a guardian ad litem appointed under ORS 419B.231 the following information and material within the possession or under the control of the party:

      (b) Unable to attend because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or undue hardship.

      (2) The affidavit in support of the motion to take a deposition to perpetuate testimony, in addition to setting forth the reasons described in subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section, shall also set forth:

      (a) The reasons why the testimony of the witness sought to be deposed cannot be taken by telephone at the time of the hearing;

      (b) Where the deposition is to be taken;

      (c) The manner of recording the deposition; and

      (d) A brief statement of the substance of the testimony that the witness is expected to give.

      (3) If the court finds that taking a deposition will best promote the just, speedy and inexpensive resolution of one or more issues in the proceeding or that taking a deposition is necessary to meet the requirements of due process, the court shall grant the motion.

      (4) If the motion is granted, the court may, in its discretion, set conditions regarding the time, place and method of taking the deposition. [Formerly 419B.315]

 

      419B.887 Objections at depositions; effect of failure to make timely objection; errors and irregularities in transcript preparation. (1) As used in this section, “deposition” means a deposition taken under ORS 419B.884.

      (2) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of a deposition unless the ground for the objection is one that might have been obviated or removed if presented before or during the taking of the deposition.

      (3) Unless seasonable objection is made at the time the deposition is taken, the following are waived:

      (a) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation or in the conduct of the parties; and

      (b) Errors of any kind that might be obviated, removed or cured if promptly presented.

      (4) Unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part of the deposition is made with reasonable promptness after the error or irregularity is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained, errors and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, transmitted and filed are waived. [2001 c.622 §23]

 

      419B.890 Dismissal of petition at end of petitioner’s case; settlement conference. (1) After the proponent of the petition has completed the presentation of evidence, any other party, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for dismissal of any or all of the allegations of the petition on the ground that upon the facts and the law the proponent of the petition has failed to prove the allegations or, if proven, the allegations do not constitute a legal basis for the relief sought by the petition. The court may order dismissal of the petition or one or more of the allegations of the petition, or the court may decline to render any order until the close of all the evidence.

      (2) Unless the court in its judgment of dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this section operates as an adjudication without prejudice.

      (3) At any time at the request of a party or upon the court’s own motion, the court may order a settlement conference or, if funds are available for a mediator, mediation. [2001 c.622 §24]

 

      419B.893 Subpoenas generally. (1) A subpoena is a writ or an order directed to a person and may require the attendance of the person at a particular time and place to testify as a witness on behalf of a particular party mentioned in the subpoena or may require the person to produce books, papers, documents or other tangible things and permit inspection of them at a particular time and place. A subpoena may be for a trial, a hearing of any kind or a deposition under ORS 419B.884. A subpoena requiring attendance to testify as a witness requires that the witness remain until the testimony is closed unless sooner discharged, but at the end of each day’s attendance a witness may demand of the party, or the party’s attorney, the payment of legal witness fees for the next following day and if not then paid, the witness is not obliged to remain longer in attendance. Every subpoena must state the name of the court and the title of the action.

      (2) Any party may have compulsory attendance of witnesses or the compulsory production of records. [2001 c.622 §25; 2003 c.14 §227]

 

      419B.896 Subpoena for production of books, papers, documents and other tangible things. A subpoena may command the person to whom it is directed to produce and permit inspection and copying, at the time and place specified in the subpoena, of designated books, papers, documents or other tangible things in the possession, custody or control of the person. A command to produce books, papers, documents or other tangible things and permit inspection of them may be joined with a command to appear at trial or hearing or, if the books, papers, documents or other tangible things are to be produced before trial, the command may be issued separately. A person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, documents or other tangible things but not commanded to also appear for deposition under ORS 419B.884, hearing or trial may, within 14 days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than 14 days after service, serve upon the party or attorney designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena may not inspect and copy the materials except pursuant to an order of the court in whose name the subpoena was issued. If objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena, upon notice to the person commanded to produce, may move for an order to compel production. When a subpoena commands production of books, papers, documents or other tangible things, the court, upon motion made promptly and in any event at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance with the subpoena, may:

      (1) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive; or

      (2) Condition denial of the motion upon the advancement by the person in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost of producing the books, papers, documents or other tangible things. [2001 c.622 §26; 2003 c.14 §228]

 

      419B.899 Issuance of subpoena. (1) A subpoena may be issued:

      (a) To require attendance before a court, at the trial of an issue in a court or, if separate from a subpoena commanding the attendance of a person, to produce and permit inspection of books, papers, documents or other tangible things. A subpoena may be issued under this paragraph:

      (A) In blank by the clerk of the court in which the action is pending or, if there is no clerk, by a judge or justice of the court; or

      (B) By an attorney of record of the party to the action in whose behalf the witness is required to appear, subscribed by the signature of the attorney.

      (b) To require attendance at a deposition authorized under ORS 419B.884.

      (c) To require attendance out of court in cases not provided for in paragraph (a) of this subsection, before a judge, justice or other officer authorized to administer oaths or take testimony in any matter under the laws of this state. A subpoena may be issued under this paragraph by the judge, justice or other officer before whom the attendance is required.

      (2) Upon the request of a party or attorney, any subpoena issued by a clerk of court may be issued in blank and delivered to the party or attorney requesting it, who must fill it in before service.

      (3) A subpoena to produce and permit inspection of records of a person who is not a party to the action must be served on the person and, if the person is represented, the person’s attorney at least 10 days before the subpoena is served on the keeper or custodian of the records. [2001 c.622 §27; 2003 c.14 §229]

 

      419B.902 Service of subpoena. (1) A subpoena may be served by the party or any other person 18 years of age or older. Except as provided in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, the service must be made by delivering a copy to the witness personally. The service must be made so as to allow the witness a reasonable time for preparation and travel to the place of attendance. If the subpoena is not accompanied by a command to appear at trial, hearing or deposition under ORS 419B.884, whether the subpoena is served personally or by mail, copies of a subpoena commanding production and inspection of books, papers, documents or other tangible things before trial must be served on each party at least seven days before the subpoena is served on the person required to produce and permit inspection, unless the court orders a shorter period.

      (2)(a) A law enforcement agency shall designate an individual upon whom service of a subpoena may be made. A designated individual must be available during normal business hours. In the absence of a designated individual, service of a subpoena under paragraph (b) of this subsection may be made upon the officer in charge of the law enforcement agency.

      (b) If a peace officer’s attendance at trial is required as a result of employment as a peace officer, a subpoena may be served on the officer by delivering a copy personally to the officer or to an individual designated by the agency that employs the officer no later than 10 days prior to the date attendance is sought. A subpoena may be served in this manner only if the officer is currently employed as a peace officer and is present within the state at the time of service.

      (c) When a subpoena has been served as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the law enforcement agency shall make a good faith effort to give actual notice to the officer whose attendance is sought of the date, time and location of the court appearance. If the officer cannot be notified, the law enforcement agency shall promptly notify the court and a postponement or continuance may be granted to allow the officer to be personally served.

      (d) As used in this subsection, “law enforcement agency” means the Oregon State Police, a county sheriff’s department, a municipal police department, a police department established by a university under ORS 352.121 or 353.125 or, if the witness whose attendance at trial is required is an authorized tribal police officer as defined in ORS 181A.680, a tribal government as defined in ORS 181A.680.

      (3) Under the following circumstances, service of a subpoena to a witness by mail has the same legal force and effect as personal service:

      (a) The attorney mailing the subpoena certifies in connection with or upon the return of service that the attorney, or the attorney’s agent, has had personal or telephone contact with the witness and the witness indicated a willingness to appear at trial if subpoenaed; or

      (b) The subpoena was mailed to the witness more than five days before trial by certified mail or some other designation of mail that provides a receipt for the mail signed by the recipient and the attorney received a return receipt signed by the witness prior to trial.

      (4) Service of subpoena by mail may be used for a subpoena commanding production of books, papers, documents or other tangible things that is not accompanied by a command to appear at trial or hearing or at a deposition under ORS 419B.884.

      (5) Proof of service of a subpoena is made in the same manner as proof of service of a summons except that the server is not required to certify that the server is not a party in the action or an attorney for a party in the action. [2001 c.622 §28; 2003 c.14 §230; 2011 c.644 §§30,68,75; 2013 c.180 §§41,42; 2015 c.174 §21]

 

      419B.905 Subpoena of incarcerated witness. If a witness is confined in a prison or jail in this state, a subpoena may be served on the witness and attendance of the witness may be compelled. The subpoena and court order must be served upon the custodian of the witness. The court may order:

      (1) Temporary removal and production of the witness for the purpose of giving testimony;

      (2) That the witness be allowed to testify by telephone or closed-circuit television; or

      (3) That the testimony of the witness be taken by deposition under ORS 419B.884 at the place of confinement. [2001 c.622 §29]

 

      419B.908 Witness fees; payment. Witnesses subpoenaed to give testimony shall receive the same fees as are paid in criminal cases. Except as provided by this section, responsibility for the per diem and mileage fees of any witness, and travel expenses if so ordered by the court, shall be borne by the party who subpoenas the witness or requests the court to subpoena the witness. If the witness was subpoenaed by more than one party, the witness shall be paid by the party who first subpoenas the witness. The court may then, thereafter, order that the costs be distributed equally among all parties who subpoenaed the witness and that the original payor of the costs be reimbursed accordingly. When the witness has been subpoenaed on behalf of a party who is represented by appointed counsel, the fees and costs allowed for that witness shall be paid pursuant to ORS 135.055. [Formerly 419B.320]

 

      419B.911 Failure to obey subpoena. Disobedience to a subpoena or a refusal to be sworn or answer as a witness is punishable as contempt by the court before whom the action is pending or by the judge or justice issuing the subpoena. [2001 c.622 §30]

 

      419B.914 Proceeding when person entitled to service is not summoned and is not before court. If the child or ward is before the court, the court has the power to proceed with the case without service upon those entitled to service under ORS 419B.812 to 419B.839 if diligent efforts have failed to reveal the identity or the whereabouts of the person, except that:

      (1) No order entered pursuant to ORS 419B.500, 419B.502, 419B.504, 419B.506 and 419B.508 may be entered unless ORS 419B.518, 419B.521, 419B.524 and 419B.812 to 419B.839 are complied with.

      (2) No order for support as provided in ORS 419B.400, 419B.402, 419B.404 and 419B.406 may be entered against a person unless that person is served as provided in ORS 419B.812 to 419B.839. [Formerly 419B.285; 2003 c.396 §95]

 

      419B.917 [2001 c.622 §31; repealed by 2003 c.205 §12 (419B.918 enacted in lieu of 419B.917)]

 

      419B.918 Manner of appearance. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 419B.815, 419B.816, 419B.819 and 419B.820, on timely written motion of a person showing good cause, a court may permit the person, instead of appearing personally, to participate in any hearing related to a petition alleging jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100, a petition to establish a permanent guardianship under ORS 419B.365 or a petition seeking termination of parental rights under ORS 419B.500, 419B.502, 419B.504, 419B.506 or 419B.508 in any manner that complies with the requirements of due process including, but not limited to, telephonic or other electronic means.

      (2) If a person who is summoned or ordered to appear under ORS 419B.815, 419B.816, 419B.819 or 419B.820 seeks to reschedule any hearing at which the person is required to appear, the person must:

      (a) Appear personally at the time specified in the summons or order to request the change; or

      (b) Include in the person’s written motion requesting the change the person’s current mailing address, to which the court may send notice of the new date for the hearing if the motion is granted.

      (3) In any proceeding that involves the interstate placement of a child or ward, the court may:

      (a) Permit a party from outside this state to provide information, testify or otherwise participate in the proceeding in any manner the court designates, provided the party complies with subsection (1) of this section, if applicable;

      (b) Permit an attorney from outside this state representing any party to participate in the proceeding in any manner the court designates; and

      (c) Obtain information or testimony in any manner the court designates from a state or private agency located in another state. [2003 c.205 §13 (enacted in lieu of 419B.917); 2007 c.497 §9; 2007 c.611 §10]

 

      419B.920 New hearings. If it appears to the court that a person required to be summoned under ORS 419B.812 to 419B.839 was not served as required by ORS 419B.812 to 419B.839 or was served on such short notice that the person did not have a reasonable opportunity to appear at the time fixed, upon motion of the person, the court shall reopen the case for full consideration. A motion for a new hearing must be made not later than 10 days after entry of the order for which a new hearing is sought. [2001 c.622 §32]

 

      419B.923 Modifying or setting aside order or judgment. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, on motion and such notice and hearing as the court may direct, the court may modify or set aside any order or judgment made by it. Reasons for modifying or setting aside an order or judgment include, but are not limited to:

      (a) Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors in the order or judgment arising from oversight or omission. These mistakes and errors may be corrected by the court at any time on its own motion or on the motion of a party and after notice as the court orders to all parties who have appeared. During the pendency of an appeal, an order or judgment may be corrected as provided in subsection (7) of this section.

      (b) Excusable neglect.

      (c) Newly discovered evidence that by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to present it at the hearing from which the order or judgment issued.

      (2) A motion to modify or set aside an order or judgment or request a new hearing must be accompanied by an affidavit that states with reasonable particularity the facts and legal basis for the motion.

      (3) A motion to modify or set aside an order or judgment must be made within a reasonable time except no order or judgment pursuant to ORS 419B.527 may be set aside or modified during the pendency of a proceeding for the adoption of the ward, nor after a petition for adoption has been granted.

      (4) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, notice and a hearing as provided in ORS 419B.195, 419B.198, 419B.201, 419B.205, 419B.208, 419B.310, 419B.325 and 419B.893 must be provided in any case when the effect of modifying or setting aside the order or judgment will or may be to deprive a parent of the legal custody of the child or ward, to place the child or ward in an institution or agency or to transfer the child or ward from one institution or agency to another. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to a parent whose rights have been terminated under ORS 419B.500 to 419B.524 or whose child has been permanently committed by order or judgment of the court unless an appeal from the order or judgment is pending.

      (5) When an Indian child is involved, notice must be provided as required under the Indian Child Welfare Act.

      (6) Except when the child or ward is an Indian child, notice and a hearing are not required when the effect of modifying or setting aside the order or judgment will be to transfer the child or ward from one foster home to another.

      (7) A motion under subsection (1) of this section may be filed with and decided by the trial court during the time an appeal from a judgment is pending before an appellate court. The moving party shall serve a copy of the motion on the appellate court. The moving party shall file a copy of the trial court’s order or judgment in the appellate court within seven days of the date of the trial court order or judgment. Any necessary modification of the appeal required by the court order or judgment must be pursuant to rule of the appellate court.

      (8) This section does not limit the inherent power of a court to modify an order or judgment within a reasonable time or the power of a court to set aside an order or judgment for fraud upon the court. [2001 c.622 §33; 2003 c.396 §97]

 

      419B.926 Stay of order or judgment pending appeal. (1) On its own motion or on the motion of a party, the court may stay the effect of any order or judgment made by it pending appeal as provided in ORS 19.335, 19.340 and 19.350 or other provision of law.

      (2) This section does not limit the right of a party to a stay otherwise provided for by law. [2001 c.622 §34]

 

      419B.929 Enforcement of certain orders and judgments. A court may enforce an order or judgment directing a party to perform a specific act by punishing the party refusing or neglecting to comply with the order or judgment, as for a contempt as provided in ORS 33.015 to 33.155. [2001 c.622 §35]
