GENERALLY

 

      419C.001 Purposes of juvenile justice system in delinquency cases; audits. (1) The Legislative Assembly declares that in delinquency cases, the purposes of the Oregon juvenile justice system from apprehension forward are to protect the public and reduce juvenile delinquency and to provide fair and impartial procedures for the initiation, adjudication and disposition of allegations of delinquent conduct. The system is founded on the principles of personal responsibility, accountability and reformation within the context of public safety and restitution to the victims and to the community. The system shall provide a continuum of services that emphasize prevention of further criminal activity by the use of early and certain sanctions, reformation and rehabilitation programs and swift and decisive intervention in delinquent behavior. The system shall be open and accountable to the people of Oregon and their elected representatives.

      (2)(a) Programs, policies and services shall be regularly and independently audited. Audits performed under this subsection must include program audits and performance audits, as defined in ORS 297.070. Programs, policies and services that were established before, on or after June 30, 1995, are subject to audit under this subsection.

      (b) The programs, policies and services of county juvenile departments shall be subject to regular review pursuant to this subsection.

      (c) The Secretary of State shall perform an audit that includes the performance of county juvenile departments.

      (d) ORS 297.405 to 297.555 do not apply to an audit conducted pursuant to this subsection.

      (e) Notwithstanding ORS 297.040, the costs and expenses of audits conducted under this subsection may not be charged to the county juvenile departments. The Secretary of State shall pay the costs and expenses of audits conducted under this subsection from funds available to the Secretary of State.

      (3) To facilitate an audit under subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) The Secretary of State may subpoena witnesses, require the production of books and papers and the rendering of reports in such manner and form as the Secretary of State requires and may do all things necessary to secure a full and thorough investigation.

      (b) The custodian of information that the Secretary of State deems necessary to conduct the audit shall provide the Secretary of State or the auditor selected by the Secretary of State access to the information notwithstanding the fact that the information may be made confidential or access to the information restricted by ORS 419A.255 or another law. Information obtained by the Secretary of State or the auditor pursuant to this paragraph and made confidential by ORS 419A.255 or another law may be used by the Secretary of State, the officers and employees of the Secretary of State or the auditor solely for the purpose of performing the audit required by subsection (2) of this section and may not be used or disclosed for any other purpose. [1995 c.422 §1a; 2001 c.904 §16; 2007 c.688 §1]

 

      419C.005 Jurisdiction. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 137.707, the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and who has committed an act that is a violation, or that if done by an adult would constitute a violation, of a law or ordinance of the United States or a state, county or city.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not prevent a court of competent jurisdiction from entertaining a civil action or suit involving a youth.

      (3) The court does not have jurisdiction as provided in subsection (1) of this section after a minor has been emancipated pursuant to ORS 419B.550 to 419B.558.

      (4) The court’s jurisdiction over a person under this section or ORS 419C.067 continues until one of the following occurs:

      (a) The court dismisses a petition filed under this chapter or waives the case under ORS 419C.340. If jurisdiction is based on a previous adjudication, then dismissal or waiver of a later case does not terminate jurisdiction under the previous case unless the court so orders.

      (b) The court transfers jurisdiction of the case as provided in ORS 419C.053, 419C.056 and 419C.059.

      (c) The court enters an order terminating jurisdiction.

      (d) The person becomes 25 years of age.

      (e) The court places the person under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board as provided in ORS 419C.529. If the court also has jurisdiction over the person based on a previous adjudication under this chapter or ORS chapter 419B, placing a person under the jurisdiction of the board in a later case does not terminate wardship under the previous case unless the court so orders. [1993 c.33 §149; 1995 c.422 §73; 2003 c.396 §98; 2005 c.843 §7]

 

      419C.007 Suspension or revocation of driving privileges. If a juvenile court finds a youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court under ORS 419C.005 because the youth committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute an offense that is a ground for suspension or revocation of driving privileges upon conviction of the offense, the order of the court finding the youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court constitutes a ground for suspension or revocation of the youth’s driving privileges. [2008 c.49 §2]

 

      419C.010 Extradition. (1) The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to a youth who, while under the age of 18 years, commits an act which is a violation, or which if done by an adult would constitute a violation, of a law or ordinance of this state or any of its political subdivisions, punishable by imprisonment, and thereafter flees from this state.

      (2) The youth described in subsection (1) of this section may be proceeded against in the manner provided in ORS 133.743 to 133.857.

      (3) Upon the return of the youth described in subsection (1) of this section to this state by extradition or otherwise, any proceedings against the youth shall be commenced in the same manner as provided in this chapter.

      (4) If a youth described in subsection (1) of this section has fled to a state which has adopted the Rendition Amendment to the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, the return of the youth shall be sought in accordance with the provisions of that compact. [1993 c.33 §150]

 

      419C.013 Venue. (1) A juvenile proceeding based on allegations of jurisdiction under ORS 419C.005 shall commence in either the county where the youth resides or the county in which the alleged act was committed.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 34.320, an application for a writ of habeas corpus brought by or on behalf of a person who has been committed or placed in a youth correction facility which attacks the validity of the order of commitment shall be brought in the county in which the court that entered the order of commitment is located. [1993 c.33 §151; 1995 c.422 §73a]

 

      419C.020 Notice to parents or guardian of youth; when given; contents. (1) At the first appearance by the parents or guardian of a youth before the court, the court shall inform the parents or guardian verbally and provide a standard notice describing:

      (a) The obligation of the parents or guardian to pay for compensation and reasonable expenses for counsel for the youth, support of the youth while the youth is in the custody of a state-financed or state-supported residence and any other obligations to pay money that may arise as a result of the youth being within the jurisdiction of the court;

      (b) The assignment of support rights under ORS 419C.597;

      (c) The right of the parents or guardian to appeal a decision on jurisdiction or disposition made by the court; and

      (d) The time for filing an appeal of a decision by the court.

      (2) The Oregon Youth Authority shall prepare and provide the standard notice required under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The court shall place a notation in the record of the case of the date that the parents or guardian were provided information under this section. [1997 c.748 §4; 2003 c.396 §99]

 

      419C.025 Appearance by telephone or closed-circuit television. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, when a person is directed to appear before the court in a proceeding under this chapter, the person may appear by telephone or closed-circuit television as long as all parties having an interest in the proceeding have access to the telephone or television circuit used for the appearance and as long as the appearance is made publicly audible within the courtroom of the court under whose authority the hearing is held.

      (2) A person may not appear before the court as provided in subsection (1) of this section if:

      (a) The proceeding is a contested adjudication;

      (c) The proceeding is a contested dispositional hearing;

      (d) The person has been issued a summons under ORS 419C.306 (2); or

      419C.050 Transfer to juvenile court from another court. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 137.707, if during the pendency of a proceeding involving an allegation of a crime in any court other than a juvenile court it is ascertained that the age of the person who is the subject of the proceeding is such that the matter is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile court, it is the duty of the court in which the proceeding is pending to transfer the proceeding to the juvenile court of the county in which the proceeding is pending. The clerk of the court transferring the proceeding shall notify the clerk of the juvenile court of the transfer. [1993 c.33 §152; 1995 c.422 §73b; 2017 c.252 §20]

      (b) The residence of the youth changes during the proceeding; or

      (c) The youth has been adjudicated to be within the jurisdiction of the court under ORS 419C.005 (1), and other proceedings involving the youth are pending in the county of the youth’s residence.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if a youth has no ascertainable residence in any county in this state, the court of the county wherein a proceeding is initiated may adjudicate any petition under ORS 419C.005 (1). [1993 c.33 §153; 1995 c.422 §73c; 2017 c.252 §21]

 

      419C.056 Transfer of jurisdiction by court in county of youth’s residence.

      (1) The court may hear, determine and dispose of the case in its entirety; or

      (B) Is advised that the court of the other county will accept jurisdiction of the case.

      (2) The cost of administering probation or protective supervision of the youth shall be paid by the county accepting jurisdiction under subsection (1)(b) of this section, unless the transferring and receiving counties otherwise agree.

      (b) When the juvenile court, by order indorsed on the summons as provided in ORS 419C.306 or otherwise, has ordered that the youth be taken into custody.

      (2) In any order issued under subsection (1)(b) of this section that may result in a substitute care placement or detention, the court shall include a written finding describing why it is in the best interests of the youth to be taken into custody.

      419C.091 Custody not arrest. (1) Custody under ORS 419C.080 and 419C.088 shall not be deemed an arrest so far as the youth is concerned. All peace officers shall keep a record of youths taken into custody and shall promptly notify the juvenile court or counselor of all youths taken into custody.

      (2) A peace officer taking a youth into custody has all the privileges and immunities of a peace officer making an arrest. [1993 c.33 §161; 1993 c.546 §61; 1997 c.727 §3]

      (2) When the person taking the youth into custody has probable cause to believe that release of the youth may endanger the welfare of the youth, the victim or others.

      (3) When the person taking the youth into custody has probable cause to believe that the youth, while in or on a public building or court facility within the last 120 days, possessed a firearm or destructive device in violation of ORS 166.250, 166.370 or 166.382.

      (4) Where a youth is released or delivered as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court of the county in which the youth resides shall attach from the time the youth is taken into custody.

      (5) The juvenile court may establish, as an alternative to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, that if a youth taken into custody is not released as provided in ORS 419C.100, procedures shall be followed that comply with the following:

      (c) The person taking the youth into custody shall comply with the direction of the person appointed by the court to effect disposition. [1993 c.33 §165; 1993 c.546 §65; 1997 c.727 §7; 1999 c.577 §5; 1999 c.1095 §15]

      (d) If the court orders that the hearing be continued and that the youth remain in detention under paragraph (c) of this subsection, in addition to and not in lieu of any other order the court may make, the court may order a mental health assessment or screening of the youth.

      (e) If the court determines that the youth should not be detained pending adjudication on the merits, the court may order any other preadjudication disposition authorized. [1993 c.33 §169; 1993 c.546 §67; 1995 c.422 §73d; 1999 c.577 §6; 1999 c.1095 §16]

      (2) In order to detain a person under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall make case-specific findings at a hearing under ORS 419C.145 that placement in a jail or other place where adults are detained meets the specific needs of the person alleged to be within the jurisdiction of the court.

If the victim requests, the district attorney or juvenile department shall notify the victim of the review hearing. [1993 c.33 §175; 2003 c.687 §12; 2007 c.609 §16]

 

      419C.156 Detention of runaway from another state. Notwithstanding ORS 419C.145 (1) and (2), the court may order the detention of a youth who resides in another state if the court makes written findings that there is probable cause to believe that the youth has run away from home or from a placement and that describe why it is in the best interests of the youth to be placed in detention. If a youth is ordered detained under this section, the court shall make such orders as are necessary to cause the youth to be immediately returned to the youth’s state of residence. [1993 c.33 §176; 2001 c.686 §11]

 

      419C.159 Escape; punishment.

[1993 c.33 §177]

 

SHELTER HEARINGS

 

      419C.170 Time limitations on shelter care. No youth shall be held in shelter care more than 36 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and judicial holidays, except on order of the court made pursuant to a hearing under ORS 419C.145, 419C.150, 419C.153 and 419C.156.

      (3) At the hearing:

      (a) The court shall make a written finding as to whether reasonable efforts have been made, considering the circumstances of the youth’s conduct, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the youth from the home;

      (b) In determining whether a youth shall be removed or continued out of the home, the court shall consider whether the provision of reasonable and available services can prevent or eliminate the need to remove the youth from the home; and

      (c) The court shall make a written finding in every order of removal that it is in the best interest of the youth and the community that the youth be removed from the home or continued in care. [1993 c.33 §179; 1993 c.295 §6; 1993 c.546 §131; 1999 c.92 §1; 2007 c.609 §17]

 

      419C.176 Conditional release by court.

COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL

 

      419C.200 Court-appointed counsel for youth; waiver. (1)(a) When a petition is filed under ORS 419C.005, the court:

      (A) Shall appoint counsel to represent the youth at all stages of the proceeding if the offense alleged in the petition is classified as a crime.

      (B) Shall appoint counsel for the youth at any proceeding concerning an order of probation.

      (C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, shall appoint counsel for the youth in any case in which the youth would be entitled to appointed counsel if the youth were an adult charged with the same offense.

      (D) May appoint counsel for the youth in any other proceeding under ORS 419C.005.

      (b) Appointment of counsel under this subsection requires the court’s determination that the youth or the youth’s parents or guardians are without sufficient financial means to employ suitable counsel possessing the skills and experience commensurate with the nature of the petition and the complexity of the case under the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission.

      (c) The court may not substitute one appointed counsel for another except pursuant to the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission.

      (2)(a) A court may not accept a waiver of counsel by a youth except under the following circumstances:

      (A) The youth is at least 16 years of age;

      (B) The youth has met with and been advised regarding the right to counsel by counsel who has been appointed by the court or retained on behalf of the youth;

      (C) A written waiver, signed by both the youth and the youth’s counsel, is filed with the court; and

      (D) A hearing is held on the record where the youth’s counsel appears and the court, after consulting with the youth, finds the waiver was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made and not unduly influenced by the interests of others, including the interests of the youth’s parents or guardians.

      (b) This subsection does not apply to a youth entering into a formal accountability agreement under ORS 419C.230.

      (3) Upon presentation of the order of appointment under this section by the counsel for the youth, any agency, hospital, school organization, division or department of the state, doctor, nurse or other health care provider, psychologist, psychiatrist, police department or mental health clinic shall permit the counsel to inspect and copy any records of the youth or youths involved in the case, without the consent of the youth or youths or parents. This subsection does not apply to records of a police agency relating to an ongoing investigation prior to charging. [1993 c.33 §182; 1993 c.234 §2; 1993 c.546 §68; 2001 c.962 §49; 2003 c.449 §§12,48; 2017 c.389 §1]

 

      419C.203 Payment for compensation of counsel. (1) When the court appoints counsel to represent a youth, it may order the youth, if able, parent, if able, or guardian of the estate, if the estate is able, to pay to the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, through the clerk of the court, in full or in part the administrative costs of determining the ability of the youth, parents or estate to pay for legal services and the costs of the legal and other services that are related to the provision of appointed counsel.

      (2) The test of the youth’s, parent’s or estate’s ability to pay costs under subsection (1) of this section is the same test as applied to appointment of counsel for defendants under ORS 135.050 or under the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines adopted under ORS 151.216. If counsel is provided at state expense, the court shall apply this test in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.485.

      (3) If counsel is provided at state expense, the court shall determine the amount the youth, parents or estate is required to pay for the costs of administrative, legal and other services related to the provision of appointed counsel in the same manner as this amount is determined under ORS 151.487.

      (4) In determining whether to order the youth to pay costs under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall also consider the reformative effect of having the youth pay. The court may order that a portion of any moneys earned by the youth in juvenile work projects be used to pay costs ordered under subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) The court’s order of payment is enforceable in the same manner as an order of support under ORS 419C.600. [1993 c.33 §183; 1997 c.761 §§7,7a; 2001 c.962 §50; 2003 c.449 §13; 2012 c.107 §47]

[1993 c.33 §184; 2001 c.962 §51; 2003 c.449 §31]

 

      419C.209 Applicability of other laws. Appointment of counsel for the youth or parent is subject to ORS 135.055, 151.216 and 151.219. [1993 c.33 §186; 2001 c.962 §52]

 

EDUCATIONAL SURROGATE

 

      419C.220 Appointment of surrogate. (1) Upon the request of any party, the court shall appoint a surrogate for a youth or youth offender who is temporarily or permanently in the custody of, or committed to, a public or private agency through the action of the juvenile court if:

      (b) The youth or youth offender does not already have a surrogate appointed by a school district or other educational agency; and

      (B) The court entered a subsequent order that:

      (i) The youth or youth offender should be permanently removed from the person’s home, or continued in substitute care, because it was not safe for the youth or youth offender to be returned to the person’s home, and no subsequent order of the court was entered that permitted the youth or youth offender to return to the person’s home before the youth’s or youth offender’s wardship was terminated under ORS 419B.328; or

      (ii) Terminated the person’s parental rights under ORS 419B.500 and 419B.502 to 419B.524. [1993 c.33 §187; 2003 c.396 §100; 2005 c.662 §15; 2011 c.194 §9]

The duties and responsibilities of the surrogate shall continue until whichever of the following occurs first:

      (1) The youth offender is 21 years of age;

      (2) The youth offender is determined to be no longer eligible for special education; or

FORMAL ACCOUNTABILITY AGREEMENTS

 

      419C.230 Formal accountability agreements; when appropriate; consultation with victim. (1) A formal accountability agreement may be entered into when a youth has been referred to a county juvenile department, and a juvenile department counselor has probable cause to believe that the youth may be found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for one or more acts specified in ORS 419C.005.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, unless authorized by the district attorney, a formal accountability agreement may not be entered into when the youth:

      (a) Is alleged to have committed an act that if committed by an adult would constitute:

      (A) A felony sex offense under ORS 163.355, 163.365, 163.375, 163.385, 163.395, 163.405, 163.408, 163.411, 163.425 or 163.427; or

      (b) Is being referred to the county juvenile department for a second or subsequent time for commission of an act that if committed by an adult would constitute a felony.

      (3) The juvenile department must consult the victim before entering into a formal accountability agreement if:

      (a) The victim has requested consultation in plea negotiations; and

      (b) The formal accountability agreement involves an alleged act that if committed by an adult would constitute a violent felony. [1993 c.33 §189; 1995 c.422 §74; 1999 c.577 §8; 2007 c.609 §19]

 

      419C.233 Nature of agreement. A formal accountability agreement is a voluntary contract between a youth described in ORS 419C.230 and a juvenile department whereby the youth agrees to fulfill certain conditions in exchange for not having a petition filed against the youth. [1993 c.33 §190; 1995 c.422 §123]

 

      419C.236 Agreement may require counseling, community service, education, treatment or training; restitution. (1) A formal accountability agreement may require participation in or referral to counseling, a period of community service, drug or alcohol education or treatment, vocational training or any other legal activity which in the opinion of the counselor would be beneficial to the youth.

      (2) A formal accountability agreement may require that the youth make restitution to any person who was physically injured or who suffered loss of or damage to property as a result of the conduct alleged. Before setting the amount of restitution, the juvenile department shall consult with the victim concerning the amount of damage. Restitution does not limit or impair the right of a victim to sue in a civil action for damages suffered, nor shall the fact of consultation by the victim be admissible in such civil action to prove consent or agreement by the victim. However, the court shall credit any restitution paid by the youth to a victim against any judgment in favor of the victim in such civil action. [1993 c.33 §191; 1995 c.422 §124]

 

      419C.237 Agreement may require mental health evaluation. If a youth enters into a formal accountability agreement under ORS 419C.230, and a juvenile department counselor has probable cause to believe that the youth may be found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for an act that would be a violation of ORS 167.315, 167.320, 167.322 or 167.333 if done by an adult, the agreement may provide for the youth to undergo psychiatric, psychological or mental health evaluation and, if warranted by the mental condition of the youth, undergo appropriate care or treatment.

      (b) Be voluntarily entered into by all parties;

      (c) Be revocable by the youth at any time by a written revocation;

      (d) Be revocable by the juvenile department in the event the department has reasonable cause to believe the youth has failed to carry out the terms of the formal accountability agreement or has committed a subsequent offense;

      (h) Become part of the youth’s juvenile department record.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the following information contained in a formal accountability agreement under ORS 419C.230 is not confidential and is not exempt from disclosure:

      (a) The name and date of birth of the youth;

      (b) The act alleged; and

      (c) The portion of the agreement providing for the disposition of the youth. [1993 c.33 §192; 1995 c.422 §76; 1995 c.440 §4; 1997 c.615 §1; 2005 c.708 §53; 2009 c.595 §366; 2013 c.591 §8; 2016 c.24 §55; 2017 c.20 §5a; 2017 c.21 §105]

 

      419C.242 Revocation and modification of agreement. (1) If a formal accountability agreement is revoked pursuant to ORS 419C.239, the juvenile department shall either extend the agreement pursuant to subsection (2) of this section or file a petition with the juvenile court, and an adjudicatory hearing may be held.

      (2) If the juvenile department has reasonable cause to believe that the youth has failed to carry out the terms of the formal accountability agreement or has committed a subsequent offense, in lieu of revoking the agreement, the department may modify the terms of the agreement and extend the period of the agreement for an additional six months from the date on which the modification was made with the consent of the youth and the youth’s counsel, if any. The period of a formal accountability agreement may be extended only once under this subsection. [1993 c.33 §193; 1995 c.422 §125]

 

      419C.245 Right to counsel; waiver. (1) The juvenile department counselor shall inform, in writing, a youth and the youth’s parents or guardians of the youth’s right to counsel and to appointed counsel at state expense, if the youth is determined to be financially eligible under the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission. The right to counsel shall attach prior to the youth’s entering into a formal accountability agreement.

      (2) The youth may waive the right to counsel prior to the youth’s entering into a formal accountability agreement, provided that:

      (a) The youth’s juvenile department counselor has advised the youth of the youth’s right to counsel, in writing; and

      (b) The waiver is in writing, signed by the youth and presented to the youth’s juvenile department counselor. [1993 c.33 §194; 1995 c.422 §126; 2001 c.962 §84; 2003 c.449 §14; 2017 c.389 §2]

      419C.261 Amendment and dismissal of petition. (1) The court, on motion of an interested party or on its own motion, may at any time direct that the petition be amended. If the amendment results in a substantial departure from the facts originally alleged, the court shall grant such continuance as the interests of justice may require.

      419C.276 Disclosure of personal identifiers of victim or witness; advice of rights prior to interview or deposition; prohibited contact with victim or witness; effect of threats or intimidation. (1)(a) Unless authorized by the court to disclose the information, the attorney of a youth or youth offender, or an agent of the attorney, may not disclose to the youth or youth offender personal identifiers of a victim or witness.

      (b) The court shall order the attorney, or agent of the attorney, to disclose to the youth or youth offender the personal identifiers of a victim or witness if the court finds that:

      (A) The attorney of the youth or youth offender has requested the district attorney or the juvenile department to disclose the information to the youth or youth offender;

      (B) The district attorney or the juvenile department has refused to disclose the information to the youth or youth offender; and

      (C) The need for the information cannot reasonably be met by other means.

      (2) If contacted by the attorney of the youth or youth offender, an agent of the youth or youth offender, or an agent of the attorney of the youth or youth offender, a victim must be clearly informed by the attorney or agent, either in person or in writing:

      (a) Of the identity and capacity of the person contacting the victim;

      (b) That the victim does not have to talk to the attorney or agent, or provide other discovery unless the victim wishes; and

      (c) That the victim may have a representative of the state present during any interview.

      (3) Unless the victim consents after receiving a full advice of rights as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a victim may not be required to be interviewed or deposed by or give discovery to the youth or youth offender or the attorney for the youth or youth offender, or an agent of the attorney or youth or youth offender. This subsection does not prohibit the youth or youth offender from:

      (a) Subpoenaing or examining the victim in a proceeding when the purpose is other than for discovery; or

      (b) Subpoenaing books, papers or documents as provided in ORS 136.580.

      (4) Any preadjudication release order must prohibit any contact with the victim, either directly or indirectly, unless specifically authorized by the court. This subsection does not limit contact by the attorney for the youth or youth offender, or an agent of the attorney, other than the youth or youth offender, in the manner set forth in subsection (2) of this section.

      (5)(a) If a victim notifies the district attorney or juvenile department that the youth or youth offender, by direct or indirect contact, threatened or intimidated the victim, the district attorney or juvenile department shall notify the court and the attorney for the youth or youth offender. If the youth or youth offender is not in custody and the court finds there is probable cause to believe the victim has been threatened or intimidated by the youth or youth offender, by direct or indirect contact, the court shall immediately issue an order to show cause why the release status should not be revoked.

      (b) After conducting a hearing as the court deems appropriate, if the court finds that the victim has been threatened or intimidated by the youth or youth offender, by direct or indirect contact, the release status shall be revoked and the youth or youth offender shall be held in detention until conditions of release sufficient to ensure the safety of the victim and the community can be implemented.

      (c) In any hearing convened under this subsection, the victim has the right to be notified in advance of the hearing, to appear personally at the hearing and, if present, to express any views relevant to the issues before the court.

      (6)(a) For purposes of subsections (4) and (5) of this section, “contact” has the meaning given that term in ORS 163.730.

      (b) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, “personal identifiers” means a person’s address, telephone number, Social Security number and date of birth and the identifying number of a person’s depository account at a financial institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, or credit card account. [2007 c.609 §3; 2009 c.113 §1]

[1993 c.546 §73; 1997 c.873 §22; 2001 c.214 §2; 2001 c.962 §85; 2003 c.396 §§102,103; 2005 c.843 §8; 2015 c.155 §6]

 

SUMMONS

 

      419C.300 Time limits on issuance of summons. Promptly after the petition is filed, there shall be an investigation of the circumstances concerning the youth. No later than 60 days after the petition is filed, summons may be issued. [1993 c.33 §202]

 

      419C.303 Form of summons; content. The summons shall be signed by a counselor or some other person acting under the direction of the court and shall contain the name of the court, the title of the proceeding and, except for a published summons, a brief statement of the substance of the facts required by ORS 419C.255 (1)(b). The summons shall also include a notice that the parent or other person legally obligated to support the youth may be required to pay, at some future date, for all or a portion of the support of the youth, including the cost of out-of-home placement, depending upon the ability of the parent to pay support. [1993 c.33 §203; 1993 c.546 §94]

 

      419C.306 Effect of summons; to whom issued. (1) The summons shall require the person or persons who have physical custody of the youth to appear and bring the youth before the court at the time and place stated in the summons. The time for the hearing on the petition shall be fixed at a reasonable time, not less than 24 hours, after the issuance of the summons. If it appears to the court that the welfare of the youth or of the public requires that the youth immediately be taken into custody, the court may indorse an order on the summons as provided in ORS 419C.080 (2) directing the officer serving it to take the youth into custody.

      (2)(a) Summons shall be issued to the legal parents of the youth, without regard to who has legal or physical custody of the youth, and to the legal guardians, if any, of the youth.

      (b) Parents or guardians summoned pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection shall appear personally pursuant to the summons. Following the initial appearance, parents or guardians shall appear as directed by the court.

      (c) An employer may not discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate or coerce any employee by reason of the employee’s attendance at a juvenile court hearing as required under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (d) This subsection may not be construed to alter or affect an employer’s policies or agreements with employees concerning employees’ wages during times when an employee attends a juvenile court hearing under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (3) If the youth is 12 years of age or older, a certified copy of the summons shall be served upon the youth. If the petition alleges that the youth is within the jurisdiction of the court for having violated ORS 471.430, the summons must contain a statement that, if the youth fails to appear as required in the summons, the driving privileges of the youth are subject to suspension under ORS 419C.472.

      (4) Summons may be issued requiring the appearance of any person whose presence the court deems necessary. When a summons is issued to a youth pursuant to a petition alleging jurisdiction under ORS 419C.005, a copy of the summons shall be mailed to all victims whose names appear on the petition pursuant to ORS 419C.255 (2). The copy of the summons shall be accompanied by a notice that the victim may be present for the youth’s appearance before the court and is entitled to request and receive notification of future hearings before the court in regard to the particular case. The copy of the summons shall also be accompanied by a notice informing the victim of the provisions of ORS 30.765. [1993 c.33 §204; 1993 c.546 §74; 1999 c.965 §1; 2001 c.686 §12; 2001 c.817 §7; 2003 c.687 §13]

 

      419C.309 Service of summons or other process. Summonses or other process issuing from the juvenile court may be served without further indorsement in any county of the state by an officer of the county in which the proceeding is pending, by an officer of the county in which the person to be served is found or by any person authorized by the court to serve the process. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of law or the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to summonses in civil cases apply to summonses issued from juvenile court. [1993 c.33 §205]

 

      419C.312 Alternate service. (1) If any parent or guardian required to be summoned as provided in ORS 419C.306 cannot be found within the state, a summons may be served on the parent or guardian in any of the following ways:

      (a) If the address of the parent or guardian is known, by sending the parent or guardian a copy of the summons by registered or certified mail with a return receipt to be signed by the addressee only.

      (b) By personal service outside the state.

      (2) Service as provided in this section and ORS 419C.309 shall vest the court with jurisdiction over the parents or guardian in the same manner and to the same extent as if the person served were served personally within this state. [1993 c.33 §206; 1993 c.546 §75]

 

      419C.315 Travel expenses of party summoned. The court may authorize payment of travel expenses of any party summoned. Except as provided in this section, responsibility for the payment of the cost of service of summons or other process on any party, and for payment of travel expenses so authorized, shall be borne by the party issuing the summons or requesting the court to issue the summons. When the Oregon Youth Authority issues the summons or requests the court to issue the summons, responsibility for such payment shall be borne by the county. [1993 c.33 §207]

 

      419C.317 Compliance with summons. No person required to appear as provided in ORS 419C.306 shall without reasonable cause fail to appear or, where directed in the summons, to bring the youth before the court. [1993 c.33 §208]

 

      419C.320 When arrest warrant for summoned person authorized. If the summons cannot be served, if the person to whom the summons is directed fails to obey it or if it appears to the court that the summons will be ineffectual, the court may direct issuance of a warrant of arrest against the person summoned or against the youth. [1993 c.33 §209]

 

      419C.323 Proceeding when summoned party not before court. If the youth is before the court, the court has jurisdiction to proceed with the case notwithstanding the failure to serve summons upon any person required to be served by ORS 419C.300, 419C.303 and 419C.306, except that:

      (1) No order for support as provided in ORS 419C.590, 419C.592, 419C.595 and 419C.597 may be entered against a person unless that person is served as provided in ORS 419C.309.

      (2) If it appears to the court that a parent or guardian required to be served by ORS 419C.300, 419C.303 and 419C.306 was not served as provided in ORS 419C.309, 419C.312 and 419C.315, or was served on such short notice that the parent or guardian did not have a reasonable opportunity to appear at the time fixed, the court shall, upon petition by the parent or guardian, reopen the case for full consideration. [1993 c.33 §210]

 

WAIVER

 

      419C.340 Authority to waive youth to adult court. In the circumstances set forth in ORS 419C.349, 419C.352, 419C.364, 419C.367 and 419C.370, the court may waive the youth to the appropriate court handling criminal actions, or to municipal court. [1993 c.33 §211; 1993 c.546 §76]

 

      419C.343 Depositions. (1) After the commencement of any proceeding in which a motion to waive has been filed, a party may move the court for an order allowing the taking of a deposition to perpetuate the testimony of a witness who is:

      (a) Outside of the jurisdiction of, or otherwise not subject to the process of, the court; or

      (b) Unable to attend because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or undue hardship.

      (2) The affidavit in support of the motion to take a deposition to perpetuate testimony, in addition to setting forth the reasons described in subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section, shall also set forth:

      (a) The reasons why the testimony of the witness sought to be deposed cannot be taken by telephone at the time of the hearing;

      (b) Where the deposition is to be taken;

      (c) The manner of recording the deposition; and

      (d) A brief statement of the substance of the testimony that the witness is expected to give.

      (3) If the court finds that taking a deposition will best promote the just, speedy and inexpensive resolution of one or more issues in the proceeding or that taking a deposition is necessary to meet the requirements of due process, the court shall grant the motion.

      (4) If the motion is granted, the court may, in its discretion, set conditions regarding the time, place and method of taking the deposition.

      (5) All objections to any testimony or evidence taken at the deposition shall be made at the time and noted upon the record. The court before which the testimony is offered shall rule on any objections before the testimony is offered. Any objection not made at the deposition is waived. [1993 c.546 §81]

 

      419C.346 Juvenile court’s retention of authority over parent. If the juvenile court waives a youth to another court under ORS 419C.349, 419C.355 and 419C.370 for disposition as an adult, the juvenile court nevertheless may retain jurisdiction over the youth’s parents or guardians under ORS 419C.570. However, if the court enters an order of waiver under ORS 419C.364, jurisdiction over the parents or guardians under ORS 419C.570 shall terminate. [1993 c.33 §212; 1993 c.546 §77]

 

      419C.349 Grounds for waiving youth to adult court. The juvenile court, after a hearing except as otherwise provided in ORS 419C.364 or 419C.370, may waive a youth to a circuit, justice or municipal court of competent jurisdiction for prosecution as an adult if:

      (1) The youth is 15 years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged offense;

      (2) The youth, except as otherwise provided in ORS 419C.364 and 419C.370, is alleged to have committed a criminal offense constituting:

      (a) Murder under ORS 163.115 or any aggravated form thereof;

      (b) A Class A or Class B felony;

      (c) Any of the following Class C felonies:

      (A) Escape in the second degree under ORS 162.155;

      (B) Assault in the third degree under ORS 163.165;

      (C) Coercion under ORS 163.275 (1)(a);

      (D) Arson in the second degree under ORS 164.315; or

      (E) Robbery in the third degree under ORS 164.395;

      (d) Any Class C felony in which the youth used or threatened to use a firearm; or

      (e) Any other felony or any misdemeanor if the youth and the state stipulate to the waiver;

      (3) The youth at the time of the alleged offense was of sufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved; and

      (4) The juvenile court, after considering the following criteria, determines by a preponderance of the evidence that retaining jurisdiction will not serve the best interests of the youth and of society and therefore is not justified:

      (a) The amenability of the youth to treatment and rehabilitation given the techniques, facilities and personnel for rehabilitation available to the juvenile court and to the criminal court which would have jurisdiction after transfer;

      (b) The protection required by the community, given the seriousness of the offense alleged;

      (c) The aggressive, violent, premeditated or willful manner in which the offense was alleged to have been committed;

      (d) The previous history of the youth, including:

      (A) Prior treatment efforts and out-of-home placements; and

      (B) The physical, emotional and mental health of the youth;

      (e) The youth’s prior record of acts which would be crimes if committed by an adult;

      (f) The gravity of the loss, damage or injury caused or attempted during the offense;

      (g) The prosecutive merit of the case against the youth; and

      (h) The desirability of disposing of all cases in one trial if there were adult co-offenders. [1993 c.33 §213; 1993 c.546 §78; 1999 c.951 §1; 2003 c.404 §1]

 

      419C.352 Grounds for waiving youth under 15 years of age. The juvenile court, after a hearing, except as provided in ORS 419C.364 or 419C.370, may waive a youth under 15 years of age at the time the act was committed to circuit court for prosecution as an adult if:

      (1) The youth is represented by counsel during the waiver proceedings;

      (2) The juvenile court makes the findings required under ORS 419C.349 (3) and (4); and

      (3) The youth is alleged to have committed an act or acts that if committed by an adult would constitute one or more of the following crimes:

      (a) Murder or any aggravated form thereof under ORS 163.095 or 163.115;

      (b) Rape in the first degree under ORS 163.375 (1)(a);

      (c) Sodomy in the first degree under ORS 163.405 (1)(a); or

      (d) Unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree under ORS 163.411 (1)(a). [1993 c.33 §214; 1993 c.546 §79; 1995 c.422 §78]

 

      419C.355 Written findings required. The juvenile court shall make a specific, detailed, written finding of fact to support any determination under ORS 419C.349 (3) and (4). [1993 c.33 §215]

 

      419C.358 Consolidation of nonwaivable and waivable charges. When a person is waived for prosecution as an adult, the person shall be waived only on the actual charges justifying the waiver under ORS 419C.349 (2) or 419C.352, as the case may be. Any nonwaivable charges arising out of the same act or transaction as the waivable charge shall be consolidated with the waivable charge for purposes of conducting the adjudicatory hearing on the nonwaivable charges. [1993 c.33 §216; 1993 c.546 §82]

 

      419C.361 Disposition of nonwaivable consolidated charges and lesser included offenses. (1) Notwithstanding that the juvenile court has waived the case under ORS 419C.349, 419C.352, 419C.355, 419C.358, 419C.364, 419C.367 and 419C.370, the court of waiver shall return the case to the juvenile court unless an accusatory instrument is filed in the court of waiver alleging, in the case of a person under 16 years of age, a crime listed in ORS 419C.352 or, in the case of any other person, a crime listed in ORS 419C.349 (2). Also in the case of a waived person, when a trial has been held in the court of waiver upon an accusatory instrument alleging a crime listed in ORS 419C.349 (2) or 419C.352, as the case may be, and the person is found guilty of any lesser included offense that is not itself a waivable offense, the trial court shall not sentence the defendant therein, but the trial court shall order a presentence report to be made in the case, shall set forth in a memorandum such observations as the court may make regarding the case and shall then return the case to the juvenile court in order that the juvenile court make disposition in the case based upon the guilty finding in the court of waiver. Disposition shall be as if the juvenile court itself had found the youth to be in its jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 419C.005. The records and consequences of the case shall, in all respects, be as if the juvenile court itself had found the youth to be in its jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 419C.005. When the person is found guilty of a nonwaivable charge that was consolidated with a waivable charge under ORS 419C.358, the case shall be returned to the juvenile court for disposition as provided in this subsection for lesser included offenses.

      (2) Nothing in this section or ORS 419C.358 applies to a waiver under ORS 419C.364 or 419C.370. [1993 c.33 §217; 1993 c.546 §83]

 

      419C.364 Waiver of future cases. After the juvenile court has entered an order waiving a youth to an adult court under ORS 419C.349, the court may, if the youth is 16 years of age or older, enter a subsequent order providing that in all future cases involving the same youth, the youth shall be waived to the appropriate court without further proceedings under ORS 419C.349 and 419C.370. [1993 c.33 §218; 1993 c.546 §84]

 

      419C.367 Vacating order waiving future cases. The juvenile court may at any time direct that the subsequent order entered under ORS 419C.364 be vacated or that a pending case be waived to the juvenile court for further proceedings. The court may make such a direction on any case but shall do so and require a pending case to be waived to the juvenile court if it cannot support the finding required under ORS 419C.355. The juvenile court shall direct that the subsequent order entered under ORS 419C.364 shall be vacated when the youth is not convicted in the waived case that preceded the order under ORS 419C.364. [1993 c.33 §219; 1993 c.546 §85; 1995 c.79 §216]

 

      419C.370 Waiver of motor vehicle, boating, game, violation and property cases. (1) The juvenile court may enter an order directing that all cases involving:

      (a) Violation of a law or ordinance relating to the use or operation of a motor vehicle, boating laws or game laws be waived to criminal or municipal court;

      (b) An offense classified as a violation under the laws of this state or a political subdivision of this state be waived to municipal court if the municipal court has agreed to accept jurisdiction; and

      (c) A misdemeanor that entails theft, destruction, tampering with or vandalism of property be waived to municipal court if the municipal court has agreed to accept jurisdiction.

      (2) Cases waived under subsection (1) of this section are subject to the following:

      (a) That the criminal or municipal court prior to hearing a case, other than a case involving a parking violation, in which the defendant is or appears to be under 18 years of age notify the juvenile court of that fact; and

      (b) That the juvenile court may direct that any such case be waived to the juvenile court for further proceedings.

      (3)(a) When a person who has been waived under subsection (1)(c) of this section is convicted of a property offense, the municipal court may impose any sanction authorized for the offense except for incarceration. The municipal court shall notify the juvenile court of the disposition of the case.

      (b) When a person has been waived under subsection (1) of this section and fails to appear as summoned or is placed on probation and is alleged to have violated a condition of the probation, the juvenile court may recall the case to the juvenile court for further proceedings. When a person has been returned to juvenile court under this paragraph, the juvenile court may proceed as though the person had failed to appear as summoned to the juvenile court or had violated a juvenile court probation order under ORS 419C.446.

      (4) Records of cases waived under subsection (1)(c) of this section are juvenile records for purposes of expunction under ORS 419A.260. [1993 c.33 §220; 1993 c.546 §86; 1995 c.481 §1; 1999 c.158 §1; 1999 c.615 §1; 2003 c.396 §104]

 

      419C.372 Handling of motor vehicle, boating or game cases not requiring waiver. If the youth’s conduct consists, or is alleged to consist, of a violation of a law or ordinance relating to the use or operation of a motor vehicle, boating laws or game laws and it appears to the court that the nature of the offense and the youth’s background are such that a proceeding as provided in this chapter is not warranted, the court may handle:

      (1) Cases involving boating laws or game laws as provided in ORS 419C.374.

      (2) Cases involving the use or operation of a motor vehicle as provided under ORS 809.412. [1993 c.33 §221; 1993 c.546 §95]

 

      419C.374 Alternative conduct of proceedings involving traffic, boating and game cases. (1) A petition relating to boating or game offenses shall be filed as provided in ORS 419C.250, 419C.255 and 419C.258. Motor vehicle offenses are subject to ORS 809.412.

      (2) Summons as provided in ORS 419C.300 shall be issued to the parent or other person having physical custody of the youth, requiring the parent or other person to appear with the youth before the court at the time and place stated in the summons.

      (3) The summons may be served as provided in ORS 419C.309, 419C.312 and 419C.315 or by mailing a copy thereof to the parent or other person having physical custody of the youth. If the summons is served personally, a warrant may be issued as provided in ORS 419C.320.

      (4) A hearing shall be held as provided in ORS 419C.142, 419C.280 and 419C.400. At the termination of the hearing, if the court finds the matters alleged in the petition to be true, it may enter an order finding the youth to be a:

      (a) Youth motor vehicle offender and dispose of the case as provided in ORS 809.412; or

      (b) Youth boating law offender or a game law offender and may dispose of the case as provided in subsection (5) of this section.

      (5) In a proceeding under this chapter, the juvenile court may suspend a hunting or fishing license or permit where a game violation is involved and may make such other recommendations where a boating violation is involved. [1993 c.33 §222; 1995 c.422 §79]

 

FITNESS TO PROCEED

 

(Motion)

 

      419C.378 Motion for finding that youth is unfit to proceed. (1) A court may find that a youth is unfit to proceed in a proceeding initiated by a petition alleging jurisdiction under ORS 419C.005 if, as a result of a qualifying mental disorder or another condition, the youth is unable:

      (a) To understand the nature of the proceedings against the youth;

      (b) To assist and cooperate with the counsel for the youth; or

      (c) To participate in the defense of the youth.

      (2) A court may not find that a youth is unfit to proceed in a proceeding solely because:

      (a) Of the age of the youth;

      (b) Of the current inability of the youth to remember the acts alleged in the petition; or

      (c) Evidence exists that the youth committed the acts alleged in the petition while the youth was under the influence of intoxicants or medication.

      (3) The issue of fitness to proceed must be raised by written motion filed by a party to the proceeding or by the court on its own motion. The motion may be made at any time after the filing of the petition. The court shall stay the proceedings on the petition after the motion is made and may order the youth to participate in an evaluation under ORS 419C.380 to determine the youth’s fitness to proceed if the court determines that:

      (a) There is reason to doubt the youth’s fitness to proceed; and

      (b) There is probable cause to believe that the factual allegations contained in the petition are true.

      (4) The fact that the youth is unfit to proceed does not preclude any objection through counsel and without the personal participation of the youth on the grounds that the petition is insufficient, that the statute of limitations has run, that double jeopardy principles apply or upon any other ground at the discretion of the court that the court deems susceptible of fair determination prior to trial. [2013 c.709 §1; 2017 c.634 §19]

 

      Note: 419C.378 to 419C.398 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 419C or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

A party or the court may submit written information to the evaluator for consideration. When written information that has not been provided to the court or an opposing party is submitted to the evaluator, the party submitting the written information to the evaluator shall provide the written information to the court and the opposing party.

      (2)(a) Upon motion of the youth, or upon the court’s own motion, a court shall determine whether the youth is financially eligible under the policies, procedures, standards and guidelines of the Public Defense Services Commission.

      (b) If a county court or justice court determines that the youth is financially eligible, the court shall order the county to pay the fees and costs described in subsection (3) of this section from funds available for that purpose.

      (c) If a circuit court determines that the youth is financially eligible, the court shall order the public defense services executive director to pay the fees and costs described in subsection (3) of this section from funds available for that purpose.

      (3) If a court determines that a youth is financially eligible under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall order that:

      (a) A reasonable fee be paid to a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist or regulated social worker in private practice who conducts the evaluation; and

      (b) All costs, including transportation of the youth, be paid if the evaluation is conducted by a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist or regulated social worker employed by the Department of Human Services or is conducted by a community mental health program or community developmental disabilities program established under ORS 430.610 to 430.695.

      (4) If an evaluation is ordered under ORS 419C.378 at the request of or with the acquiescence of a youth, and the youth is determined not to be financially eligible under subsection (2) of this section, the evaluation shall be performed at the youth’s expense.

      (5) If an evaluation is ordered under ORS 419C.378 at the request of the district attorney or juvenile department, the county shall pay for the expense of the evaluation.

      (6) After a motion is made by the court or the youth under ORS 419C.378 (3), the state shall have the right to seek an independent evaluation at its own expense.

      (7) A youth may not be removed from the youth’s current placement for the purpose of an evaluation performed under this section unless the youth has been placed in a detention facility as defined in ORS 419A.004 or a youth correction facility as defined in ORS 420.005. [2013 c.709 §2; 2017 c.558 §1]

 

      Note: See note under 419C.378.

 

      419C.382 Duties of Oregon Health Authority; rules. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall:

      (a) Develop training standards for psychiatrists, licensed psychologists and regulated social workers conducting evaluations under ORS 419C.380;

      (b) Develop guidelines for the conduct of evaluations; and

      (c) Provide courts with a current list of qualified evaluators from which an evaluator may be selected. Neither the parties nor the court is required to choose an evaluator from the list provided by the authority, provided that the evaluator chosen is otherwise qualified.

      419C.396 Provision of restorative services; report; review hearing. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall arrange for the provision of or begin providing restorative services within 30 days after receiving a court order under ORS 419C.392 (3). The authority shall send a report to the court, with copies to the parties to the proceeding initiated by a petition alleging jurisdiction under ORS 419C.005, no later than 90 days after receipt of the order.

      (2) Within 14 days after receiving a report under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall determine the youth’s fitness to proceed.

      (3) Upon the recommendation of the authority, the request of a party or the court’s own motion, the court may hold a review hearing concerning the evaluation of the youth’s fitness to proceed at any time during which restorative services are provided pursuant to an order under ORS 419C.392 (3).

      (a) That removal is necessary to provide restorative services under ORS 419C.396;

      (b) That removal is in the best interest of the youth; and

      (c) If the Department of Human Services has custody of the youth, that:

      (B) Reasonable efforts have not been made by the department but reasonable efforts would not have eliminated the need for removal under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.

      (2) If a youth is removed for the purpose of receiving restorative services, the youth shall be returned to the youth’s current placement immediately upon conclusion of the provision of the restorative services unless the youth has been placed in a detention facility as defined in ORS 419A.004 or a youth correction facility as defined in ORS 420.005.

ADJUDICATION

 

      419C.400 Conduct of hearings. (1) The hearing shall be held by the court without a jury and may be continued from time to time.

      (2) The facts alleged in the petition showing the youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court as provided in ORS 419C.005, unless admitted, must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

      (3) If the youth files written notice of intent to rely on the defense set forth in ORS 419C.522, the youth has the burden of proving the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

      (4) For the purpose of determining proper disposition of the youth, testimony, reports or other material relating to the youth’s mental, physical and social history and prognosis may be received by the court without regard to their competency or relevancy under the rules of evidence.

      (5) An adjudication by a juvenile court that a youth is within its jurisdiction is not a conviction of a crime or offense. [1993 c.33 §223; 1993 c.546 §87; 2005 c.843 §9]

 

      419C.405 Witnesses; subpoena. (1) Witnesses or other persons necessary for the conduct of the hearing may be subpoenaed. The youth, parents, guardian or any person appearing in the youth’s behalf may have compulsory attendance of witnesses in the youth’s or their behalf in the same manner as provided in ORS 136.567 to 136.603. The form of the subpoena shall be substantially as provided in ORS 136.575 (4) or (6), but shall describe the action as a “juvenile court proceeding” and the appearance as on behalf of “the court,” “the youth,” and so on, as the case may be.

      (2) In addition to the subpoena available under subsection (1) of this section, when the petition alleges that the youth is within the jurisdiction of the court by reason of a ground set forth in ORS 419C.005, the youth or any person appearing in behalf of the youth or the state may secure the attendance of out-of-state witnesses in the same manner as provided in ORS 136.623 to 136.637. [1993 c.33 §224]

 

      419C.408 Witness fees. Witnesses subpoenaed to give testimony shall receive the same fees as are paid in criminal cases. Except as provided by this section, responsibility for the per diem and mileage fees of any witness, and travel expenses if so ordered by the court, shall be borne by the party who subpoenas the witness or requests the court to subpoena the witness. If the witness was subpoenaed to appear on behalf of the Oregon Youth Authority, responsibility for per diem, mileage fees and travel expenses shall be borne by the county. If the witness was subpoenaed by more than one party, the witness shall be paid by the party who first subpoenas the witness. The court may then, thereafter, order that the costs be distributed equally among all parties who subpoenaed the witness and that the original payor of the costs be reimbursed accordingly. When the witness has been subpoenaed on behalf of a party who is represented by appointed counsel, the fees and costs allowed for that witness shall be paid pursuant to ORS 135.055. [1993 c.33 §225; 2001 c.962 §53]

 

      419C.411 Disposition order; factors to be considered; finding of responsible except for insanity. (1) At the termination of the hearing or hearings in the proceeding or after entry of an order under ORS 419C.067, the court shall enter an appropriate order directing the disposition to be made of the case.

      (2) The court shall find a youth responsible except for insanity if:

      (a) The youth asserted qualifying mental disorder as a defense as provided in ORS 419C.524; and

      (b) The court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that, as a result of a qualifying mental disorder at the time the youth committed the act alleged in the petition, the youth lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the nature and quality of the act or to conform the youth’s conduct to the requirements of law.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (6) and (7) of this section, in determining the disposition of the case, the court shall consider each of the following:

      (a) The gravity of the loss, damage or injury caused or attempted during, or as part of, the conduct that is the basis for jurisdiction under ORS 419C.005;

      (b) Whether the manner in which the youth offender engaged in the conduct was aggressive, violent, premeditated or willful;

      (c) Whether the youth offender was held in detention under ORS 419C.145 and, if so, the reasons for the detention;

      (d) The immediate and future protection required by the victim, the victim’s family and the community; and

      (e) The youth offender’s juvenile court record and response to the requirements and conditions imposed by previous juvenile court orders.

      (4) In addition to the factors listed in subsection (3) of this section, the court may consider the following:

      (a) Whether the youth offender has made any efforts toward reform or rehabilitation or making restitution;

      (b) The youth offender’s educational status and school attendance record;

      (c) The youth offender’s past and present employment;

      (d) The disposition proposed by the youth offender;

      (e) The recommendations of the district attorney and the juvenile court counselor and the statements of the victim and the victim’s family;

      (f) The youth offender’s mental, emotional and physical health and the results of the mental health or substance abuse treatment; and

      (g) Any other relevant factors or circumstances raised by the parties.

      (5) The court’s consideration of matters under this section may be addressed on appeal only if raised by a party at a dispositional hearing or by a motion to modify or set aside under ORS 419C.610.

      (6) When a youth is found responsible except for insanity, the court shall order a disposition under ORS 419C.529 if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time of disposition, the youth:

      (a) Has a serious mental condition; or

      (b) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition and presents a substantial danger to others.

      (7) When a youth is found responsible except for insanity and the court does not make a finding described in subsection (6) of this section, the court may:

      (a) Enter an order finding the youth to be within the court’s jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 and make any disposition authorized by ORS chapter 419B;

      (b) Initiate civil commitment proceedings; or

      (c) Enter an order of discharge. [1993 c.33 §226; 1995 c.422 §80; 2003 c.396 §105; 2005 c.843 §10; 2017 c.634 §21]

If a youth is cited or summoned for violating ORS 471.430, 475B.316 or 475B.341 and fails to appear, the court may adjudicate the citation or petition and enter a disposition without a hearing. [2001 c.904 §14; 2005 c.708 §54; 2013 c.591 §9; 2016 c.24 §56; 2017 c.20 §6a; 2017 c.21 §106]

 

DISPOSITION

 

      419C.440 When court has duties and authority of guardian. Unless guardianship is granted as provided in ORS 419C.555, the court as an incident of its jurisdiction over the youth offender has the duties and authority of the guardian as provided in ORS 419C.558. [1993 c.33 §227; 2003 c.396 §106]

 

      419C.441 Mental health evaluation, care and treatment. A court having jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 419C.005 over a youth offender who commits an act that would be a violation of ORS 167.315, 167.320, 167.322 or 167.333 if done by an adult may, in addition to any other exercise of jurisdiction over the youth offender, order that the youth offender undergo psychiatric, psychological or mental health evaluation. If warranted by the mental condition of the youth offender, the court may order that the youth offender undergo appropriate care or treatment. [2001 c.926 §4; 2003 c.396 §107]

 

      419C.443 [1993 c.33 §228; 1995 c.422 §135; 1995 c.440 §5; 2003 c.396 §108; 2005 c.22 §295; 2005 c.708 §55; 2009 c.595 §367; 2013 c.591 §10; 2016 c.24 §57; 2017 c.21 §107; repealed by 2017 c.20 §10]

 

      419C.446 Probation; requirements. (1) When a court determines it would be in the best interest and welfare of a youth offender, the court may place the youth offender on probation. The court may direct that the youth offender remain in the legal custody of the youth offender’s parents or other person with whom the youth offender is living, or the court may direct that the youth offender be placed in the legal custody of some relative or some person maintaining a foster home approved by the court, or in a child care center or a youth care center authorized to accept the youth offender.

      (2) The court may specify particular requirements to be observed during the probation consistent with recognized juvenile court practice, including but not limited to restrictions on visitation by the youth offender’s parents, restrictions on the youth offender’s associates, occupation and activities, restrictions on and requirements to be observed by the person having the youth offender’s legal custody, requirements for visitation by and consultation with a juvenile counselor or other suitable counselor, requirements to make restitution under ORS 419C.450, requirements of a period of detention under ORS 419C.453, requirements to pay a fine under ORS 419C.459, requirements to pay a supervision fee under ORS 419C.449, requirements to perform community service under ORS 419C.462, or service for the victim under ORS 419C.465, or requirements to submit to blood or buccal testing under ORS 419C.473.

      (3) If the youth offender is a sex offender, as defined in ORS 163A.005, the juvenile department shall notify the chief of police, if the youth offender is going to reside within a city, and the county sheriff of the county in which the youth offender is going to reside of the youth offender’s release on probation and the requirements imposed on the youth offender’s probation under subsection (2) of this section. [1993 c.33 §229; 1993 c.546 §88; 1997 c.725 §1; 1999 c.97 §5; 2001 c.884 §8; 2003 c.396 §109; 2011 c.597 §136]

 

      419C.449 Supervision fee. (1) In determining whether to impose a supervision fee under ORS 419C.446 (2), the court shall consider whether the youth offender or the parent or legal guardian of the youth offender will be able to pay the fee. When a supervision fee is required, the fee shall be determined and fixed by the county juvenile department.

      (2) The county shall collect or provide by contract for the collection of the supervision fee from the youth offender or the parent or legal guardian of the youth offender and shall retain the fee to be used by the county for funding of its juvenile department program. [1997 c.725 §3; 2001 c.485 §2; 2003 c.396 §110]

 

      419C.450 Restitution. (1)(a) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage and promote the payment of restitution and other obligations by youth offenders as well as by adult offenders. In any case within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to ORS 419C.005 in which the youth offender caused another person any physical, emotional or psychological injury or any loss of or damage to property, the victim has the right to receive prompt restitution. The district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to or at the time of adjudication, evidence of the nature and amount of the injury, loss or damage. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered injury, loss or damage, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall:

      (A) Include in the judgment a requirement that the youth offender pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim’s injury, loss or damage as determined by the court; or

      (B) Include in the judgment a requirement that the youth offender pay the victim restitution, and that the specific amount of restitution will be established by a supplemental judgment based upon a determination made by the court within 90 days of entry of the judgment. In the supplemental judgment, the court shall establish a specific amount of restitution that equals the full amount of the victim’s injury, loss or damage as determined by the court. The court may extend the time within which the determination and supplemental judgment may be completed for good cause. The lien, priority of the lien and ability to enforce a specific amount of restitution established under this subparagraph by a supplemental judgment relates back to the date of the original judgment that is supplemented.

      (b) After the district attorney makes a presentation described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the court is unable to find from the evidence presented that a victim suffered injury, loss or damage, the court shall make a finding on the record to that effect.

      (c) No finding made by the court or failure of the court to make a finding under this subsection limits or impairs the rights of a person injured to sue and recover damages in a civil action under subsection (2) of this section.

      (d) The court may order restitution, including but not limited to counseling and treatment expenses, for emotional or psychological injury under this section only:

      (A) When the act that brought the youth offender within the jurisdiction of the court would constitute aggravated murder, murder or a sex crime if committed by an adult; and

      (B) For an injury suffered by the victim or a member of the victim’s family who observed the act.

      (e) If the youth offender will be present at a hearing under this subsection and the victim requests notice, the district attorney or juvenile department shall notify the victim of the hearing.

      (2) Restitution for injury inflicted upon a person by the youth offender, for property taken, damaged or destroyed by the youth offender and for a reward offered by the victim or an organization authorized by the victim and paid for information leading to the apprehension of the youth offender, shall be required as a condition of probation. Restitution does not limit or impair the right of a victim to sue in a civil action for damages suffered, nor shall the fact of consultation by the victim be admissible in such civil action to prove consent or agreement by the victim. However, the court shall credit any restitution paid by the youth offender to a victim against any judgment in favor of the victim in such civil action. Before setting the amount of such restitution, the court shall notify the person upon whom the injury was inflicted or the owner of the property taken, damaged or destroyed and give such person an opportunity to be heard on the issue of restitution.

      (3)(a) If a judgment or supplemental judgment described in subsection (1) of this section includes restitution, a court may delay the enforcement of the monetary sanctions, including restitution, only if the youth offender alleges and establishes to the satisfaction of the court the youth offender’s inability to pay the judgment in full at the time the judgment is entered. If the court finds that the youth offender is unable to pay, the court may establish or allow an appropriate supervising authority to establish a payment schedule. The supervising authority shall be authorized to modify any payment schedule established under this section. In establishing a payment schedule, the court or the supervising authority shall take into consideration:

      (A) The availability to the youth offender of paid employment during such time as the youth offender may be committed to a youth correction facility;

      (B) The financial resources of the youth offender and the burden that payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the youth offender;

      (C) The present and future ability of the youth offender to pay restitution on an installment basis or on other conditions to be fixed by the court; and

      (D) The rehabilitative effect on the youth offender of the payment of restitution and the method of payment.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “supervising authority” means any state or local agency that is authorized to supervise the youth offender.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 419C.501 and 419C.504, when the court has ordered a youth offender to pay restitution, as provided in this section, the judgment shall be entered in the register or docket of the court in the manner provided by ORS chapter 18 and enforced in the manner provided by ORS 18.252 to 18.993. The judgment is in favor of the state and may be enforced only by the state. Notwithstanding ORS 419A.255, a judgment for restitution entered under this subsection is a public record. Judgments entered under this subsection are subject to ORS 18.048.

      (5) A person required to pay restitution under subsection (1) of this section may file a motion supported by an affidavit for satisfaction of the judgment or supplemental judgment requiring payment of restitution in the circuit court of the county in which the original judgment was entered if:

      (a) At least 50 percent of the monetary obligation is satisfied or at least 10 years have passed since the original judgment was entered;

      (b) The person has substantially complied with all established payment plans;

      (c) The person has not been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419C.005 or convicted of an offense since the date the original judgment of restitution was entered; and

      (d) The person has satisfactorily completed any required period of probation or parole for the act for which the judgment of restitution was entered.

      (6) When a person files a motion described in subsection (5) of this section, the district attorney for the county in which the motion was filed shall promptly notify the victim for whose benefit the judgment of restitution was entered that the person has filed the motion and that the victim may object in writing to the motion through the district attorney.

      (7) If the victim does not object to the motion as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing on the motion and may enter an order granting a full or partial satisfaction if the allegations in the affidavit supporting the motion are true and failure to grant the motion would result in an injustice. In determining whether an injustice would result, the court shall take into account:

      (a) The financial resources of the defendant and the burden that continued payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the defendant;

      (b) The ability of the defendant to continue paying restitution on an installment basis or under other conditions to be fixed by the court; and

      (c) The rehabilitative effect on the defendant of the continued payment of restitution and the method of payment.

      (8) A person may file a motion under subsection (5) of this section no more than one time per year for each judgment of restitution entered against the person. [1993 c.33 §230; 1993 c.405 §1; 1995 c.422 §83; 1997 c.313 §32; 1997 c.727 §11; 2001 c.202 §1; 2003 c.576 §214; 2003 c.670 §4; 2007 c.425 §2; 2007 c.609 §22]

 

      419C.453 Detention; when authorized. (1) Pursuant to a hearing, the juvenile court may order a youth offender placed in a detention facility for a specific period of time not to exceed eight days, in addition to time already spent in the facility, unless a program plan that is in conformance with standards established by the Youth Development Council has been filed with and approved by the council, in which case the youth offender may be held in detention for a maximum of 30 days in addition to time already spent in the facility, when:

      (a) The youth offender has been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court by reason of having committed an act that would be a crime if committed by an adult; or

      (b) The youth offender has been placed on formal probation for an act that would be a crime if committed by an adult, and has been found to have violated a condition of that probation.

      (2) Pursuant to a hearing, the juvenile court may order a youth offender who is at least 18 years of age placed in a jail or other place where adults are detained. The placement must be for a specific period of time and may not exceed eight days in addition to time already spent in a juvenile detention facility or jail. The court may order placement under this subsection when:

      (a) The youth offender has been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court by reason of having committed an act that would be a crime if committed by an adult; or

      (b) The youth offender has been placed on formal probation for an act that would be a crime if committed by an adult, and has been found to have violated a condition of that probation.

      (3) In order to detain a youth offender under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall make case-specific findings that placement in a jail or other place where adults are detained meets the specific needs of the youth offender.

      (4) As used in this section, “adult” does not include a person who is 18 years of age or older and is alleged to be, or has been found to be, within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419C.005. [1993 c.33 §231; 2001 c.904 §5; 2001 c.905 §6; 2003 c.396 §111; 2003 c.442 §3; 2005 c.503 §17; 2012 c.37 §61]

 

      419C.456 Detention after escape. Pursuant to a hearing, the juvenile court may order a youth offender 12 years of age or older placed in a detention facility for a specific period of time not to exceed eight days, in addition to time already spent in the facility, when the youth offender has been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court by reason of having escaped from a detention facility, after having been placed in the facility pursuant to the filing of a petition alleging that the youth has committed an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult or the offense described in ORS 419C.159. [1993 c.33 §232; 2003 c.396 §112]

 

      419C.459 Fines. If a youth is found to be within the jurisdiction of the court under ORS 419C.005 by reason of committing an offense or by reason of committing an act that would constitute an offense if committed by an adult, the youth offender is subject to the same fines, including the minimum fines established under ORS 137.286 and 153.021, that are applicable to adults who commit the offense. In determining the amount of the fine, the court shall consider the potential rehabilitative effect of a fine. [1993 c.33 §233; 2003 c.396 §113; 2011 c.597 §21]

 

      419C.461 Disposition for graffiti related offenses. (1) When a youth offender has been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for having committed an act that if committed by an adult would constitute a violation of ORS 164.383 or 164.386 or criminal mischief and the act consisted of defacing property by creating graffiti, the court, in addition to any other disposition, may order the youth offender to perform:

      (a) Personal service, as provided in ORS 419C.465, consisting of removing graffiti; or

      (b) If the victim does not agree to the personal service, community service consisting of removing graffiti at some location other than that defaced by the youth offender.

      (2) In no case shall the youth offender, pursuant to this section, perform more hours of personal or community service than would be indicated by dividing the monetary damage caused by the youth offender by the legal minimum wage.

      (3)(a) When a youth offender has been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for having committed an act that if committed by an adult would constitute a violation of ORS 164.383, the court may find the parent, legal guardian or other person lawfully charged with the care or custody of the youth offender liable for actual damages to person or property caused by the youth offender. However, a parent who is not entitled to legal custody of the youth offender at the time of the act is not liable for the damages.

      (b) The legal obligation of the parent, legal guardian or other person under this subsection may not exceed the liability provided in ORS 30.765.

      (c) The court may, with the consent of the parent, legal guardian or other person, order the parent, legal guardian or other person to complete a parent effectiveness program approved by the court. Upon the parent’s, legal guardian’s or other person’s completion of the program to the satisfaction of the court, the court may dismiss any other penalties imposed upon the parent, legal guardian or other person.

      419C.462 Community service. The court may order a youth offender to perform appropriate community service for a number of hours not to exceed that which could be required under ORS 137.129 if the youth offender were an adult. [1993 c.33 §234; 2003 c.396 §115]

 

      419C.465 Service to victim. Upon agreement of the youth offender, the youth offender’s parent or guardian and the victim of the youth offender’s conduct, the court may order a youth offender to perform personal service for the victim as a condition of probation. Contact with a victim to determine whether the victim is willing to agree to such personal service shall be by a person to be designated by the court and may not be by the youth offender. The victim shall be advised by such person of any prior findings of juvenile court jurisdiction of the youth offender under ORS 419C.005. The court shall specify the nature and length of the service as the court finds appropriate. Personal service performed pursuant to the order shall constitute full or partial satisfaction of any restitution ordered by the court, as provided by agreement prior to the making of the order. However, in no case shall the youth offender, pursuant to this section, perform more hours of personal service than would be indicated by dividing the victim’s monetary loss by the legal minimum wage. [1993 c.33 §235; 2003 c.396 §116]

 

      419C.470 Opportunities to fulfill obligations imposed by court. The Oregon Youth Authority and county juvenile departments, respectively, and to the extent practicable, shall create opportunities for youth offenders placed in the legal custody of the youth authority or under the supervision of a county juvenile department to pay restitution as ordered by the court and to perform any community service ordered by the court, as well as to fulfill any other obligation imposed by the court.

The youth authority or the department may place the youth offender in a youth care center or other facility authorized to accept the youth offender.

      (3) The court may place a youth offender in the legal custody of the department under subsection (1) of this section if:

      (a) The court has determined that a period of out-of-home placement and supervision should be part of the disposition in the case;

      (1) Serves the purposes of and is consistent with the principles of ORS 419C.001;

      (2) Incorporates the perspective of the youth offender and the family; and

      (3) Is integrated with the efforts of other agencies responsible for providing services to the youth offender or the family. [1993 c.33 §240; 1995 c.770 §2; 2003 c.396 §121; 2005 c.159 §1]

 

      419C.489 Condition requiring medical care or special treatment; preparation of plan; progress reports. Whenever a youth offender who is in need of medical care or other special treatment by reason of physical or mental condition is placed in the custody of the Oregon Youth Authority by the juvenile court, the youth authority shall prepare a plan for care or treatment within 14 days after assuming custody of the youth offender. The court may indicate in general terms the type of care which it regards as initially appropriate. A copy of the plan, including a time schedule for its implementation, shall be sent to the juvenile court that committed the youth offender to the youth authority. The court may at any time request regular progress reports on implementation of the plan. The youth authority shall notify the court when the plan is implemented, and shall report to the court concerning the progress of the youth offender annually thereafter. If the plan is subsequently revised, the youth authority shall notify the court of the revisions and the reasons therefor. [1993 c.33 §242; 2003 c.396 §122]

 

      419C.492 Court’s authority to review placement. Commitment of a youth offender to the Oregon Youth Authority or the Department of Human Services does not terminate the court’s continuing jurisdiction to protect the rights of the youth offender or the youth offender’s parents or guardians. Notwithstanding ORS 419C.478 (5), if upon review of a placement of a youth offender made by the youth authority or the department, the court determines that the placement is so inappropriate as to violate the rights of the youth offender or the youth offender’s parents or guardians, the court may direct the youth authority or the department to place the youth offender in a specific type of residential placement, but the actual planning and placement of the youth offender shall be the responsibility of the youth authority or the department. Nothing in this section affects any contractual right of a private agency to refuse or terminate a placement. [1993 c.33 §243; 1995 c.422 §131]

 

      419C.495 When commitment to youth correction facility authorized. (1) A youth offender placed in the legal custody of the Oregon Youth Authority may be placed in a youth correction facility or in a private institution operated as a facility for youth offenders requiring secure custody only when the juvenile court having jurisdiction so recommends.

      (2) A youth offender who is admitted to a youth correction facility may be retained in the facility for the duration of the commitment period. In no case may a youth offender be retained in a youth correction facility after the youth offender has attained 25 years of age.

      (3) No youth offender shall be transferred or returned after discharge to a facility described in subsection (1) of this section, except upon court order under this chapter.

      (4) Nothing in subsection (3) of this section shall be deemed to prohibit return of a youth offender to a facility described in subsection (1) of this section, in the discretion of the youth authority, if the youth offender has been released from the facility on temporary or indefinite parole, or to prohibit transfer of a youth offender from one such facility to another. [1993 c.33 §244; 1999 c.109 §2]

 

      419C.498 Disposition under compact, agreement or arrangement with another state. If there is an interstate compact or agreement or an informal arrangement with another state permitting the youth offender to reside in another state while on probation or under protective supervision, or to be placed in an institution or with an agency in another state, the court may place the youth offender on probation or under protective supervision in such other state, or, subject to ORS 419C.495, place the youth offender in an institution in such other state in accordance with the compact, agreement or arrangement. [1993 c.33 §245; 2003 c.396 §123]

 

      419C.501 Duration of disposition. (1) The court shall fix the duration of any disposition made pursuant to this chapter and the duration may be for an indefinite period. Any placement in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Youth Authority under ORS 419C.478 or placement under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board under ORS 419C.529 shall be for an indefinite period. However, the period of institutionalization or commitment may not exceed:

      (a) The period of time specified in the statute defining the crime for an act that would constitute an unclassified misdemeanor if committed by an adult;

      (b) Thirty days for an act that would constitute a Class C misdemeanor if committed by an adult;

      (c) Six months for an act that would constitute a Class B misdemeanor if committed by an adult;

      (d) Three hundred sixty-four days for an act that would constitute a Class A misdemeanor if committed by an adult;

      (e) Five years for an act that would constitute a Class C felony if committed by an adult;

      (f) Ten years for an act that would constitute a Class B felony if committed by an adult;

      (g) Twenty years for an act that would constitute a Class A felony if committed by an adult; and

      (h) Life for a young person who was found to have committed an act that, if committed by an adult would constitute murder or any aggravated form of murder under ORS 163.095 or 163.115.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (1)(h) of this section, the period of any disposition may not extend beyond the date on which the young person or youth offender becomes 25 years of age. [1993 c.33 §246; 1995 c.422 §85; 1999 c.964 §1; 2005 c.843 §11; 2017 c.706 §23]

 

      419C.504 Duration of probation. In any case under ORS 419C.005 the court, notwithstanding ORS 419C.501, may place the youth offender on probation to the court for a period not to exceed five years. However, the period of probation shall not extend beyond the date on which the youth offender becomes 23 years of age. [1993 c.33 §247; 1995 c.422 §86]

 

      419C.507 Additional options; consultation. The court may, in lieu of or in addition to any disposition under this chapter, direct that a youth offender be examined or treated by a physician, psychiatrist or psychologist, or receive other special care or treatment in a hospital or other suitable facility. If the court determines that mental health examination and treatment should be provided by services delivered through the Oregon Health Authority, the Department of Human Services shall determine the appropriate placement or services in consultation with the court, the Oregon Youth Authority and other affected agencies. If the youth authority or another affected agency objects to the type of placement or services, the court shall determine the appropriate type of placement or service. During the examination or treatment of the youth offender, the department may, if appropriate, be appointed guardian of the youth offender. [1993 c.33 §248; 2001 c.900 §124; 2003 c.396 §124; 2009 c.595 §368]

 

      419C.510 Advisory committee to study dispositions; recommendations. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall create an advisory committee consisting of three judges appointed by the Chief Justice. The advisory committee shall study dispositions imposed in juvenile court cases under ORS 419C.005 and make recommendations for disposition criteria that consider:

      (1) The protection of the community;

      (2) The accountability of the offender; and

      (3) The competency of the offender. [1995 c.422 §127]

 

      Note: 419C.510 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 419C or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

QUALIFYING MENTAL DISORDER

 

      419C.520 Definitions. As used in ORS 419C.411, 419C.522 to 419C.527 and 419C.529 to 419C.544:

      (1) “Conditional release” includes but is not limited to the monitoring of mental and physical health treatment.

      (2) “Qualifying mental disorder” does not include an abnormality:

      (a) Manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct;

      (b) Constituting solely a personality disorder; or

      (c) Constituting solely a conduct disorder.

      (3) “Serious mental condition” means a condition that requires supervision and treatment services for the safety of others and is:

      (a) A mental illness of major depression;

      (b) A mental illness of bipolar disorder; or

      (c) A mental illness of psychotic disorder. [2005 c.843 §3; 2007 c.889 §3; 2017 c.634 §22]

 

      419C.522 Qualifying mental disorder as affirmative defense. Qualifying mental disorder constituting insanity under ORS 419C.411 (2) is an affirmative defense. [2005 c.843 §4; 2017 c.634 §23]

 

      419C.524 Notice and filing report prerequisite to defense; timing. (1) A youth may not introduce evidence on the issue of the defense set forth in ORS 419C.522 unless the youth:

      (a) Gives notice of intent to do so in the manner provided in subsection (2) of this section; and

      (b) Files with the court a report of a psychiatric or psychological evaluation, conducted by a certified evaluator, in the manner provided in subsection (5) of this section.

      (2) A youth who is required under subsection (1) of this section to give notice must do so by filing a written notice of intent. A youth who is not in detention must file the notice of intent no later than 60 days after the petition is filed unless the court finds good cause to extend the time. If the youth fails to file notice timely, the youth may not introduce evidence for the establishment of the defense set forth in ORS 419C.522 unless the court permits the evidence to be introduced when just cause for failure to file the notice is shown.

      (3) Just cause for failure to file notice timely exists if the youth was not represented by counsel until after the filing period.

      (4) The filing of a notice of intent under this section by a youth in detention constitutes express consent of the youth for continued detention under ORS 419C.150.

      (5) A youth who is required under subsection (1) of this section to file a report of a psychiatric or psychological evaluation shall file the report before trial. The report must be based on an evaluation conducted after the date of the alleged act and must address the issue of insanity under ORS 419C.411 (2) and the dispositional determinations described in ORS 419C.411 (7) and 419C.529. If the youth fails to file a complete report before trial, the youth may not introduce evidence for the establishment of the defense set forth in ORS 419C.522 unless the court permits the evidence to be introduced when just cause for failure to file the report is shown.

      (6) As used in this section, “certified evaluator” means a psychiatrist or psychologist who holds a valid certification under the provisions of ORS 161.392. [2005 c.843 §5; 2011 c.724 §6]

 

      419C.527 Procedure for state to obtain mental examination of youth; limitations. Upon the filing of a written notice of intent or the introduction of evidence by the youth as provided in ORS 419C.524, the state may have at least one psychiatrist certified, or eligible to be certified, by the Oregon Medical Board in child psychiatry or licensed psychologist with expertise in child psychology of its selection examine the youth. Unless the court finds good cause to extend the time, the state must obtain an examination under this section no later than 60 days after the notice of intent was filed or the evidence was introduced. The state shall file notice with the court of its intention to have the youth examined. Upon filing of the notice, the court shall order the youth to participate in an examination. If the youth objects to the examiner chosen by the state, the court for good cause shown may direct the state to select a different examiner. The examiner shall provide a copy of the report generated from the examination to the state. A report generated from an examination under this section is a report relating to the youth’s history and prognosis under ORS 419A.255 (2). [2005 c.843 §6]

 

      419C.529 Finding of serious mental condition; jurisdiction of Psychiatric Security Review Board; conditional release or commitment. (1) After the entry of a jurisdictional order under ORS 419C.411 (2), if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the young person, at the time of disposition, has a serious mental condition or has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition and presents a substantial danger to others, requiring conditional release or commitment to a hospital or facility designated on an individual case basis by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the court shall order the young person placed under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board.

      (2) The court shall determine whether the young person should be committed to a hospital or facility designated on an individual case basis by the department or the authority, as provided in subsection (6) of this section, or conditionally released pending a hearing before the juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board as follows:

      (a) If the court finds that the young person is not a proper subject for conditional release, the court shall order the young person committed to a secure hospital or a secure intensive community inpatient facility designated on an individual case basis by the department or the authority, as provided in subsection (6) of this section, for custody, supervision and treatment pending a hearing before the juvenile panel in accordance with ORS 419C.532, 419C.535, 419C.538, 419C.540 and 419C.542 and shall order the young person placed under the jurisdiction of the board.

      (b) If the court finds that the young person can be adequately controlled with supervision and treatment services if conditionally released and that necessary supervision and treatment services are available, the court may order the young person conditionally released, subject to those supervisory orders of the court that are in the best interests of justice and the young person. The court shall designate a qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or state, county or local agency to supervise the young person on release, subject to those conditions as the court directs in the order for conditional release. Prior to the designation, the court shall notify the qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or agency to whom conditional release is contemplated and provide the qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or agency an opportunity to be heard before the court. After receiving an order entered under this paragraph, the qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or agency designated shall assume supervision of the young person subject to the direction of the juvenile panel. The qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or agency designated as supervisor shall report in writing no less than once per month to the juvenile panel concerning the supervised young person’s compliance with the conditions of release.

      (c) For purposes of determining whether to order commitment to a hospital or facility or conditional release, the primary concern of the court is the protection of society.

      (3) In determining whether a young person should be conditionally released, the court may order examinations or evaluations deemed necessary.

      (4) Upon placing a young person on conditional release and ordering the young person placed under the jurisdiction of the board, the court shall notify the juvenile panel in writing of the court’s conditional release order, the supervisor designated and all other conditions of release pending a hearing before the juvenile panel in accordance with ORS 419C.532, 419C.535, 419C.538, 419C.540 and 419C.542.

      (5) When making an order under this section, the court shall:

      (a) Determine whether the parent or guardian of the young person is able and willing to assist the young person in obtaining necessary mental health or developmental disabilities services and is willing to acquiesce in the decisions of the juvenile panel. If the court finds that the parent or guardian:

      (A) Is able and willing to do so, the court shall order the parent or guardian to sign an irrevocable consent form in which the parent agrees to any placement decision made by the juvenile panel.

      (B) Is unable or unwilling to do so, the court shall order that the young person be placed in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services for the purpose of obtaining necessary developmental disabilities services or mental health services.

      (b) Make specific findings on whether there is a victim and, if so, whether the victim wishes to be notified of any board hearings and orders concerning the young person and of any conditional release, discharge or escape of the young person.

      (c) Include in the order a list of the persons who wish to be notified of any board hearing concerning the young person.

      (d) Determine on the record the act committed by the young person for which the young person was found responsible except for insanity.

      (e) State on the record the qualifying mental disorder on which the young person relied for the responsible except for insanity defense.

      (6) When the department designates a facility for the commitment of a young person with a developmental disability under this section, or the authority designates a hospital or facility for commitment of a young person with mental illness under this section, the department and the authority shall take into account the care and treatment needs of the young person, the resources available to the department or the authority and the safety of the public. [2005 c.843 §13; 2007 c.889 §4; 2009 c.595 §369; 2010 c.89 §10; 2011 c.720 §159a; 2013 c.360 §14; 2017 c.634 §24]

 

      419C.530 Continuing jurisdiction of Psychiatric Security Review Board after placement. The juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board exercises continuing jurisdiction over a young person committed to, or retained in, a hospital or facility designated by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority under ORS 419C.529. If the board determines after review that the placement of a young person in the particular hospital or facility is so inappropriate as to create a substantial danger to others, the board may direct the department or the authority to place the young person in a specific type of facility or direct specific care or supervision, but the actual placement of the young person is the responsibility of the department or the authority. [2007 c.889 §2; 2009 c.595 §370]

 

      419C.531 Notice to victim; opportunity to be heard; request for reconsideration. (1) If the juvenile court or the juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board determines that a victim desires notification as described in ORS 419C.529, the panel shall make a reasonable effort to notify the victim of panel hearings and orders, conditional release, discharge or escape. Nothing in this subsection authorizes the panel to disseminate information that is otherwise privileged by law.

      (2) When the panel conducts a hearing involving a young person found responsible except for insanity for an act for which there is a victim, the panel shall afford the victim an opportunity to be heard, either orally or in writing, at the hearing.

      (3)(a) If the panel fails to make a reasonable effort to notify the victim of a panel hearing under subsection (1) of this section or fails to afford the victim an opportunity to be heard under subsection (2) of this section, the victim may request that the panel reconsider the order of the panel.

      (b) If the panel determines that the panel failed to make a reasonable effort to notify the victim or failed to afford the victim an opportunity to be heard, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the panel shall grant the request for reconsideration. Upon reconsideration, the panel shall consider the statement of the victim and may consider any other information that was not available to the panel at the previous hearing.

      (c) The panel may not grant a request for reconsideration that is made:

      (A) After the young person has been discharged from the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board;

      (B) After the panel has held a subsequent hearing involving the young person; or

      (C) If the panel failed to make a reasonable effort to notify the victim of a hearing, more than 30 days after the victim knew or reasonably should have known of the hearing. [2010 c.89 §8]

 

      419C.532 Hearings of juvenile panel of Psychiatric Security Review Board; requirements; standards; dispositions. (1) The juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board shall conduct hearings on an application for discharge, conditional release, commitment or modification filed under or required by ORS 419C.538, 419C.540 and 419C.542, and shall make findings on the issues before the juvenile panel.

      (2) In every hearing before the juvenile panel, the juvenile panel shall determine whether the young person:

      (a) Has a serious mental condition; or

      (b) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition and presents a substantial danger to others.

      (3) The juvenile panel shall order a young person discharged from commitment or conditional release if the juvenile panel finds that the young person:

      (a) No longer has a qualifying mental disorder; or

      (b) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition but no longer presents a substantial danger to others.

      (4) The juvenile panel shall order a young person conditionally released subject to ORS 419C.538 if the juvenile panel finds that:

      (a) The young person:

      (A) Has a serious mental condition; or

      (B) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition and presents a substantial danger to others;

      (b) The young person can be adequately controlled with treatment services as a condition of release; and

      (c) Necessary supervision and treatment services are available.

      (5) The juvenile panel shall order a young person committed to, or retained in, a hospital or facility designated by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority for custody, supervision and treatment subject to ORS 419C.540 if the juvenile panel finds that the young person:

      (a)(A) Has a serious mental condition; or

      (B) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition and presents a substantial danger to others; and

      (b) Cannot be adequately controlled if conditionally released.

      (6) In determining whether a young person should be committed to or retained in a hospital or facility, conditionally released or discharged, the primary concern of the juvenile panel is the protection of society.

      (7) In a hearing before the juvenile panel, a young person who has a qualifying mental disorder in a state of remission is considered to have a qualifying mental disorder if the qualifying mental disorder may, with reasonable medical probability, occasionally become active.

      (8) At any time, the juvenile panel may appoint a psychiatrist certified, or eligible to be certified, by the Oregon Medical Board in child psychiatry or a licensed psychologist with expertise in child psychology to examine the young person and submit a written report to the juvenile panel. Reports filed with the juvenile panel pursuant to the examination must include, but need not be limited to, an opinion as to whether the young person:

      (a)(A) Has a serious mental condition; or

      (B) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition and presents a substantial danger to others; and

      (b) Could be adequately controlled with treatment services as a condition of release.

      (9) The juvenile panel may make a determination regarding discharge or conditional release based upon the written report submitted under subsection (8) of this section or ORS 419C.540 (3). If a member of the juvenile panel desires further information from the examining psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who submitted the report, the juvenile panel shall summon the psychiatrist or psychologist to give testimony.

      (10) The juvenile panel shall consider all available evidence that is material, relevant and reliable regarding the issues before the juvenile panel. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, the record of the juvenile court adjudication, information supplied by the attorney representing the state or by any other interested person, including the young person, information concerning the young person’s mental condition and the entire psychiatric and juvenile court history of the young person. All evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their serious affairs is admissible at the hearings. Testimony must be taken upon oath or affirmation of the witness from whom received. The officer presiding at the hearing shall administer oaths and affirmations to witnesses.

      (11) The standard of proof on all issues at a hearing of the juvenile panel is by a preponderance of the evidence.

      (12)(a) The juvenile panel shall furnish written notice of any hearing pending under this section within a reasonable time prior to the hearing to:

      (D) The person having legal custody of the young person;

      (E) The Attorney General or other attorney representing the state, if any; and

      (F) The district attorney of the county in which the young person was adjudicated.

      (b) The juvenile panel shall include in the notice required by paragraph (a) of this subsection:

      (A) The time, place and location of the hearing;

      (B) The nature of the hearing, the specific action for which the hearing has been requested, the issues to be considered at the hearing and a reference to the particular sections of the statutes and rules involved;

      (C) A statement of the authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held; and

      (D) A statement of all rights under subsection (13) of this section.

      (13) A young person about whom a hearing is being held has the right:

      (a) To appear at all proceedings held under this section, except juvenile panel deliberations.

      (b) To cross-examine all witnesses appearing to testify at the hearing.

      (c) To subpoena witnesses and documents as provided in ORS 161.395.

      (d) To be represented by suitable legal counsel possessing skills and experience commensurate with the nature and complexity of the case, to consult with counsel prior to the hearing and, if financially eligible, to have suitable counsel appointed at state expense.

      (e) To examine all information, documents and reports that the juvenile panel considers and, if the information, documents and reports are available to the juvenile panel before the hearing, to examine them prior to the hearing.

      (14) Except for deliberations of the juvenile panel, the juvenile panel shall keep a record of all hearings before the juvenile panel.

      (15) Upon request of a person listed in subsection (12)(a) of this section or on its own motion, the juvenile panel may continue a hearing for a reasonable period not to exceed 60 days to obtain additional information or testimony or for other good cause shown.

      (16) Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile panel shall provide written notice of the juvenile panel’s decision to the young person, the attorney representing the young person, the young person’s parents or guardians, if known, the person having legal custody of the young person, the district attorney of the county in which the young person was adjudicated and the Attorney General or other attorney representing the state, if any.

      (17) The juvenile panel shall maintain and keep current the medical, social and delinquency history of all young persons. The juvenile panel shall determine the confidentiality of records maintained by the juvenile panel pursuant to ORS 192.338, 192.345 and 192.355. [2005 c.843 §14; 2009 c.595 §371; 2017 c.232 §2; 2017 c.634 §25]

 

      419C.533 Rules. (1) The juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board, by rule pursuant to ORS 183.325 to 183.410 and not inconsistent with law, may implement its policies and set out its procedure and practice requirements and may promulgate such interpretive rules as the panel deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its statutory responsibilities.

      (2) The juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board shall adopt rules defining the type of dangerous behavior that requires the temporary placement of a young person with mental retardation in a secure hospital or facility.

      (3) The juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board shall consult with the Department of Human Services about proposed rules relating to developmental disabilities and the Oregon Health Authority about proposed rules relating to mental illness before issuing proposed rules for public comment and before adopting rules under this section. [2007 c.889 §6; 2009 c.595 §372]

 

      419C.535 Appointed counsel; representation of state in contested hearings before panel. (1) If the juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board determines that a young person about whom a hearing under ORS 419C.532 is being held is financially eligible, the juvenile panel shall appoint suitable counsel to represent the young person. Counsel appointed must be an attorney who satisfies the professional qualification standards established by the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.216. The public defense services executive director shall determine and allow fair compensation for counsel appointed under this subsection and the reasonable expenses of the young person in respect to the hearing. Compensation payable to appointed counsel may not be less than the applicable compensation level established under ORS 151.216. The public defense services executive director shall pay compensation and expenses allowed from funds available for that purpose.

      (2) When the juvenile panel appoints counsel to represent the young person, the juvenile panel may order the young person, if able, parent, if able, or guardian of the estate, if the estate is able, to pay to the Public Defense Services Account established by ORS 151.225, through the clerk of the court, in full or in part, the administrative costs of determining the ability of the young person, parent or estate to pay for legal services and the costs of the legal and other services that are related to the provision of appointed counsel. The juvenile panel’s order of payment may be entered in the County Clerk Lien Record and enforced as provided in ORS 205.126.

      (3) The test of the young person’s, parent’s or estate’s ability to pay costs under subsection (2) of this section is the same test as applied to appointment of counsel for defendants under ORS 135.050 or under the rules adopted under ORS 151.216. If counsel is provided at state expense, the juvenile panel shall apply this test in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Public Defense Services Commission under ORS 151.485.

      (4) If counsel is provided at state expense, the juvenile panel shall determine the amount the young person, parent or estate is required to pay for the costs of administrative, legal and other services related to the provision of appointed counsel in the same manner as this amount is determined under ORS 151.487.

      (5) The Attorney General may represent the state at contested hearings before the juvenile panel unless the district attorney of the county in which the young person was adjudicated elects to represent the state. The district attorney of the county in which the young person was adjudicated shall cooperate with the Attorney General in securing the material necessary for presenting a contested hearing before the juvenile panel. If the district attorney elects to represent the state, the district attorney shall give timely written notice to the Attorney General, the juvenile panel and the attorney representing the young person. [2005 c.843 §15; 2012 c.107 §48]

 

      419C.538 Conditional release. (1) When the juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board orders a young person conditionally released under ORS 419C.532 (4), the juvenile panel may designate a qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or state, county or local agency to supervise the young person on release subject to those conditions as the juvenile panel directs in the order for conditional release. Prior to the designation, the juvenile panel shall notify the qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or agency to whom conditional release is contemplated and provide the qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or agency an opportunity to be heard before the juvenile panel. After receiving an order entered under ORS 419C.532 (4), the qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or agency designated shall assume supervision of the young person pursuant to the direction of the juvenile panel.

      (2) Conditions of release contained in orders entered under ORS 419C.532 (4) may be modified from time to time and conditional release may be terminated by order of the juvenile panel as provided in ORS 419C.532 and 419C.542.

      (3)(a) As a condition of release, the juvenile panel may require the young person to report to any state, county or local mental health or developmental disabilities facility for evaluation. Whenever medical, psychiatric or psychological treatment is recommended, the juvenile panel may order the young person, as a condition of release, to cooperate with and accept the treatment of the facility.

      (b) The facility to which the young person has been referred for evaluation shall perform the evaluation and submit a written report of its findings to the juvenile panel. If the facility finds that treatment of the young person is appropriate, the facility shall include its recommendations for treatment in the report to the juvenile panel.

      (c) Whenever treatment is provided by the facility, the facility shall furnish reports to the juvenile panel on a regular basis concerning the progress of the young person.

      (d) The facility shall comply with any other conditions of release prescribed by order of the juvenile panel.

      (4) If at any time it appears to the juvenile panel or the chairperson of the juvenile panel that a young person has violated the terms of conditional release or that the mental health of the young person has changed, the juvenile panel or the chairperson of the juvenile panel may order the young person returned to a hospital or facility designated by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority for evaluation and treatment. A written order of the juvenile panel, or the chairperson of the juvenile panel on behalf of the juvenile panel, is sufficient warrant for any peace officer to take the young person into custody and transport the young person accordingly. A peace officer shall execute the order, and the young person shall be returned as soon as practicable to a facility designated by the department or the authority. Within 20 days following the return of the young person to the facility designated by the department or the authority, the juvenile panel shall conduct a hearing. At a hearing required by this subsection, the state has the burden of proving the young person’s lack of fitness for conditional release.

      (5) The community mental health program director, the community developmental disabilities program director, the director of the facility providing treatment for the young person on conditional release, a peace officer or a person responsible for the supervision of a young person on conditional release may take a young person into custody or request that the young person be taken into custody if there is reasonable cause to believe the young person presents a substantial danger to others and that the young person is in need of immediate custody, supervision and treatment. A young person taken into custody under this subsection must immediately be transported to a hospital or facility designated by the department or the authority. Within 20 days following the return of the young person to the facility designated by the department or the authority, the juvenile panel shall conduct a hearing. At a hearing required by this subsection, the state has the burden of proving the young person’s lack of fitness for conditional release.

      (6)(a) A young person conditionally released under ORS 419C.532 (4) may apply to the juvenile panel for discharge from or modification of an order of conditional release on the ground that the young person no longer has a qualifying mental disorder or, if affected by a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition, no longer presents a substantial danger to others and no longer requires supervision or treatment services. Within 60 days after receiving an application under this paragraph, the juvenile panel shall conduct a hearing. At a hearing required by this paragraph, the young person has the burden of proving the young person’s fitness for discharge or modification of the order of conditional release. A young person may not apply for discharge or modification of conditional release more often than once every six months.

      (b) Upon application by any qualified mental health or developmental disabilities treatment provider or state, county or local agency responsible for supervision or treatment services pursuant to an order of conditional release, the juvenile panel shall conduct a hearing to determine if the conditions of release should be continued, modified or terminated. The application must be accompanied by a report setting forth the facts supporting the application. At a hearing required by this paragraph, the state has the burden of proving the young person’s lack of fitness for discharge or modification of the order of conditional release. [2005 c.843 §16; 2007 c.889 §5; 2009 c.595 §373; 2017 c.634 §26]

 

      419C.540 Discharge or conditional release after commitment. (1) The director of a hospital or facility to which a young person was committed under ORS 419C.532 (5) shall apply to the juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board for an order of discharge or conditional release of the young person if, at any time after the commitment, the director is of the opinion that the young person:

      (a) No longer has a qualifying mental disorder;

      (b) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition but no longer presents a substantial danger to others; or

      (c) Can be controlled with proper supervision and treatment services if conditionally released.

      (2) The director shall include in an application under subsection (1) of this section a report setting forth the facts that support the opinion of the director. If the application is for conditional release, the director shall also include a verified conditional release plan. The juvenile panel shall hold a hearing on an application under subsection (1) of this section within 30 days of its receipt. Not less than 10 days prior to the hearing before the juvenile panel, copies of the report must be sent to the Attorney General or other attorney representing the state, if any, the district attorney of the county in which the young person was adjudicated, the young person, the young person’s attorney, the young person’s parents or guardians, if known, and the person having legal custody of the young person.

      (3) The attorney representing the state may choose a psychiatrist certified, or eligible to be certified, by the Oregon Medical Board in child psychiatry or a licensed psychologist with expertise in child psychology to examine the young person prior to any decision of the juvenile panel on discharge or conditional release. The results of the examination must be in writing and filed with the juvenile panel and must include, but need not be limited to, an opinion as to whether the young person:

      (a)(A) Has a serious mental condition; or

      (B) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition and presents a substantial danger to others; and

      (b) Could be adequately controlled with treatment services as a condition of release.

      (4) A young person who has been committed to a hospital or facility under ORS 419C.532 (5) or the young person’s parents or guardians acting on the young person’s behalf may apply to the juvenile panel for an order of discharge or conditional release upon the grounds that the young person:

      (a) No longer has a qualifying mental disorder;

      (b) Has a qualifying mental disorder other than a serious mental condition but no longer presents a substantial danger to others; or

      (c) Can be controlled with proper supervision and treatment services if conditionally released.

      (5) When an application is made under subsection (4) of this section, the juvenile panel shall require a report from the director of the hospital or facility. The director shall prepare and transmit the report as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

      (6) At a hearing on an application under subsection (4) of this section:

      (a) The applicant has the burden of proving the young person’s fitness for discharge or conditional release; or

      (b) If more than two years have passed since the state had the burden of proving the young person’s lack of fitness for discharge or conditional release, the state has the burden of proving the young person’s lack of fitness for discharge or conditional release.

      (7) A person may not file an application for discharge or conditional release under subsection (4) of this section:

      (a) Sooner than 90 days after the initial juvenile panel hearing concerning the young person.

      (b) If another application for discharge or conditional release of the young person was filed during the immediately preceding 90 days.

      (8) The juvenile panel shall hold a hearing on an application under subsection (4) of this section within 30 days after the application is filed. [2005 c.843 §17; 2017 c.634 §27]

 

      419C.542 Hearings before juvenile panel of Psychiatric Security Review Board. (1) A young person committed by the court under ORS 419C.529 to a hospital or facility designated by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority may not be held in the hospital or facility for more than 90 days from the date of the court’s commitment order without an initial hearing before the juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board to determine whether the young person should be discharged or conditionally released.

      (2) A young person may not be held pursuant to an order under ORS 419C.532 (5) for a period of time exceeding one year without a hearing before the juvenile panel to determine whether the young person should be discharged or conditionally released.

      (3) When a young person has spent three years on conditional release, the juvenile panel shall bring the young person before the juvenile panel no later than 30 days after the expiration of the three-year period. The juvenile panel shall review the young person’s status and determine whether the young person should be discharged from the jurisdiction of the board.

      (4) Notwithstanding the fact that a young person who is brought before the juvenile panel under subsection (3) of this section continues to have a serious mental condition, the juvenile panel may discharge the young person if the young person did not exhibit behaviors that presented a substantial danger to others during the period of conditional release and no longer requires supervision by the juvenile panel. [2005 c.843 §18; 2009 c.595 §374]

 

      419C.544 Transfer of cases from juvenile panel to adult panel of Psychiatric Security Review Board. (1) When a young person attains 18 years of age, the juvenile panel of the Psychiatric Security Review Board shall transfer the young person’s case to the adult panel of the board if the act that brought the young person within the board’s jurisdiction would constitute murder or any aggravated form of murder if committed by an adult.

      (2) At any time after a young person not described in subsection (1) of this section attains 18 years of age, the juvenile panel of the board may hold a hearing to determine whether it is in the young person’s best interest to transfer the young person’s case to the adult panel of the board. The juvenile panel of the board shall transfer the young person’s case to the adult panel of the board unless good cause is shown for retaining the young person’s case with the juvenile panel. [2005 c.843 §19]

[1993 c.33 §250; 1993 c.367 §2; 2003 c.396 §125; 2013 c.640 §2; 2013 c.688 §89]

 

GUARDIAN

 

      419C.555 Authority to appoint guardian. Except when the court grants legal custody to the Oregon Youth Authority, the court may grant guardianship of the youth offender to a private institution or agency to which the youth offender is committed or to some suitable person or entity if it appears necessary to do so in the interests of the youth offender. [1993 c.33 §249; 2003 c.396 §126]

 

      419C.558 Duties and authority of guardian. A person, agency or institution having guardianship of a youth offender by reason of appointment by the court has the duties and authority of a guardian of the youth offender, including but not limited to the following:

      (1) To authorize surgery for the youth offender, but this authority does not prevent the person having legal custody of the youth offender from acting under ORS 419C.550 (4).

      (2) To authorize the youth offender to enlist in the Armed Forces of the United States.

      (3) To consent to the youth offender’s marriage.

      419C.561 Limitation of guardianship granted by juvenile court. A person appointed guardian of a youth offender by the court is guardian only and not a conservator of the estate of the youth offender, unless that person is appointed conservator of the youth offender’s estate in a protective proceeding as provided in ORS chapter 125. [1993 c.33 §252; 1995 c.664 §95; 2003 c.396 §128]

 

AUTHORITY OF COURT OVER PARENT OR GUARDIAN

 

      419C.570 Parent or guardian summoned subject to jurisdiction of court; probation contract. (1)(a) A parent or legal guardian of a youth offender, if the parent or guardian was served with summons under ORS 419C.300, 419C.303 and 419C.306 prior to the adjudication or at least 10 days prior to disposition, is subject to the jurisdiction of the court for purposes of this section. The court may:

      (A) Order the parent or guardian to assist the court in any reasonable manner in providing appropriate education or counseling for the youth offender;

      (B) If the youth offender is within the jurisdiction of the court for having committed an act that if committed by an adult would constitute a violation of ORS 166.250, 166.370 or 166.382, require the parent or guardian to pay or cause to be paid all or part of the reasonable costs of any mental health assessment or screening ordered by the court under ORS 419C.109 (3);

      (C) If the court orders probation, require the parent or guardian to enter into a contract with the juvenile department in regard to the supervision and implementation of the youth offender’s probation; or

      (D) If the court orders probation, require the parent or guardian to pay all or a portion of the supervision fee if a supervision fee is imposed under ORS 419C.446 (2).

      (b) In all cases in which a youth offender is placed on probation, the juvenile department and the parent or guardian shall develop a plan for supervision of the youth offender. The plan must be reasonably calculated to provide the supervision necessary to prevent further acts of delinquency given the individual circumstances of the youth offender. The court shall review and ratify the plan and make the plan a part of the probation order.

      (2) The court may require the parent or guardian to pay a specific sum not to exceed $1,000 for a violation by the parent or guardian of the court’s order or the contract under subsection (1)(a) of this section.

      (3) The court may not revoke a youth offender’s probation solely because of a failure of the youth offender’s parent or guardian to comply with an order or a contract under subsection (1)(a) of this section. [1993 c.33 §253; 1995 c.592 §1; 1999 c.577 §12; 2001 c.485 §1; 2003 c.396 §129]

 

      419C.573 Court may order education or counseling. (1)(a) The court may order the parent or guardian to participate in any educational or counseling programs as are reasonably directed toward improvement of parenting skills and the ability of the parent to supervise the youth offender if the court finds:

      (A) That a deficiency in parenting skills has significantly contributed to the circumstances bringing the youth offender within the jurisdiction of the court; and

      (B) That participation would be consistent with the best interests of the youth offender.

      (b) The programs may include, but need not be limited to, parenting classes.

      (c) The court may order such participation with the youth offender or separately.

      (2) As an alternative to a contempt proceeding, the court may require a parent or guardian to pay a specific sum not to exceed $1,000 for a violation by the parent or guardian of an order under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The court may not revoke a youth offender’s probation solely because of a failure of the youth offender’s parent or guardian to comply with an order under subsection (1) of this section. [1993 c.33 §254; 1995 c.592 §2; 2003 c.396 §130]

 

      419C.575 Court may order drug or alcohol treatment; hearing required; appointment of counsel for parent or guardian. If the court finds that the parent’s or guardian’s addiction to or habitual use of alcohol, cannabis or controlled substances has significantly contributed to the circumstances bringing the youth offender within the jurisdiction of the court, the court may conduct a special hearing to determine if the court should order the parent or guardian to participate in treatment and pay the costs thereof. Notice of this hearing shall be by special petition and summons to be filed by the court and served upon the parent or guardian. The court shall appoint counsel to represent the parent or guardian if the parent or guardian is eligible under ORS 135.050. If, at this hearing, the court finds it is in the best interest of the youth offender for the parent or guardian to be directly involved in treatment, the judge may order the parent or guardian to participate in treatment. The dispositional order shall be in writing and shall contain appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. The judge shall state with particularity, both orally and in the written order of the disposition, the precise terms of the disposition. [1993 c.33 §255; 1993 c.546 §90; 1995 c.422 §87; 2003 c.396 §131; 2017 c.21 §57]

 

SUPPORT

 

      419C.590 Authority of court to order support; hearing; determination of amount. (1) The court may, after a hearing on the matter, require the parents or other person legally obligated to support a youth offender to pay toward the youth offender’s support such amounts at such intervals as the court may direct, while the youth offender is within the jurisdiction of the court even though the youth offender is over 18 years of age as long as the youth offender is a child attending school, as defined in ORS 107.108.

      (2) At least 21 days before the hearing, the court shall notify the Administrator of the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice, or the branch office providing support services to the county where the hearing will be held, of the hearing. Before the hearing the administrator shall inform the court, to the extent known:

      (a) Whether there is pending in this state or any other jurisdiction any type of support proceeding involving the youth offender, including a proceeding brought under ORS 25.287, 107.085, 107.135, 107.431, 108.110, 109.100, 109.103, 109.165, 125.025, 416.400 to 416.465 or 419B.400 or ORS chapter 110; and

      (b) Whether there exists in this state or any other jurisdiction a support order, as defined in ORS 110.503, involving the youth offender.

      (3) The Judicial Department and the Department of Justice may enter into an agreement regarding how the courts give the notice required under subsection (2) of this section to the Department of Justice and how the Department of Justice gives the information described in subsection (2)(a) and (b) to the courts.

      (4) The court, in determining the amount to be paid, shall use the scale and formula provided for in ORS 25.275 and 25.280. Unless otherwise ordered, the amounts so required to be paid shall be paid to the Department of Justice or the county clerk, whichever is appropriate, for transmission to the person, institution or agency having legal custody of the youth offender. [1993 c.33 §256; 1997 c.704 §§47,61; 2003 c.116 §17; 2003 c.396 §132a; 2015 c.298 §102]

 

      419C.592 Support order is judgment and final. Any order for support entered pursuant to ORS 419C.590 is a judgment and is final as to any installment or payment of money which has accrued up to the time either party makes a motion to set aside, alter or modify the order, and the court does not have the power to set aside, alter or modify such order, or any portion thereof, which provides for any payment of money, either for minor children or the support of a party, which has accrued prior to the filing of such motion. [1993 c.33 §257; 2003 c.576 §253]

 

      419C.595 Support for youth offender in state financed or supported residence. Any order for support entered pursuant to ORS 419C.590 for a youth offender in the care and custody of the Oregon Youth Authority may be made contingent upon the youth offender residing in a state financed or supported residence, shelter or other facility or institution. A certificate signed by the director of the youth authority, the Administrator of the Division of Child Support or the administrator’s authorized representative is sufficient to establish such periods of residence and to satisfy the order for periods of nonresidence. [1993 c.33 §259; 2003 c.396 §133]

 

      419C.597 Assignment of support obligation to state. When a youth offender or other offender is in the legal or physical custody of the Oregon Youth Authority and the offender is the beneficiary of an order of support in a judgment of dissolution or other order and the youth authority is required to provide financial assistance for the care and support of the offender, the youth authority shall be assignee of and subrogated to the offender’s proportionate share of any such support obligation including sums that have accrued whether or not the support order or judgment provides for separate monthly amounts for the support of each of two or more children or a single monthly gross payment for the benefit of two or more children, up to the amount of assistance provided by the youth authority. The assignment shall be as provided in ORS 412.024. [1993 c.33 §258; 1999 c.80 §77; 2001 c.455 §23; 2003 c.572 §19; 2003 c.576 §453]

 

      419C.600 Enforcement. (1) An order of support entered pursuant to ORS 419C.590, 419C.592, 419C.595 and 419C.597 may be enforced by execution or in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of a judgment granting an equitable remedy or by an order to withhold pursuant to ORS 25.372 to 25.427.

      (2) No property of the youth offender’s parents, or either of them, or other person legally obligated to support the youth offender is exempt from levy and sale or other process to enforce collection of the amounts ordered by the court to be paid toward the support of the youth offender. [1993 c.33 §260; 1993 c.798 §31a; 2003 c.396 §134]

 

MODIFICATION OF ORDERS

 

      419C.610 Authority to modify or set aside orders. (1) Except as provided in ORS 419C.613, 419C.615 and 419C.616, the court may modify or set aside any order made by it upon such notice and with such hearing as the court may direct.

      (2) When the court modifies or sets aside an order of jurisdiction based on a petition alleging that a youth offender has committed an act that would constitute a sex crime, as defined in ORS 163A.005, if committed by an adult, the court shall make written findings stating the reason for modifying or setting aside the order. [1993 c.33 §261; 2001 c.803 §1]

 

      419C.613 Notice of modification. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, notice and a hearing as provided in this chapter shall be granted in any case where the effect of modifying or setting aside the order will or may be to deprive a parent of the legal custody of the youth offender, to place the youth offender in an institution or agency or to transfer the youth offender from one institution or agency to another. However, the provisions of this subsection do not apply to a parent whose rights have been terminated by the court or whose child has been permanently committed by order of the court unless an appeal from such order is pending.

      (2) Notice and a hearing as provided in subsection (1) of this section are not required where the effect of modifying or setting aside the order will be to transfer the youth offender from one foster home to another. [1993 c.33 §262; 2003 c.396 §135]

 

      419C.615 Grounds for setting aside order; procedure; appeal. (1) In addition to any other grounds upon which a person may petition a court under ORS 419C.610, a person may petition the court on the following grounds to set aside an order finding the person to be within the jurisdiction of the court under ORS 419C.005:

      (a) A substantial denial in the proceedings resulting in the person’s adjudication, or in the appellate review of the adjudication, of the person’s rights under the United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution, or both, and the denial rendered the adjudication void; or

      (b) Unconstitutionality of the statute making criminal, if the person were an adult, the acts for which the person was adjudicated.

      (2) When a person petitions the court on one of the grounds listed in subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) A copy of the petition shall be served on the district attorney, who shall represent the state in the matter.

      (b) The court shall decide the issues raised. The court may receive proof by affidavits, depositions and other competent evidence. Oral testimony may be taken by telephone or other means approved by the court. The petitioner has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the facts alleged in the petition.

      (c) The court shall set aside the order finding the petitioner to be within the jurisdiction of the court if the petitioner establishes one of the grounds set forth in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Either the petitioner or the state may appeal from the court’s order granting or denying a petition for relief under this section. The manner of taking the appeal and the scope of review are the same as provided under ORS 419A.200.

      (4) Nothing in this section may be construed to limit the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in habeas corpus as provided by the Oregon Constitution. [2001 c.803 §3]

 

      419C.616 Effect of prior proceeding on petition under ORS 419C.615. (1) The effect of a prior proceeding concerning the adjudication of the person that is challenged in a petition under ORS 419C.615 is as follows:

      (a) The failure of the petitioner to have sought appellate review of the adjudication, or to have raised matters alleged in the petition at the prior proceeding, does not affect the availability of relief under ORS 419C.615. No proceeding under ORS 419C.615 may be pursued while direct appellate review of the adjudication remains available.

      (b) When the petitioner sought and obtained direct appellate review of the adjudication, no ground for relief may be asserted in a petition for relief under ORS 419C.615 unless the ground was not asserted and could not reasonably have been asserted in the direct appellate review proceeding. If the petitioner was not represented by counsel in the direct appellate review proceeding, due to lack of funds to retain such counsel and the failure of the court to appoint counsel for that proceeding, any ground for relief under ORS 419C.615 that was not specifically decided by the appellate court may be asserted in the petition described in ORS 419C.615.

      (2) The court may grant leave, at any time prior to entry of an order granting or denying relief, to withdraw the petition. The court may make appropriate orders as to the amendment of the petition or any other pleading, as to the filing of further pleadings, or as to extending the time of filing of any pleading other than the original petition.

      (3) All grounds for relief claimed in a petition described in ORS 419C.615 must be asserted in the original or amended petition, and any grounds not asserted are deemed waived, unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted therein that could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition. However, any prior petition or amended petition that was withdrawn prior to the entry of an order granting or denying relief by leave of the court, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, has no effect on the right of the petitioner to bring a subsequent petition. [2001 c.803 §4]

 

      419C.617 Time limitation for certain adults seeking relief under ORS 419C.615. If a person seeking relief under ORS 419C.615 is over 18 years of age and is no longer within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the petition must be filed within two years of the following, unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted therein that could not reasonably have been raised in the original petition or an amended petition:

      (1) If no appeal is taken, the date the juvenile court adjudication was entered in the register.

      (2) If an appeal is taken, the date the appeal is final in the Oregon appellate courts. [2001 c.803 §5]

 

REPORTS BY AGENCY HAVING GUARDIANSHIP OR LEGAL CUSTODY

 

      419C.620 Circumstances requiring report. When required by the court, the Oregon Youth Authority or a private agency having guardianship or legal custody of a youth offender pursuant to court order shall file reports on the youth offender with the juvenile court that entered the original order concerning the youth offender. [1993 c.33 §263; 1999 c.92 §2; 2005 c.159 §5]

 

      419C.623 Frequency and content of report. (1) The Oregon Youth Authority or private agency shall file the reports required by ORS 419C.620 at times required by the court, required by the youth offender’s reformation plan or case plan and as determined necessary by the youth authority or agency. The youth authority or agency shall file reports more frequently if the court so orders. The reports shall include, but need not be limited to:

      (a) A description of the offenses that necessitated the placement of the youth offender with the youth authority or agency;

      (b) A description of the youth offender’s risk to reoffend and an analysis of the need for services and assistance; and

      (c) A proposed reformation plan or case plan, or proposed continuation or modification of an existing reformation plan or case plan, including, where applicable, a description of services to be provided in furtherance of the youth offender’s reformation and safe return to the community.

      (2) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, reports following the first report that is required by subsection (1) of this section need not contain information contained in prior reports.

      (3) Notwithstanding the requirements under ORS 419C.620 that reports be filed with the court, any report after the first report that is required by subsection (1) of this section on a youth offender whose case is being regularly reviewed by a local citizen review board shall be filed with that local citizen review board rather than with the court. [1993 c.33 §264; 1999 c.92 §3; 2005 c.159 §6]

 

      419C.626 Review hearing by court; findings; appeal. (1) Upon receiving a report required by ORS 419C.620:

      (a) The court may hold a hearing to review the youth offender’s condition and circumstances and to determine if the court should continue jurisdiction over the youth offender or order modifications in the custody, placement and supervision of the youth offender.

      (b) And if requested by the youth offender, the attorney for the youth offender, if any, the parents of the youth offender if parental rights have not been terminated, a court appointed special advocate, a local citizen review board, the Oregon Youth Authority, a district attorney or a private agency having guardianship or legal custody of the youth offender, the court shall hold a hearing within 30 days of receipt of the request.

      (2) The court, on its own motion, may hold a review hearing at any time. Unless good cause otherwise is shown, the court shall hold a review hearing at any time upon the request of the youth offender, the attorney for the youth offender, if any, the parents of the youth offender if parental rights have not been terminated, a court appointed special advocate, a local citizen review board, the youth authority, a district attorney or a private agency having guardianship or legal custody of the youth offender.

      (3) A hearing under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall be conducted in the manner provided in ORS 419C.400 (1), 419C.405 and 419C.408, except that the court may receive testimony and reports as provided in ORS 419C.400 (4). At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall enter findings of fact if the decision is to continue the youth offender in an out-of-home placement in the legal custody of the youth authority or a private agency. The findings shall specifically state:

      (a) Why continued out-of-home placement is necessary as opposed to returning the youth offender to the youth offender’s home or promptly securing another placement;

      (b) The expected timetable for return home; and

      (c) Whether the youth offender’s reformation plan or case plan should be modified.

      (4) The court may direct the local citizen review board to review the status of the youth offender prior to the court’s next review under ORS 419A.106, 419A.108, 419A.110, 419A.112, 419A.116 and 419A.118.

      (5) Any final decision of the court made pursuant to a hearing under subsection (1) or (2) of this section is appealable under ORS 419A.200. [1993 c.33 §265; 1999 c.92 §4; 2001 c.480 §10; 2001 c.910 §6; 2005 c.159 §7; 2005 c.843 §26]

 

      419C.629 Distribution of report by court. Except when a youth offender has been surrendered for adoption or the parents’ rights have been terminated, the court shall send a copy of a report required by ORS 419C.620 to the parents of the youth offender and shall notify the parents either that a hearing will be held or that the parents may request a hearing at which time they may ask for modifications in the custody, placement and supervision of the youth offender. If the court finds that informing the parents of the identity and location of the foster parents of the youth offender or providing other information in the youth offender’s reformation plan or case plan is not in the best interest of the youth offender, the court may order the information deleted from the report before sending the report to the parents. [1993 c.33 §266; 1999 c.92 §6; 2005 c.159 §8]

 

      419C.640 [1993 c.33 §267; repealed by 1999 c.92 §7]

 

      419C.650 [1993 c.33 §268; 2003 c.396 §136; repealed by 2005 c.159 §10]

      (2) The court shall notify the parties listed in ORS 419C.626 and any other interested parties of the hearing. The notice shall state the time and place of the hearing. Upon request of the court, the Oregon Youth Authority or other legal custodian of the youth offender shall provide the court with information concerning the whereabouts and identity of such parties. If the victim requests notice, the district attorney or juvenile department shall notify the victim of the time and place of the hearing. [1993 c.33 §269; 2003 c.396 §137; 2005 c.159 §9; 2007 c.609 §24]

      (4) The county court or board of county commissioners of any county may provide by ordinance for a curfew restriction on minors applicable to areas not within a city, which has the same terms provided in subsection (1) of this section except that the period of curfew may include hours in addition to those specified in subsection (1) of this section. The ordinance may provide different periods of curfew for different age groups.
