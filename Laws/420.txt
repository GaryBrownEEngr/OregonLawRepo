      (5) “Youth offender” has the meaning given that term in ORS 419A.004. [1965 c.616 §29; 1969 c.597 §128; 1971 c.401 §96; 1985 c.229 §1; 1995 c.422 §88; 1999 c.109 §4; 2001 c.295 §13; 2003 c.396 §139]

 

      420.010 [Repealed by 1965 c.616 §101]

 

      420.011 Admissions to youth correction facilities; assignment of persons within custody of Department of Corrections; temporary assignment; return to Department of Corrections custody. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, admissions to the youth correction facilities are limited to youth offenders who are at least 12 but less than 19 years of age, found by the juvenile court to have committed an act that if committed by an adult would constitute aggravated murder, murder, a felony or a Class A misdemeanor and placed in the legal custody of the Oregon Youth Authority. A youth offender admitted to a youth correction facility may not be transferred by administrative process to any penal or correctional institution.

      (2)(a) In addition to the persons placed in the legal custody of the youth authority under ORS 419C.478 (1) or 419C.481, and with the concurrence of the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority or the director’s designee, persons who are committed to the Department of Corrections under ORS 137.124 and meet the requirements of ORS 137.124 (5) or (7) may be temporarily assigned to a youth correction facility as provided by ORS 137.124 (5) or (7). A person assigned on such a temporary basis remains within the legal custody of the Department of Corrections and such reassignment is subject to termination by the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority by referring the person back to the Department of Corrections as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) After a person is transferred to the physical custody of the youth authority under ORS 137.124 (5) or (7), the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority may refer the person back to the Department of Corrections for physical custody and placement if the director, after consulting with the Department of Corrections, determines that the person is at least 18 years of age and:

      (A) Poses a substantial danger to youth authority staff or persons in the custody of the youth authority; or

      (B) Is not likely, in the foreseeable future, to benefit from the rehabilitation and treatment programs administered by the youth authority and is appropriate for placement in a Department of Corrections institution.

      (3) Any person under 18 years of age at the time of committing the crime and under 20 years of age at the time of sentencing and commitment who, after waiver under ORS 419C.349, 419C.352, 419C.364 or 419C.370 or sentencing under ORS 137.707 (5)(b)(A) or (7)(b) or 137.712, is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections, and any person under 16 years of age who after waiver under ORS 419C.349, 419C.352, 419C.364 or 419C.370 or sentencing under ORS 137.707 (5)(b)(A) or (7)(b) or 137.712 is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the county jail, shall be temporarily assigned to a youth correction facility by the Department of Corrections, or by the sheriff to whose custody the person has been committed, pursuant to ORS 137.124 (6). The director shall designate the appropriate youth correction facility or schools for such assignment. A person assigned to a youth correction facility under ORS 137.124 (6) and this subsection remains within the legal custody of the Department of Corrections or sheriff to whose custody the person was committed. The assignment of such a person to the youth correction facility is subject, when the person is 18 years of age or older, to termination by the director by referring the person back to the Department of Corrections or the sheriff to serve the balance of the person’s sentence. Assignment to a youth correction facility pursuant to ORS 137.124 (6) and this subsection, if not terminated earlier by the director, shall terminate upon the person’s attaining the age specified in ORS 420A.010 (5) setting the age limits for which the Oregon Youth Authority may retain legal and physical custody of the person, and the person shall be referred to the Department of Corrections or the sheriff having legal custody of the person to serve the balance of the person’s sentence.

      (4) Whenever a person committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections is temporarily assigned to a youth correction facility pursuant to this section, the youth authority may provide programs and treatment for the person, and may adopt rules relating to conditions of confinement at the youth correction facility, as the youth authority determines are appropriate. However, the person remains subject to laws and rules of the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision relating to parole. [1965 c.616 §31; 1969 c.679 §5; 1971 c.401 §98; 1971 c.458 §1; 1975 c.182 §1; 1983 c.815 §2; 1985 c.631 §7; 1987 c.320 §159; 1993 c.33 §343; 1993 c.546 §122; 1995 c.422 §§89,89a; 1995 c.423 §28; 1997 c.433 §13; 1999 c.109 §1; 2003 c.396 §140; 2017 c.134 §2]

      (2) The juvenile departments shall develop a plan for services needed to divert the commitment of youth from the youth correction facilities, and how these services are to be administered if funds are provided. The plan must be approved in the form of a resolution by the governing body of the appropriate county and of a letter of concurrence from the presiding judge for the judicial district in which the juvenile court is located.

      (3) The youth authority shall develop and implement a statewide diversion plan after taking the local juvenile departments’ plans into consideration and after consulting with affected service providers. [1985 c.500 §7; 1993 c.676 §47; 1993 c.742 §88; 1995 c.422 §91; 1995 c.781 §44; 2012 c.37 §98]

 

      420.019 Implementation of diversion plan. (1)(a) The Oregon Youth Authority may contract with the governing body of a county or two or more counties, if the counties have joined together as a consortium or region, for implementing the statewide diversion plan, which may include juvenile parole and probation services or out-of-home placement.

      (b) A county or counties that contract with the Oregon Youth Authority under this section shall have access to a continuum of out-of-home placement options including, but not limited to, youth correction facilities, youth care centers, foster care and private placements. Participating counties shall be ensured access to an equitable share of out-of-home placements.

      (c) A county or counties that contract with the Oregon Youth Authority under this section have the responsibility for parole decisions regarding youths from the county or counties committed to youth correction facilities. In the event that a county or counties are operating over the allocated youth correction facility cap, the youth authority may assume parole authority until the county population is at the cap.

      (d) The state and county may agree that the governing body of the county or counties may subcontract for services or that the state will provide services or that the county or counties may subcontract for some services and the state provide other services as stipulated in the contract with the youth authority.

      (e) When services previously provided by the Oregon Youth Authority transfer to a county or counties, terms of the contract must include, but need not be limited to, the actual cost of employee salaries, benefits and other payroll expenses, plus support costs necessary for the transferred positions.

      (f) The youth authority is responsible for performance auditing of contracts and subcontracts.

      (g) The youth authority shall contract directly with service providers in those counties where the governing body of the county or counties chooses not to contract with the youth authority.

      (h) The funds provided to implement the diversion plan or provide for out-of-home placement or parole and probation services shall not be used by a county to supplant moneys otherwise provided to the county juvenile department for services to delinquent youth.

      (2)(a) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a county that is contracting with the youth authority under subsection (1) of this section shall supervise state employees providing parole and probation services within the county.

      (b) Subject to a collective bargaining agreement, supervision under this subsection includes discipline, performance evaluation, training and all other functions previously carried out by state employed supervisors. [1985 c.500 §8; 1995 c.422 §92; 1997 c.249 §134]

      420.031 Wardship over youth offender at youth correction facility; legal custody of youth offender. (1) The granting of legal custody and guardianship over the youth offender to the Oregon Youth Authority does not terminate the juvenile court’s jurisdiction over the youth offender.

      (2) Upon parole of the youth offender from a youth correction facility, the legal custody of the youth offender is vested in the parents of the youth offender or other person to whom the youth offender is returned, subject to ORS 420.045 (3). [Formerly 420.015; 1969 c.679 §8; 1971 c.401 §99; 1995 c.422 §94; 2003 c.396 §141]

      (2) At such time as the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority finds that final release is compatible with the safety of the community and the best interests of the youth offender, with the consent of the committing court, the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority may make and issue a final order discharging the youth offender.

      (3) The Director of the Oregon Youth Authority may revoke a parole if the conditions of the parole have been violated or if the continuation of the youth offender on parole would not be in the best interests of the youth offender or the community. After the revocation of parole, the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority shall immediately advise the committing court thereof. [1965 c.616 §37; 1969 c.679 §9; 1971 c.401 §101; 1995 c.422 §96]

      (3) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 192.431, the youth authority, a school district or a school administrator, or anyone employed or acting on behalf of the youth authority, school district or school administrator, who sends or receives records under this section is not liable civilly or criminally for failing to disclose the information under this section.

      (2) There is employment of capable and trained or experienced personnel.

      (3) The youth care programs include educational, vocational, recreational and counseling opportunities that will be in the best interests of the youth.

      (4) A county must demonstrate that an adequate probation system for youths exists in the county in order to be eligible for state support for a youth care center. [1967 c.444 §3; 1971 c.401 §64; 1989 c.41 §1; 1995 c.422 §117; 2009 c.595 §376]

 

      420.875 Application for state support of center; required reports. (1) An approved youth care center is eligible for state support from funds appropriated to the Oregon Youth Authority for that purpose to meet its operating expenses. Public or private agencies operating a youth care center shall make application for state support to the youth authority. The application shall contain such information as may be required by the youth authority.

      (2) Upon receiving the application, the youth authority shall cause an investigation of the affairs and methods of the youth care center and, if it finds that the center meets the requirements of ORS 420.870, shall grant its application for state support.

      (3) At such times as the youth authority may require, all youth care centers receiving state support under the provisions of ORS 420.855 to 420.885, shall file with the youth authority a financial and statistical report, and a report on the content and conduct of the youth care center, in such form as may be prescribed by the youth authority.

[1967 c.444 §6; 1969 c.196 §2; 1971 c.401 §66; 1971 c.698 §6; 1974 c.57 §1; 1977 c.279 §1; 1985 c.500 §11; 1995 c.422 §119; 2001 c.295 §7]

 

      420.885 Audit and payment of claims. (1) The youth care center shall present to the Oregon Youth Authority an itemized statement showing the names of the youths being cared for during the period for which the statement is submitted and the amount which the center claims for the period. The youth authority shall investigate the claim and approve only that portion which is in accordance with the provisions of ORS 420.855 to 420.885 and the rules of the youth authority.

      (2) When certified by the youth authority, claim for state reimbursements shall be presented to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and paid in the same manner as the claims against the state are paid.

      (3) If the center is operated jointly by more than one public or private agency, each agency participating in the operation shall be entitled to a pro rata share of the amount due, to be determined by the contribution of each to the operating cost of the center. [1967 c.444 §7; 1969 c.196 §3; 1971 c.401 §67; 1995 c.422 §120]
