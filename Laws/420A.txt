      (b) Provide capital improvements and capital construction necessary for the implementation of all youth correction facilities;

      (c) Carry out dispositions of youth offenders committed to its legal custody;

      (d) Exercise custody and supervision over those youth offenders committed to the youth authority by order of the juvenile court and persons placed in the physical custody of the youth authority under ORS 137.124 or other statute until the time that a lawful release authority authorizes release or terminates the commitment or placement;

      (e) Provide adequate food, clothing, health and medical care, sanitation and security for confined youth offenders and others in youth authority custody;

      (f) Provide youth offenders and others in youth authority custody with opportunities for self-improvement and work; and

      (g) Conduct investigations and prepare reports for release authorities.

      (2) To meet the individual circumstances of each person committed to its custody, the youth authority shall:

      (a) Develop a flexible fee-for-service provider system that can respond quickly to each person’s identified and changing circumstances; and

      (b) Develop a process for joint state and county review of contracts entered into under subsection (6)(b) of this section and paragraph (a) of this subsection based on:

      (A) Measurable outcomes, which must include in dominant part the reduction of future criminal or antisocial conduct and which also must include:

      (i) Academic progress;

      (ii) Social adjustments;

      (iii) Behavioral improvements;

      (iv) Rearrests; and

      (v) Other measurements as determined by the youth authority;

      (ii) Compliance with state and federal regulations;

      (iii) Record keeping, including data collection and management; and

      (iv) Reporting; and

      (C) Provision of services identified under the reformation plan.

      (3) In order to measure performance as required in subsection (2) of this section, the youth authority shall require parties to the contracts to compile, manage and exchange data to the extent of available information systems resources to facilitate the measurement of outcomes including, but not limited to, reduction in future criminal or antisocial conduct.

      (4) The youth authority may administer a program of state assistance to counties for the construction and operation of local youth detention facilities or to purchase detention services.

      (5) The youth authority shall accept and exercise legal or physical custody of youth offenders and others 12 years of age and over and under 25 years of age who are committed to, or placed with, the youth authority pursuant to:

      (a) Be cognizant of and sensitive to the issue of overrepresentation of minority youth offenders in youth correction facilities;

      (c) Keep data reflecting the ethnicity and gender of all youth offenders committed to its care.

      (11) The youth authority is a designated agency as defined in ORS 181A.010. [1995 c.422 §2; 1997 c.433 §7; 2003 c.396 §142; 2011 c.545 §53]
