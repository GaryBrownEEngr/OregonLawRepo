      (2) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.

      (3) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided, that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.

      (4) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.

The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

ARTICLE V

ACTS NOT REVIEWABLE IN RECEIVING STATE; EXTRADITION

      (1) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.

      (2) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which the inmate is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

ARTICLE IX

OTHER ARRANGEMENTS UNAFFECTED

ALTERNATIVE INCARCERATION PROGRAM

 

      421.500 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) There is no method in this state for diverting sentenced offenders from a traditional correctional setting;

      (2) The absence of a program that instills discipline, enhances self-esteem and promotes alternatives to criminal behavior has a major impact on overcrowding of prisons and criminal recidivism in this state; and

      (3) An emergency need exists to implement a highly structured corrections program that involves intensive mental and physical training and substance abuse treatment. [1993 c.681 §1; 1999 c.239 §2]

 

      Note: 421.500 to 421.512 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 421 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (2) “Department” means the Department of Corrections.

      (3) “Program” means the special alternative incarceration program established under ORS 421.504 and the intensive alternative incarceration addiction program established under ORS 421.506. [1993 c.681 §2; 1999 c.239 §1; 2003 c.464 §3; 2008 c.35 §3]

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the department may convert the special alternative incarceration program required by this section into an intensive alternative incarceration addiction program as described in ORS 421.506 if the department determines that the needs of offenders in the department’s custody would be better served by an intensive alternative incarceration addiction program than by the special alternative incarceration program. [1993 c.681 §3; 1997 c.63 §3; 2005 c.271 §7; 2005 c.708 §12; 2007 c.617 §1; 2009 c.595 §380]

      (b) The offender has served a term of incarceration of at least one year.

      (5) An offender may not be released on post-prison supervision under subsection (4) of this section if the release would reduce the term of incarceration the offender would otherwise be required to serve by more than 20 percent.

      (6) For the purposes of calculating the term of incarceration served under subsection (4)(b) of this section, the department shall include:

      (a) The time that an offender is confined under ORS 137.370 (2)(a); and

      (b) The time for which an offender is granted nonprison leave under ORS 421.510.

      (7) Successful completion of a program does not relieve the offender from fulfilling any other obligations imposed as part of the sentence including, but not limited to, the payment of restitution and fines. [1993 c.681 §4; 1997 c.313 §17; 2003 c.464 §4; 2008 c.35 §4]

      (3) An offender may submit a nonprison leave plan to the Department of Corrections. The plan shall indicate that the offender has secured an employment, educational or other transitional opportunity in the community to which the offender will be released and that a leave of up to 90 days is an essential part of the offender’s successful reintegration into the community.

      (4) Upon verification of the offender’s nonprison leave plan, the department may grant nonprison leave no more than 90 days prior to the offender’s date of release on post-prison supervision under ORS 421.508 (4).

      (5) The department shall establish by rule a set of conditions for offenders released on nonprison leave. An offender on nonprison leave shall be subject to immediate return to prison for any violation of the conditions of nonprison leave.

      (6) During the period of nonprison leave, the offender must reside in, and be supervised within, the state. [1997 c.63 §2; 2003 c.464 §5; 2008 s.35 §5]

(1) Notwithstanding ORS 169.690, 195.025, 197.180, 215.130 (4) and 227.286 or any other provision of law, including but not limited to statutes, ordinances, regulations and charter provisions, the decisions of the Corrections Facilities Siting Authority, if approved by the Governor, shall bind the state and all counties, cities and political subdivisions in this state as to the approval of the sites and the construction and operation of the proposed corrections facilities. Affected state agencies, counties, cities and political subdivisions shall issue the appropriate permits, licenses and certificates and enter into any intergovernmental agreements as necessary for construction and operation of the facilities, subject only to the conditions of the siting decisions.

      (2) Each state or local governmental agency that issues a permit, license or certificate shall continue to exercise enforcement authority over the permit, license or certificate.

      (3) Except as provided in subsections (4) to (16) of this section, nothing in ORS 421.611 to 421.630 expands or alters the obligations of cities, counties and political subdivisions to pay for infrastructure improvements for the proposed corrections facilities.

      (4) The Department of Corrections shall seek to obtain public services necessary for the construction and operation of corrections facilities from a public body providing such services. The department shall not acquire or develop and furnish its own public services under this section that could be provided by a public body unless the department concludes that the state can achieve significant cost savings by doing so.

      (5) Upon request of the Department of Corrections, a public body furnishing public services shall make public services available to the department that are either necessary for the construction and operation of a corrections facility or required by additions to or remodeling of a corrections facility sited or constructed under ORS 421.611 to 421.630 or any other law. All rates, terms and conditions of furnishing public services shall be just, fair and reasonable. A just, fair and reasonable rate shall assure the public body the recovery of the additional costs of providing and maintaining the requested service to the corrections facility, including, but not limited to, feasibility and design engineering costs, and reasonable capacity replacement, but shall not exceed the public body’s actual capital and operating expenses, including reasonable reserves charged to all ratepayers, for such service. The public body’s rates, terms and conditions shall be conclusively deemed to be just, fair and reasonable if the department and public body so agree in writing.

      (6) If the Department of Corrections and the public body cannot agree on the rates, terms and conditions of furnishing necessary public services to a corrections facility, either the department or the public body may deliver to the other a notice of request to mediate any disputed issues, including, but not limited to, whether the department can achieve significant cost savings to the state by acquiring or developing and furnishing its own public services. If either the department or the public body requests mediation, the other shall participate in good faith in such mediation. Unless otherwise agreed by the department and the public body, the mediation shall be concluded within 30 days of delivery of the notice of request to mediate.

      (7) If the mediation fails to resolve the issues in dispute, or if mediation is not requested by either the Department of Corrections or the public body, the department and the public body may agree to submit any disputed matters to arbitration. The arbitration may be either binding or nonbinding. If the department and the public body cannot agree on the selection of the arbitrator and the arbitration rules and procedure, upon motion directed to the Court of Appeals, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals shall select the arbitrator and decide the rules and procedure. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be guided by the standards set forth in this section. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the department and the public body only if they agree to enter into binding arbitration prior to the initiation of the arbitration. If the department and public body have agreed to binding arbitration of disputed issues, either the department or the public body, if dissatisfied with the arbitrator’s decision and award, may file exceptions in the Court of Appeals within 21 days of the issuance of the decision and award. Exceptions shall be limited to the causes set forth in ORS 36.705 (1)(a) to (d), and to the grounds for modification or correction of an award under ORS 36.710. If any of the exceptions requires consideration of facts that do not appear on the face of the arbitrator’s decision and award or is not stipulated to by the parties, the court may appoint a master to take evidence and make the necessary factual findings. The Court of Appeals’ decision shall be final and not subject to further review.

      (8) If the Department of Corrections and the public body have submitted disputed matters to nonbinding arbitration or if the department and public body have chosen not to submit disputed matters to arbitration, the department shall issue a preliminary order to the public body that either concludes that the state can achieve significant costs savings by acquiring or developing and furnishing its own public services, or establishes the rates, terms and conditions upon which the public body shall make necessary public services available to the department for the corrections facility. The public body, no later than 15 days following the department’s issuance of its preliminary order, may contest the preliminary order by filing a written notice to that effect with the department. The preliminary order shall become final, binding and conclusive if the public body fails to request a hearing within the time permitted in this section.

      (9) If a hearing is requested, the department shall provide the public body with an opportunity to be heard and shall issue its final order upon conclusion of the hearing. The department shall establish procedures to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and evidence and the method of taking and furnishing the same in order to afford the public body a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing. The procedures shall ensure that the public body has a reasonable opportunity to place in the record the information upon which the public body relies as a basis for its position. The department’s order shall be guided by the standards set forth in this section.

      (10) Proceedings for review of the department’s final order shall be instituted when the affected public body files a petition with the Court of Appeals that meets the following requirements:

      (a) The petition shall be filed within 21 days of issuance of the final order on which the petition is based.

      (b) The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail upon the Department of Corrections and the Attorney General.

      (11) Within 30 days after service of the petition, the department shall transmit to the Court of Appeals the original or a certified copy of the entire record and any findings that may have been made.

      (12) The Court of Appeals shall review the final order of the Department of Corrections. The Court of Appeals’ decision shall be final and not subject to further review.

      (13) Proceedings for review in the Court of Appeals under this section shall be given priority over all other matters before the Court of Appeals.

      (14) The Department of Corrections or other state agency shall not be required to make payments to the public body for necessary public services to a corrections facility in excess of funds that are legally available for such purposes.

      (15) Nothing in this section shall require a public body to furnish public services to the Department of Corrections for a corrections facility in the event that the Legislative Assembly fails to make funds available in an amount sufficient to pay the state’s share of costs of such services as determined under this section.

      (16) As used in this section, “public services” means off-site infrastructure, including, but not limited to, sewer and water systems and service, and road improvements. [1995 c.745 §9; 1997 c.715 §4; 2003 c.598 §44; 2009 c.231 §7]
