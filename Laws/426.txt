(Commitment Procedure)

 

      426.070 Initiation; notification required; recommendation to court; citation. (1) Any of the following may initiate commitment procedures under this section by giving the notice described under subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) Two persons;

      (b) The local health officer; or

      (c) Any magistrate or judge of a court of a federally recognized Indian tribe located in this state.

      (2) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the notice must comply with the following:

      (a) It must be in writing under oath;

      (b) It must be given to the community mental health program director or a designee of the director in the county where the person alleged to have a mental illness resides;

      (c) It must state that a person within the county other than the person giving the notice is a person with mental illness and is in need of treatment, care or custody;

      (d) If the commitment proceeding is initiated by two persons under subsection (1)(a) of this section, it may include a request that the court notify the two persons:

      (A) Of the issuance or nonissuance of a warrant under this section; or

      (B) Of the court’s determination under ORS 426.130 (1); and

      (e) If the notice contains a request under paragraph (d) of this subsection, it must also include the addresses of the two persons making the request.

      (3) Upon receipt of a notice under subsections (1) and (2) of this section or when notified by a circuit court that the court received notice under ORS 426.234, the community mental health program director, or designee of the director, shall:

      (a) Immediately notify the judge of the court having jurisdiction for that county under ORS 426.060 of the notification described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

      (b) Immediately notify the Oregon Health Authority if commitment is proposed because the person appears to be a person with mental illness, as defined in ORS 426.005 (1)(f)(C). When such notice is received, the authority may verify, to the extent known by the authority, whether or not the person meets the criteria described in ORS 426.005 (1)(f)(C)(i) and (ii) and so inform the community mental health program director or designee of the director.

      (c) Initiate an investigation under ORS 426.074 to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the person is in fact a person with mental illness.

      (4) Upon completion, a recommendation based upon the investigation report under ORS 426.074 shall be promptly submitted to the court. If the community mental health program director determines that probable cause does not exist to believe that a person released from detention under ORS 426.234 (2)(c) or (3)(b) is a person with mental illness, the community mental health program director may recommend assisted outpatient treatment in accordance with ORS 426.133.

      (5) When the court receives notice under subsection (3) of this section:

      (a) If the court, following the investigation, concludes that there is probable cause to believe that the person investigated is a person with mental illness, it shall, through the issuance of a citation as provided in ORS 426.090, cause the person to be brought before it at a time and place as it may direct, for a hearing under ORS 426.095 to determine whether the person is a person with mental illness. The person shall be given the opportunity to appear voluntarily at the hearing unless the person fails to appear or unless the person is detained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b)(A) If the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that failure to take the person into custody pending the investigation or hearing would pose serious harm or danger to the person or to others, the court may issue a warrant of detention to the community mental health program director or designee or the sheriff of the county or designee directing the director, sheriff or a designee to take the person alleged to have a mental illness into custody and produce the person at the time and place stated in the warrant.

      (B) At the time the person is taken into custody, the person shall be informed by the community mental health program director, the sheriff or a designee of the following:

      (i) The person’s rights with regard to representation by or appointment of counsel as described in ORS 426.100;

      (ii) The warning under ORS 426.123; and

      (iii) The person’s right, if the community mental health program director, sheriff or designee reasonably suspects that the person is a foreign national, to communicate with an official from the consulate of the person’s country. A community mental health program director, sheriff or designee is not civilly or criminally liable for failure to provide the information required by this sub-subparagraph. Failure to provide the information required by this sub-subparagraph does not in itself constitute grounds for the exclusion of evidence that would otherwise be admissible in a proceeding.

      (C) The court may make any orders for the care and custody of the person prior to the hearing as it considers necessary.

      (c) If the notice includes a request under subsection (2)(d)(A) of this section, the court shall notify the two persons of the issuance or nonissuance of a warrant under this subsection. [Amended by 1957 c.329 §1; 1967 c.534 §20; 1973 c.838 §3; 1975 c.690 §2; 1979 c.408 §1; 1983 c.740 §149; 1987 c.903 §7; 1989 c.993 §4; 1993 c.484 §26; 1995 c.201 §2; 1995 c.498 §1; 2003 c.14 §235; 2003 c.109 §3; 2009 c.595 §385; 2009 c.828 §26; 2013 c.360 §18; 2013 c.737 §3; 2015 c.461 §2; 2015 c.736 §66; 2019 c.247 §1]

      (d) The treating licensed independent practitioner shall be notified immediately of any seclusion of the person or use of mechanical restraints on the person. Every use of seclusion or mechanical restraint and the reasons for the use shall be made a part of the clinical record of the person over the signature of the treating licensed independent practitioner.

      (e) The treating licensed independent practitioner shall give the person the warning under ORS 426.123 at times the treating licensed independent practitioner determines the person will reasonably understand the notice. This paragraph only requires the notice to be given as often as the licensed independent practitioner determines is necessary to assure that the person is given an opportunity to be aware of the notice.

      (3) The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt rules necessary to carry out this section, including rules regarding the content of the medical record compiled during the current period of custody. [1987 c.903 §9; 1993 c.484 §13; 1997 c.531 §1; 2009 c.595 §386; 2013 c.360 §19; 2015 c.81 §1; 2015 c.461 §3]

      (a) If the person can be located, the investigator shall contact the person within three judicial days from the date the community mental health program director or a designee receives a notice under ORS 426.070 alleging that the person has a mental illness and is in need of treatment.

      (c) The investigator shall be allowed access to licensed independent practitioners, nurses or social workers and to medical records compiled during the current involuntary prehearing period of detention to determine probable cause and to develop alternatives to commitment.

The investigator shall include pertinent parts of the medical record in the investigation report. Records and communications described in this paragraph and related communications are not privileged under ORS 40.230, 40.235, 40.240 or 40.250.

      (C) May order commitment of the person with mental illness to the Oregon Health Authority for treatment if, in the opinion of the court, subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph is not in the best interest of the person. If the court orders commitment under this subparagraph:

      (ii) The authority may place the committed person in outpatient commitment under ORS 426.127.

      (D) Shall order that the person be prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm if, in the opinion of the court, there is a reasonable likelihood the person would constitute a danger to self or others or to the community at large as a result of the person’s mental or psychological state as demonstrated by past behavior or participation in incidents involving unlawful violence or threats of unlawful violence, or by reason of a single incident of extreme, violent, unlawful conduct. When a court makes an order under this subparagraph, the court shall cause a copy of the order to be delivered to the sheriff of the county who will enter the information into the Law Enforcement Data System.

      (b) Is not a person with mental illness, the court shall release the person from custody if the person has been detained under ORS 426.070, 426.180, 426.228, 426.232 or 426.233 and:

      (4) If the court finds that the person is a person with mental illness and either orders commitment under subsection (1)(a)(B) or (C) of this section or enters an order under subsection (1)(a)(D) of this section, the court shall notify the person that the person is prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm under state and federal law unless the person obtains relief from the prohibition from the Psychiatric Security Review Board under ORS 166.273 or under federal law. [Amended by 1973 c.838 §12; 1975 c.690 §8; 1979 c.408 §3; 1987 c.903 §17; 1989 c.839 §36; 1993 c.735 §9; 1995 c.498 §2; 2009 c.595 §393; 2013 c.360 §30; 2013 c.737 §6; 2017 c.233 §2]

 

      426.133 Assisted outpatient treatment. (1) As used in ORS 426.005 to 426.390, “assisted outpatient treatment” may not be construed to be a commitment under ORS 426.130 and does not include taking a person into custody or the forced medication of a person.

      (2) A court may issue an order requiring a person to participate in assisted outpatient treatment if the court finds that the person:

      (a)(A) Is 18 years of age or older;

      (B) Has a mental disorder;

      (C) Will not obtain treatment in the community voluntarily; and

      (D) Is unable to make an informed decision to seek or to comply with voluntary treatment; and

      (b) As a result of being a person described in paragraph (a) of this subsection:

      (A) Is incapable of surviving safely in the community without treatment; and

      (B) Requires treatment to prevent a deterioration in the person’s condition that will predictably result in the person becoming a person with mental illness.

      (3) In determining whether to issue the order under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall consider, but is not limited to considering, the following factors:

      (a) The person’s ability to access finances in order to get food or medicine.

      (b) The person’s ability to obtain treatment for the person’s medical condition.

      (c) The person’s ability to access necessary resources in the community without assistance.

      (d) The degree to which there are risks to the person’s safety.

      (e) The likelihood that the person will decompensate without immediate care or treatment.

      (f) The person’s previous attempts to inflict physical injury on self or others.

      (g) The person’s history of mental health treatment in the community.

      (h) The person’s patterns of decompensation in the past.

      (i) The person’s risk of being victimized or harmed by others.

      (j) The person’s access to the means to inflict harm on self or others.

      (4) The community mental health program director may recommend to the court a treatment plan for a person participating in assisted outpatient treatment. The court may adopt the plan as recommended or with modifications.

      (5) As part of the order under subsection (2) of this section, the court may prohibit the person from purchasing or possessing a firearm during the period of assisted outpatient treatment if, in the opinion of the court, there is a reasonable likelihood the person would constitute a danger to self or others or to the community at large as a result of the person’s mental or psychological state, as demonstrated by past behavior or participation in incidents involving unlawful violence or threats of unlawful violence, or by reason of a single incident of extreme, violent, unlawful conduct. When a court adds a firearm prohibition to an order under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall cause a copy of the order to be delivered to the sheriff of the county, who shall enter the information into the Law Enforcement Data System.

      (6) The court retains jurisdiction over the person until the earlier of the end of the period of the assisted outpatient treatment established under ORS 426.130 (2) or until the court finds that the person no longer meets the criteria in subsection (2) of this section.

      (7) This section does not:

      (a) Prevent a court from appointing a guardian ad litem to act for the person; or

      (b) Require a community mental health program to provide treatment or services to, or supervision of, the person:

      (A) If the county lacks sufficient funds for such purposes; or

      (B) In the case of a county that has declined to operate or contract for a community mental health program, if the public agency or private corporation that contracts with the Oregon Health Authority to provide the program, as described in ORS 430.640, lacks sufficient funds for such purposes. [2013 c.737 §2; 2015 c.50 §11; 2015 c.785 §1]

 

      Note: 426.133 was added to and made a part of 426.005 to 426.390 by legislative action but was not added to any other series. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      426.135 Counsel on appeal; costs of appeal.

Failure to provide the information required by this paragraph does not in itself constitute grounds for the exclusion of evidence that would otherwise be admissible in a proceeding.

      (2)(a) At the time the person is admitted to or retained in a hospital under ORS 426.232, the licensed independent practitioner shall contact the community mental health program director of the county in which the person resides, if the county of residence is different from the county in which the hospital is located. The community mental health program director may request that the licensed independent practitioner notify the circuit court in the county in which the person resides. If the community mental health program director does not make the request, the licensed independent practitioner shall notify, immediately and in writing, the circuit court in the county in which the person is hospitalized.

      (b) At the time the person is admitted to a hospital under ORS 426.232 after being brought to the hospital by a peace officer under ORS 426.228, the licensed independent practitioner shall contact the community mental health program director of the county in which the person is hospitalized.

      (3)(a) At the time the person is admitted to or retained in a nonhospital facility under ORS 426.233, the community mental health program director in the county where the person was taken into custody shall contact the community mental health program director of the county in which the person resides, if the county of residence is different from the county in which the person was taken into custody. The community mental health program director of the county in which the person resides may request that the community mental health program director of the county in which the person was taken into custody notify the circuit court in the county where the person resides. Otherwise, the community mental health program director of the county in which the person was taken into custody shall notify, immediately and in writing, the circuit court in the county in which the person was taken into custody.

      (b) If, at any time prior to the hearing under ORS 426.070 to 426.130, a community mental health program director, after consultation with a licensed independent practitioner, determines that a person admitted or retained under ORS 426.233 is not dangerous to self or to any other person and is not in need of immediate care, custody or treatment for mental illness, the community mental health program director may release the person from detention. The community mental health program director shall immediately notify the circuit court originally notified under paragraph (a) of this subsection of the person’s release from detention.

      (4) When the judge of the circuit court receives notice under subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the judge immediately shall commence proceedings under ORS 426.070 to 426.130. In a county having a population of 100,000 or more, and when feasible in a county with a lesser population, the community mental health program director or designee who directs the peace officer or other authorized individual to take a person into custody under ORS 426.233 shall not also conduct the investigation as provided for under ORS 426.074. Except when a person is being held under ORS 426.237 (1)(b), a person shall not be held under ORS 426.232 or 426.233 for more than five judicial days without a hearing being held under ORS 426.070 to 426.130.

      (5) When the judge of the circuit court receives notice under subsection (2)(c) or (3)(b) of this section that a person has been released, and unless the court receives the recommendation required by ORS 426.070 (4), the judge shall dismiss the case no later than 14 days after the date the person was initially detained.

      (c) Recommend, in an investigation report as provided in ORS 426.074, that the circuit court hold a hearing under ORS 426.070 to 426.130 if the community mental health program director has probable cause to believe the person is a person with mental illness or that the person is in need of assisted outpatient treatment.

      (2)(a) If the circuit court adopts the recommendation of the community mental health program director under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the circuit court shall enter an order releasing the person and dismissing the case. Unless the person agrees to voluntary treatment, if the person is being detained in a:

      (A) Nonhospital facility, the community mental health program director shall make discharge plans and ensure the discharge of the person.

      (B) Hospital, the licensed independent practitioner who is treating the person shall make discharge plans and discharge the person.

      (b) Upon release of the person, the community mental health program director shall attempt to notify the person’s next of kin if the person consents to the notification.

Within 24 hours of the time the certificate is delivered to the court, the person’s attorney shall review the certificate with the person. If the person and the person’s attorney consent to the certification within one judicial day of the time the certificate is delivered to the circuit court and, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the court shall postpone the hearing required by ORS 426.070 to 426.130 for 14 days.

      (f) If the person is in a nonhospital facility, the community mental health program director may discharge the person at any time during the 14-day period. The community mental health program director shall consult with the licensed independent practitioner who is treating the person and the person’s next of kin, if the person consents to the consultation, prior to discharging the person. Immediately upon discharge of the person, the community mental health program director shall notify the court in the county in which the certificate was filed initially.

      (g) The person may agree to voluntary treatment at any time during the 14-day period. When a person agrees to voluntary treatment under this paragraph, the community mental health program director immediately shall notify the court in the county in which the certificate was filed initially.

      (h) A person consenting to 14 days of treatment under subsection (3)(c) of this section shall not be held longer than 14 days from the time of consenting without a hearing as provided in ORS 426.070 to 426.130.

      (4) For purposes of this section and ORS 426.310, “resident” means resident of the county in which the person maintains a current mailing address or, if the person does not maintain a current mailing address within the state, the county in which the person is found, or the county in which a court-committed person has been conditionally released.

      (5)(a) The authority may deny payment for part or all of the emergency psychiatric services provided by a hospital or nonhospital facility under ORS 426.232, 426.233 or 426.237 when the authority finds, upon review, that the condition of the person alleged to have a mental illness did not meet the admission criteria in ORS 426.232 (1), 426.233 (1) or 426.237 (1)(b)(A). The payer responsible under this section shall make a request for denial of payment for emergency psychiatric services provided under ORS 426.232, 426.233 or 426.237 in writing to the authority.

      426.275 Effect of failure to adhere to condition of placement. The following are applicable to placements of persons with mental illness that are made as conditional release under ORS 426.125, outpatient commitments under ORS 426.127 or trial visits under ORS 426.273 as described:

      (1) If the individual responsible under this subsection determines that a person with mental illness is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of the placement, the responsible individual shall notify the court having jurisdiction that the person with mental illness is not adhering to the terms and conditions of the placement. If the placement is an outpatient commitment under ORS 426.127 or a trial visit under ORS 426.273, the notifications shall include a copy of the conditions for the placement. The individual responsible for notifying the court under this subsection is as follows:

      (a) For conditional releases under ORS 426.125, the guardian, relative or friend in whose care the person with mental illness is conditionally released.

      (2) On its own motion, the court with jurisdiction of a person with mental illness on placement may cause the person to be brought before it for a hearing to determine whether the person is or is not adhering to the terms and conditions of the placement. The person shall have the same rights with respect to notice, detention stay, hearing and counsel as for a hearing held under ORS 426.095. The court shall hold the hearing within five judicial days of the date the person with mental illness receives notice under this section. The court may allow postponement and detention during postponement as provided under ORS 426.095.

      (3) Pursuant to the determination of the court upon hearing under this section, a person on placement shall either continue the placement on the same or modified conditions or shall be returned to the Oregon Health Authority for involuntary care and treatment on an inpatient basis subject to discharge at the end of the commitment period or as otherwise provided under this chapter.

      (4) If the person on placement is living in a county other than the county of the court that established the current period of commitment under ORS 426.130 during which the trial visit, conditional release or outpatient commitment takes place, the court establishing the current period of commitment shall transfer jurisdiction to the appropriate court of the county in which the person is living while on the placement and the court receiving the transfer shall accept jurisdiction.

      (b) Determines that the person is a person with mental illness on conditional release under ORS 426.125, outpatient commitment under ORS 426.127 or trial visit under ORS 426.273.

If the court is advised that the person is competent, the court shall enter an order to that effect. If the court is advised that the person is not competent, upon petition of the person, the guardian, relative or creditor of the person or other interested person, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether or not the discharged person is competent. The court shall serve a copy of any order entered pursuant to this subsection on the person and forward a copy of such order to the committing court. [1965 c.628 §2; 1967 c.460 §1; 1969 c.391 §7]

 

      426.297 Payment of expenses for proceeding under ORS 426.295. (1) The expenses of a proceeding under ORS 426.295 (2) shall be paid by the person with mental illness, unless it appears from the affidavit of the person or other evidence that the person is unable to pay the expenses.

(1) The Oregon Health Authority shall, by filing a written certificate with the last committing court and the court of residence, discharge an individual from court commitment, except one held upon an order of a court or judge having criminal jurisdiction in an action or proceeding arising out of criminal offense, if the authority finds that the individual is no longer a person with mental illness or that the transfer of the individual to a voluntary status is in the individual’s best interest.

      (2) The authority may sign applications for public assistance, as defined in ORS 411.010, medical assistance, as defined in ORS 414.025, or any other state or federal benefits on behalf of those individuals who may be eligible for public assistance, medical assistance or any other state or federal benefits upon discharge.

The authority, pursuant to its rules, may delegate to the director of the treating facility the responsibility for making the certification. The director of the treating facility shall consult with the community mental health program director of the county of residence prior to making the certification.

      (5) When serving the certification upon the person, the authority shall read and deliver the certification to the person and ask whether the person protests a further period of commitment. The person may protest further commitment either orally or by signing a simple protest form to be given to the person with the certification. If the person does not protest a further period of commitment within 14 days of service of the certification, the authority or facility shall so notify the court and the court shall, without further hearing, order the commitment of the person for an additional indefinite period of time up to 180 days.

The court may consider as evidence such reports and testimony.

      (6) The court shall then conduct a hearing and after hearing the evidence and reviewing the recommendations of the treating and examining physicians or other qualified professionals, the court shall determine whether the person is still a person with mental illness and is in need of further treatment. If in the opinion of the court the individual is still a person with mental illness by clear and convincing evidence and is in need of further treatment, the court may order commitment to the authority for an additional indefinite period of time up to 180 days.

      (7) At the end of the 180-day period, the person shall be released unless the authority or facility again certifies to the committing court that the person is still a person with mental illness and is in need of further treatment, in which event the procedures set forth in ORS 426.301 to 426.307 shall be followed.

      426.670 Treatment programs for sexually dangerous persons. The Oregon Health Authority hereby is directed and authorized to establish and operate treatment programs, either separately within an existing state Department of Corrections institution, as part of an existing program within an Oregon Health Authority institution, or in specified and approved sites in the community to receive, treat, study and retain in custody, as required, such sexually dangerous persons as are committed under ORS 426.510 to 426.670.

(1) When a defendant has been convicted of a sexual offense under ORS 163.305 to 163.467 or 163.525 and there is probable cause to believe the defendant is a sexually dangerous person, the court prior to imposing sentence may continue the time for sentencing and commit the defendant to a facility designated under ORS 426.670 for a period not to exceed 30 days for evaluation and report.

      (2) If the facility reports to the court that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person and that treatment available may reduce the risk of future sexual offenses, the court shall hold a hearing to determine by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person. The state and the defendant shall have the right to call and cross-examine witnesses at such hearing. The defendant may waive the hearing required by this subsection.

      (3) If the court finds that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person and that treatment is available which will reduce the risk of future sexual offenses, it may, in its discretion at the time of sentencing:

      (a) Sentence the defendant to probation on the condition that the person participate in and successfully complete a treatment program for sexually dangerous persons pursuant to ORS 426.670;

      (b) Impose a sentence of imprisonment with the order that the defendant be assigned by the Director of the Department of Corrections to participate in a treatment program for sexually dangerous persons pursuant to ORS 426.670. The Department of Corrections and the Oregon Health Authority shall jointly adopt administrative rules to coordinate assignment and treatment of prisoners under this subsection; or

      (c) Impose any other sentence authorized by law. [1977 c.377 §3; 1979 c.606 §2; 1987 c.320 §231; 1993 c.14 §24; 2009 c.595 §435]

      (b) The trial visit is agreed to by the community mental health program director for the county in which the person would reside.

      (2) Trial visit here shall correspond to trial visit as described in ORS 426.273 to 426.292 and 426.335, except that the length of a trial visit may be for the duration of the period of probation, subject to the consent of the sentencing court.

      (3)(a) Upon receipt of a petition filed under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall schedule a hearing. At the hearing, the court shall order the person committed as an extremely dangerous person with mental illness under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board for a maximum of 24 months if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that:

      (A) The person is extremely dangerous;

      (B) The person suffers from a mental disorder that is resistant to treatment; and

      (C) Because of the mental disorder that is resistant to treatment, the person committed one of the following acts:

      (b) The court shall further commit the person to a state hospital for custody, care and treatment if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person cannot be controlled in the community with proper care, medication, supervision and treatment on conditional release.

      (c) The court shall specify in the order whether any person who would be considered a victim as defined in ORS 131.007 of the act described in paragraph (a)(C) of this subsection, if the act had been criminally prosecuted, requests notification of any order or hearing, conditional release, discharge or escape of the person committed under this section.

      (d) The court shall be fully advised of all drugs and other treatment known to have been administered to the alleged extremely dangerous person with mental illness that may substantially affect the ability of the person to prepare for, or to function effectively at, the hearing.

      (e) The provisions of ORS 40.230, 40.235, 40.240, 40.250 and 179.505 do not apply to the use of the examiner’s report and the court may consider the report as evidence.

      (4) The findings of the court that a person committed an act described in subsection (3)(a)(C) of this section may not be admitted in a criminal prosecution.

      (5) A person committed under this section shall remain under the jurisdiction of the board for a maximum of 24 months unless the board conducts a hearing and makes the findings described in subsection (6)(d) of this section.

      (6)(a) The board shall hold a hearing six months after the initial commitment described in subsection (3) of this section, and thereafter six months after a further commitment described in ORS 426.702, to determine the placement of the person and whether the person is eligible for conditional release or early discharge. The board shall provide written notice of the hearing to the person, the person’s legal counsel and the office of the district attorney who filed the initial petition under subsection (2) of this section within a reasonable time prior to the hearing. The board shall further notify the person of the following:

      (A) The nature of the hearing and possible outcomes;

      (B) The right to appear at the hearing and present evidence;

      (C) The right to be represented by legal counsel and, if the person is without funds to retain legal counsel, the right to have the court appoint legal counsel;

      (D) The right to subpoena witnesses;

      (E) The right to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing; and

      (F) The right to examine all reports, documents and information that the board considers, including the right to examine the reports, documents and information prior to the hearing if available.

      (b) If the board determines at the hearing that the person still suffers from a mental disorder that is resistant to treatment and continues to be extremely dangerous, and that the person cannot be controlled in the community with proper care, medication, supervision and treatment if conditionally released, the person shall remain committed to a state hospital.

      (c) If the board determines at the hearing that the person still suffers from a mental disorder that is resistant to treatment and continues to be extremely dangerous, but finds that the person can be controlled in the community with proper care, medication, supervision and treatment if conditionally released, the board shall conditionally release the person.

      (d) If the board determines at the hearing that the person no longer suffers from a mental disorder that is resistant to treatment or is no longer extremely dangerous, the board shall discharge the person. The discharge of a person committed under this section does not preclude commitment of the person pursuant to ORS 426.005 to 426.390.

      (7)(a) At any time during the commitment to a state hospital, the superintendent of the state hospital may request a hearing to determine the status of the person’s commitment under the jurisdiction of the board. The request shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the facts supporting the request. If the request is for conditional release, the request shall be accompanied by a verified conditional release plan. The hearing shall be conducted as described in subsection (6) of this section.

      (b) The board may make the findings described in subsection (6)(c) of this section and conditionally release the person without a hearing if the office of the district attorney who filed the initial petition under subsection (2) of this section does not object to the conditional release.

      (c) At any time during conditional release, a state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person may request a hearing to determine the status of the person’s commitment under the jurisdiction of the board. The hearing shall be conducted as described in subsection (6) of this section.

      (8)(a) If the board orders the conditional release of a person under subsection (6)(c) of this section, the board shall order conditions of release that may include a requirement to report to any state or local mental health facility for evaluation. The board may further require cooperation with, and acceptance of, psychiatric or psychological treatment from the facility. Conditions of release may be modified by the board from time to time.

      (b) When a person is referred to a state or local mental health facility for an evaluation under this subsection, the facility shall perform the evaluation and submit a written report of its findings to the board. If the facility finds that treatment of the person is appropriate, the facility shall include its recommendations for treatment in the report to the board.

      (c) Whenever treatment is provided to the person by a state or local mental health facility under this subsection, the facility shall furnish reports to the board on a regular basis concerning the progress of the person.

      (d) Copies of all reports submitted to the board pursuant to this subsection shall be furnished to the person and to the person’s legal counsel, if applicable. The confidentiality of these reports is determined pursuant to ORS 192.338, 192.345 and 192.355.

      (e) The state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person under this subsection shall comply with the conditional release order and any modifications of the conditions ordered by the board.

      (9)(a) If at any time while the person is conditionally released it appears that the person has violated the terms of the conditional release, the board may order the person returned to a state hospital for evaluation or treatment. A written order of the board is sufficient warrant for any law enforcement officer to take the person into custody. A sheriff, municipal police officer, parole or probation officer or other peace officer shall execute the order, and the person shall be returned to the state hospital as soon as practicable.

      (b) The director of a state or local mental health facility providing treatment to a person under subsection (8) of this section may request that the board issue a written order for a person on conditional release to be taken into custody if there is reason to believe that the person can no longer be controlled in the community with proper care, medication, supervision and treatment.

      (c) Within 30 days following the return of the person to a state hospital, the board shall conduct a hearing to determine if, by a preponderance of the evidence, the person is no longer fit for conditional release. The board shall provide written notice of the hearing to the person, the person’s legal counsel and the office of the district attorney who filed the initial petition under subsection (2) of this section within a reasonable time prior to the hearing. The notice shall advise the person of the nature of the hearing, the right to have the court appoint legal counsel and the right to subpoena witnesses, examine documents considered by the board and cross-examine all witnesses who appear at the hearing.

      (10)(a) If the person had unadjudicated criminal charges at the time of the person’s initial commitment under this section and the state hospital or the state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person intends to recommend discharge of the person at an upcoming hearing, the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the facility shall provide written notice to the board and the district attorney of the county where the criminal charges were initiated of the discharge recommendation at least 45 days before the hearing. The notice shall be accompanied by a report describing the person’s diagnosis and the treatment the person has received.

      (b) Upon receiving the notice described in this subsection, the district attorney may request an order from the court in the county where the criminal charges were initiated for an evaluation to determine if the person is fit to proceed in the criminal proceeding. The court may order the state hospital or the state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person to perform the evaluation. The hospital or facility shall provide copies of the evaluation to the district attorney, the person and the person’s legal counsel, if applicable.

      (c) The person committed under this section may not waive an evaluation ordered by the court to determine if the person is fit to proceed with the criminal proceeding as described in this subsection.

      (11) The board shall make reasonable efforts to notify any person described in subsection (3)(c) of this section of any order or hearing, conditional release, discharge or escape of the person committed under this section.

      (12) The board shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section and ORS 426.702.

      (13) Any time limitation described in ORS 131.125 to 131.155 does not run during a commitment described in this section or a further commitment described in ORS 426.702. [2013 c.715 §2; 2013 c.715 §13]

 

      426.702 Discharge from commitment of extremely dangerous person with mental illness; requirements for further commitment; protest and hearing. (1)(a) At the end of the 24-month period of commitment described in ORS 426.701, any person who remains committed under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board shall be discharged, unless the board certifies to the court in the county where the state hospital or state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person is located that the person is still extremely dangerous and suffers from a mental disorder that is resistant to treatment. The board, pursuant to its rules, may delegate to the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person the responsibility for making the certification. If the certification is made, the person will not be released.

      (b) The board may additionally certify that the person cannot be controlled in the community with proper care, medication, supervision and treatment on conditional release and must be committed to a state hospital. The board, pursuant to its rules, may delegate to the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person the responsibility for making the additional certification.

      (2) The certification shall immediately be served upon the person by the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person. The superintendent or director shall inform the court in writing that service has been made and the date thereof.

      (3) The certification shall advise the person of all the following:

      (a) That the board, hospital or facility has requested that commitment be continued for an additional 24 months.

      (b) That the person may protest this further commitment within 14 days, and that, if the person does not protest, the commitment will be continued for a maximum of 24 months.

      (c) That the person may consult with legal counsel when deciding whether to protest the further commitment and that legal counsel will be provided for the person without cost if the person is without funds to retain legal counsel.

      (d) That the person may protest a further period of commitment either orally or in writing by signing the form accompanying the certification.

      (e) That if the person does protest a further period of commitment, the person is entitled to a hearing before the court to determine whether commitment should be continued.

      (f) That the person is entitled to have a psychologist or psychiatrist, other than a member of the staff at the facility where the person is being treated, examine the person and report to the court the results of the examination at the hearing.

      (g) That the person may subpoena witnesses and offer evidence on behalf of the person at the hearing.

      (h) That if the person is without funds to retain legal counsel or an examining psychologist or psychiatrist for the hearing, the court will appoint legal counsel or an examining psychologist or psychiatrist.

      (4) The person serving the certification shall read and deliver the certification to the person and ask whether the person protests a further period of commitment. The person may protest a further period of commitment and request a hearing either orally or by signing a simple protest form to be given to the person with the certification. If the person does not protest a further period of commitment within 14 days of service of the certification, the board, hospital or facility shall so notify the court, and the court shall, without further hearing, order the commitment of the person to the jurisdiction of the board for a maximum of 24 months. The court shall further order that the person be committed to a state hospital if a certification under subsection (1)(b) of this section has been made.

      (5) When the person protests a further period of commitment and requests a hearing, the board, hospital or facility shall immediately notify the court, and the court shall have the person brought before it and shall again advise the person that the board, hospital or facility has requested that commitment be continued for an additional period of time and that if the person does not protest this commitment the commitment will be continued for a maximum of 24 months. The person shall also be informed of the rights set forth in subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) If the person requests a hearing under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the following provisions apply as described:

      (a) The hearing shall be conducted as promptly as possible and at a time and place as the court may direct.

      (b) If the person requests a continuance in order to prepare for the hearing or to obtain legal counsel to represent the person, the court may grant postponement and detention during postponement as described in ORS 426.095 (2)(c).

      (c) The person has the right to representation by or appointment of legal counsel subject to ORS 135.055, 151.216 and 151.219.

      (d) If the person requests an examination by a psychologist or psychiatrist and is without funds to retain a psychologist or psychiatrist for purposes of the examination, the court shall appoint a psychologist or psychiatrist, other than a member of the staff from the facility where the person is being treated, to examine the person at no expense to the person and to report to the court the results of the examination.

      (e) The provisions of ORS 40.230, 40.235, 40.240, 40.250 and 179.505 do not apply to the use of medical records from the current period of commitment or to testimony related to such records or period of commitment in connection with hearings under this section. The court may consider as evidence such reports and testimony.

      (f) The court shall then conduct a hearing. The court may take judicial notice of the findings regarding the act described in ORS 426.701 (3)(a)(C) made by the court at the initial commitment. If, after hearing the evidence and reviewing the recommendations of the board and the state hospital or the state or local mental health facility providing treatment to the person, in the opinion of the court the person is still extremely dangerous and suffering from a mental disorder that is resistant to treatment by clear and convincing evidence, the court may order commitment to the jurisdiction of the board for an additional maximum of 24 months. The court shall further commit the person to a state hospital for custody, care and treatment if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person cannot be controlled in the community with proper care, medication, supervision and treatment on conditional release.

      (g) At the end of the 24-month period, the person shall be discharged unless the board, hospital or facility again certifies to the committing court that the person is still an extremely dangerous person with mental illness and in need of further treatment, in which event the procedures set forth in this section shall be followed.
