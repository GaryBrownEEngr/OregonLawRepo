      427.007 Policy; Department of Human Services to facilitate community-based services. (1)(a) Individuals with intellectual and other developmental disabilities and society as a whole benefit when the individuals exercise choice and self-determination, living and working in the most integrated community settings appropriate to their needs, with supportive services that are designed and implemented consistent with the choice of the individuals regarding services, providers, goals and activities. Individuals with developmental disabilities, together with their families and advocates, must play a major role in the planning, designing, funding, operation and monitoring of community services. These services should be ultimately focused on the outcomes of independence, integration and productivity.

      (b) The employment of individuals with developmental disabilities in fully integrated work settings is the highest priority over unemployment, segregated employment, facility-based employment or day habilitation.

      (c) Support for families with children who have developmental disabilities must be based upon principles of choice and self-determination, with families receiving the support they need to support their children at home. If a child with a developmental disability cannot remain safely at home even with supportive services, the child should live in a family-like setting with the ability to remain closely connected to the child’s family.

      (d) Therefore, the Department of Human Services is directed to facilitate, provide or contract for appropriate community-based services, including family support, residential facilities, day programs, home care and other necessary support, care and training programs, in an orderly and systematic manner.

      (2) In carrying out the directive in subsection (1) of this section, the department shall develop a biennial plan in conjunction with the budgeting process for review by each Legislative Assembly. In developing this plan, the department shall meet with and consider the input of representatives from the following constituencies: Consumer organizations, parent-family organizations, advocacy organizations, unions representing personal support workers and adult foster home providers, community provider organizations, state and local education officials and community developmental disabilities programs. Such plans shall include, where appropriate:

      (a) Proposals for the orderly development of community-based services, including family support, residential facilities, day programs, home care and other necessary support, care and training programs, to accommodate persons eligible for and needing developmental disability services and to serve persons already in the community waiting for services. The proposals shall include services for persons who are leaving the public education system. Funding for these services shall be commensurate with individual need. These proposals may include provisions for an array of both publicly and privately operated services and shall include specific implementation plans requiring that new services developed are designed to significantly increase the independence, productivity and integration into the community of persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities.

      (b) Proposals for the location of community-based services for persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities in proximity to family, friends, supportive services and home communities whenever possible.

      (3) In further carrying out the directive in subsection (1) of this section, the department shall develop monitoring and evaluation systems that ensure competent management, program quality and cost-effectiveness of community-based services. Such systems shall include, where appropriate:

      (a) A comprehensive system of service coordination that ensures an orderly movement of persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities between community-based service alternatives, and ensures an effective system of service delivery to persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities living in the community, based on individualized planning and close cooperation with consumers, families and guardians.

      (b) Specific standards for each component within the array of services for persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities, either operated or supported by the department, that ensure the competent management, program quality and cost-effectiveness of such services.

      (4) Subject to available funds, the department shall ensure that each family with a member with an intellectual disability or another developmental disability has access to family support services, and that each person with an intellectual disability or another developmental disability living in the community, including those leaving the public education system, has access to community-based services necessary to enable the person to strive to achieve independence, productivity and integration. Specific services proposed for the person shall be identified in an individual support plan or in a family support service plan.

      (5) Subject to available funds, the department shall determine the content of individual support plans and family support service plans, and the process whereby such plans are developed and updated.

      427.235 Notice to court of need for commitment; investigation; report and recommendation. (1) Any two persons may notify the court having probate jurisdiction for the county or the circuit court, if it is not the probate court but its jurisdiction has been extended to include commitment of a person with an intellectual disability under ORS 3.275, that a person within the county has an intellectual disability and is in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training. Such notice shall be in writing and sworn to before an officer qualified to administer an oath and shall set forth the facts sufficient to show the need for investigation. The circuit court shall forward notice to the community developmental disabilities program director in the county if it finds the notice sufficient to show the need for investigation. The director or the designee of the director shall immediately investigate to determine whether the person has an intellectual disability and is in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training.

      (2) Any person who acts in good faith shall not be held civilly liable for making of the notification under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Any investigation conducted by the community developmental disabilities program director or the designee of the director under subsection (1) of this section shall commence with an interview or examination of the person alleged to have an intellectual disability, where possible, in the home of the person or other place familiar to the person. Further investigation if warranted shall include a diagnostic evaluation as described in ORS 427.105 and may also include interviews with the person’s relatives, neighbors, teachers and physician or naturopathic physician.

      427.245 Hearing; citation to appear; notice; right to legal counsel. (1) If the court, following receipt of an investigation report under ORS 427.235, concludes that there is probable cause to believe that the subject of the investigation has an intellectual disability and is in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training, it shall, through the issuance of a citation as provided in subsection (2) of this section, cause the person to be brought before it at such time and place as it may direct for a hearing to determine whether the person has an intellectual disability and is in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training. The person shall be given the opportunity to appear at the hearing. If the person is detained pursuant to ORS 427.255, the court shall hold the hearing within seven judicial days.

      (2) Upon a determination under subsection (1) of this section that probable cause exists to believe that the person has an intellectual disability and is in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training, the court shall cause a citation to issue to the person or, if the person is a minor or incapacitated, to the parent or legal guardian of the person.

      427.255 Detention prior to investigation or hearing; care and maintenance while under custody. (1) If the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the failure to take into custody pending an investigation or hearing a person alleged to have an intellectual disability and be in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training would pose an imminent and serious danger to the person or to others, the court may issue a warrant of detention to either the community developmental disabilities program director or the sheriff of the county directing that the director, the sheriff or the designee of the director or sheriff take the person into custody and produce the person at the time and place stated in the warrant. At the time the person is taken into custody, the custodian shall advise the person or, if the person is incapacitated or a minor, the parents or guardian of the person of the person’s right to counsel, to have legal counsel appointed if the person is unable to afford legal counsel, and, if requested, to have legal counsel appointed immediately.

      (2) A person taken into custody under subsection (1) of this section shall be provided all care, custody, evaluation and treatment required for the mental and physical health and safety of the person and the director of the facility retaining custody shall report any care, custody, evaluation or treatment provided the person to the court as required by ORS 427.280. Any diagnostic evaluation performed on such person shall be consistent with Department of Human Services rules and ORS 427.105. Any prescription or administration of drugs shall be the sole responsibility of the treating physician or naturopathic physician. The person shall have the right to the least hazardous treatment procedures while in custody, and the treating physician or naturopathic physician shall be notified immediately of the use of any mechanical restraints on the person. A note of each use of mechanical restraint and the reasons therefor shall be made a part of the person’s clinical record over the signature of the treating physician or naturopathic physician.

(1) At the time that a person who is alleged to have an intellectual disability and to be in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training is brought before the court, the court shall advise the person of the reason for being brought before the court, the nature of the proceedings and the possible results of the proceedings. The court shall also advise the person of the right to subpoena witnesses and to suitable legal counsel possessing skills and experience commensurate with the nature of the allegations and complexity of the case during the proceedings, and that if the person does not have funds with which to retain suitable legal counsel, the court shall appoint such legal counsel to represent the person. If the person does not request legal counsel, the legal guardian, relative or friend may request the assistance of legal counsel on behalf of the person.

      (2) If no request for legal counsel is made, the court shall appoint suitable legal counsel.

      (3) If the person is unable to afford legal counsel, the court, if the matter is before a county or justice court, or the public defense services executive director, if the matter is before the circuit court, shall determine and allow, as provided in ORS 135.055, the reasonable expenses of the person and compensation for legal counsel. The expenses and compensation so allowed by a county court shall be paid by the county of residence of the person. The expenses and compensation determined by the public defense services executive director shall be paid by the public defense services executive director from funds available for the purpose. In all cases legal counsel shall be present at the hearing and may examine all witnesses offering testimony, and otherwise represent the person.

      (4) The court may, for good cause, postpone the hearing for not more than 72 hours to allow preparation for the hearing and order the continuation of detention authorized under ORS 427.255 during a postponement, if requested by the person, the legal counsel, parent or guardian of the person, an examiner or on the court’s own motion.

If the facility finds, and shows by its report, that the person examined has an intellectual disability and is in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training, the report shall include a recommendation as to the type of treatment or training facility most suitable for the person. The report shall also advise the court whether in the opinion of the examining facility the person and, if the person is a minor or incapacitated, the parents or legal guardian of the person would cooperate with voluntary treatment or training and whether the person would benefit either from voluntary treatment or training or from appointment of a legal guardian or conservator.

      (2) Upon request by the person or the parent, legal guardian or legal counsel of the person, the court shall appoint an additional physician, naturopathic physician or psychologist, or both, to examine the person and make separate reports in writing to the court. However, the court shall not appoint more than one additional physician or naturopathic physician and one additional psychologist to examine the person.

(1) Any physician, naturopathic physician or psychologist employed by the court to make a diagnostic evaluation of a person alleged to have an intellectual disability and to be in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training, shall be allowed a fee as the court in its discretion determines reasonable for the evaluation. The costs of the evaluation shall be paid by the county of residence of the person or, if the person has no residence within the state, by the county in which the person is taken into custody. The county shall not be held responsible for the costs of prior examinations or tests reported to the court, or of diagnostic evaluations performed or arranged by the community developmental disabilities program or Department of Human Services.

      (2) Witnesses subpoenaed to give testimony shall receive the same fees as are paid in criminal cases and are subject to compulsory attendance in the same manner as provided in ORS 136.567 to 136.603. The attendance of out-of-state witnesses may be secured in the same manner as provided in ORS 136.623 to 136.637. The party who subpoenas the witness or requests the court to subpoena the witness is responsible for payment of the cost of the subpoena and payment for the attendance of the witness at a hearing. When the witness has been subpoenaed on behalf of a person who is represented by appointed counsel, the fees and costs allowed for that witness shall be paid pursuant to ORS 135.055.

[1979 c.683 §22; 2009 c.595 §446; 2011 c.658 §19]

 

      427.285 Witnesses required at hearing; cross-examination. The investigator and other appropriate persons or professionals as necessary shall appear at the hearing and present the evidence.

      427.290 Determination by court of need for commitment; discharge; conditional release; commitment; appointment of guardian or conservator. After hearing all of the evidence, and reviewing the findings of the investigation and other examiners, the court shall determine whether the person has an intellectual disability and because of the intellectual disability is either dangerous to self or others or is unable to provide for the personal needs of the person and is not receiving care as is necessary for the health, safety or habilitation of the person. If in the opinion of the court the person is not in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training, the person shall be discharged. If in the opinion of the court the person has, by clear and convincing evidence, an intellectual disability and is in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training, the court may order as follows:

      (1) If the person can give informed consent and is willing and able to participate in treatment and training on a voluntary basis, and the court finds that the person will do so, the court shall order release of the person and dismiss the case.

      (2) If a relative, a friend or legal guardian of the person requests that the relative, friend or legal guardian be allowed to care for the person for a period of one year in a place satisfactory to the court and shows that the relative, friend or legal guardian is able to care for the person and that there are adequate financial resources available for the care of the person, the court may commit the person and order that the person be conditionally released and placed in the care and custody of the relative, friend or legal guardian. The order may be revoked and the person committed to the Department of Human Services for the balance of the year whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is in the best interest of the person.

      (3) If in the opinion of the court voluntary treatment and training or conditional release is not in the best interest of the person, the court may order the commitment of the person to the department for care, treatment or training. The commitment shall be for a period not to exceed one year with provisions for continuing commitment pursuant to ORS 427.235 to 427.290.

      (4) If in the opinion of the court the person may be incapacitated, the court may appoint a legal guardian or conservator pursuant to ORS chapter 125. The appointment of a guardian or conservator shall be a separate order from the order of commitment. [1979 c.683 §24; 1995 c.664 §97; 2011 c.658 §21; 2013 c.36 §9]

 

      427.293 Disclosure of record of proceeding. (1) In any proceeding conducted under ORS 427.235 to 427.290, the court may not disclose any part of the record, including any report submitted to the court under ORS 427.270, to any person except:

      (a) The court shall, pursuant to rules adopted by the Department of State Police, transmit the minimum information necessary, as defined in ORS 181A.290, to the Department of State Police for persons described in ORS 181A.290 (1)(c) to enable the department to maintain the information and transmit the information to the federal government as required under federal law;

      (2) In any proceeding described in subsection (1) of this section that is before the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, the limitations on disclosure imposed by this section apply to the appellate court record and to the trial court record while it is in the appellate court’s custody. The appellate court may disclose information from the trial or appellate court record in a decision, as defined in ORS 19.450, provided that the court uses initials, an alias or some other convention for protecting against public disclosure the identity of the person who is alleged to have an intellectual disability.

The compensation for legal counsel and costs and expenses necessary to the appeal shall be determined and paid by the public defense services executive director as provided in ORS 135.055 if the circuit court is the appellate court or as provided in ORS 138.500 if the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court is the appellate court. The compensation, costs and expenses so allowed shall be paid as provided in ORS 138.500. [1979 c.867 §15; 1981 s.s. c.3 §136; 1985 c.502 §26; 2001 c.962 §73; 2011 c.658 §22]

 

      427.300 Assignment to appropriate facility; notice of transfer or discharge; appeal; hearing. (1) The Department of Human Services may, at its discretion, direct any person with an intellectual disability who has been committed under ORS 427.290 to the facility best able to treat and train the person. The authority of the department on such matters shall be final.

      (2)(a) At any time, for good cause and in the best interest of the person, the department may decide to transfer the person from one facility to another or discharge the person as no longer in need of residential care, treatment or training.

      (b) At least 30 days prior to the transfer or discharge, the department shall notify, by regular mail, the person and the parent, guardian or other individual entitled to custody of the person of the decision to transfer or discharge. The notice must inform the person of the right to appeal the department’s decision to transfer or discharge. In the case of a medical emergency, the department is not required to give 30 days’ notice but shall give the notice as soon as possible under the circumstances. The department shall define “medical emergency” by rule, including but not limited to an increase in the level of needed care or the person engaging in a behavior that poses an imminent danger to self or others.

      (c) Except in a medical emergency, the person has the right to an administrative hearing prior to an involuntary transfer or discharge. ORS 441.605 (4) and the department’s rules governing transfer notices and hearings for residents of long term care facilities apply to a transfer or discharge under this section. If the person is being transferred or discharged for a medical emergency, the hearing must be held no later than seven days after the transfer or discharge. The department shall maintain a space in the facility for the person pending the administrative order.

      (3) The department, pursuant to its rules, may delegate to a community developmental disabilities program director the responsibility for assignment of persons with intellectual disabilities to suitable facilities or transfer between such facilities under conditions that the department may define. [1979 c.683 §25; 2009 c.595 §447; 2011 c.658 §23; 2013 c.36 §11]

      (2) A person alleged or adjudged to have an intellectual disability and to be in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training, who is not incarcerated on a criminal charge, may not be confined without an attendant in charge of the person. If the person is not confined in a hospital or a facility, the community developmental disabilities program director or sheriff having the person in custody shall select some suitable individual to act as attendant in quarters suitable for the comfortable, safe and humane confinement of the person.
