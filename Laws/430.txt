(Treatment Program)

 

      430.455 Information to drug-dependent person upon arrest. When a person is arrested for violation of the criminal statutes of this state which do not involve crimes of violence against another person, and the officer or person making the arrest has reasonable grounds for believing the arrested individual is a drug-dependent person, the officer or person making the arrest may:

      (1) Fully inform the arrested person of the right of the arrested person to evaluation and the possible consequences of such evaluation;

      (2) Inform the arrested person of the right of the arrested person to counsel before consenting to evaluation; and

      (3) Fully explain the voluntary nature of the evaluation and the limitations upon the confidentiality of the information obtained during the evaluation. [1977 c.871 §7]

 

      430.460 Consent to evaluation; effect of refusal. Upon obtaining the written consent of the arrested person, the officer or person making the arrest shall request an approved site to conduct an evaluation to determine whether the arrested person is drug dependent. Refusal of the arrested person to consent to the evaluation is not admissible in evidence upon the trial of the arrested person. [1977 c.871 §8]

 

      430.465 Referral for evaluation. A defendant may be informed of the rights of the defendant to evaluation and, upon giving written consent, may be referred for such evaluation at any time prior to conviction for the offense for which the defendant is charged, notwithstanding prior refusal to submit to evaluation. The procedures stipulated in ORS 430.455 and 430.460 shall be followed whenever the right to evaluation is restated under this section. [1977 c.871 §9]

 

      430.470 Notice of right to evaluation if not given at time of arrest. (1) In the event that an officer or person making the arrest fails to inform the person arrested of the right to evaluation, and possible diversion, within 24 hours from the time of booking, an officer of the court or diversion coordinator may do so.

      (2) At the time of arraignment, the judge shall inform the defendant of the rights described in ORS 430.455. [1977 c.871 §10]

 

      430.475 Evaluation results as evidence; admissibility at subsequent trial; privileged communication. (1) The results of the evaluation of an arrested person suspected of being drug dependent shall be made available to the prosecuting and defense attorneys and the presiding judge for the judicial district, but shall not be entered into evidence in any subsequent trial of the accused except upon written consent of the accused or upon a finding by the court that the relevance of the results outweighs their prejudicial effect.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, results of evaluation or information voluntarily provided to evaluation or treatment personnel by a person under ORS 430.450 to 430.555 shall be confidential and shall not be admitted as evidence in criminal proceedings. Reports submitted to the court or the prosecutor by the diversion coordinator shall consist solely of matters required to be reported by the terms of the diversion plan, together with an assessment of the person’s progress toward achieving the goals set forth in the plan. Communications between the person participating in the plan and the diversion coordinator shall be privileged unless they relate directly to the elements required to be reported under the diversion plan. [1977 c.871 §§11,27; 1995 c.781 §45]

 

      430.480 Effect of ORS 430.450 to 430.555 on other evidence. Nothing in ORS 430.450 to 430.555 is intended to limit the introduction of other evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not a person is using or is under the influence of cannabis or controlled substances. [1977 c.871 §12; 1979 c.744 §27; 2017 c.21 §61]

 

      430.485 Treatment may be ordered. When the results of the evaluation obtained under ORS 430.460 or 430.465 indicate that the defendant is a drug-dependent person within the meaning of ORS 430.450 to 430.555, and the results of the evaluation indicate that such person may benefit in a substantial manner from treatment for drug dependence, the prosecutor, with the concurrence of the court, may direct the defendant to receive treatment as a contingent alternative to prosecution. If defendant refuses treatment, criminal proceedings shall be resumed. [1977 c.871 §15]

 

      430.490 Diversion plan for defendant; participation as condition of probation or parole. (1) Prior to the initiation of diversion, the local diversion coordinator shall submit an individual diversion plan for the defendant. Upon approval of the plan by the prosecutor and the court, the person diverted shall be required to follow the diversion plan as a condition of continuance in treatment. The plan shall be entered into the record of the court.

      (2) Participation in a diversion program may be made a condition of probation or parole. [1977 c.871 §§16,28]

 

      430.495 Content of diversion plan; duration. (1) The diversion plan shall include appropriate methods for monitoring the progress of the diverted individual toward the achievement of the defined treatment objectives. In the presence of counsel, the defendant shall review the terms of the individual diversion plan, including methods for monitoring progress, and execute a written statement indicating consent. Such statement shall include a voluntary waiver of stipulated rights as necessary to implement the approved plan. Any authorized waiver under this section shall not extend beyond the time of participation by the person in the diversion plan.

      (2) No individual diversion plan shall continue for more than the maximum time a person can be sentenced for the offense charged. [1977 c.871 §§17,21]

 

      430.500 Dismissal of charges. (1) Upon successful completion of treatment, as outlined in the individual diversion plan, a request may be made to dismiss charges against the individual related to the offense for which diversion was initiated as an alternative to prosecution.

      (2) When the prosecutor and the court have determined that the individual has successfully completed treatment, as outlined in the diversion plan, the prosecutor shall dismiss charges against the individual related to the offense for which diversion was initiated as an alternative to prosecution. [1977 c.871 §§18,19]

 

      430.505 Expunction of verdict. If a person is diverted after conviction, but prior to sentencing, the court may order expunction from the record of the verdict of the court and all proceedings incident thereto upon successful completion of the diversion plan and a post-treatment period of three years, provided there have been no new convictions for misdemeanor or felony offenses. [1977 c.871 §20]

 

      430.510 Notice when treatment unsuccessful. If treatment under ORS 430.450 to 430.555 is unsuccessful, the prosecuting attorney and the court shall be notified before the defendant is released from treatment. After such notice the prosecution may be resumed. If the person has been convicted of the offense for which the person has been arrested, the court may proceed to impose sentence, which shall take into account the period during which the person participated in treatment. [1977 c.871 §25]

 

      430.515 Procedure to terminate treatment. Termination of treatment under ORS 430.450 to 430.555 may be instituted at any time by either the prosecutor, the director of the treatment facility, the court or the person diverted into treatment. An order to terminate treatment shall be based upon a finding of substantial violation of the diversion plan or upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that the person diverted constitutes a threat to the peace and safety of the public and that continued treatment will involve direct risk to the community or the treatment facility. Such findings and showing shall be made before the court in open hearing, with the person under treatment entitled to counsel and to due process of law. [1977 c.871 §26]

      (2) Special attention must be focused on preventive programs and services directed at women at risk of becoming pregnant substance users as well as on pregnant women who use substances or who are at risk of substance use or abuse.

      (3) It is the policy of this state to achieve desired results such as alcohol- and drug-free pregnant women and healthy infants through a holistic approach covering the following categories of needs:

      (a) Biological-physical need, including but not limited to detoxification, dietary and obstetrical.

      (b) Psychological need, including but not limited to support, treatment for anxiety, depression and low self-esteem.

      (2) The provider shall supply demographic information concerning patients described in subsection (1) of this section to the Alcohol and Drug Policy Commission, for purposes related to the commission’s accountability and data collection system, and to the local public health administrator, as defined in ORS 431.003, without revealing the identity of the patients. The local public health administrator shall use forms prescribed by the Oregon Health Authority and shall send copies of the forms and any compilation made from the forms to the authority at such times as the authority may require by rule.

      (3) The provider, if otherwise authorized, may administer or prescribe controlled substances that relieve withdrawal symptoms and assist the patient in reducing the need for unlawful controlled substances according to medically acceptable practices.
