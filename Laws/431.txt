     (5) If a local public health authority makes a transfer under this section, the Oregon Health Authority is not obligated to provide or to contract for the provision of public health programs and public health activities within the local public health authority’s jurisdiction.

     431.730 Conduct of hearing. (1) At the hearing on the resolution, any interested person shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard or to present written statements.

If a petition is received, the director may set a time and place for receipt of argument. [1973 c.361 §6; 1975 c.266 §2; 1999 c.849 §§81,82; 2003 c.75 §35; 2009 c.595 §581]

 

     431.735 Director’s authority under ORS 431.705 to 431.760. (1) If the Director of the Oregon Health Authority after investigation finds that no danger to public health exists because of conditions within the affected territory, or that such a danger does exist but the conditions causing it could not be removed or alleviated by the provision of service facilities, the director shall issue an order terminating the proceedings under ORS 431.705 to 431.760 with reference to the affected territory.

     (2) If the director finds, after investigation and the hearing required by ORS 431.725, that a danger to public health exists because of conditions within the territory, and that such conditions could be removed or alleviated by the provisions of service facilities in accordance with the plans and specifications and the time schedule proposed, the director shall enter findings in an order, directed to the officers described by ORS 431.740, setting out the service facilities to be provided.

     (3) If the director determines that a danger to public health exists because of conditions within only part of the affected territory, or that such conditions could be removed or alleviated in only part of the affected territory by the provision of service facilities, the director may, subject to conditions stated in ORS 431.705 to 431.760, reduce the boundaries of the affected territory to that part which presents a danger or in which the conditions could be removed or alleviated if the area to be excluded would not be surrounded by the territory remaining to be annexed and would not be directly served by the sanitary, water or other facilities necessary to remove or alleviate the danger to public health existing within the territory remaining to be annexed. The findings shall describe the boundaries of the area as reduced by the director.

     (4) In determining whether to exclude any area the director may consider whether or not such exclusion would unduly interfere with the removal or alleviation of the danger to public health in the area remaining to be annexed and whether the exclusion would result in an illogical boundary for the provision of services.

     (5) The requesting body or the boundary commission shall, when requested, aid in the determinations made under subsections (3) and (4) of this section and, if necessary, cause a study to be made. [1973 c.361 §7; 1975 c.266 §3; 2009 c.595 §582]

(1) At any time after the adoption of a resolution under ORS 431.715, a petition, signed by not less than 51 percent of the electors registered in the affected territory, may be filed with the Oregon Health Authority. The petition shall suggest an alternative plan to the proposed formation or annexation for removal or alleviation of the conditions dangerous to public health. The petition shall state the intent of the residents to seek annexation to an existing city or special district authorized by law to provide service facilities necessary to remove or alleviate the dangerous conditions. The petition shall be accompanied by a proposed plan which shall state the type of facilities to be constructed, a proposed means of financing the facilities and an estimate of the time required to construct such facilities and place them in operation.

     (2) Upon receipt of the petition, the authority shall immediately forward a copy of the petition to the Environmental Quality Commission, if the plan accompanying the petition involves facilities that are subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. The authority also shall forward a copy of the petition to the requesting body and to the county court or boundary commission where the authority filed its findings under ORS 431.740 and direct the county court or boundary commission to stay the proceedings pending the review permitted under this section and ORS 431.750.

In reviewing the alternative plan, the commission shall consider whether, in its judgment, the plan contains a preferable alternative for the alleviation or removal of the conditions dangerous to public health. If the commission determines that the original plan provides the better and most expeditious method of removing or alleviating the dangerous conditions, it shall disapprove the alternative plan and inform the authority of its decision. The authority shall order the proceedings on the finding filed under ORS 431.740 to resume.

     (2) If the commission finds that the alternative plan provides a preferable method of alleviating or removing the dangerous conditions, the petitioners shall be granted six months within which to present to the commission information showing:

     (a) That the affected territory has annexed to a city or special district authorized by law to provide the service facilities necessary to remove or alleviate the dangerous conditions, and that the financing of the extension of such facilities to the territory has been assured.

     (b) Detailed plans and specifications for the construction of such facilities.

     (c) A time schedule for the construction of such facilities.

     (d) That such facilities, if constructed, will remove or alleviate the conditions dangerous to public health in a manner as satisfactory and expeditious as would be accomplished by the formation or annexation proposed by the original plans.

     (3) The commission shall review the plan presented to it by the petitioners under subsection (2) of this section and shall promptly certify to the authority whether the requirements of subsection (2) of this section have been met. If the requirements have been met, the authority shall certify the alternative plan to the county court or boundary commission having jurisdiction and direct it to proceed in accordance with the alternative plan and in lieu of the plans filed under ORS 431.740.
