      (3) When a live birth occurs in an institution or en route to an institution, the person in charge of the institution or an authorized designee shall obtain all data required by the state registrar, prepare the report of live birth, certify either by signature or electronic signature that the child was born alive at the place and time and on the date stated and submit the report as described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) In obtaining the information required for the report of live birth, an institution shall use information gathering procedures provided or approved by the state registrar. Institutions may establish procedures to transfer, electronically or otherwise, information required for the report from other sources, provided that the procedures are reviewed and approved by the state registrar prior to the implementation of the procedures to ensure that the information being transferred is the same as the information being requested.

      (5)(a) When a live birth occurs outside an institution, the information for the report of live birth shall be submitted within five calendar days of the live birth in a format adopted by the state registrar by rule in the following order of priority:

      (A) By an institution where the birth mother and child are examined, if examination occurs within 24 hours of the live birth;

      (E) By the father, the birth mother, any other parent or, in the absence or inability of any parent, the person in charge of the premises where the live birth occurred.

      (b) The state registrar may establish by rule the manner of submitting the information for the report of live birth by a person described in paragraph (a)(D) of this subsection or a physician or licensed direct entry midwife who attends the birth of his or her own child, grandchild, niece or nephew.

      (6) When a report of live birth is submitted that does not include the minimum acceptable documentation required by this section or any rules adopted under this section, or when the state registrar has cause to question the validity or adequacy of the documentation, the state registrar, in the state registrar’s discretion, may refuse to register the live birth and shall enter an order to that effect stating the reasons for the action. The state registrar shall advise the applicant of the right to appeal under ORS 183.484.

      (7) When a live birth occurs on a moving conveyance:

      (a) Within the United States and the child is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the live birth shall be registered in this state and the place where it is first removed shall be considered the place of live birth.

      (b) While in international waters or airspace or in a foreign country or its airspace and the child is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the birth shall be registered in this state but the report of live birth shall show the actual place of birth insofar as can be determined.

      (8) For purposes of making a report of live birth and live birth registration, the woman who gives live birth is the birth mother. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a woman other than the birth mother is the biological or genetic mother, the court may order the state registrar to amend the record of live birth. The record of live birth shall then be placed under seal.

      (9)(a) If the birth mother is married at the time of either conception or live birth, or within 300 days before the live birth, the name of the mother’s spouse in a marriage shall be entered on the report of live birth as a parent of the child unless parentage has been determined otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (b) If the birth mother is not married at the time of either conception or live birth, or within 300 days before the live birth, the name of the other parent shall not be entered on the report of live birth unless a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form or other form prescribed under ORS 432.098 is:

      (A) Signed by the birth mother and the person to be named as the other parent; and

      (B) Filed with the state registrar.

      (c) If the birth mother is a partner in a domestic partnership registered by the state at the time of either conception or live birth, or between conception and live birth, the name of the birth mother’s partner shall be entered on the report of live birth as a parent of the child, unless parentage has been determined otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (d) In any case in which paternity or parentage of a child is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or by an administrative determination of paternity or parentage, the Center for Health Statistics shall enter the name of each parent on the new record of live birth. The Center for Health Statistics shall change the surname of the child if so ordered by the court or, in a proceeding under ORS 416.430, by the administrator as defined in ORS 25.010.

      (e) If a biological parent is not named on the report of live birth, information other than the identity of the biological parent may be entered on the report.

      (12) The state registrar may require additional evidence in support of the facts of live birth. [Formerly 432.206; 2014 c.45 §51; 2015 c.629 §50; 2017 c.651 §45]

 

      432.090 [1985 c.549 §10; 1997 c.783 §§10,10a; 1999 c.1084 §46; 2013 c.366 §40; renumbered 432.445 in 2013]

 

      432.093 Availability of voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form; responsibility of health care facility and parents. Any health care facility as defined in ORS 442.015 shall make available to the biological parents of any child born live or expected to be born in the health care facility, a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form when the facility has reason to believe that the mother of the child is unmarried. The responsibility of the health care facility is limited to providing the form and submitting the form with the report of live birth to the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics. The biological parents are responsible for ensuring that the form is accurately completed. This form shall be as prescribed by ORS 432.098. [Formerly 432.285]

 

      432.095 [1997 c.783 §44; repealed by 2013 c.366 §88]

 

      432.098 Voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form; rules; filing; when form is sworn document; copy to child support agency. (1) The Director of the Oregon Health Authority shall adopt by rule a form of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that includes the minimum requirements specified by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. When the form is signed by both biological parents and witnessed by a third party, the form establishes parentage for all purposes when filed with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics, provided there is no second parent already named in the report of live birth. Establishment of parentage under this section is subject to the provisions and the requirements in ORS 109.070. When there is no second parent named on the child’s record of live birth, the filing of such voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form shall cause the state registrar to place the name of the parent who has signed the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form on the record of live birth of the child or, if appropriate, establish a replacement for the record containing the name of the child’s parent, as that parent is named in the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form. When signed by both parents in the health care facility of the child’s birth within five days after the birth, the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form is not a sworn document. When thus signed, a staff member of the health care facility shall witness the signatures of the parents. In all other circumstances, the form is a sworn document. The filing of the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form created by this section is subject to the payment of any fees that may apply.

      (2) The voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form must contain:

      (a) A statement of rights and responsibilities including any rights afforded to a minor parent;

      (b) A statement of the alternatives to and consequences of signing the acknowledgment;

      (c) Instructions on how to file the form with the state registrar and information about any fee required;

      (d) Lines for the Social Security numbers and addresses of the parents; and

      (e) A statement that the rights, responsibilities, alternatives and consequences listed on the acknowledgment were read to the parties prior to signing the acknowledgment.

      (3) Upon request, the state registrar shall provide a copy of any voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form to the state agency responsible for administration of the child support enforcement program created under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. The duty imposed upon the state registrar by this section is limited to records of live birth executed and filed with the state registrar after October 1, 1995. [Formerly 432.287; 2017 c.651 §46]

 

      432.103 Full faith and credit. A determination of paternity or parentage by another state is entitled to full faith and credit. [Formerly 432.289; 2017 c.651 §47]

 

      432.105 [Amended by 1973 c.829 §35; 1983 c.709 §32; 1997 c.783 §11; repealed by 2013 c.366 §88]

 

      432.108 Report of live birth for child of unknown parentage. (1) A person who assumes the custody of a child of unknown parentage shall report on a form and in a manner prescribed by the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics, within five calendar days of assuming custody, to the state registrar the following information:

      (a) The date and the city or county, or both, where the child was found.

      (b) Sex and approximate live birth date of child.

      (c) Name and address of the person or institution with whom the child has been placed for care.

      (d) Name given to the child by the custodian of the child.

      (e) Other data required by the state registrar.

      (2) The place where the child was found shall be entered as the place of live birth.

      (3) Information submitted under this section shall constitute the report of live birth for the child.

      (4) If the child is identified and a live birth registration is found or obtained, the report submitted under this section and the live birth registration resulting from that report shall be voided and placed under seal and shall not be subject to inspection except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or as provided by rule of the state registrar. [Formerly 432.430]

 

      432.110 [Repealed by 1971 c.16 §3]

 

      432.113 Delayed reports of live birth; rules. (1) When a report of live birth of a person born in this state has not been registered within one year after the date of birth, a delayed report of live birth may be submitted in accordance with rules of the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics. No delayed report shall be registered until the evidentiary requirements as specified by rule have been met.

      (2) A certified copy issued as a result of a report of live birth submitted under this section shall indicate the delayed registration and show the date of the registration. The record of live birth shall contain a summary statement of the evidence submitted in support of the delayed registration.

      (3) All delayed reports of live birth shall be processed and registered at the Center for Health Statistics.

      (4) All certified copies of delayed registrations shall be issued by the state registrar.

      (5) A delayed report of live birth may not be registered for a deceased person.

      (6)(a) When an applicant does not submit the minimum documentation required by rule of the state registrar for delayed registration or when the state registrar has cause to question the validity or adequacy of the applicant’s sworn statement or the documentary evidence, and if the deficiencies are not corrected, the state registrar, in the state registrar’s discretion, may refuse to register the delayed report of live birth and shall enter an order to that effect stating the reasons for the action. The state registrar shall advise the applicant of the right to appeal under ORS 183.484.

      (b) The state registrar by rule may provide for the dismissal of an application that is not actively prosecuted. [Formerly 432.140]

 

      432.115 [Amended by 1983 c.709 §19; 1997 c.783 §12; 2013 c.366 §32; renumbered 432.295 in 2013]

 

      432.118 Procedure for contesting refusal to register report of live birth or delayed report of live birth; rules. (1) If the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics refuses to register a report of live birth or a delayed report of live birth under the provisions of ORS 432.088 or 432.113, the applicant may file a signed and sworn petition with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking an order establishing a record of the date and place of live birth and the parentage of the person whose birth is to be registered.

      (2) The petition shall be made on a form prescribed and furnished or approved by the state registrar and shall allege:

      (a) That the person for whom a record of live birth or a delayed record of live birth is sought was born in this state and no record of live birth or delayed record of live birth of the person can be found in the records of the Center for Health Statistics;

      (b) That diligent efforts by the petitioner have failed to obtain the evidence required for submitting a report of live birth or a delayed report of live birth in accordance with ORS 432.088 or 432.113 and rules adopted under ORS 432.088 or 432.113;

      (c) That the state registrar has refused to register a report of live birth or a delayed report of live birth; and

      (3) The petition must be served on the state registrar and accompanied by all documentary evidence that was submitted to the state registrar in support of the petition.

      (4) The court shall fix a time and place for hearing the petition and shall give the state registrar notice of the hearing. The state registrar or an authorized representative may appear and testify in the proceeding.

      (5) If the court finds, from the evidence presented, that the person for whom a record of live birth or a delayed record of live birth is sought was born in this state, it shall make findings as to the place and date of live birth, parentage and such other findings as may be required and shall issue an order, on a form prescribed and furnished or approved by the state registrar, to establish a court-ordered record of live birth or delayed record of live birth. This order shall include the live birth data to be registered, a description of the evidence presented and the date of the court’s action.

      (6) The clerk of the court shall forward a certified copy of each order to the state registrar twice a month as adopted by the state registrar by rule.

      (c) When death occurs in a moving conveyance within or outside the United States and the body is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the death must be registered in this state and the place where the body is first removed shall be deemed the place of death. The report of death may note the actual location of death insofar as it can be determined.

      (d) In all other cases, the place where death is pronounced shall be considered the place where death occurred.

      (2)(a) The funeral service practitioner or person acting as a funeral service practitioner who first assumes custody of the dead body shall submit the report of death to the county registrar of the county in which the death occurred or to the Center for Health Statistics.

      (3) A medical certification shall be completed within 48 hours after having access to the report of death by the decedent’s primary or attending medical certifier who was in charge of the care of the patient for the illness or condition that resulted in death, except when inquiry is required under ORS chapter 146. In the absence or inability of the medical certifier, or with the medical certifier’s approval, the report of death may be completed by an associate of the medical certifier, the chief medical officer of the institution where death occurred or the physician who performed an autopsy upon the decedent, provided that the associate, chief medical officer or physician has access to the medical history of the case and death is due to natural causes. The person completing the cause of death shall attest to its accuracy either by signature or by electronic signature.

      (4) When inquiry is required under ORS chapter 146, the medical examiner in the jurisdiction where death occurred or the body was found shall determine the cause and manner of death and shall complete and sign the medical certification within 48 hours after taking charge of the case. If the cause or manner of death is unknown or pending investigation, the cause or manner of death shall be noted as such on the report of death.

      (8) When a death that is not the subject of a presumptive death proceeding in a court in this state or another state is presumed to have occurred in this state as the result of a known event in this state, but no remains of the presumed deceased can be located, a report of death may be prepared by the Chief Medical Examiner upon receiving an order from a court of competent jurisdiction that contains findings of fact necessary to complete the report of death. A report of death prepared under this subsection shall be marked or flagged “Presumptive” and must show on its face the date of death as determined by the court, the date of registration, the identity of the court and the date of the order.

      (9) When a death of a missing person domiciled in this state, and that is not the subject of a presumptive death proceeding in a court of this state or another state, has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have presumptively occurred in another state, a report of death may be prepared by the Chief Medical Examiner upon receiving an order from the court that contains findings of fact necessary to complete the report of death.

      (10) When a death occurring in this state has not been registered as prescribed by this section, a report of death may be submitted to the state registrar as described in this section provided that the medical certifier or medical examiner and the funeral service practitioner or person acting as a funeral service practitioner are available to complete the report of death. If the report of death is submitted more than one year after the date of death or the date on which the body was found, the medical certifier or medical examiner and funeral service practitioner or person acting as a funeral service practitioner shall state in accompanying notarized statements that the information submitted is based on records kept in the files of the medical certifier or medical examiner and funeral service practitioner or person acting as a funeral service practitioner. If the medical certifier or medical examiner and funeral service practitioner or person acting as a funeral service practitioner are unavailable to complete the report of death, or decline to complete the report death, then the death shall not be registered except upon the receipt of an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (11) A report of death required to be submitted under this section must contain the Social Security number of the decedent when the Social Security number is reasonably available from other records related to the decedent or can be obtained from the person in charge of the final disposition of the decedent.

      (12) If a decedent’s death was caused by suicide, the person who submits the report of death to the county registrar or to the Center for Health Statistics, or as otherwise directed by the state registrar, shall make reasonable efforts to ascertain whether the decedent was a veteran and, if the decedent was a veteran, whether the decedent served in combat and, if so, where the decedent served.

      432.510 Cancer and tumor registry system; purpose; rulemaking; duties of Oregon Health Authority. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall establish a uniform, statewide, population-based registry system for the collection of information determining the incidence of cancer and benign or borderline tumors of the brain and central nervous system and related data. The purpose of the registry shall be to provide information to design, target, monitor, facilitate and evaluate efforts to determine the causes or sources of cancer and benign or borderline tumors among the residents of this state and to reduce the burden of cancer and benign or borderline tumors in this state. Such efforts may include but are not limited to:

      (a) Targeting populations in need of cancer screening services or evaluating screening or other cancer control services;

      (b) Supporting the operation of hospital registries in monitoring and upgrading the care and the end results of treatment for cancer and benign or borderline tumors;

      (c) Investigating suspected clusters or excesses of cancer and benign or borderline tumors both in occupational settings and in the state’s environment generally;

      (d) Conducting studies to identify cancer hazards to the public health and cancer hazard remedies; and

      (e) Projecting the benefits or costs of alternative policies regarding the prevention or treatment of cancer and benign or borderline tumors.

      (2) The authority shall adopt rules necessary to carry out the purposes of ORS 432.510 to 432.550 and 432.900, including but not limited to designating which types of cancer and benign or borderline tumors of the brain and central nervous system are reportable to the statewide registry, the data to be reported, the data reporting standards and format and the effective date after which reporting by health care facilities, clinical laboratories and practitioners shall be required. When adopting rules under this subsection, the authority shall, to the greatest extent practicable, conform the rules to the standards and procedures established by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, with the goal of achieving uniformity in the collection and reporting of data.

      (3) The authority shall:

      (a) Conduct a program of epidemiologic analyses of registry data collected under subsection (1) of this section to assess control, prevention, treatment and causation of cancer and benign or borderline tumors in this state; and

The authority may provide, at cost, reporting services to health care facilities. Health care facilities may also purchase reporting services from another facility or commercial vendor. If a health care facility is unable to report in conformance with the format and standards prescribed by the authority, the authority may, after consultation with the health care facility, elect to activate its reporting service for the facility. When activated, the authority may enter the facility, obtain the information and report it in conformance with the appropriate format and standards. In these instances, the facility shall reimburse the authority or its authorized representative for the cost of obtaining and reporting the information.

      (2) Upon application to the authority by a health care facility, the authority shall grant to the health care facility an extension of time in which to meet the reporting requirements of this section. In no event shall the extension of time exceed one year from the date of application.
