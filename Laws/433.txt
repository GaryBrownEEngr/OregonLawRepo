      (c) All procedures for obtaining the respondent’s consent to an HIV test by rules adopted under ORS 433.065 have been exhausted by the petitioner and the respondent has refused to consent to the test, or within the time period prescribed by rule of the authority has failed to submit to the test;

      (d) The petitioner has no knowledge that the petitioner has a history of a positive HIV test and has since the exposure, within a time period prescribed by rule of the authority, submitted a specimen from the petitioner for an HIV test; and

      (e) The injury that petitioner is suffering or will suffer if the source person is not ordered to submit to an HIV test.

      (3) The petition shall be accompanied by the certificate of the local public health administrator declaring that, based upon information in the possession of the administrator, the facts stated in the allegations under subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of this section are true.

      (4) Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall issue a citation to the respondent stating the nature of the proceedings, the statutes involved and the relief requested and, that if the respondent does not appear at the time and place for hearing stated in the citation, that the court will order the relief requested in the petition.

      (5) The citation shall be served on the respondent together with a copy of the petition by the county sheriff or deputy.

      (9) If the court does not make the finding described in subsection (8) of this section, the court shall dismiss the petition.

      (10) Failure to obey the order of the court shall be subject to contempt proceedings pursuant to law. [1989 c.878 §5; 2009 c.595 §638]

An immunization registry reduces inappropriate immunizations and increases appropriate immunizations because clients’ records will be easily available to authorized users. [1993 c.297 §2; 2007 c.196 §2]

 

      433.094 Development of immunization registry and tracking and recall system; standards; release of information. (1) The Oregon Health Authority, a local health department, or both, or their agents or other providers may develop an immunization registry and an associated tracking and recall system.

      (2) The immunization registry and tracking and recall system shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

      (a) Registering all clients born in, living in or receiving services in this state;

      (b) Tracking and updating immunization histories of the registered clients;

      (c) Allowing a provider, the authority or a local health department to provide information to and obtain information from the immunization records contained in the immunization registry, and the tracking and recall records contained in the tracking and recall system, without the consent of the client or the parent or guardian of the client;

      (d) Allowing an immunization record of a client who is under the care of an authorized user or enrolled in an authorized user’s program to be released to the authorized user;

      (e) Notifying in writing the parent or guardian of a client, at least through five years of age, when the tracking and recall system indicates that a client has missed a scheduled immunization;

      (f) Integrating with any immunization registry and its associated tracking and recall systems; and

      (g) Working with health care providers to develop information transfer systems.

      (3) The immunization registry and tracking and recall system may allow information to be released to an authorized user from an immunization record or a tracking and recall record for purposes including, but not limited to:

      (a) Outreach to clients under the care of the authorized user or enrolled in the authorized user’s program who have missed immunizations, hearing or lead screenings, or other public health interventions designated by rule of the authority; or

      (b) Public health assessment and evaluation related to immunizations and vaccine-preventable diseases conducted by the authority or by a local health department for clients within the local health department’s jurisdiction. [1993 c.297 §3; 2003 c.573 §2; 2003 c.593 §2; 2007 c.196 §3; 2009 c.595 §641; 2011 c.71 §2]

 

      433.095 Reporting information to registry; rules. The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt rules requiring dentists and pharmacists to report information about the administration of vaccines to the immunization registry created under ORS 433.094. [2009 c.250 §2; 2011 c.720 §194; 2019 c.58 §3]

 

      Note: 433.095 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 433 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      433.096 Receiving and disclosing registry information. Nothing in ORS 179.505, 192.311 to 192.478, 192.553 to 192.581 or 677.190 (5) or the client and provider privilege prevents:

      (1) Authorized users from providing information to and receiving information from the immunization registry regarding a client’s immunization record or tracking and recall record; or

      (2) The immunization registry from:

      (a) Providing immunization information to or receiving immunization information from an authorized user regarding a client’s immunization record or tracking and recall record;

      (b) Notifying or personally contacting a client or the custodial parent or guardian of a client about the client’s immunization status; or

      (c) Providing or publishing information in aggregate form that does not identify a client. [1993 c.297 §4; 2003 c.86 §11; 2007 c.196 §4; 2011 c.71 §4]

 

      433.098 Nonliability for disclosing or using information; confidentiality of information; removal of information.

      (3) When a client who is 18 years of age or older requests in writing that the client’s immunization record be removed from an immunization registry, the agency that maintains the registry shall purge the client’s immunization record from the registry as soon as is reasonably possible.

      (4) Before sharing data with any immunization registry, an immunization registry maintained in Oregon shall ensure that the immunization registry receiving the data has confidentiality and security policies at least as stringent as the policies of the registry sharing the data. [1993 c.297 §8; 2003 c.573 §3; 2007 c.196 §5; 2011 c.71 §3]

 

      433.100 Parental consent not required for enrollment in registry; rules; fees. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt rules pertaining to the development and implementation of the immunization registries and associated tracking and recall systems. The rules must include a process that allows a client who is 18 years of age or older, a custodial parent or guardian to control the transfer of information from the client’s immunization record or tracking and recall record when such control is necessary to protect the health or safety of the family or the client.

      (2) Nothing in this section requires the consent of a parent or guardian prior to enrolling the child in the registry or restricts the registry from providing information from a tracking and recall record to a custodial parent or guardian.

      (3)(a) Pursuant to rules adopted by the authority, the authority may charge fees to authorized users, except hospitals, schools and individual health care providers, for services requested from an immunization registry, including associated tracking and recall systems maintained by the authority.

[1993 c.297 §5; 2003 c.593 §3; 2007 c.196 §6; 2009 c.595 §642; 2011 c.71 §5]

 

      433.102 Parental responsibility for immunization; medical or religious exemptions. (1) Nothing in ORS 433.090 to 433.102 is intended to affect the responsibility of a parent or guardian to have a child of that parent or guardian properly immunized.

      (2) Nothing in ORS 433.090 to 433.102 is intended to require immunization or tracking of any child otherwise exempt from immunization requirements under ORS 433.267 (1)(b) or (c). [1993 c.297 §§6,7]

 

      433.103 Reporting and training requirements; exemptions; rules; redistribution of unused vaccines. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt rules requiring an entity that administers vaccines and receives vaccines from the authority to:

      (a) Report information about the administration of the vaccine to the immunization registry created under ORS 433.094; and

      (b) At least once every two years, certify that employees of the entity have completed a training session approved by the authority on the storage, handling and administration of vaccines. The authority may not require more than two employees of an entity to complete the training session.

      (2) The authority shall adopt rules exempting an entity from the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section if the entity demonstrates to the satisfaction of the authority that the entity or a health licensing board imposes adequate training requirements on employees of the entity.

      (3) The authority shall consider methods of facilitating the redistribution of unused vaccines. [2011 c.362 §1]

 

      433.104 Use of immunization registry for potential catastrophic disease threat. (1) The immunization registry and associated tracking and recall systems established under ORS 433.094 may be used as a vaccination management and tracking system in preparation for a potential catastrophic disease threat, such as smallpox or pandemic influenza.

      (2) When used as authorized by this section, the immunization registry may include persons of any age, and vaccination records may be shared with authorized users of the registry without obtaining the prior consent of the clients of the registry.

      (3) As used in this section, “client” and “immunization registry” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 433.090. [2003 c.593 §4]

      433.121 Emergency administrative order for isolation or quarantine; contents; ex parte court order. (1) The Public Health Director or a local public health administrator may issue an emergency administrative order causing a person or group of persons to be placed in isolation or quarantine if the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator has probable cause to believe that a person or group of persons requires immediate detention in order to avoid a clear and immediate danger to others and that considerations of safety do not allow initiation of the petition process set out in ORS 433.123.

      (4) A person or group of persons detained pursuant to an order issued under subsection (1) or (2) of this section may not be detained for longer than 72 hours unless a petition is filed under ORS 433.123.

      (5) If the detention of a person or group of persons for longer than 72 hours is deemed necessary, immediately following the issuance of an order under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator must petition the circuit court in accordance with ORS 433.123.

      (7) The Public Health Director or local public health administrator may request that a person or group of persons who is the subject of a petition filed under subsection (1) or (9) of this section not personally appear before the court because personal appearance would pose a risk of serious harm to others. If the court grants the director’s or local public health administrator’s request or if the court determines that personal appearance by the person or group of persons who is the subject of the petition poses a risk of serious harm to others, the court proceeding must be conducted by legal counsel for the person or group of persons or must be held at a location, or by any means, including simultaneous electronic transmission, that allows all parties to fully participate.

      (8) The court shall grant the petition if, by clear and convincing evidence, the court finds that isolation or quarantine is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the health and safety of others. In lieu of or in addition to isolation or quarantine, the court may order the imposition of other public health measures appropriate to the public health threat presented. The court order must:

      (a) Specify the maximum duration for the isolation or quarantine, which may not exceed 60 days unless there is substantial medical evidence indicating that the condition that is the basis of the public health threat is spread by airborne transmission and cannot be rendered noninfectious within 60 days or may recur after 60 days, in which case the maximum duration of the isolation or quarantine may not exceed a period of 180 days;

      (b) Identify the person or group of persons subject to the order by name or shared or similar characteristics or circumstances;

      (c) Specify the factual findings warranting imposition of isolation, quarantine or another public health measure;

A petition filed under this subsection must comply with the requirements of subsections (2) to (8) of this section.

      (10)(a) The court shall hold a hearing on a petition filed under subsection (9) of this section within 72 hours of filing, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.

      (b) In extraordinary circumstances and for good cause shown, or with consent of the affected persons, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator may apply to continue the hearing date for up to 10 days. The court may grant a continuance at its discretion, giving due regard to the rights of the affected persons, the protection of the public health, the severity of the public health threat and the availability of necessary witnesses and evidence.

      (c) The hearing required under this subsection may be waived by consent of the affected parties.

      (d) The court may continue the isolation or quarantine order if the court finds there is clear and convincing evidence that continued isolation or quarantine is necessary to prevent a serious threat to the health and safety of others. In lieu of or in addition to continued isolation or quarantine, the court may order the imposition of a public health measure appropriate to the public health threat presented.

      (e) An order issued under this subsection must comply with the requirements of subsection (8) of this section.

      (11) An order issued under subsection (10) of this section must be for a period not to exceed 60 days and must be served on all affected parties in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

      (12) In no case may a person or group of persons be in quarantine or isolation for longer than 180 days unless, following a hearing, a court finds that extraordinary circumstances exist and that the person or group of persons subject to isolation or quarantine continues to pose a serious threat to the health and safety of others if detention is not continued.

      (13) Failure to obey a court order issued under this section subjects the person in violation of the order to contempt proceedings under ORS 33.015 to 33.155. [2007 c.445 §9; 2011 c.721 §3]

 

      433.125 [Repealed by 1973 c.259 §20]

      433.128 Conditions of and principles for isolation or quarantine; notice to manager of health care facility. When isolating or quarantining a person or group of persons in accordance with ORS 433.121 or 433.123, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator shall adhere to the following conditions and principles:

      (1) Isolation or quarantine must be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease to others or to limit exposure to or contamination with a toxic substance by others, and may include, but is not limited to, confinement to private homes or other public or private premises.

      (2) Confinement may not be in a prison, jail or other facility where those charged with a crime or a violation of a municipal ordinance are incarcerated unless:

      (a) The person or group of persons represents an immediate and serious physical threat to the staff or physical facilities of a hospital or other facility in which the person or group of persons has been confined; or

      (b) A person has been found in contempt of court because of failure to obey a court order.

      (3) Isolated persons must be confined separately from quarantined persons. If a facility is not capable of separating isolated persons from quarantined persons, either the isolated persons or the quarantined persons must be moved to a separate facility.

      (4) The health status of an isolated or quarantined person must be monitored regularly to determine if the person requires continued isolation or quarantine.

      (5) A quarantined person who subsequently becomes infected or is reasonably believed to have become infected with a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease that the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator believes poses a significant threat to the health and safety of other quarantined persons must be promptly placed in isolation.

      (6) An isolated or quarantined person must be released as soon as practicable when the Public Health Director or local public health administrator determines that the person has been successfully decontaminated or that the person no longer poses a substantial risk of transmitting a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease that would constitute a serious or imminent threat to the health and safety of others.

      (7) The needs of a person who is isolated or quarantined must be addressed to the greatest extent practicable in a systematic and competent fashion, including, but not limited to, providing adequate food, medication, competent medical care, clothing, shelter and means of communication with other persons who are in isolation or quarantine and persons who are not under isolation or quarantine.

      (8) Premises used for isolation or quarantine must, to the extent practicable, be maintained in a safe and hygienic manner to lessen the likelihood of further transmission of a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease or of further harm to persons who are isolated and quarantined.

      (9) Cultural and religious beliefs should be considered to the extent practicable in addressing the needs of persons who are isolated or quarantined and in establishing and maintaining premises used for isolation or quarantine.

      (10)(a) Isolation or quarantine shall not abridge the right of any person to rely exclusively on spiritual means to treat a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease in accordance with religious or other spiritual tenets and practices.

      (b) Nothing in ORS 433.126 to 433.138, 433.142 and 433.466 prohibits a person who relies exclusively on spiritual means to treat a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease and who is infected with a communicable disease or has been exposed to a toxic substance from being isolated or quarantined in a private place of the person’s own choice, provided the private place is approved by the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator and the person who is isolated or quarantined complies with all laws, rules and regulations governing control, sanitation, isolation and quarantine.

      (11) Prior to placing a person or group of persons subject to isolation or quarantine in a health care facility as defined in ORS 442.015, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator must provide to the managers of the health care facility notice of the intention to seek authorization from the circuit court to place a person or group of persons in isolation or quarantine in the facility and must consult with the managers of the health care facility regarding how to best meet the requirements of this section.

      (12) The Public Health Director or local public health administrator shall provide adequate means of communication between a person or a group of persons who is isolated or quarantined and legal counsel for the person or group of persons. [2007 c.445 §12; 2011 c.721 §5; 2015 c.736 §79]

 

      433.130 [Amended by 1973 c.259 §11; 1987 c.600 §12; repealed by 2007 c.445 §42]

 

      433.131 Entry into premises used for isolation or quarantine; rules. (1) Entry into premises used for isolation or quarantine shall be allowed under the following conditions:

      (a) The Public Health Director or the local public health administrator may authorize physicians or other health care workers or other persons access to persons or groups of persons who are in isolation or quarantine pursuant to ORS 433.121 or 433.123 as necessary to meet the needs of isolated or quarantined persons;

      (b) Only persons authorized by the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator may enter premises used for isolation or quarantine;

      (c) An authorized person entering premises used for isolation or quarantine shall be provided with infection control training and may be required to wear personal protective equipment or to receive vaccinations as determined by the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator; and

      (d) A person entering premises used for isolation or quarantine with or without authorization of the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator may become subject to isolation or quarantine.

      (2) Persons subject to isolation or quarantine and other persons entering premises used for isolation or quarantine are subject to rules and orders adopted by the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator.

      (b)(A) Describe the reasonable efforts made to obtain voluntary compliance from the owner or custodian of the property with public health measures necessary to isolate the property; or

(Metabolic Diseases)

 

      433.285 Policy to control metabolic diseases; testing; fees; exemptions; waiver of fees; rules. (1) It hereby is declared to be a matter of public policy of the State of Oregon that in the interest of public health and the prevention of mental retardation, every infant, shall be given tests approved by the Oregon Health Authority for the detection of the disease of phenylketonuria and other metabolic diseases.

      (2) The authority by rule shall specify the diseases for which infants shall be tested under subsection (1) of this section, the appropriate time following delivery for collecting specimens, the manner in which the specimens are to be submitted, the persons responsible for submitting the specimens, the methods of testing and the manner of payment of the fees.

      (3) The testing required by subsection (1) of this section shall not be required if the infant is being reared as an adherent to a religion the teachings of which are opposed to such testing. The person responsible for submitting specimens under the rules of the authority shall be responsible for submitting a statement signed by the infant’s parent that the infant is being so reared. The authority by rule shall prescribe the form of the statement.

      (4) The authority shall adopt by rule a procedure whereby the fees established under subsection (2) of this section shall be waived and no infant refused service because of the parent’s inability to pay the fee.

      (5) The authority by rule shall prescribe the procedure to be followed in cases where initial testing for metabolic diseases is administered too early to detect these diseases, where the sample submitted for testing is improperly collected and where a sample shows an abnormal result. The authority, within the limits of funds available from fees collected under this section, shall institute a pilot program for follow-up on abnormal test results.

      433.290 Oregon Health Authority to conduct educational program concerning metabolic diseases. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that many newborn children are given their first tests for metabolic diseases too early for the detection of these diseases because parents remove these newborn infants from the hospital before the optimum testing period commences. To assure proper first testing and follow-up testing and increase knowledge about the nature and results of these diseases, the Oregon Health Authority shall institute and carry on an intensive educational program among physicians, naturopathic physicians, hospitals, public health nurses, the parents of newborn children and the public concerning the disease of phenylketonuria and other metabolic diseases. This educational program shall include information concerning:

      (a) The nature of these diseases; and

      (b) Examinations for the detection of these diseases in infancy in order that measures may be taken to prevent the mental retardation resulting from these diseases.

      (2) The authority shall make a special effort specifically to inform expectant parents and parents of newborn children of the necessity of newborn infants receiving appropriate tests within the optimum time range after birth to prevent the mental retardation or other serious complications resulting from these diseases. [1963 c.190 §2; 1977 c.582 §35; 1983 c.490 §1; 2009 c.595 §656; 2017 c.356 §64]

      433.326 Waiver of requirement of authorization to disclose information. The purpose of ORS 433.321, 433.323 and 433.327 and section 4, chapter 240, Oregon Laws 2003, is to waive the requirement of authorization to disclose information from, or provide information to, the record of a newborn child in the newborn hearing screening test registry and to waive confidentiality in regard to this information. The waiver allows providers, the Oregon Health Authority and local health departments and their agents, parents or guardians and diagnostic facilities to share information from the newborn hearing screening test registry without violating confidentiality. The newborn hearing screening test registry and the associated tracking and recall system are designed to increase early and appropriate intervention to minimize delays in developing language skills by the children of this state.

      433.332 Investigation and control of reported cases; rules. The Oregon Health Authority shall, upon receiving a report that any person has tuberculosis, make such investigation of the case as is necessary to determine whether or not the person reported has communicable tuberculosis. Upon finding that any person has communicable tuberculosis, the authority shall exercise such control over the affected person and contacts with other persons as may be necessary for the protection of the public health, pursuant to its rules and regulations. In exercising such control over any person who has communicable tuberculosis the authority may make such rules or orders governing such person’s conduct as are necessary to prevent the spread of the disease.

      (1) “Animal” means a dog or other animal of a species susceptible to rabies.

      (2) “Owner” means any person having a right of property in an animal or who harbors an animal or who has it in the care of the person, or acts as its custodian, or who knowingly permits an animal to remain on or about any premises occupied by the person. “Owner” does not include veterinarians or kennel operators temporarily maintaining on their premises animals owned by other persons for a period of not more than 30 days.

      433.350 Power of Oregon Health Authority to take possession and order destruction of animal. When confinement and observation of an animal for purposes of determining infection with rabies will not avoid the necessity of the application of painful or possibly dangerous preventative treatment to a person who has been bitten or scratched by such animal, the Director of the Oregon Health Authority may order possession of the animal to be immediately relinquished to the director or to the authorized representative of the director and may order the animal destroyed for examination of its bodily tissues.

      (2) The petition shall be verified and shall set forth the facts relative to the refusal to comply with the order. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the owner or person in possession of the animal in the manner provided for service of summons in civil actions. Such owner or person in possession shall appear and answer the petition at a time and place set by the court in an order, a copy of which shall be served with the petition, directing the defendant to appear at such time and place, and to then and there show cause, if any, why an order directing compliance with the order of the director should not be granted. The time set by the court for the hearing to show cause shall be made with due regard for the circumstances of the person or persons who have been subjected to the bite or scratch of the animal and whose health or life may be in jeopardy.

      (3) If the owner or person in possession fails to appear or the court either with or without such appearance finds the allegations of the petition are true and the order of the director is necessary under ORS 433.350, the court shall enter its order requiring the owner or person in possession of such animal to comply with the order of the director.

      (4) The sheriff of the county in which the animal is located shall execute such order by serving upon the owner or person in possession a copy thereof duly certified to by the clerk of the circuit court and by enforcing the provisions thereof. [1971 c.413 §4; 2009 c.595 §665]

      (a) Not apply to animals brought temporarily into the state for periods of less than 30 days but may require that the animals be kept under strict supervision by the owners of the animals.

      (b) Not apply to dogs or to any other animal specifically exempted from the inoculation requirement by rule of the department or the authority.

The tag shall be designed for and shall be attached to a collar or harness that must be worn by the dog for which the tag and certificate are issued at all times when off or outside the premises of the owner. Whenever an original tag is lost, mutilated or destroyed, upon application and payment of the fee prescribed under ORS 433.380, if any, a replacement tag, to be dated, designed and worn as the original, shall be issued.

      (3) No official of any county shall issue a license for a dog until the official has been shown a proper certification, or its equivalent, of a rabies inoculation.

      (4) If the county files the certificate upon which a tag is issued, it shall be cross-referenced to the tag number. If the certificate is not filed, the county shall keep an appropriate record of the expiration date and number, if any, of the certificate cross-referenced to the tag number. Notwithstanding ORS 205.320 (1)(a), a fee is not required for filing the certificate.

      (5) Unexpired tags shall be honored in all counties when the animal is in transit or where the owner has established a new residence.

      (2) All animals apprehended and impounded under this section shall be held in adequate and sanitary pounds to be established or contracted for in each county by the governing body of the county. All animals so impounded shall be given proper care and maintenance.

      (3) When an animal is apprehended and impounded, the owner, if known, shall be given notice of not less than five days from the date of such impounding before the animal is destroyed or otherwise disposed of. An owner appearing to redeem the animal may do so if the provisions of ORS 433.365 are complied with and if the owner pays the expense of keeping the animal during the time it was impounded and in addition thereto, the sum established by the county governing body. If the animal is subject to any other impounding law the requirements for release under that law shall also be met except that the expense of keeping the animal shall be payable only once for the period of impoundment. If the owner does not appear to redeem the animal after the notice provided for herein, or otherwise, after five days, or if the owner is not known, after three days, the governing body of the county may provide for animals impounded to be released to any other person upon the conditions outlined in this subsection or otherwise disposed of in a humane manner.

      (4) If the owner desires to redeem an animal impounded pursuant to this section or the animal is to be released to any other person as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the person shall post a $20 deposit with the county and obtain possession of the animal for the purpose of complying with ORS 433.365. The county shall refund the deposit to a person who, on or before the eighth day after obtaining possession of the animal, demonstrates proof of rabies inoculation or exemption from the inoculation requirement and, if applicable, proof of purchase of a license as required under ORS 609.100. Failure to demonstrate proof of rabies inoculation or exemption and proof of licensing within the prescribed time shall forfeit the deposit to the county.

      (5) The governing body of the county shall designate persons responsible for the enforcement of this section. [1971 c.413 §11; 1977 c.189 §7; 2001 c.636 §4]

 

      433.390 County dog control fund; sources and uses. (1) All moneys received by a county under ORS 433.340 to 433.390 and 433.990 (6) shall be paid to the county dog control fund.

      (2) The governing body of the county may, in the event of a rabies outbreak within the county, use such portion of the dog control fund as it deems necessary to purchase rabies vaccine for administration to animals under the direction of the state and local health officers. [1971 c.413 §12; 1977 c.189 §8; 1987 c.158 §78; 1987 c.905 §22; 2001 c.104 §156; 2007 c.445 §31]

      (1) “Office workplace” means any enclosed nonmanufacturing indoor area, located in a building of more than 4,000 square feet, and in which 50 or more employees, as defined in ORS 654.005 spend any part of their working hours.

      (2) “Public area” means any enclosed indoor area open to and frequented by the public and where, during a representative 24-hour period the number of public occupants exceeds the number of employees, except private residences. “Public area” includes a health care facility as defined in ORS 442.015.

      (3) “Remodeling” means any change, addition or modification in the ventilation system for which a building permit is or was required.

      (4) “Significant indoor air pollutant” means any solid, liquid, semisolid, dissolved solid, biological organism, aerosol or gaseous material, including combinations or mixtures of substances, which has an adverse effect on human health and has been designated by the state for regulation under ORS 433.502 to 433.526, 455.445 and 468A.775 to 468A.785. [1989 c.1070 §1]

 

      Note: 433.502 to 433.526 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 433 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      433.505 [Repealed by 1981 c.198 §2]

 

      433.507 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares:

      (1) Scientific studies reveal that indoor concentrations of some pollutants are frequently higher than outdoor concentrations of those pollutants and that indoor pollutant concentrations can exceed health-based standards.

      (2) On the average, people spend at least 90 percent of their time indoors, and, as a result, the population has a significant potential for exposure to indoor air pollutants.

      (3) Indoor air pollution poses one of the most serious environmental threats to public health, including cancer, respiratory illness, multiple chemical sensitivities, skin and eye irritation and related effects, and is estimated to cause significant increases in medical costs and claims, and declines in work productivity. Indoor air pollution also has been linked significantly to improperly maintained ventilation systems that increase consumption of energy.

      (4) Existing state environmental and occupational health programs do not adequately protect the public from exposure to indoor air pollution that may occur in public areas or office workplaces.

      (5) It is in the public interest to reduce exposure to indoor air pollution by developing a comprehensive program to investigate and remedy indoor air pollution and to educate the public. [1989 c.1070 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 433.502.

 

      433.510 [Amended by 1973 c.779 §20; repealed by 1981 c.198 §2]

      433.517 Field investigations and epidemiological studies. Subject to available funds, the Oregon Health Authority may conduct field investigations and epidemiological studies to quantify the extent of indoor air pollution levels and public exposure in Oregon. Field investigations shall be conducted in a manner that does not compete with the business of private contractors. Epidemiological studies may be conducted to look for the causes of illness and collect and analyze data to identify trends and health impacts, especially where national information on significant potential problems is lacking.

      (a) Particulate matter;

      (b) Aldehydes;

      (c) Radon;

      (d) Carbon monoxide;

      (e) Carbon dioxide;

      (f) Ozone; and

      (g) Water vapor.

      (3) In developing the indoor air quality standards, the authority shall consult with the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Indoor Air Pollution Task Force.

      (4) The standards established by the authority shall not take effect before July 1, 1991. The authority shall seek voluntary compliance with the standards. [1989 c.1070 §5; 1993 c.744 §227; 2009 c.595 §678]

Any workplace, building or public area that qualifies for such recognition may display a notice indicating that the building exceeds the requirements of Oregon’s indoor clean air statutes.

      (2) To qualify for recognition under this section, an office workplace, building or public area shall:

      (a) Comply with all applicable provisions of ORS 433.835 to 433.875;

      (b) Demonstrate a consistent pattern of compliance in meeting all indoor air quality standards and other requirements of ORS 433.502 to 433.526, 455.445 and 468A.775 to 468A.785; and

      (c) Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authority that all technically and economically practicable steps have been taken to minimize significant sources of indoor air pollution.

      (3) The authority by rule may establish a fee to be submitted by the owner or responsible party of a building, workplace or public area who requests certification under this section. The fee shall be an amount sufficient to pay the authority’s costs in carrying out the provisions of this section. [1989 c.1070 §8; 2009 c.595 §679]

REGULATION OF OUTDOOR MASS GATHERINGS

 

      433.735 Definitions for ORS 433.735 to 433.770. As used in ORS 433.735 to 433.770 and 433.990 (7):

      (2) “Outdoor mass gathering,” unless otherwise defined by county ordinance, means an actual or reasonably anticipated assembly of more than 3,000 persons which is held primarily in open spaces and not in any permanent structure and within any three-month period is expected to continue for more than 24 hours and not more than 120 hours, excluding hours required for ingress to and egress from a gathering that is located on lands zoned for exclusive farm use that are 60 miles or farther from the nearest interstate highway.

      433.740 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that the uncontrolled outdoor gatherings of large groups of persons for extended periods of time have necessitated a need for the establishment of reasonable health and safety rules to regulate such outdoor mass gatherings. [1971 c.597 §1]

 

      433.745 Outdoor mass gathering without permit prohibited. (1) An organizer may not hold an outdoor mass gathering or allow an outdoor mass gathering to be held on real property that the organizer owns, leases or possesses unless the governing body of the county in which the outdoor mass gathering is to take place issues the organizer a permit to hold the outdoor mass gathering.

      (2) A permit issued under this section does not entitle the organizer to make any permanent development to or on the real property. Any permanent development on the real property must be made in accordance with any applicable state or local land use law. [1971 c.597 §2; 1985 c.758 §3; 2015 c.428 §1]

 

      433.750 Application for outdoor mass gathering for which county decides land use permit is not required; criteria; procedure; fee. (1) Unless a county decides that a land use permit is required, the county in which an outdoor mass gathering is to take place shall issue a permit upon application if the organizer demonstrates compliance with or the ability to comply with the health and safety rules governing outdoor mass gatherings to be regulated according to the anticipated crowd and adopted by the Oregon Health Authority. The application must include all of the following:

      (a) Name and address of the applicant.

      (b) Legal description of the place of the proposed gathering.

      (c) Date of the proposed gathering.

      (d) Estimated attendance at the proposed gathering.

      (2) Notice of the application must be sent by the county to the county sheriff or county chief law enforcement officer, the local health officer and the chief of the fire district in which the gathering is to be held.

      (3) Each officer receiving notice of the application under subsection (2) of this section may comment in writing to the county not later than the hearing date. The comment may include recommendations related to the official functions of the officer as to granting the permit and any recommended conditions that should be imposed.

      (4) The county shall hold a public hearing on the issue of compliance with this section. Notice of the time and place of the hearing including a general explanation of the matter to be considered must be published at least 10 calendar days before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or, if there is none, it must be posted in at least three public places in the county.

      (5) Except as provided in ORS 433.763, a decision of a county on an application for a permit to hold an outdoor mass gathering may be appealed to a circuit court for the county as provided in ORS 34.020 to 34.100.

      (6) A county may charge permit applicants a fee reasonably calculated to reimburse the county for its reasonable and necessary costs in receiving, processing and reviewing applications for permits to hold outdoor mass gatherings. However, a fee authorized by this subsection may not exceed the greater of $5,000 or $2 per anticipated attendee of the gathering. [1971 c.597 §3; 1985 c.758 §4; 1993 c.779 §1; 2009 c.595 §681; 2015 c.736 §83; 2019 c.408 §3]

 

      433.755 Additional information required before permit issued; liability of permit holder; casualty insurance; county as additional insured. (1) In reviewing an application for a permit to hold an outdoor mass gathering, the county governing body may require such plans, specifications and reports as it may deem necessary for proper review and it may request and shall receive from all public officers, departments and agencies of the state and its political subdivisions such cooperation and assistance as it may deem necessary. If the county governing body determines upon examination of the permit application that the outdoor mass gathering creates a potential for injury to persons or property, the county governing body may require organizers to obtain an insurance policy in an amount commensurate with the risk, but not exceeding the limitation for liability of a local public body under ORS 30.272 (3). The policy of casualty insurance shall provide coverage against liability for death, injury or disability of any human or for damage to property arising out of the outdoor mass gathering. The county shall be named as an additional insured under the policy.

      (2) In the event of failure to remove all debris or residue and repair any damage to personal or real property arising out of the outdoor mass gathering within 72 hours after its termination and to remove any temporary structures used at the outdoor mass gathering within three weeks after its termination, the county governing body may file suit against the organizer for financial settlement as is needed to remove debris, residue or temporary structures and to repair such damage to real or personal property of persons not attending the outdoor mass gathering. The organizer shall be wholly responsible for payment of any fines imposed under ORS 433.990 (7). [1971 c.597 §4; 1985 c.758 §5; 1993 c.779 §2; 2001 c.104 §158; 2007 c.445 §33; 2019 c.340 §1]

 

      433.760 Rulemaking authority. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Oregon Health Authority shall, in accordance with the provisions of ORS chapter 183, make rules regulated according to anticipated crowds with respect to health and safety at outdoor mass gatherings which provide for:

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a county may not require a permit under ORS 433.750 for events otherwise permitted under ORS 215.213 (11), 215.283 (4), 215.449, 215.451 or 215.452. [1985 c.758 §7; 2019 c.408 §1a]

 

      433.765 Right of county to enact ordinances or regulations. ORS 433.735 to 433.770 and 433.990 (7) and any rules adopted under ORS 433.735 to 433.770 and 433.990 (7) do not preempt the right of a county to enact ordinances or regulations not inconsistent with ORS 433.735 to 433.770 and 433.990 (7) or any rules adopted under ORS 433.735 to 433.770 and 433.990 (7), except that a county may not, under ORS 433.750 or 433.763, require a land use permit for a gathering of 3,000 people or fewer, any part of which is held outdoors.
