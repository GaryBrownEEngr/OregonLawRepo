(1)(a) The Public Health Director or a local public health administrator may require testing or medical examination of any person who may have, or may have been exposed to, a communicable disease identified by rule of the Oregon Health Authority to be a reportable disease, a new or uncommon disease of potential public health significance, or a condition that is the basis of a state of public health emergency declared by the Governor as authorized by ORS 433.441. The Public Health Director or the local public health administrator must issue a written order for testing or medical examination pursuant to this section.

      (b) A written order must:

      (A) Include findings stating the communicable disease that the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator believes the person has and the reasons for that belief.

      (B) State whether medical or laboratory confirmation of the disease is feasible and possible and whether such confirmation would enable control measures to be taken to minimize infection of others with the disease.

      (C) Include a statement that the person may refuse to submit to the testing or medical examination and that if the testing or examination is refused, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator may seek the imposition of a public health measure, including isolation or quarantine pursuant to ORS 433.121 or 433.123.

      (2) When a person is directed to submit to a test or examination under this section and the person agrees to do so, the person shall submit to any testing or examination as may be necessary to establish the presence or absence of the communicable disease for which the testing or examination was directed. The examination shall be carried out by the local health officer or a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board or the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine. A written report of the results of the test or examination shall be provided to the person ordering the test or examination, and upon request, to the person tested or examined. Laboratory examinations, if any, shall be carried out by the laboratory of the authority whenever the examinations are within the scope of the tests conducted by the laboratory. If treatment is needed, the person or the parent or guardian of the person shall be liable for the costs of treatment based on the examination carried out under this section, if the person liable is able to pay the treatment costs. Cost of any examination performed by a physician in private practice shall be paid from public funds available to the local public health administrator, if any, or from county funds available for general governmental expenses in the county that the local public health administrator serves or in the county where the person tested or examined resides if the local public health administrator serves more than one county or the test or examination was ordered by the Public Health Director or local public health administrator.

      (3) If a person has a communicable disease, a new or uncommon disease of potential public health significance, or a condition that is the basis of a state of public health emergency, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator may issue an order requiring the person to complete an appropriate prescribed course of medication or other treatment for the communicable disease, including directly observed therapy if appropriate, and to follow infection control provisions for the disease. The order shall also include statements that the person may refuse the medication or other treatment and that the person’s failure to comply with the order issued under this subsection may result in the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator seeking the imposition of a public health measure, including isolation or quarantine as authorized by ORS 433.121 and 433.123.

      (4) The Public Health Director or the local public health administrator must make every effort to obtain voluntary compliance from a person for any testing, medical examination and treatment required under this section.

      (5) Any action taken by the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator under this section to compel testing, medical examination or treatment of a person who has a communicable disease, a new or uncommon disease of potential public health significance, or a condition that is the basis of a state of public health emergency must be the least restrictive alternative available to accomplish the results necessary to minimize the transmission of the disease to others.

      (c) All procedures for obtaining the respondent’s consent to an HIV test by rules adopted under ORS 433.065 have been exhausted by the petitioner and the respondent has refused to consent to the test, or within the time period prescribed by rule of the authority has failed to submit to the test;

      (d) The petitioner has no knowledge that the petitioner has a history of a positive HIV test and has since the exposure, within a time period prescribed by rule of the authority, submitted a specimen from the petitioner for an HIV test; and

      (e) The injury that petitioner is suffering or will suffer if the source person is not ordered to submit to an HIV test.

      (3) The petition shall be accompanied by the certificate of the local public health administrator declaring that, based upon information in the possession of the administrator, the facts stated in the allegations under subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of this section are true.

      (4) Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall issue a citation to the respondent stating the nature of the proceedings, the statutes involved and the relief requested and, that if the respondent does not appear at the time and place for hearing stated in the citation, that the court will order the relief requested in the petition.

      (5) The citation shall be served on the respondent together with a copy of the petition by the county sheriff or deputy.

      (7) Both the petitioner and the local public health administrator certifying to the matter alleged in the petition shall appear at the hearing. The hearing of the case shall be informal with the object of resolving the issue before the court promptly and economically between the parties.

      (a) The allegations in the petition are true;

      (b) The injury the petitioner is suffering or will suffer is an injury that only the relief requested will adequately remedy; and

      (c) The interest of the petitioner in obtaining the relief clearly outweighs the privacy interest of the respondent in withholding consent.

      (9) If the court does not make the finding described in subsection (8) of this section, the court shall dismiss the petition.

      (10) Failure to obey the order of the court shall be subject to contempt proceedings pursuant to law. [1989 c.878 §5; 2009 c.595 §638]

The waiver allows authorized users to share information from the immunization record through or between immunization registries without violating confidentiality. The immunization registries and the associated tracking and recall systems are designed to increase the state’s immunization rates for clients and help prevent the spread of the diseases at which the immunizations are aimed. Immunizations are a proven benefit to individuals and society. An immunization registry reduces inappropriate immunizations and increases appropriate immunizations because clients’ records will be easily available to authorized users.

      (d) Allowing an immunization record of a client who is under the care of an authorized user or enrolled in an authorized user’s program to be released to the authorized user;

      (e) Notifying in writing the parent or guardian of a client, at least through five years of age, when the tracking and recall system indicates that a client has missed a scheduled immunization;

      (f) Integrating with any immunization registry and its associated tracking and recall systems; and

      (g) Working with health care providers to develop information transfer systems.

      (b) Public health assessment and evaluation related to immunizations and vaccine-preventable diseases conducted by the authority or by a local health department for clients within the local health department’s jurisdiction. [1993 c.297 §3; 2003 c.573 §2; 2003 c.593 §2; 2007 c.196 §3; 2009 c.595 §641; 2011 c.71 §2]

      (1) Authorized users from providing information to and receiving information from the immunization registry regarding a client’s immunization record or tracking and recall record; or

      (2) The immunization registry from:

      (10)(a) The court shall hold a hearing on a petition filed under subsection (9) of this section within 72 hours of filing, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.

      (b) In extraordinary circumstances and for good cause shown, or with consent of the affected persons, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator may apply to continue the hearing date for up to 10 days.

      (13) Failure to obey a court order issued under this section subjects the person in violation of the order to contempt proceedings under ORS 33.015 to 33.155. [2007 c.445 §9; 2011 c.721 §3]

When isolating or quarantining a person or group of persons in accordance with ORS 433.121 or 433.123, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator shall adhere to the following conditions and principles:

      (1) Isolation or quarantine must be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease to others or to limit exposure to or contamination with a toxic substance by others, and may include, but is not limited to, confinement to private homes or other public or private premises.

      (2) Confinement may not be in a prison, jail or other facility where those charged with a crime or a violation of a municipal ordinance are incarcerated unless:

      (b) A person has been found in contempt of court because of failure to obey a court order.

      (3) Isolated persons must be confined separately from quarantined persons. If a facility is not capable of separating isolated persons from quarantined persons, either the isolated persons or the quarantined persons must be moved to a separate facility.

      (4) The health status of an isolated or quarantined person must be monitored regularly to determine if the person requires continued isolation or quarantine.

      (5) A quarantined person who subsequently becomes infected or is reasonably believed to have become infected with a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease that the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator believes poses a significant threat to the health and safety of other quarantined persons must be promptly placed in isolation.

      (6) An isolated or quarantined person must be released as soon as practicable when the Public Health Director or local public health administrator determines that the person has been successfully decontaminated or that the person no longer poses a substantial risk of transmitting a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease that would constitute a serious or imminent threat to the health and safety of others.

      (7) The needs of a person who is isolated or quarantined must be addressed to the greatest extent practicable in a systematic and competent fashion, including, but not limited to, providing adequate food, medication, competent medical care, clothing, shelter and means of communication with other persons who are in isolation or quarantine and persons who are not under isolation or quarantine.

      (9) Cultural and religious beliefs should be considered to the extent practicable in addressing the needs of persons who are isolated or quarantined and in establishing and maintaining premises used for isolation or quarantine.

      (10)(a) Isolation or quarantine shall not abridge the right of any person to rely exclusively on spiritual means to treat a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease in accordance with religious or other spiritual tenets and practices.

      (b) Nothing in ORS 433.126 to 433.138, 433.142 and 433.466 prohibits a person who relies exclusively on spiritual means to treat a communicable disease or possibly communicable disease and who is infected with a communicable disease or has been exposed to a toxic substance from being isolated or quarantined in a private place of the person’s own choice, provided the private place is approved by the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator and the person who is isolated or quarantined complies with all laws, rules and regulations governing control, sanitation, isolation and quarantine.

      (11) Prior to placing a person or group of persons subject to isolation or quarantine in a health care facility as defined in ORS 442.015, the Public Health Director or the local public health administrator must provide to the managers of the health care facility notice of the intention to seek authorization from the circuit court to place a person or group of persons in isolation or quarantine in the facility and must consult with the managers of the health care facility regarding how to best meet the requirements of this section.

      (12) The Public Health Director or local public health administrator shall provide adequate means of communication between a person or a group of persons who is isolated or quarantined and legal counsel for the person or group of persons. [2007 c.445 §12; 2011 c.721 §5; 2015 c.736 §79]

      433.142 Petition for isolation of contaminated property; contents; hearing; court order. (1) As used in this section, “to isolate property” means to restrict access to property in a manner that reduces or prevents exposure to a toxic substance by persons.

      (2) The Public Health Director or a local public health administrator may petition the circuit court to isolate property if there is reason to believe the property is contaminated with a toxic substance that poses a serious risk to the health and safety of others.

      (3) The petition must:

      (a) Describe the property subject to isolation;

      (b)(A) Describe the reasonable efforts made to obtain voluntary compliance from the owner or custodian of the property with public health measures necessary to isolate the property; or

      (c) A hearing may be waived by the owner or custodian of the property.

      (6) The court shall grant the petition if, by clear and convincing evidence, the court finds that isolation of property contaminated with a toxic substance is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the health and safety of others. An order authorizing isolation remains in effect until the toxic substance no longer poses a serious risk to the health and safety of others.

      (7) The court order must:

      433.290 Oregon Health Authority to conduct educational program concerning metabolic diseases. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that many newborn children are given their first tests for metabolic diseases too early for the detection of these diseases because parents remove these newborn infants from the hospital before the optimum testing period commences. To assure proper first testing and follow-up testing and increase knowledge about the nature and results of these diseases, the Oregon Health Authority shall institute and carry on an intensive educational program among physicians, naturopathic physicians, hospitals, public health nurses, the parents of newborn children and the public concerning the disease of phenylketonuria and other metabolic diseases. This educational program shall include information concerning:

      (a) The nature of these diseases; and

      (b) Examinations for the detection of these diseases in infancy in order that measures may be taken to prevent the mental retardation resulting from these diseases.

      (2) The authority shall make a special effort specifically to inform expectant parents and parents of newborn children of the necessity of newborn infants receiving appropriate tests within the optimum time range after birth to prevent the mental retardation or other serious complications resulting from these diseases. [1963 c.190 §2; 1977 c.582 §35; 1983 c.490 §1; 2009 c.595 §656; 2017 c.356 §64]

      (2) The county shall upon receipt of the fee and presentation of the certificate issue to the owner a serial-numbered tag, legibly identifying its expiration date as such date is determined in accordance with rules of the Oregon Health Authority relating to intervals of inoculation. The tag shall be designed for and shall be attached to a collar or harness that must be worn by the dog for which the tag and certificate are issued at all times when off or outside the premises of the owner.

      (4) If the county files the certificate upon which a tag is issued, it shall be cross-referenced to the tag number. If the certificate is not filed, the county shall keep an appropriate record of the expiration date and number, if any, of the certificate cross-referenced to the tag number. Notwithstanding ORS 205.320 (1)(a), a fee is not required for filing the certificate.

      (5) Unexpired tags shall be honored in all counties when the animal is in transit or where the owner has established a new residence.

      (3) When an animal is apprehended and impounded, the owner, if known, shall be given notice of not less than five days from the date of such impounding before the animal is destroyed or otherwise disposed of. An owner appearing to redeem the animal may do so if the provisions of ORS 433.365 are complied with and if the owner pays the expense of keeping the animal during the time it was impounded and in addition thereto, the sum established by the county governing body. If the animal is subject to any other impounding law the requirements for release under that law shall also be met except that the expense of keeping the animal shall be payable only once for the period of impoundment. If the owner does not appear to redeem the animal after the notice provided for herein, or otherwise, after five days, or if the owner is not known, after three days, the governing body of the county may provide for animals impounded to be released to any other person upon the conditions outlined in this subsection or otherwise disposed of in a humane manner.

      (4) If the owner desires to redeem an animal impounded pursuant to this section or the animal is to be released to any other person as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the person shall post a $20 deposit with the county and obtain possession of the animal for the purpose of complying with ORS 433.365. The county shall refund the deposit to a person who, on or before the eighth day after obtaining possession of the animal, demonstrates proof of rabies inoculation or exemption from the inoculation requirement and, if applicable, proof of purchase of a license as required under ORS 609.100. Failure to demonstrate proof of rabies inoculation or exemption and proof of licensing within the prescribed time shall forfeit the deposit to the county.

      (5) The governing body of the county shall designate persons responsible for the enforcement of this section. [1971 c.413 §11; 1977 c.189 §7; 2001 c.636 §4]

      (a) “Contaminated material” means wastes or other materials exposed to or tainted by chemical, radiological, or biological substances or agents.

      (b) “Transmissible agent” means a biological substance capable of causing disease or infection through individual to individual transmission, animal to individual transmission, or other modes of transmission.

      (2) Notwithstanding any provision in ORS chapter 97 or 692, during a state of public health emergency, the Public Health Director may:

      (a) Prescribe measures to provide for the safe disposal of human remains as may be reasonable and necessary to respond to the public health emergency. Measures adopted under this subsection may include the embalming, burial, cremation, interment, disinterment, transportation and disposal of human remains.

      (b) Require any person in charge of disposing of human remains to clearly label the human remains of a deceased person with a communicable disease or transmissible agent with an external, clearly visible tag indicating that the human remains are infected or contaminated and, if known, the communicable disease or transmissible agent or contaminated materials present in the remains.

      (c) After a medical examiner has certified the cause and manner of death, order a person in charge of disposing of human remains to dispose of the human remains of a person who has died of a communicable disease or transmissible agent through burial or cremation within a specified time period. To the extent practicable, religious, cultural, family and individual beliefs of the deceased person or the person’s family shall be considered when disposing of any human remains.

      (3) The Public Health Director must consult and coordinate with the Chief Medical Examiner when exercising authority under this section.

INDOOR AIR POLLUTION

 

      433.502 Definitions. As used in ORS 433.502 to 433.526, 455.445 and 468A.775 to 468A.785:

      (1) “Office workplace” means any enclosed nonmanufacturing indoor area, located in a building of more than 4,000 square feet, and in which 50 or more employees, as defined in ORS 654.005 spend any part of their working hours.

      (2) “Public area” means any enclosed indoor area open to and frequented by the public and where, during a representative 24-hour period the number of public occupants exceeds the number of employees, except private residences. “Public area” includes a health care facility as defined in ORS 442.015.

      (3) “Remodeling” means any change, addition or modification in the ventilation system for which a building permit is or was required.

      (4) “Significant indoor air pollutant” means any solid, liquid, semisolid, dissolved solid, biological organism, aerosol or gaseous material, including combinations or mixtures of substances, which has an adverse effect on human health and has been designated by the state for regulation under ORS 433.502 to 433.526, 455.445 and 468A.775 to 468A.785. [1989 c.1070 §1]

 

      Note: 433.502 to 433.526 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 433 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      433.505 [Repealed by 1981 c.198 §2]

 

      433.507 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares:

      (1) Scientific studies reveal that indoor concentrations of some pollutants are frequently higher than outdoor concentrations of those pollutants and that indoor pollutant concentrations can exceed health-based standards.

      (2) On the average, people spend at least 90 percent of their time indoors, and, as a result, the population has a significant potential for exposure to indoor air pollutants.

      (3) Indoor air pollution poses one of the most serious environmental threats to public health, including cancer, respiratory illness, multiple chemical sensitivities, skin and eye irritation and related effects, and is estimated to cause significant increases in medical costs and claims, and declines in work productivity. Indoor air pollution also has been linked significantly to improperly maintained ventilation systems that increase consumption of energy.

      (4) Existing state environmental and occupational health programs do not adequately protect the public from exposure to indoor air pollution that may occur in public areas or office workplaces.

      (5) It is in the public interest to reduce exposure to indoor air pollution by developing a comprehensive program to investigate and remedy indoor air pollution and to educate the public. [1989 c.1070 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 433.502.

 

      433.510 [Amended by 1973 c.779 §20; repealed by 1981 c.198 §2]

 

      433.511 Public information program. Subject to available funds, the Oregon Health Authority may establish a broad public information program to educate the public on indoor air pollutants, their identities, causes and effects, and on effective practical methods for preventing, detecting and correcting the causes of indoor air pollution. [1989 c.1070 §3; 2009 c.595 §676]

 

      Note: See note under 433.502.

      433.517 Field investigations and epidemiological studies. Subject to available funds, the Oregon Health Authority may conduct field investigations and epidemiological studies to quantify the extent of indoor air pollution levels and public exposure in Oregon. Field investigations shall be conducted in a manner that does not compete with the business of private contractors. Epidemiological studies may be conducted to look for the causes of illness and collect and analyze data to identify trends and health impacts, especially where national information on significant potential problems is lacking. [1989 c.1070 §4; 2009 c.595 §677]

      433.521 Indoor air quality standards. (1) Based upon the recommendations of the Indoor Air Pollution Task Force, the Oregon Health Authority may establish indoor air quality standards for significant indoor air pollutants. If established, the standards:

      (a) Shall include an adequate margin of safety;

      (b) Shall be adequate to protect the population, including sensitive groups; and

      (c) May be revised as appropriate.

      (2) If established, indoor air quality standards shall be at least for the following significant indoor air pollutants:

      (a) Particulate matter;

      (b) Aldehydes;

      (c) Radon;

      (d) Carbon monoxide;

      (e) Carbon dioxide;

      (f) Ozone; and

      (g) Water vapor.

      (3) In developing the indoor air quality standards, the authority shall consult with the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Indoor Air Pollution Task Force.

      (4) The standards established by the authority shall not take effect before July 1, 1991. The authority shall seek voluntary compliance with the standards. [1989 c.1070 §5; 1993 c.744 §227; 2009 c.595 §678]

 

      Note: See note under 433.502.

 

      433.525 [Repealed by 1981 c.198 §2]

 

      433.526 Public recognition program for compliance; rules. (1) The Oregon Health Authority may establish by rule a public recognition program for office workplaces, buildings and public areas that consistently meet the indoor air quality requirements of ORS 433.502 to 433.526, 455.445 and 468A.775 to 468A.785. Any workplace, building or public area that qualifies for such recognition may display a notice indicating that the building exceeds the requirements of Oregon’s indoor clean air statutes.

      (2) To qualify for recognition under this section, an office workplace, building or public area shall:

      (a) Comply with all applicable provisions of ORS 433.835 to 433.875;

      (b) Demonstrate a consistent pattern of compliance in meeting all indoor air quality standards and other requirements of ORS 433.502 to 433.526, 455.445 and 468A.775 to 468A.785; and

      (c) Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authority that all technically and economically practicable steps have been taken to minimize significant sources of indoor air pollution.

      (3) The authority by rule may establish a fee to be submitted by the owner or responsible party of a building, workplace or public area who requests certification under this section. The fee shall be an amount sufficient to pay the authority’s costs in carrying out the provisions of this section. [1989 c.1070 §8; 2009 c.595 §679]

REGULATION OF OUTDOOR MASS GATHERINGS

 

      433.735 Definitions for ORS 433.735 to 433.770. As used in ORS 433.735 to 433.770 and 433.990 (7):

      (1) “Outdoor mass gathering,” unless otherwise defined by county ordinance, means an actual or reasonably anticipated assembly of more than 3,000 persons which continues or can reasonably be expected to continue for more than 24 consecutive hours but less than 120 hours within any three-month period and which is held primarily in open spaces and not in any permanent structure.

      (2) “Organizer” includes any person who holds, stages or sponsors an outdoor mass gathering and the owner, lessee or possessor of the real property upon which the outdoor mass gathering is to take place.

      (3) “Permanent structure” includes a stadium, an arena, an auditorium, a coliseum, a fairgrounds or other similar established places for assemblies.

      (4) “Temporary structure” includes tents, trailers, chemical toilet facilities and other structures customarily erected or sited for temporary use. [1971 c.597 §1a; 1981 c.82 §3; 1985 c.758 §1; 2001 c.104 §157; 2007 c.445 §32]

 

      433.740 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that the uncontrolled outdoor gatherings of large groups of persons for extended periods of time have necessitated a need for the establishment of reasonable health and safety rules to regulate such outdoor mass gatherings. [1971 c.597 §1]

 

      433.745 Outdoor mass gathering without permit prohibited. (1) An organizer may not hold an outdoor mass gathering or allow an outdoor mass gathering to be held on real property that the organizer owns, leases or possesses unless the governing body of the county in which the outdoor mass gathering is to take place issues the organizer a permit to hold the outdoor mass gathering.

      (2) A permit issued under this section does not entitle the organizer to make any permanent development to or on the real property. Any permanent development on the real property must be made in accordance with any applicable state or local land use law. [1971 c.597 §2; 1985 c.758 §3; 2015 c.428 §1]

 

      433.750 Permit application; procedure for issuance of permit; fee. (1) The governing body of a county in which an outdoor mass gathering is to take place shall issue a permit upon application when the organizer demonstrates compliance with or the ability to comply with the health and safety rules governing outdoor mass gatherings to be regulated according to the anticipated crowd and adopted by the Oregon Health Authority. The application shall include all of the following:

      (a) Name and address of the applicant.

      (b) Legal description of the place of the proposed gathering.

      (c) Date of the proposed gathering.

      (d) Estimated attendance at the proposed gathering.

      (e) Nature of the proposed gathering.

      (f) Such other appropriate information as the county governing body may require in order to insure compliance with rules of the authority.

      (2) Notice of the application shall be sent by the county governing body to the county sheriff or county chief law enforcement officer, the local health officer and the chief of the fire district in which the gathering is to be held.

      (3) Each officer receiving notice of the application under subsection (2) of this section who wishes to comment on the application shall submit such comment in writing to the county governing body not later than the hearing date. The comment may include recommendations related to the official functions of the officer as to granting the permit and any recommended conditions that should be imposed.

      (4) The county governing body shall hold a public hearing on the issue of compliance with this section. Notice of the time and place of such hearing including a general explanation of the matter to be considered shall be published at least 10 calendar days before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or, if there is none, it shall be posted in at least three public places in the county.

      (5) Any decision of a county governing body on an application for a permit to hold an outdoor mass gathering may be appealed to a circuit court for the county as provided in ORS 34.020 to 34.100.

      (6) A county governing body may charge permit applicants a fee reasonably calculated to reimburse the county for its reasonable and necessary costs in receiving, processing and reviewing applications for permits to hold outdoor mass gatherings. However, a fee authorized by this subsection shall not exceed $5,000 and shall not be charged when the governing body finds, by a preponderance of the evidence presented to the governing body, that the applicant is unable to reimburse the governing body. [1971 c.597 §3; 1985 c.758 §4; 1993 c.779 §1; 2009 c.595 §681; 2015 c.736 §83]

 

      433.755 Additional information required before permit issued; liability of permit holder; casualty insurance; county as additional insured. (1) In reviewing an application for a permit to hold an outdoor mass gathering, the county governing body may require such plans, specifications and reports as it may deem necessary for proper review and it may request and shall receive from all public officers, departments and agencies of the state and its political subdivisions such cooperation and assistance as it may deem necessary. If the county governing body determines upon examination of the permit application that the outdoor mass gathering creates a potential for injury to persons or property, the county governing body may require organizers to obtain an insurance policy in an amount commensurate with the risk, but not exceeding $1 million. The policy of casualty insurance shall provide coverage against liability for death, injury or disability of any human or for damage to property arising out of the outdoor mass gathering. The county shall be named as an additional insured under the policy.

      (2) In the event of failure to remove all debris or residue and repair any damage to personal or real property arising out of the outdoor mass gathering within 72 hours after its termination and to remove any temporary structures used at the outdoor mass gathering within three weeks after its termination, the county governing body may file suit against the organizer for financial settlement as is needed to remove debris, residue or temporary structures and to repair such damage to real or personal property of persons not attending the outdoor mass gathering. The organizer shall be wholly responsible for payment of any fines imposed under ORS 433.990 (7). [1971 c.597 §4; 1985 c.758 §5; 1993 c.779 §2; 2001 c.104 §158; 2007 c.445 §33]

 

      433.760 Rulemaking authority. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Oregon Health Authority shall, in accordance with the provisions of ORS chapter 183, make rules regulated according to anticipated crowds with respect to health and safety at outdoor mass gatherings which provide for:

      (1) Adequate water supply, drainage and sewerage facilities;

      (2) Adequate toilet facilities;

      (3) Adequate refuse storage and disposal facilities;
