     (b) Interfere with or restrict, in the regulation or provision of benefits, facilities, services or information, the right of consenting individuals to obtain and use safe and effective methods of contraception.

     (2) Nothing in this section is intended to prevent the application of laws, rules, ordinances or taxes that affect the method or manner of sales or distribution of contraceptive devices, provided the laws, rules, ordinances or taxes are designed to promote public health and safety and do not unreasonably burden public access to contraception.

     (3) As used in this section:

     (a) “Contraception” means the use of any process, device or method to prevent pregnancy, including steroidal, chemical, physical or barrier, natural or permanent methods for preventing the union of an ovum with the spermatozoon, or preventing the subsequent implantation of the fertilized ovum in the uterus, and includes all postcoital methods, drugs or devices approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to prevent pregnancy.

     (b) “Pregnancy” is the period of time from implantation of a fertilized ovum in the uterus to delivery. A woman shall be presumed pregnant if she is premenopausal and exhibits signs of pregnancy, including missed menses, until disproved by a laboratory test or until delivery. [2007 c.182 §7]

The authority shall furnish consultation and assistance to local health departments.

     (2) Family planning and birth control services may include interviews with trained personnel; distribution of literature; referral to a licensed physician, physician assistant licensed under ORS 677.505 to 677.525, naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685 or nurse practitioner licensed under ORS 678.375 to 678.390 for consultation, examination, medical treatment and prescription; and, to the extent so prescribed, the distribution of rhythm charts, the initial supply of a drug or other medical preparation, contraceptive devices and similar products.

     (4) In carrying out its duties under this section, and with the consent of the local public health authority as defined in ORS 431.003, the local health department may adopt a fee schedule for services provided by the local health department. The fees shall be reasonably calculated not to exceed costs of services provided and may be adjusted on a sliding scale reflecting ability to pay.

     (5) The local health department shall collect fees according to the schedule adopted under subsection (4) of this section. Such fees may be used to meet the expenses of providing the services authorized by this section. [1967 c.491 §§1,2; 1971 c.396 §1; 1971 c.779 §65; 1973 c.253 §1; 2001 c.900 §159; 2009 c.595 §692; 2014 c.45 §56; 2015 c.736 §86; 2017 c.356 §65]

 

     435.215 Right to refuse services protected. The refusal of any person to accept family planning and birth control services shall in no way affect the right of such person to receive public assistance, medical assistance, as defined in ORS 414.025, or any other public benefit and every person to whom such services are offered shall be so advised initially both orally and in writing. Employees engaged in the administration of ORS 435.205 to 435.235 shall recognize that the right to make decisions concerning family planning and birth control is a fundamental personal right of the individual and nothing in ORS 435.205 to 435.235 shall in any way abridge such individual right, nor shall any individual be required to state the reason for refusing the offer of family planning and birth control services.

     435.225 Refusal by employee to offer services. Any employee of the Oregon Health Authority may refuse to accept the duty of offering family planning and birth control services to the extent that such duty is contrary to the personal or religious beliefs of the employee. However, such employee shall notify the immediate supervisor in writing of such refusal in order that arrangements may be made for eligible persons to obtain such information and services from another employee. Such refusal shall not be grounds for any disciplinary action, for dismissal, for any interdepartmental transfer, for any other discrimination in employment, or for suspension from employment, or for any loss in pay or other benefits. [1967 c.491 §4; 1971 c.779 §67; 2009 c.595 §693]

 

     435.235 Construction of ORS 435.205 to 435.235. ORS 435.205 to 435.235 shall be liberally construed to protect the rights of all individuals to pursue their religious beliefs, to follow the dictates of their own consciences, to prevent the imposition upon any individual of practices offensive to the individual’s moral standards, to respect the right of every individual to self-determination in the procreation of children, and to insure a complete freedom of choice in pursuance of constitutional rights.
