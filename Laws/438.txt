     (2) A license issued to the owner of a clinical laboratory is not transferable. The license of the laboratory is voided 30 days after a change in its director if it has only one director or if all directors change or a change in the ownership or in the location of the laboratory. In case of death of a director, immediate notification to the Director of the Oregon Health Authority or a designee who shall be empowered to issue a special temporary permit of 30 days’ duration issued to a designated substitute director is required. If a license is voided or a special temporary permit is issued under this section, a new license application, accompanied by the nonrefundable license fee prescribed in ORS 438.130, shall be filed with the authority.

     (3) The procedures under subsection (2) of this section shall be referred to as external quality control. The samples are to be tested by regularly assigned personnel using routine methods. The test samples shall be confined to the specialty of the laboratory as indicated on the license. A specified time shall be allowed for such testing and reporting of the results and shall be the time required under conditions of normal operation.

     (4) In addition to external quality control, each clinical laboratory shall establish an internal laboratory quality control system pursuant to rules of the authority including but not necessarily limited to the testing of reference or control sera and other biological samples, verifying concurrent calibration standards and control charts recordings, and reporting on its control system as required by the authority.

     438.435 Testing for substance of abuse; rules; fees. (1) In addition to duties which a clinical laboratory may perform under ORS 438.010 to 438.510, a laboratory is authorized to perform appropriate tests, examinations or analyses on materials derived from the human body for the purpose of detecting substances of abuse in the body. All laboratories performing the tests, examinations or analyses must be licensed under the provisions of ORS 438.010 to 438.510 and must employ qualified technical personnel to perform the tests, examinations and analyses.

     (2) In order to perform such tests, examinations or analyses, the laboratory may examine specimens submitted by persons other than those described in ORS 438.430 (1) and shall report the result of any test, examination or analysis to the person who submitted the specimen. When the substance of abuse test is for nonmedical employment or pre-employment purposes, and a written request is provided, the test result shall be reported to the person from whom the specimen was originally obtained.

     (3) When the specimen of a person tested for substances of abuse is submitted to the laboratory and the test result is positive, the laboratory shall perform a confirming test which has been designated by rule of the Oregon Health Authority as the best available technology for use to determine whether or not the substance of abuse identified by the first test is present in the specimen prior to reporting the test results.

     (4) The authority by rule shall set standards for special category laboratories that engage only in the initial testing for substances of abuse in the body, including registration procedures for such laboratories and personnel.

     (5) The operator of a substances of abuse on-site screening facility may use substances of abuse on-site screening tests if the test results are not for use in diagnosing or preventing disease and are not for use by physicians, dentists or other licensed health care professionals in treating humans. Any entity using the test shall pay a yearly filing fee, not to exceed $50, and file a registration form as provided by rule of the authority that:

     (a) States the current name and address of the entity, the telephone number of the entity, if any, and the name of a contact individual at each on-site facility operated by the entity; and

     (b) Certifies that:

     (A) The tests are being administered according to the federal Food and Drug Administration package insert that accompanies the test;

     (B) The tests are being administered according to the instructions of the manufacturer;

     (C) Custody chain procedures are being followed;

     (D) Operators of the substances of abuse on-site screening facility are trained in the use of the substances of abuse on-site screening tests by the manufacturer; and

     (E) If the substances of abuse on-site screening facility obtains a positive test result on a specimen and the entity indicates that the test result is to be used to deny or deprive any person of employment or any benefit, or may otherwise result in adverse employment action, the same specimen shall be submitted to a clinical laboratory licensed under ORS 438.110 and 438.150 or an equivalent out-of-state facility and the presence of a substance of abuse confirmed prior to release of the on-site test result.

     (6) The authority by rule shall set reasonable standards for the screening by correctional agencies of inmates within state and local correctional facilities and offenders on parole, probation or post-prison supervision for substances of abuse. The standards shall include, but not be limited to, the establishment of written procedures and protocols, the qualifications and training of individuals who perform screening tests, the approval of specific technologies and the minimum requirements for record keeping, quality control and confirmation of positive screening results.

     (7) If an initial test by a special category laboratory under subsection (4) of this section or a special category screening under subsection (6) of this section shows a result indicating the presence of a substance of abuse in the body, a confirmatory test shall be conducted in a licensed clinical laboratory if the results are to be used to deprive or deny any person of any employment or benefit. If a screening test of an inmate of a state or local correctional facility is positive for a substance of abuse, the inmate may be held in a secure facility pending the outcome of the confirmatory test. If the confirmatory test is positive, the inmate may be held in a secure facility pending the outcome of any hearing to determine what action will be taken.

     (8) If any test for substances of abuse is performed outside this state the results of which are to be used to deprive or deny any person any employment or any benefit, the person desiring to use the test shall have the burden to show that the testing procedure used meets or exceeds the testing standards of this state.
