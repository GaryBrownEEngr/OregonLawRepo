      (b) The authority shall, following payment of the fee, annually renew each license issued under this subsection unless:

However, nothing in ORS 441.224 to 441.233 shall prevent a credentialing organization from requesting additional credentialing information from a health care practitioner for the purpose of completing credentialing procedures for the health care practitioner used by the credentialing organization.

      (b) A credentialing organization that, in good faith, uses credentialing information provided under this subsection for the purposes established by the authority under ORS 441.226 (2)(e) is immune from civil liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed with respect to the use of that credentialing information. [2013 c.603 §4]

 

      441.229 Exemption from electronic credentialing information program. A prepaid group practice health plan that serves at least 200,000 members in this state and that has been issued a certificate of authority by the Department of Consumer and Business Services may petition the Director of the Oregon Health Authority to be exempt from the requirements of ORS 441.224 to 441.233. The director may award the petition if the director determines that subjecting the health plan to ORS 441.224 to 441.233 is not cost-effective. If a petition is awarded under this section, the exemption also applies to any health care facilities and health care provider groups associated with the health plan. [2013 c.603 §5]

      441.232 Advisory group. At least once per year, the Oregon Health Authority shall convene an advisory group consisting of individuals who represent credentialing organizations, health care practitioners and health care regulatory boards to review and advise the authority on the implementation of ORS 441.224 to 441.233 and on the standard credentialing application used in this state. [2013 c.603 §7]

 

      441.233 Rules. The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt rules necessary for the administration of ORS 441.224 to 441.233. [2013 c.603 §6; 2017 c.101 §34; 2017 c.384 §7]

      441.277 Definitions for ORS 441.277 to 441.323. As used in ORS 441.277 to 441.323:

      (1) “Facility” means a long term care facility as defined in ORS 442.015 or a residential care facility as defined in ORS 443.400. “Facility” does not include facilities licensed, certified or otherwise authorized under ORS 418.205 to 418.327, 418.470, 418.475 or 418.950 to 418.970 by the Department of Human Services.

      441.281 Petition for appointment of trustee; hearing; order. (1) The Director of Human Services may petition the circuit court for Marion County or for the county in which a facility is located for an order appointing a trustee to administer the facility for a period not to exceed 18 months.

      (5) If there exists a serious and immediate risk of harm or death to patients of a facility, the director may file with the petition described in subsection (1) of this section an ex parte motion for the preliminary appointment of a trustee. The motion shall be supported by affidavits demonstrating the qualifications of the proposed trustee and the need for an immediate appointment of a trustee to protect the patients prior to a hearing. If the court grants the motion for the preliminary appointment of a trustee, the court shall set a hearing on the merits of the petition within five judicial days. Pending the court’s order on the petition described in subsection (1) of this section, a preliminary trustee appointed pursuant to this subsection shall have all of the powers and duties described in ORS 441.289. [1981 c.868 §2; 1985 c.648 §1; 1987 c.428 §18; 2009 c.539 §1]

 

      441.285 [Amended by 1969 c.343 §12; repealed by 1969 c.343 §28; amended by 1969 c.669 §8; 1973 c.796 §61; renumbered 440.330]

 

      441.286 Grounds for appointment of trustee. There are grounds for the appointment of a trustee under ORS 441.281 if a court finds that the health and welfare of patients in a facility are or in the immediate future will be in jeopardy and the finding is based on one or more of the following:

      (1) Prior inspections or investigations of complaints by the Department of Human Services revealed that the facility was not in compliance with rules of the department and the department’s attempts to bring the facility into compliance are unsuccessful.

      (2) The health and welfare of patients at the facility are in jeopardy due to continued noncompliance of the facility over a seven-day period after an inspection or investigation of a complaint, demonstrated by one or more of the following:

      (a) Physicians’ orders are not being followed correctly.

      (b) Direct patient care is lacking or inadequate to the point that a patient has suffered or is suffering physical harm.

      (c) The levels of staffing are deficient to the point of causing physical or mental harm to a patient.

      (d) The department has determined that a physical injury to a patient of a facility has been caused by other than accidental means and the licensee has not taken necessary action.

      (3) The licensee is unwilling or unable to upgrade the quality of patient care to the level necessary to protect the health and welfare of the patients.

      (4) The facility is insolvent.

      (5) The department has revoked or suspended the license of the facility.

      (6) The licensee intends to cease operations and to close the facility and has not made adequate arrangements for relocation of the patients.

      (7) The monitors are refused access to the facility.

      (8) The licensee agreed to the appointment of a temporary manager under ORS 441.333, but subsequently revoked consent for a temporary manager or is interfering with the ability of the temporary manager to operate the facility. [1981 c.868 §3; 1985 c.648 §2; 1987 c.428 §19; 2009 c.539 §2]

 

      441.289 Powers and duties of trustee. A trustee appointed under ORS 441.281:

      (1) May exercise any powers and shall perform any duties required by the court.

      (2) Shall operate the facility in such a manner as to protect the health and welfare of the patients.

      (3) Shall have the same rights to possession of the building in which the facility is located and of all goods and fixtures in the building at the time the petition for the appointment of the trustee is filed as the licensee would have had if the trustee had not been appointed.

      (4) Shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to protect and conserve the assets and property the trustee takes in possession, or the proceeds of any transfer thereof, and may use them only in the performance of the powers and duties set forth in this section and by order of the court.

      (5) May receive and spend the facility’s income and encumber its assets to the extent specifically authorized by the court and do all acts necessary or appropriate to promote the health and safety of the patients.

      (6) Shall have the power to maintain an action to reach the assets of the parent corporation if it appears to the court that the parent corporation is the actual controlling owner of the facility and that the named owner is not in control of the facility.

      (7) May use the building, fixtures, furnishings and any accompanying consumable goods in the provision of care and services to patients at the time the petition for the appointment of the trustee was filed.

      (8) Shall collect payments for all goods and services provided to patients during the period of the trust, at the same rate of payment charged by the facility at the time the petition for the appointment of the trustee was filed, unless a different rate is set by the court.

      (9) May correct or eliminate any deficiency in the structure or furnishings of the facility which endangers the health or welfare of the patients while they remain in the facility. However, the total cost of correction may not exceed $3,000 unless the court orders expenditures for this purpose in excess of $3,000 upon application by the trustee.

      (10) May make contracts and hire agents and employees to assist the trustee in carrying out the powers and duties described in this section, subject to approval by the court.

      (11) Except as provided in ORS 441.296, shall honor all leases, mortgages and secured transactions governing the building in which this facility is located and all goods and fixtures in the building of which the trustee has taken possession, but only to the extent of payments which, in the case of a rental agreement, are for the use of the property during the period of the trust, or which, in the case of a purchase agreement, come due during the period of the trust.

      (12) May direct, manage and discharge employees of the facility, subject to any contract rights they may have.

      (13) Shall pay employees at the same rate of compensation, including benefits, that the employees would have received from the owner, operator or other controlling person, except the trustee shall compensate employees only for time actually worked during the period of the trust and shall not be responsible for reimbursement for vacations or periods of sick leave. However, in no case shall a trustee compensate any employee of a facility in an amount which is less than the minimum amount required by law.

      (14) Shall be entitled to take possession of all property or assets belonging to patients that are in the possession of the long term care facility.

      (15) Shall preserve and protect all property, assets and records of patients of which the trustee takes possession.

      (16) May prohibit any person, including a licensee, from entering or remaining on the premises if in the opinion of the trustee the person is interfering or has materially interfered with the ability of the trustee to exercise the powers and duties under this section.

      (17) If the facility ceases to operate and closes during the period of the trust and any patient is transferred as a result, shall ensure that:

      (a) Transportation of the patient, the patient’s belongings and the medical record to the new location is provided.

      (b) Aid for locating alternative placements is available to the patient or the patient’s legal representative.

      (c) Each patient is physically and mentally prepared for transfer to avoid possible trauma due to the transfer.

      (d) Each patient or the patient’s legal representative is permitted to participate in the selection of the new placement.

      (18) Is an agent of the state for purposes of ORS 30.260 to 30.300 for which the Department of Human Services shall be assessed and the department may use the Facility Fund established under ORS 441.303 to pay the assessment. [1981 c.868 §4; 1985 c.731 §28; 1987 c.428 §20; 1997 c.249 §140; 2009 c.539 §3]

 

      441.290 [Renumbered 440.335]

 

      441.293 Liability to trustee for goods and services after notice; effect of nonpayment. (1) A person who is served with notice of an order of the court appointing a trustee, with the trustee’s name and address, shall be liable to pay the trustee for any goods or services provided by the trustee after the date of the order if the person would have been liable for the goods or services as supplied by the licensee. The trustee shall give a receipt for each payment and shall keep a copy of each receipt on file. The trustee shall deposit amounts received in a special account and may use this or any other similar account for disbursements.

      (2) The trustee may bring an action to enforce the liability created by subsection (1) of this section. Proof of payment to the trustee is as effective in favor of the person making the payment as payment of the amount to the person who would have been entitled to receive the sum so paid.

      (3) A patient shall not be discharged, nor shall any contract or rights be forfeited or impaired, nor shall forfeiture or liability be increased, by reason of an omission to pay a licensee a sum paid to the trustee. [1981 c.868 §5; 2009 c.539 §4]

 

      441.295 [Amended by 1969 c.343 §§13,27; 1969 c.344 §6; 1971 c.403 §7; renumbered 440.340]

 

      441.296 Liability for rent or contracts. (1) A trustee is not required to honor any lease, mortgage, secured transaction or other wholly or partially executory contract entered into by the licensee if in the judgment of the court the terms thereof are unconscionable.

      (2) If the trustee is in possession of real estate or goods subject to a lease, mortgage or security interest which the trustee is permitted to avoid under subsection (1) of this section, and if the real estate or goods are necessary for the continued operation of the facility, the trustee may apply to the court to set a reasonable rental. The court shall hold a hearing on the application within 15 days. The trustee shall send notice of the application to any known owners of the property involved at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Payment by the trustee of the amount determined by the court to be reasonable is a defense to any action against the trustee for payment or for possession of the goods or real estate subject to the lease or mortgage involved by any person who received such notice. However, the payment does not relieve the licensee of any liability for the difference between the amount paid by the trustee and the amount due under the original lease or mortgage involved. [1981 c.868 §6; 2009 c.539 §5]

 

      441.300 [Amended by 1969 c.343 §14; repealed by 1969 c.343 §29 and 1969 c.345 §20]

 

      441.301 Payment of expenses when income inadequate. If funds collected under ORS 441.289 and 441.293 are insufficient to meet the expenses of performing the powers and duties conferred on the trustee by ORS 441.277 to 441.323 or on the temporary manager pursuant to ORS 441.333, or if there are insufficient funds on hand to meet those expenses, the Department of Human Services may draw from the Facility Fund established in ORS 441.303 to pay those expenses. Moneys drawn under this section that are not applied to the expenses of the trust shall be used to reimburse the fund for advances made under this section. [1981 c.868 §7; 2009 c.539 §6]

 

      441.303 Establishment of Facility Fund; fees from facilities in addition to license or application fee; use of fees. (1) The Facility Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund, consisting of payments made by facilities to the Department of Human Services as specified in this section. Interest earned by the Facility Fund shall be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the department for the purpose of paying:

      (a) The reasonable expenses of a trustee appointed under ORS 441.281 if funds collected by a trustee under ORS 441.289 and 441.293 are insufficient to meet those expenses; or

      (b) The reasonable expenses of a temporary manager appointed under ORS 441.333 if funds collected by a temporary manager are insufficient to meet those expenses.

      (2) Each licensee shall pay annually to the department an amount not to exceed the annual license fee or application fee for the facility under ORS 441.020 or 443.415. The facility payment shall be due annually on a date fixed by the department and enforced in the same manner as the license fee for the particular facility is payable and enforceable. The amount of payments shall be set so as to acquire in the fund the $750,000 described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) Whenever the balance of moneys in the fund established under this section reaches $750,000, the department shall discontinue collecting the facility payment described in subsection (2) of this section. However, whenever the fund balance falls below $600,000, the department shall reinstitute the facility payment described in subsection (2) of this section until the fund is restored to at least $750,000. The department’s notice of intent to reinstitute the facility payment shall include a summary of the amounts expended by the department from the fund and the balance of the fund on the date of the notice. The department may use reasonable amounts from the fund necessary to administer the fund.

      (4) Whenever the department is required to use any amount in the fund to meet the expenses of a trustee appointed under ORS 441.281 or a temporary manager appointed under ORS 441.333, the amount used shall constitute a loan to the facility and shall be repayable to the fund under such terms and conditions as the facility and the department agree. The rate of interest shall be set by the department to reflect the prevailing market rate on similar loans. Interest earned under this subsection shall be credited to the fund established under this section.

      (5) The facility payment described in subsection (2) of this section shall be considered an allowable cost in setting the reimbursement rates of a facility by the department.

      (6) The court may order that the trustee file an undertaking with the clerk of the court. The fund established under this section may serve as surety for the undertaking. [1981 c.868 §7a; 1983 c.787 §1; 1987 c.428 §21; 1989 c.966 §49; 2003 c.14 §255; 2009 c.539 §7; 2017 c.679 §38]

 

      441.305 [Amended by 1969 c.343 §15; 1971 c.647 §79; renumbered 440.350]

 

      441.306 Compensation of trustee. The court shall set the compensation of the trustee. That compensation and the compensation of the employees shall be considered a necessary expense of the trust. [1981 c.868 §8]

 

      441.307 [1957 s.s. c.13 §7; 1969 c.343 §16; repealed by 1971 c.647 §149]

 

      441.308 [Repealed by 1957 s.s. c.13 §8]

 

      441.309 Trustee as public employee. (1) In any action or special proceeding brought against a trustee in the trustee’s official capacity for acts committed while carrying out the powers granted and duties imposed by ORS 441.277 to 441.323, the trustee shall be considered a public employee.

      (2) A trustee may be held liable in a personal capacity only for the trustee’s own gross negligence, intentional acts or breach of fiduciary duty. [1981 c.868 §9]

 

      441.310 [Amended by 1959 c.616 §1; 1969 c.343 §17; repealed by 1971 c.647 §149]

 

      441.312 License renewal of facility placed in trust. Notwithstanding other provisions of law concerning licensing of long term care facilities, a license renewal may be issued to a facility placed in trust under ORS 441.281. The duration of a license issued under this section is limited to the duration of the trust. [1981 c.868 §10; 2009 c.539 §8]

 

      441.315 [Amended by 1971 c.647 §80; renumbered 440.355]

 

      441.316 Termination of trust; extension; license revocation. (1) The court may terminate a trust if the time period specified in the order appointing the trustee lapses or if the patients in the facility have been provided with care in another facility or upon petition of the licensee if the licensee intends to discontinue the operation of or close the facility during the period of trust. The court may use its discretion in terminating a trust upon petition of the licensee to determine whether discontinuance or closure will promote the health and safety of the patients.

      (2) At the expiration of the period for which the trustee was appointed, the court shall make a determination as to the future of the facility based upon evidence presented to the court. At that time the court may decide to:

      (a) Order the Department of Human Services to issue a new license to the person that was the licensee when the department filed the petition under ORS 441.281 and permit the facility to continue in operation;

      (b) Extend the period of appointment of the trustee by not more than 90 days; or

      (c) Order the department without further administrative hearing to revoke the license of the facility.

      (3) Nothing in ORS 441.277 to 441.323 is intended to limit or prohibit any licensee from ceasing the operation of and closing a facility during the period of the trust. However, the licensee intending to do so shall give written notice of the intended action to the trustee pursuant to rules of the department. The trustee may continue to operate the facility for a period of not more than 60 days after notice is received. The licensee shall be liable for any expenses incurred in the operation of the facility during this period. [1981 c.868 §11; 1987 c.428 §22; 2009 c.539 §9]

 

      441.318 Trustee accounting; deficiencies; lien. (1) Within 60 days following the creation of the trust by the court, and every 60 days thereafter, and within 30 days after the termination of the trust, the trustee shall give the court and the Department of Human Services a complete accounting of all property of which the trustee has taken possession, all funds collected under ORS 441.289 and 441.293 and all expenses incurred by the trust. The trustee shall prepare and file a report with the court and the department making recommendations concerning the current condition of the facility and projections for future operation of the facility and the conditions of the health and welfare of the patients.

      (2)(a) If the funds collected by the trustee under ORS 441.289 and 441.293 exceed the reasonable expenses of the trust, the court shall order payment of the surplus to the licensee after reimbursement to the department of amounts contributed from the Facility Fund established under ORS 441.303.

      (b) If the funds are insufficient to cover the reasonable expenses of the trust, the department may move the court for an order requiring the licensee to pay the deficiency to the department. The motion shall contain the following statement in bold:

______________________________________________________________________________

Notice to _________

 

      The Department of Human Services has filed this motion to recover from you costs incurred as a result of the operation of a facility under ORS 441.277 to 441.323. The court may enter a money judgment against you if you fail to respond to this motion within 20 days of service of this motion upon you.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (c) The department shall serve the motion personally or by first class mail at the last-known address of the licensee. If the licensee fails to file a response to the motion within 20 days of service, the court shall enter an order and judgment accordingly. If the licensee files a timely response, the court shall set a date for a hearing at which the court shall determine whether the expenses incurred by the trust are reasonable.

      (d) The licensee is not liable for expenses in excess of what the court finds to be reasonable. The court shall enter a money judgment against the licensee in an amount that does not exceed the reasonable expenses. Payment recovered from the licensee shall be credited to reimburse the Facility Fund established under ORS 441.303.

      (3) The department shall have a lien for any deficiency established under subsection (2) of this section upon any real property and other beneficial interest, direct or indirect, of any licensee, any fixtures, equipment or goods used in the operation of the facility and the proceeds from a conveyance of any such property or interest made by the licensee within the 12 months prior to the filing of the petition for appointment of a trustee.

      (4) The lien provided in subsection (3) of this section is prior to any lien or other interest that originates subsequent to the filing of a petition for appointment of a trustee under ORS 441.281, except for a construction lien arising out of work performed with the express consent of the trustee.

      (5) The lien established under subsection (3) of this section may be recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record described in ORS 205.130. [1981 c.868 §12; 1987 c.428 §23; 2009 c.539 §10]

      441.323 Effect of trust or temporary management on prior obligations or civil or criminal liabilities. (1) Nothing in ORS 441.277 to 441.323 is intended:

      (a) To relieve any licensee of the facility placed in trust under ORS 441.281 or under temporary management pursuant to ORS 441.333 of any civil or criminal liability incurred, or any duty imposed by law by reason of acts or omissions of the licensee prior to the appointment of a trustee under ORS 441.281.

      (b) To suspend any obligation of the licensee for payment of taxes or other operating and maintenance expenses of the facility or payment of mortgages or other liens during the term of the trust or the temporary management.

      (2) A licensee may not be held professionally liable for acts or omissions of the trustee or the trustee’s employees during the term of the trust or of the temporary manager or the temporary manager’s employees during the period of temporary management. [1981 c.868 §13; 2009 c.539 §11]

      441.530 Policy. In order to provide the people of Oregon with access to adequate medical care and hospital facilities, the Legislative Assembly finds that it is necessary and desirable to authorize the creation in the several counties and cities of public authorities having the power to acquire, own, lease, sell and otherwise dispose of hospital facilities, and to authorize municipalities which create authorities to utilize those authorities to issue bonds and other obligations on behalf of such municipalities in order that the municipalities may provide hospital facilities. [1973 c.153 §1; 1977 c.201 §2]

 

      441.532 Municipalities authorized to create authority; issuance of obligations; conditions; purpose of authority. Only a municipality may create an authority.

Such director shall serve only so long as the director is a member of the governing body and, in any event, no longer than six years.

      (d) Such other provisions as may be appropriate and not inconsistent with ORS 441.525 to 441.595 or the laws of Oregon.

      (2) The board of directors shall adopt and may amend rules for calling and conducting its meetings and carrying out its business and may adopt an official seal. All decisions of the board shall be by motion or resolution and shall be recorded in the board’s minute book which shall be a public record.

      (3) The board may employ such employees and agents as it deems appropriate and provide for their compensation.

      (4) Notwithstanding the exception for pecuniary benefit or detriment described in ORS 244.020 (13)(c), a director is a public official subject to the requirements of ORS chapter 244 based on an actual conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest arising out of the director’s relationship with a nonprofit corporation that is tax-exempt under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, including employment with the nonprofit corporation or a relationship with a foundation that provides assistance to the nonprofit corporation.

      (2) The authority shall issue revenue obligations only by bond resolution duly adopted by its board of directors. The bond resolution shall specify the public purposes for which the proceeds of the revenue obligations shall be expended, declare the estimated cost of carrying out such purposes, contain such covenants, and provide for the issuance and sale of revenue obligations in such form and amount as the directors determine. In declaring such cost, the directors may include the funds necessary for working capital during construction, reserves, interest during construction, the payment of organizational, planning, financing and legal expenses, the repayment of advances and the start-up costs. The bond resolution may provide that hospital facilities subsequently acquired or constructed by the authority shall be deemed betterments or additions to, or extensions of, the specified hospital facility, whether or not physically connected.

      (3) The bond resolution shall provide for the establishment of one or more special funds, and such funds may be under the control of the board or one or more trustees.

      (8) The board of directors may provide by resolution for the issuance of funding and refunding revenue obligations in order to refund, convert, purchase or restructure any one or more series, or portion of a series, of outstanding revenue obligations at such time or times as it may determine.

      (b) The department shall impose a license condition in a scope and manner that is specifically designed to remediate the finding that led to the license condition.

      (c) If the department imposes a license condition in response to a finding of immediate jeopardy to residents of the facility, and the finding of immediate jeopardy to residents of the facility is not substantiated within 30 days after the imposition of the license condition, the department shall immediately remove the license condition.

      (d)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the department shall provide a facility with a notice of impending imposition of license condition at least 48 hours before issuing an order imposing a license condition. The notice must:

      (A) A specific description of how the scope and manner of the license condition is designed to remediate the findings that led to the license condition; and

      (B) A specific description of the requirements for withdrawal of the license condition.

      (3) The department may impose a license condition that includes a restriction on admissions to the facility only if the department makes a finding of immediate jeopardy that is likely to present an immediate jeopardy to future residents upon admission.

      (4)(a) Following the imposition of a license condition on a facility, the department shall:

      (A) Within 15 business days of receipt of the facility’s written assertion of substantial compliance with the requirements set forth by the department for withdrawal of the license condition, reinspect or reevaluate the facility to determine whether the facility has achieved substantial compliance with the requirements;

      (b) If the department finds that the facility has achieved substantial compliance regarding the violation for which the license condition was imposed, and finds that systems are in place to ensure similar deficiencies do not reoccur, the department shall withdraw the license condition.

      (c) If after reinspection or reevaluation the department determines that the violation for which the license condition was imposed continues to exist, the department may not withdraw the license condition, and the department is not obligated to reinspect or reevaluate the facility again for 45 days after the first reinspection or reevaluation. The department shall provide the decision not to withdraw the license condition to the facility in writing and inform the facility of the right to a contested case hearing pursuant to ORS chapter 183. Nothing in this paragraph limits the department’s authority to visit or inspect the facility at any time.

      (d) If the department does not meet the requirements of this subsection, a license condition is automatically removed on the date the department failed to meet the requirements of this subsection, unless the Director of Human Services extends the applicable period for no more than 15 business days. The director may not delegate the power to make a determination regarding an extension under this paragraph. [2017 c.679 §5]
