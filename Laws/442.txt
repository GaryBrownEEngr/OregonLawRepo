      442.020 [Amended by 1955 c.533 §4; 1973 c.754 §2; repealed by 1977 c.717 §23]

 

      442.025 Findings and policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that the achievement of reasonable access to quality health care at a reasonable cost is a priority of the State of Oregon.

      (2) Problems preventing the priority in subsection (1) of this section from being attained include:

      (a) The inability of many citizens to pay for necessary health care, being covered neither by private insurance nor by publicly funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;

      (b) Rising costs of medical care which exceed substantially the general rate of inflation;

      (c) Insufficient price competition in the delivery of health care services that would provide a greater cost consciousness among providers, payers and consumers;

      (d) Inadequate incentives for the use of less costly and more appropriate alternative levels of health care;

      (e) Insufficient or inappropriate use of existing capacity, duplicated services and failure to use less costly alternatives in meeting significant health needs; and

      (f) Insufficient primary and emergency medical care services in medically underserved areas of the state.

      (3) As a result of rising health care costs and the concern expressed by health care providers, health care users, third-party payers and the general public, there is an urgent need to abate these rising costs so as to place the cost of health care within reach of all Oregonians without affecting the quality of care.

      (4) To foster the cooperation of the separate industry forces, there is a need to compile and disseminate accurate and current data, including but not limited to price and utilization data, to meet the needs of the people of Oregon and improve the appropriate usage of health care services.

      (5) It is the purpose of this chapter to establish area-wide and state planning for health services, staff and facilities in light of the findings of subsection (1) of this section and in furtherance of health planning policies of this state.

      (6) It is further declared that hospital costs should be contained through improved competition between hospitals and improved competition between insurers and through financial incentives on behalf of providers, insurers and consumers to contain costs. As a safety net, it is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to monitor hospital performance. [1977 c.751 §2; 1981 c.693 §2; 1983 c.482 §2; 1985 c.747 §1; 1987 c.660 §3]

      442.120 Ambulatory surgery and inpatient discharge abstract records; alternative data; rules; fees. In order to provide data essential for health planning programs:

      (1) The Oregon Health Authority may request, by July 1 of each year, each general hospital to file with the authority ambulatory surgery and inpatient discharge abstract records covering all patients discharged during the preceding calendar year. The ambulatory surgery and inpatient discharge abstract record for each patient must include the following information, and may include other information deemed necessary by the authority for developing or evaluating statewide health policy:

      (a) Date of birth;

      (b) Sex;

      (c) Race and ethnicity;

      (d) Primary language;

      (e) Disability;

      (f) Zip code;

      (g) Inpatient admission date or outpatient service date;

      (h) Inpatient discharge date;

      (i) Type of discharge;

      (j) Diagnostic related group or diagnosis;

      (k) Type of procedure performed;

      (L) Expected source of payment, if available;

      (m) Hospital identification number; and

      (n) Total hospital charges.

      (2) By July 1 of each year, the authority may request from ambulatory surgical centers licensed under ORS 441.015 ambulatory surgery discharge abstract records covering all patients admitted during the preceding year. Ambulatory surgery discharge abstract records must include information similar to that requested from general hospitals under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) In lieu of abstracting and compiling the records itself, the authority may solicit the voluntary submission of such data from Oregon hospitals or other sources to enable it to carry out its responsibilities under this section. If such data are not available to the authority on an annual and timely basis, the authority may establish by rule a fee to be charged to each hospital.

      (4) Subject to prior approval of the Oregon Health Policy Board and a report to the Emergency Board, if the Legislative Assembly is not in session, prior to adopting the fee, and within the budget authorized by the Legislative Assembly as the budget may be modified by the Emergency Board, the fee established under subsection (3) of this section may not exceed the cost of abstracting and compiling the records.

      (5) The authority may specify by rule the form in which the records are to be submitted. If the form adopted by rule requires conversion from the form regularly used by a hospital, reasonable costs of such conversion shall be paid by the authority.

      (6) Abstract records must include a patient identifier that allows for the statistical matching of records over time to permit public studies of issues related to clinical practices, health service utilization and health outcomes. Provision of such a patient identifier must not allow for identification of the individual patient.

      (7) In addition to the records required in subsection (1) of this section, the authority may obtain abstract records for each patient that identify specific services, classified by International Classification of Disease Code, for special studies on the incidence of specific health problems or diagnostic practices. However, nothing in this subsection shall authorize the publication of specific data in a form that allows identification of individual patients or licensed health care professionals.

      (8) The authority may provide by rule for the submission of records for enrollees in a health maintenance organization from a hospital associated with such an organization in a form the authority determines appropriate to the authority’s needs for such data and the organization’s record keeping and reporting systems for charges and services.

(Temporary provisions relating to certificates of need for long term care facilities)

 

      Note: Sections 14, 15 and 27, chapter 608, Oregon Laws 2013, provide:

      Sec. 14. Section 15 of this 2013 Act is added to and made a part of ORS chapter 442. [2013 c.608 §14]

      Sec. 15. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) A significant amount of public and private funds are expended each year for long term care services provided to Oregonians;

      (b) Oregon has established itself as the national leader in providing a choice of noninstitutional care to low income Oregonians in need of long term care services by developing an extensive system of home health care and community-based care; and

      (c) Long term care facilities continue to provide critical services to some of Oregon’s most frail and vulnerable residents with complex needs. Increasingly, long term care facilities are filling a need for transitional care between hospitals and home settings in a cost-effective manner, reducing the overall costs of long term care.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares its support for collaboration among state agencies that purchase health services and private health care providers in order to align financial incentives with the goals of achieving better patient care and improved health status while restraining growth in the per capita cost of health care.

      (3) It is the goal of the Legislative Assembly that the long term care facility bed capacity in Oregon be reduced by 1,500 beds by December 31, 2015, except for bed capacity in nursing facilities operated by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and facilities that either applied to the Oregon Health Authority for a certificate of need between August 1, 2011, and December 1, 2012, or submitted a letter of intent under ORS 442.315 (7) between January 15, 2013, and January 31, 2013.

      (4) In order to reduce the long term care facility bed capacity statewide, the Department of Human Services may permit an operator of a long term care facility to purchase another long term care facility’s entire bed capacity if:

      (a) The long term care facility bed capacity being purchased is not in an essential long term care facility; and

      (b) The long term care facility’s entire bed capacity is purchased and the seller agrees to surrender the long term care facility’s license on the earlier of the date that:

      (A) The last resident is transferred from the facility; or

      (B) Is 180 days after the date of purchase.

      (5) If a long term care facility’s entire bed capacity is purchased, the facility may not admit new residents to the facility except in accordance with criteria adopted by the Department of Human Services by rule.

      (6) Long term care bed capacity purchased under this section may not be transferred to another long term care facility.

      (7) The Department of Human Services may convene meetings with representatives of entities that include, but are not limited to, long term care providers, nonprofit trade associations and state and local governments to collaborate in strategies to reduce long term care facility bed capacity statewide. Participation shall be on a voluntary basis. Meetings shall be held at a time and place that is convenient for the participants.

      (8) The Department of Human Services may conduct surveys of entities and individuals specified in subsection (7) of this section concerning current long term care facility bed capacity and strategies for increasing future capacity.

      (9) Based on the findings in subsection (1) of this section and the declaration expressed in subsection (2) of this section, the Legislative Assembly declares its intent to exempt from state antitrust laws and provide immunity from federal antitrust laws through the state action doctrine individuals and entities that engage in transactions, meetings or surveys described in subsections (4), (7) and (8) of this section that might otherwise be constrained by such laws.

      (10) The Director of Human Services or the director’s designee shall engage in appropriate state supervision necessary to promote state action immunity under state and federal antitrust laws, and may inspect or request additional documentation to verify that the individuals and entities acting pursuant to subsection (4), (7) or (8) of this section are acting in accordance with the legislative intent expressed in this section.

      (11) The Director of Human Services or the director’s designee, in consultation with the Long Term Care Ombudsman, shall engage in regional planning necessary to promote the safety and dignity of residents living in a long term care facility that surrenders its license under this section. [2013 c.608 §15]

      Sec. 27. Section 15 of this 2013 Act is repealed June 30, 2020. [2013 c.608 §27]

      442.325 Certificate for health care facility of health maintenance organization; exempt activities; policy relating to health maintenance organizations. (1) A certificate of need shall be required for the development or establishment of a health care facility of any new health maintenance organization.

      (2) Any activity of a health maintenance organization which does not involve the direct delivery of health services, as distinguished from arrangements for indirect delivery of health services through contracts with providers, shall be exempt from certificate of need review.

      (3) Nothing in ORS 244.050, 431.250, 441.015 to 441.087, 442.015 to 442.420 and 442.450 applies to any decision of a health maintenance organization involving its organizational structure, its arrangements for financing health services, the terms of its contracts with enrolled beneficiaries or its scope of benefits.

      (4) With the exception of certificate of need requirements, when applicable, the licensing and regulation of health maintenance organizations shall be controlled by ORS 750.005 to 750.095 and statutes incorporated by reference therein.

      (5) It is the policy of ORS 244.050, 431.250, 441.015 to 441.087, 442.015 to 442.420 and 442.450 to encourage the growth of health maintenance organizations as an alternative delivery system and to provide the facilities for the provision of quality health care to the present and future members who may enroll within their defined service area.

(Cost Reporting by Health Care Facilities)

 

      442.400 “Health care facility” defined. As used in ORS 442.400 to 442.463, unless the context requires otherwise, “health care facility” or “facility” means such facility as defined by ORS 442.015, exclusive of a long term care facility, and includes all publicly and privately owned and operated health care facilities, but does not include facilities described in ORS 441.065. [Formerly 441.415; 1979 c.697 §8; 1981 c.693 §15]

 

      442.405 Legislative findings and policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that rising costs and charges of health care facilities are a matter of vital concern to the people of this state. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that it is the policy of this state:

      (1) To require health care facilities to file for public disclosure reports that will enable both private and public purchasers of services from such facilities to make informed decisions in purchasing such services; and

      (2) To encourage development of programs of research and innovation in the methods of delivery of institutional health care services of high quality with costs and charges reasonably related to the nature and quality of the services rendered. [Formerly 441.420; 1999 c.581 §3]

      442.420 Application for financial assistance; financial analysis and investigation authority; rules. (1) The Oregon Health Authority may apply for, receive and accept grants, gifts, payments and other funds and advances, appropriations, properties and services from the United States, the State of Oregon or any governmental body, agency or agencies or from any other public or private corporation or person, and enter into agreements with respect thereto, including the undertaking of studies, plans, demonstrations or projects.

      (2) The authority shall conduct or cause to have conducted such analyses and studies relating to costs of health care facilities as considered desirable, including but not limited to methods of reducing such costs, utilization review of services of health care facilities, peer review, quality control, financial status of any facility subject to ORS 442.400 to 442.463 and sources of public and private financing of financial requirements of such facilities.

      (3) The authority may also:

      (a) Hold public hearings, conduct investigations and require the filing of information relating to any matter affecting the costs of and charges for services in all health care facilities;

      (d) Adopt rules in accordance with ORS chapter 183 for carrying out the functions of the authority. [Formerly 441.435; 1981 c.693 §17; 1983 c.482 §15; 1985 c.747 §39; 1995 c.727 §26; 1997 c.683 §22; 1999 c.581 §4; 2015 c.318 §31]

 

      442.425 Financial reporting systems. (1) The Oregon Health Authority by rule may specify one or more uniform systems of financial reporting necessary to meet the requirements of ORS 442.400 to 442.463. Such systems shall include such cost allocation methods as may be prescribed and such records and reports of revenues, expenses, other income and other outlays, assets and liabilities, and units of service as may be prescribed. Each facility under the authority’s jurisdiction shall adopt such systems for its fiscal period starting on or after the effective date of such system and shall make the required reports on such forms as may be required by the authority. The authority may extend the period by which compliance is required upon timely application and for good cause. Filings of such records and reports shall be made at such times as may be reasonably required by the authority.

      (2) Existing systems of reporting used by health care facilities shall be given due consideration by the authority in carrying out the duty of specifying the systems of reporting required by ORS 442.400 to 442.463. The authority insofar as reasonably possible shall adopt reporting systems and requirements that will not unreasonably increase the administrative costs of the facility.

      (3) The authority may allow and provide for modifications in the reporting systems in order to correctly reflect differences in the scope or type of services and financial structure between the various categories, sizes or types of health care facilities and in a manner consistent with the purposes of ORS 442.400 to 442.463.

      (4) The authority may establish specific annual reporting provisions for facilities that receive a preponderance of their revenue from associated comprehensive group-practice prepayment health care service plans. Notwithstanding any other provisions of ORS 442.400 to 442.463, such facilities shall be authorized to utilize established accounting systems and to report costs and revenues in a manner consistent with the operating principles of such plans and with generally accepted accounting principles. When such facilities are operated as units of a coordinated group of health facilities under common ownership, the facilities shall be authorized to report as a group rather than as individual institutions, and as a group shall submit a consolidated balance sheet, income and expense statement and statement of source and application of funds for such group of health facilities. [Formerly 441.440; 1981 c.693 §18; 1995 c.727 §27; 1997 c.683 §23; 1999 c.581 §5; 2009 c.792 §40; 2015 c.318 §32]

 

      442.430 Investigations; confidentiality of data. (1) Whenever a further investigation is considered necessary or desirable by the Oregon Health Authority to verify the accuracy of the information in the reports made by health care facilities, the authority may make any necessary further examination of the facility’s records and accounts. Such further examinations include, but are not limited to, requiring a full or partial audit of all such records and accounts.

      (2) In carrying out the duties prescribed by ORS 442.400 to 442.463, the authority may utilize its own staff or may contract with any appropriate, independent, qualified third party. No such contractor shall release or publish or otherwise use any information made available to it under its contractual responsibility unless such permission is specifically granted by the authority. [Formerly 441.445; 1995 c.727 §28; 1997 c.683 §24; 2009 c.792 §41; 2015 c.318 §33]

MISCELLANEOUS

 

      442.600 Policy on maternity care. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Maternity care is the cornerstone of health care delivery in the state. It provides a proven, cost-effective foundation for improving the health of all Oregonians, and a healthy start in life allows our future citizens to achieve their full potential.

      (2) Although great strides have been made to improve maternity care, barriers continue to exist as indicated by high rates of inadequate prenatal care and lack of coordination between prenatal and delivery services.

      (3) Individual communities have unique combinations of barriers and resources. Therefore, planning and solutions must be developed at the local level whenever possible, with the state providing guidelines, standards and support.

      (4) Local resources are strained and communities need a structure and technical assistance to assure development of access to a coordinated system of maternity care.

      (5) There is a need for a system to assure coordination of all maternity service providers to develop a comprehensive service system for Oregon that addresses all barriers to guide the state’s action in this area.

      (6)(a) Therefore, it is the intent of this state that there shall be a comprehensive system of maternity care based on the plan that includes prenatal, delivery and postpartum care and that meets the unique needs of the individual pregnant woman, available to all pregnant women in this state.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “plan” means the Maternity Care Access Planning Commission’s comprehensive statewide plan for a maternity care system dated March 1993 and titled “Comprehensive Perinatal Health Services: A Strategy Toward Universal Access to Care in Oregon.” [1991 c.760 §1; 1993 c.514 §1]

 

      Note: 442.600 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 442 by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      442.625 Emergency Medical Services Enhancement Account; distribution of moneys in account. (1) The Emergency Medical Services Enhancement Account is established separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned on moneys in the account shall accrue to the account. All moneys deposited in the account are continuously appropriated to the Department of Revenue for the purposes of this section.

      (2) The Department of Revenue shall distribute moneys in the Emergency Medical Services Enhancement Account in the following manner:

      (a) 35 percent of the moneys in the account shall be transferred to the Office of Rural Health established under ORS 442.475 for the purpose of enhancing emergency medical services in rural areas as specified in ORS 442.507.

      (b) 25 percent of the moneys in the account shall be transferred to the Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Systems Program established under ORS 431A.085.

      (c) 35 percent of the moneys in the account shall be transferred to the Area Health Education Center program established under ORS 353.450.

      (d) 5 percent of the moneys in the account shall be transferred to the Oregon Poison Center referred to in ORS 431A.313. [1999 c.1056 §3]

      442.705 Legislative findings; goals. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that direct competition among health care providers in the field of heart and kidney transplant services may not result in the most cost efficient and least expensive transplant services for the citizens of this state and that it is in the public interest to allow cooperative programs among health care providers providing heart and kidney transplant services.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that, to the extent provided in ORS 442.700 to 442.760, it is the policy and intent of this state to displace competition among health care providers providing heart and kidney transplant services by allowing health care providers to enter into cooperative programs governing the provision of heart and kidney transplant services in order to achieve in each instance the following goals:

      (a) Reduction of, or protection against, rising costs of heart and kidney transplant services;

      (b) Reduction of, or protection against, rising prices for heart and kidney transplant services;

      (c) Improvement or maintenance of the quality of heart and kidney transplant services provided in this state;

      (d) Reduction of, or protection against, duplication of resources including, without limitation, expensive medical specialists, medical equipment and sites of service;

      (e) Improvement or maintenance of efficiency in the delivery of heart and kidney transplant services;

      (f) Improvement or maintenance of public access to heart and kidney transplant services;

      (g) Increase in donations of organs for transplantation; and

      (h) Improvement in the continuity of patient care.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly further declares that the goals identified in subsection (2) of this section represent the policies of this state.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly further declares that once a cooperative program is approved under ORS 442.700 to 442.760, there is an interest in insuring stability in the provision of health care services by a cooperative program, to the extent stability is consistent with achieving the goals identified in subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) The Director of the Oregon Health Authority shall actively supervise the cooperative program in accordance with authority under ORS 442.700 to 442.760 and 646.740. [1993 c.769 §1; 2009 c.595 §756]

 

      442.710 Application for approval of cooperative program; form; content; review; modification; order. (1) The Oregon Health and Science University and one or more entities, each of which operates at least three hospitals in a single urban area in this state, may apply to the Director of the Oregon Health Authority for approval of a cooperative program.

      (b) The director has reviewed and approved the specifics of the anticompetitive activity expected to be conducted by the cooperative program.

      (5) In evaluating the application, the director shall consider whether a cooperative program will contribute to or detract from achieving the goals listed in ORS 442.705 (2). The director may weigh goals relating to circumstances that are likely to occur without the cooperative program, and relating to existing circumstances. The director may also consider whether any alternative arrangements would be less restrictive of competition while achieving the same goals.

      (6) An order approving a cooperative program shall identify and define the limits of the permitted activities for purposes of granting antitrust immunity under ORS 442.700 to 442.760.

      (a) If the director determines that a particular decision or action is not in accordance with the order, or that the parties are engaging in anticompetitive activity not permitted by the order, the director may direct the board of governors to identify and implement corrective action to insure compliance with the order or may modify the order.

      (b) If the director determines that the cooperative program is engaging in unlawful activity not permitted by the order or is not complying with the directive given under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director may serve on the cooperative program a proposed order directing the cooperative program to:

      (A) Conform with the directive under paragraph (a) of this subsection; or

      (B) Cease and desist from engaging in the activity.

      (2) The cooperative program shall have up to 30 days to comply with a proposed order under subsection (1)(b) of this section unless the board of governors demonstrates additional time is needed for compliance.

      (3) If the director determines that the participants in the cooperative program are in substantial noncompliance with the cease and desist directive, the director may seek an appropriate injunction in the circuit courts of Marion or Multnomah Counties.

      (4) If the director determines that a sufficient number of the goals set forth in ORS 442.705 (2) are not being achieved or that the cooperative program is engaging in activity not permitted by the order, the director may suspend or terminate approval for all or part of the activities approved and permitted by the order.

      (5) A proposed order to be entered under subsection (1)(b) or (4) of this section may be served upon the cooperative program without prior notice. The cooperative program may contest the proposed order by filing a written request for a contested case hearing with the director not later than 20 days following the date of the proposed order.

      (a) A cooperative program for which approval has been granted under ORS 442.700 to 442.760 and 646.740 is a lawful program to the extent it engages in activities permitted by the order and supervised by the Director of the Oregon Health Authority and is in compliance with the order; and

      (3) Nothing in ORS 442.700 to 442.760 and 646.740 shall be construed to immunize any person from liability or impose liability where none would otherwise exist under federal or state antitrust laws for conduct in negotiating and entering into a cooperative program for which no application was filed with the director.

      (b) This section does not create a right to damages against a public body, as defined in ORS 30.260.

      (c) This section does not prevent a person from bringing a claim against a covered entity and seeking applicable relief from a covered entity for conduct described in this section under any other provision of law. [2017 c.396 §1]
