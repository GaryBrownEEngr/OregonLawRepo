      443.205 Definitions for ORS 443.215 and 443.225.

      443.215 Policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly recognizes the importance of providing a high quality of domiciliary care facilities throughout the State of Oregon.

      (2) It is the intent of ORS 443.205 to 443.225 to distribute domiciliary care facility capacity on the basis of population and the regional origin of institutionalized persons. [1977 c.779 §1; formerly 184.875]

      443.225 Location and capacity of domiciliary care facilities. (1) Except as otherwise provided by subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the capacity of all domiciliary care facilities must be located throughout the state based on the relationship of the population of the county in which the additional capacity is proposed to be located to the number of persons originating from the county who are determined to be in need of domiciliary care. However, nothing in this subsection is intended to prevent the placement of a person who is or was not a resident of the county in a domiciliary care facility in the county.

      (2) The Department of Human Services shall determine the number of persons originating from a county who are in need of domiciliary care if the domiciliary care facility is an adult foster home as defined in ORS 443.705, a residential care facility or residential training facility as those terms are defined in ORS 443.400 or other group care facility.

      (3) The Oregon Health Authority shall determine the number of persons originating from a county who are in need of domiciliary care if the domiciliary care facility is a residential treatment facility as defined in ORS 443.400.

      (4) When a county is too sparsely populated to produce a meaningful ratio of county population to population in need, or a county is lacking necessary support services, the population of two or more counties may be combined. The area of the combined counties may be considered a county for purposes of subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) The computation required by subsection (1) of this section does not require reduction in any domiciliary care facility capacity existing on October 4, 1977.

      (6) Subject to the appropriate licensing requirements, the governing body of a county may authorize a domiciliary care facility located in the county to exceed the capacity limit imposed by subsection (1) of this section upon:

      (a) Request of an individual or organization operating or proposing to operate a domiciliary care facility;

      (b) Consultation with an advisory committee appointed by the governing body and consisting of persons who are particularly interested in the type of domiciliary care facility contemplated; and

      (c) Finding of good cause following notice and public hearing. [1977 c.779 §2; 1979 c.235 §1; formerly 184.880; 2007 c.71 §132; 2009 c.595 §776]

      (7) This section does not modify any right of an adult receiving foster care. [2007 c.834 §2; 2009 c.595 §791e; 2009 c.869 §1; 2013 c.722 §32a]

After consultation with representatives of providers, educators, residents’ advocates and the Long Term Care Ombudsman or the Residential Facilities Ombudsman, the licensing agency shall adopt by rule standards governing the educational requirements. The rules shall require that a person may not provide care to any resident prior to acquiring education or supervised training designed to impart the basic knowledge and skills necessary to maintain the health, safety and welfare of the resident. Each provider shall document compliance with the educational requirements for persons subject to the requirements.

      (2) The rules required under subsection (1) of this section shall include but need not be limited to the following:

      (a) A requirement that, before being licensed, a provider successfully completes training that satisfies a defined curriculum, including demonstrations and practice in physical caregiving, screening for care and service needs, appropriate behavior toward residents with physical, cognitive and mental disabilities and issues related to architectural accessibility;

      (4) The licensing agency may permit a person who has not completed the training or passed the test required in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section to act as a resident manager until the training and testing are completed or for 60 days, whichever is shorter, if the licensing agency determines that an unexpected and urgent staffing need exists. The licensed provider must notify the licensing agency of the situation and demonstrate that the provider is unable to find a qualified resident manager, that the person has met the requirements for a substitute caregiver for the adult foster home and that the provider will provide adequate supervision.

      (5) Providers shall serve three nutritionally balanced meals to residents each day. A menu for the meals for the coming week shall be prepared and posted weekly.

The provider has an affirmative duty to take reasonable actions to mitigate the damages by accepting a new resident. However, if a resident dies or leaves an adult foster home due to neglect or abuse by the provider or due to conditions of imminent danger to life, health or safety, the provider may not charge the resident beyond the resident’s last day in the home. The provider shall refund any advance payments within 30 days after the resident dies or leaves the adult foster home.

      (9) Chemical and physical restraints may be used only after considering all other alternatives and only when required to treat a resident’s medical symptoms or to maximize a resident’s physical functioning. Restraints may not be used for discipline of a resident or for the convenience of the adult foster home. Restraints may be used only as follows:

      (a) Psychoactive medications may be used only pursuant to a prescription that specifies the circumstances, dosage and duration of use.

The rules adopted by the licensing agency relating to physical restraints shall include standards for use and training.

      (10) If the physical characteristics of the adult foster home do not encourage contact between caregivers and residents and among residents, the provider shall demonstrate how regular positive contact will occur. Providers may not place residents who are unable to walk without assistance in a basement, split-level, second story or other area that does not have an exit at ground level. Nonambulatory residents shall be given first floor rooms.

      (11)(a) The provider may not transfer or discharge a resident from an adult foster home unless the transfer or discharge is necessary for medical reasons, for the welfare of the resident or for the welfare of other residents, or due to nonpayment. In such cases, the provider shall give the resident written notice as soon as possible under the circumstances.

      (b) The provider shall give the resident and the resident’s legal representative, guardian or conservator written notice at least 30 days prior to the proposed transfer or discharge, except in a medical emergency including but not limited to a resident’s experiencing an increase in level of care needs or engaging in behavior that poses an imminent danger to self or others. In such cases, the provider shall give the resident written notice as soon as possible under the circumstances.

      (c) The resident has the right to an administrative hearing prior to an involuntary transfer or discharge. If the resident is being transferred or discharged for a medical emergency, or to protect the welfare of the resident or other residents, as defined by rule, the hearing must be held within seven days of the transfer or discharge. The provider shall hold a space available for the resident pending receipt of an administrative order. ORS 441.605 (4) and the rules thereunder governing transfer notices and hearings for residents of long term care facilities shall apply to adult foster homes.

      (12) The provider may not include any illegal or unenforceable provision in a contract with a resident and may not ask or require a resident to waive any of the resident’s rights.

      (13) Any lessor of a building in which an adult foster home is located may not interfere with the admission, discharge or transfer of any resident in the adult foster home unless the lessor is a provider or coprovider on the license.
