DOMICILIARY CARE FACILITIES

 

      443.205 Definitions for ORS 443.215 and 443.225. As used in ORS 443.215 and 443.225, “domiciliary care facilities” means facilities providing residential care to adults, including adult foster homes, group care facilities or residential treatment, training or care facilities, established, contracted for or operated by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority. [1977 c.779 §3; formerly 184.870; 1987 c.320 §234; 2001 c.900 §181; 2007 c.21 §4; 2009 c.595 §775]

      443.215 Policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly recognizes the importance of providing a high quality of domiciliary care facilities throughout the State of Oregon.

      (2) It is the intent of ORS 443.205 to 443.225 to distribute domiciliary care facility capacity on the basis of population and the regional origin of institutionalized persons. [1977 c.779 §1; formerly 184.875]

      443.220 [1953 c.659 §2; 1971 c.650 §21; 1973 c.285 §9; repealed by 1977 c.717 §23]

 

      443.225 Location and capacity of domiciliary care facilities. (1) Except as otherwise provided by subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the capacity of all domiciliary care facilities must be located throughout the state based on the relationship of the population of the county in which the additional capacity is proposed to be located to the number of persons originating from the county who are determined to be in need of domiciliary care. However, nothing in this subsection is intended to prevent the placement of a person who is or was not a resident of the county in a domiciliary care facility in the county.

      (2) The Department of Human Services shall determine the number of persons originating from a county who are in need of domiciliary care if the domiciliary care facility is an adult foster home as defined in ORS 443.705, a residential care facility or residential training facility as those terms are defined in ORS 443.400 or other group care facility.

      (3) The Oregon Health Authority shall determine the number of persons originating from a county who are in need of domiciliary care if the domiciliary care facility is a residential treatment facility as defined in ORS 443.400.

      (4) When a county is too sparsely populated to produce a meaningful ratio of county population to population in need, or a county is lacking necessary support services, the population of two or more counties may be combined. The area of the combined counties may be considered a county for purposes of subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) The computation required by subsection (1) of this section does not require reduction in any domiciliary care facility capacity existing on October 4, 1977.

      (6) Subject to the appropriate licensing requirements, the governing body of a county may authorize a domiciliary care facility located in the county to exceed the capacity limit imposed by subsection (1) of this section upon:

      (a) Request of an individual or organization operating or proposing to operate a domiciliary care facility;

      (b) Consultation with an advisory committee appointed by the governing body and consisting of persons who are particularly interested in the type of domiciliary care facility contemplated; and

      (c) Finding of good cause following notice and public hearing. [1977 c.779 §2; 1979 c.235 §1; formerly 184.880; 2007 c.71 §132; 2009 c.595 §776]

      443.733 Collective bargaining. (1) As used in this section, “adult foster care home provider” means a person who operates an adult foster home in the provider’s home and who receives fees or payments from state funds for providing adult foster care home services. “Adult foster care home provider” does not include a person:

      (a) Who is a resident manager of an adult foster home who does not provide adult foster care home services in the resident manager’s own home or who does not have a controlling interest in, or is not an officer or partner in, the entity that is the provider of adult foster care home services;

      (b) Who is not a natural person; or

      (c) Whose participation in collective bargaining is determined by the licensing agency to be inconsistent with this section or in violation of state or federal law.

      (2) For purposes of collective bargaining under ORS 243.650 to 243.782, the State of Oregon is the public employer of record of adult foster care home providers.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 243.650 (19), adult foster care home providers are considered to be public employees governed by ORS 243.650 to 243.782. Adult foster care home providers have the right to form, join and participate in the activities of labor organizations of their own choosing for the purposes of representation and collective bargaining on matters concerning labor relations. Mandatory subjects of collective bargaining include but are not limited to provider base rates and add-on payments. These rights shall be exercised in accordance with the rights granted to public employees, with mediation and interest arbitration under ORS 243.742 as the method of concluding the collective bargaining process. Adult foster care home providers may not strike.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, adult foster care home providers are not for any other purpose employees of the State of Oregon or any other public body.

      (5) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall represent the State of Oregon in collective bargaining negotiations with the certified or recognized exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit of adult foster care home providers. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services is authorized to agree to terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements on behalf of the State of Oregon.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 243.650 (1), an appropriate bargaining unit for adult foster care home providers is any bargaining unit recognized by the Governor in an executive order issued prior to January 1, 2008.

      (7) This section does not modify any right of an adult receiving foster care. [2007 c.834 §2; 2009 c.595 §791e; 2009 c.869 §1; 2013 c.722 §32a]

      (e) The applicant has demonstrated to the licensing agency the financial ability and resources necessary to operate the adult foster home. The licensing agency shall adopt rules as the agency deems appropriate that establish the financial standards an applicant must meet to qualify for issuance of a license and that protect financial information from public disclosure. The demonstration of financial ability under this paragraph shall include, but need not be limited to, providing the licensing agency with a list of any unsatisfied judgments, pending litigation and unpaid taxes and notifying the agency regarding whether the applicant is in bankruptcy. If the applicant is unable to demonstrate the financial ability and resources required by this paragraph, the licensing agency may require the applicant to furnish a financial guarantee as a condition of initial licensure.

      (4) The licensing agency may not renew a license under this section unless:

      (b) In proceedings for renewal of a license when an adult foster home has been licensed for at least 24 continuous months, the burden of proof shall be upon the licensing agency to establish noncompliance with ORS 443.705 to 443.825 and the rules of the agency.

      (6)(a) Persons who have been convicted of one or more crimes that, as determined by rules of the licensing agency, are substantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of a provider, substitute caregiver or other household member of an adult foster home shall be prohibited from operating, working in or residing in an adult foster home.

      (b) The licensing agency shall adopt rules that distinguish the criminal convictions and types of abuse that permanently prohibit a person from operating, working in or living in an adult foster home from the convictions and types of abuse that do not permanently prohibit the person from operating, working in or living in an adult foster home.

      (c) A provider may not hire, retain in employment or allow to live in an adult foster home, other than as a resident, any person who the provider knows has been convicted of a disqualifying crime or has been found responsible for a disqualifying type of abuse.

      (7) A license under ORS 443.725 is effective for one year from the date of issue unless sooner revoked. Each license shall state the name of the resident manager of the adult foster home, the names of all providers who own the adult foster home, the address of the premises to which the license applies, the maximum number of residents and the classification of the adult foster home. If, during the period covered by the license, a resident manager changes, the provider must within 15 days request modification of the license. The request must be accompanied by a fee of $10.

      (8) No license under ORS 443.725 is transferable or applicable to any location, persons operating the adult foster home or the person owning the adult foster home other than that indicated on the application for licensing.

      (9) The licensing agency shall not issue a license to operate an additional adult foster home to a provider unless the provider has demonstrated the qualifications and capacity to operate the provider’s existing licensed adult foster homes and has demonstrated the ability to provide to the residents of those adult foster homes care that is adequate and substantially free from abuse and neglect.

      (10)(a) All moneys collected under ORS 443.725 to 443.780 from adult foster homes that are licensed to serve persons with mental, emotional or behavioral disturbances or alcohol or drug dependence shall be deposited in a special account in the General Fund, and are appropriated continuously for payment of expenses incurred by the Oregon Health Authority.

      (b) All moneys collected under ORS 443.725 to 443.780 from adult foster homes licensed to serve persons who are elderly, have physical disabilities or have developmental disabilities shall be deposited in the Quality Care Fund established in ORS 443.001.

      (11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or ORS 443.725 or 443.738, the licensing agency may issue a 60-day provisional license to a qualified person if the agency determines that an emergency situation exists after being notified that the licensed provider of an adult foster home is no longer overseeing operation of the adult foster home. [1983 c.629 §4; 1985 c.663 §4; 1991 c.960 §5; 1995 c.180 §2; 1995 c.667 §10; 1999 c.205 §1; 2001 c.900 §189; 2005 c.730 §24; 2009 c.418 §4; 2009 c.595 §791f; 2009 c.828 §§20,89a; 2017 c.707 §6]

 

      443.738 Educational standards for providers, managers and caregivers; rules; exception; duties of providers. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, all providers, resident managers and substitute caregivers for adult foster homes shall satisfactorily meet all educational requirements established by the licensing agency. After consultation with representatives of providers, educators, residents’ advocates and the Long Term Care Ombudsman or the Residential Facilities Ombudsman, the licensing agency shall adopt by rule standards governing the educational requirements. The rules shall require that a person may not provide care to any resident prior to acquiring education or supervised training designed to impart the basic knowledge and skills necessary to maintain the health, safety and welfare of the resident. Each provider shall document compliance with the educational requirements for persons subject to the requirements.

      (2) The rules required under subsection (1) of this section shall include but need not be limited to the following:

      (a) A requirement that, before being licensed, a provider successfully completes training that satisfies a defined curriculum, including demonstrations and practice in physical caregiving, screening for care and service needs, appropriate behavior toward residents with physical, cognitive and mental disabilities and issues related to architectural accessibility;

      (b) A requirement that a provider pass a test before being licensed or becoming a resident manager. The test shall evaluate the ability to understand and respond appropriately to emergency situations, changes in medical conditions, physicians’ orders and professional instructions, nutritional needs, residents’ preferences and conflicts; and

      (c) A requirement that, after being licensed, a provider or resident manager successfully completes continuing education as described in ORS 443.742.

      (3) After consultation with representatives of providers, educators, residents’ advocates and the Long Term Care Ombudsman or the Residential Facilities Ombudsman, the licensing agency may adopt by rule exceptions to the training requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section for persons who are appropriately licensed medical care professionals in Oregon or who possess sufficient education, training or experience to warrant an exception. The licensing agency may not make any exceptions to the testing requirements.

      (4) The licensing agency may permit a person who has not completed the training or passed the test required in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section to act as a resident manager until the training and testing are completed or for 60 days, whichever is shorter, if the licensing agency determines that an unexpected and urgent staffing need exists. The licensed provider must notify the licensing agency of the situation and demonstrate that the provider is unable to find a qualified resident manager, that the person has met the requirements for a substitute caregiver for the adult foster home and that the provider will provide adequate supervision.

      (5) Providers shall serve three nutritionally balanced meals to residents each day. A menu for the meals for the coming week shall be prepared and posted weekly.

      (6) Providers shall make available at least six hours of activities each week which are of interest to the residents, not including television or movies. The licensing agency shall make information about resources for activities available to providers upon request. Providers or substitute caregivers shall be directly involved with residents on a daily basis.

      (7) Providers shall give at least 30 days’ written notice to the residents, and to the legal representative, guardian or conservator of any resident, before selling, leasing or transferring the adult foster home business or the real property on which the adult foster home is located. Providers shall inform real estate licensees, prospective buyers, lessees and transferees in all written communications that the license to operate an adult foster home is not transferable and shall refer them to the licensing agency for information about licensing.

      (8) If a resident dies or leaves an adult foster home for medical reasons and indicates in writing the intent to not return, the provider may not charge the resident for more than 15 days or the time specified in the provider contract, whichever is less, after the resident has left the adult foster home. The provider has an affirmative duty to take reasonable actions to mitigate the damages by accepting a new resident. However, if a resident dies or leaves an adult foster home due to neglect or abuse by the provider or due to conditions of imminent danger to life, health or safety, the provider may not charge the resident beyond the resident’s last day in the home. The provider shall refund any advance payments within 30 days after the resident dies or leaves the adult foster home.

      (9) Chemical and physical restraints may be used only after considering all other alternatives and only when required to treat a resident’s medical symptoms or to maximize a resident’s physical functioning. Restraints may not be used for discipline of a resident or for the convenience of the adult foster home. Restraints may be used only as follows:

      (a) Psychoactive medications may be used only pursuant to a prescription that specifies the circumstances, dosage and duration of use.

      (b) Physical restraints may be used only pursuant to a qualified practitioner’s order that specifies the type, circumstances and duration of use in accordance with rules adopted by the licensing agency. The rules adopted by the licensing agency relating to physical restraints shall include standards for use and training.

      (10) If the physical characteristics of the adult foster home do not encourage contact between caregivers and residents and among residents, the provider shall demonstrate how regular positive contact will occur. Providers may not place residents who are unable to walk without assistance in a basement, split-level, second story or other area that does not have an exit at ground level. Nonambulatory residents shall be given first floor rooms.

      (11)(a) The provider may not transfer or discharge a resident from an adult foster home unless the transfer or discharge is necessary for medical reasons, for the welfare of the resident or for the welfare of other residents, or due to nonpayment. In such cases, the provider shall give the resident written notice as soon as possible under the circumstances.

      (b) The provider shall give the resident and the resident’s legal representative, guardian or conservator written notice at least 30 days prior to the proposed transfer or discharge, except in a medical emergency including but not limited to a resident’s experiencing an increase in level of care needs or engaging in behavior that poses an imminent danger to self or others. In such cases, the provider shall give the resident written notice as soon as possible under the circumstances.

      (c) The resident has the right to an administrative hearing prior to an involuntary transfer or discharge. If the resident is being transferred or discharged for a medical emergency, or to protect the welfare of the resident or other residents, as defined by rule, the hearing must be held within seven days of the transfer or discharge. The provider shall hold a space available for the resident pending receipt of an administrative order. ORS 441.605 (4) and the rules thereunder governing transfer notices and hearings for residents of long term care facilities shall apply to adult foster homes.

      (12) The provider may not include any illegal or unenforceable provision in a contract with a resident and may not ask or require a resident to waive any of the resident’s rights.

      (13) Any lessor of a building in which an adult foster home is located may not interfere with the admission, discharge or transfer of any resident in the adult foster home unless the lessor is a provider or coprovider on the license.
