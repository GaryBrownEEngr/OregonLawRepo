      445.040 [Repealed by 1961 c.672 §2]

      445.070 Additional benefits permitted within limits. If it is made to appear to the Oregon Health Authority that the limitations of ORS 445.060 are not sufficient to provide necessary and adequate care of an indigent patient and that the condition of the indigent patient warrants such action, the authority, in its sole discretion, the exercise of which shall be conclusive and not in any wise subject to review, may authorize the supplying of additional care to the indigent patient of the same type as the types of initial care authorized by this chapter and may pay for the same from the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund. No claim for additional care shall be enforceable under this chapter unless the authority first approves and authorizes in writing the supplying of such additional care. No single authorization shall be for more than:

      (1) For additional care supplied by a hospital or hospitals, $500.

      (2) For additional care supplied by a doctor or doctors, $300.

      (3) For additional care supplied by a nurse or nurses, $200.

      445.080 [Amended by 1983 c.45 §1; repealed by 1985 c.279 §14]

 

      445.090 Filing of claims; time for filing. (1) At the time of filing a claim under this chapter, the claimant shall submit to the Oregon Health Authority such information and data as the authority may reasonably require.

      (2) A claim filed under this chapter must be filed with the authority within one year after the termination of the care supplied by the claimant. However, in computing the time there shall not be included that period beginning when any claim under ORS chapter 656 arising out of the same motor vehicle accident is filed by the indigent patient with the authority, and ending when that claim has been finally decided. [Amended by 1953 c.399 §3; 1959 c.676 §1; 1965 c.376 §3; 1969 c.260 §4; 1983 c.45 §2; 2009 c.595 §805]

 

      445.100 [Repealed by 1965 c.376 §6]

 

      445.110 Hospital claims; form and contents. Each claim shall be made in writing in the form prescribed by the Oregon Health Authority, and shall show, and be accompanied by, the following matters and things:

      (1) The name and last-known post-office address of the person to whom care has been given.

      (2) The number of days’ care, with the dates of admission to the hospital and of discharge therefrom or other termination of care.

      (3) The amount of the claim.

      (4) A statement in writing showing the effort made by the hospital to collect the amount of the claim, the facts indicating the indigency of the patient, and the amount, if any, of money received from the patient or others in payment of the account of the patient.

      (5) If reasonably obtainable, the affidavit of the indigent patient or of the person or agency, if any, responsible for the patient, and, if reasonably obtainable, the statement in writing of a public or private agency engaged in the relief of the poor, verifying the indigency of the patient. If the affidavit or statement does not accompany the claim, and it is alleged in the claim that such absence is owing to the fact that the affidavit or statement is not reasonably obtainable, the claim shall set forth the facts upon which such assertion is based.

      (6) Any other information and data the authority may reasonably require. [Amended by 1965 c.376 §4; 1983 c.45 §3; 1985 c.279 §7; 2009 c.595 §806]

 

      445.120 Filing of claims generally; combining claims. (1) The claim of a claimant other than a hospital shall be in form and substance like that provided in ORS 445.110 in so far as applicable and be accompanied by the same supporting documents. However, only one set of supporting documents need be filed in respect of any one indigent patient in regard to any one motor vehicle injury.

      (2) An account for the services of an orthodontist for orthodontia performed by the orthodontist on the order of the doctor in charge of the case or an account for care supplied by a nurse, pharmacy, ambulance operator, supplier of prosthetic appliances and services or services of a licensed physical therapist may be, with the consent of the doctor, assigned to, and included as a part in and of the claim of, a hospital or doctor. [Amended by 1969 c.260 §5; 1973 c.141 §4]

 

      445.130 Effect of liability of third person or commencement of legal action on settlement of claim. For the purposes of claims under ORS 445.110 and 445.120, an indigent patient who is not otherwise able to pay the charges for care supplied shall not be deemed to be able to pay them because a third person might be held liable in an action to recover damages on account of the motor vehicle injury, if an action has not been commenced. If an action has been commenced, the claim shall show that fact. In that event the Oregon Health Authority may suspend the determination of the claim until the action has been terminated and from time to time require the claimant to supply such further information and data in respect of the action as the authority may deem necessary in order to determine the ultimate ability of the patient to pay the charges for which the claim is filed. [Amended by 1985 c.279 §8; 2009 c.595 §807]

 

      445.140 Audit and determination of validity of claims. The Oregon Health Authority shall examine and audit each claim filed with it under this chapter. From the information and data contained in the claim, the reports of the claimant, the documents so accompanying and supporting the claim and such other evidence as it may reasonably require or itself adduce, the authority shall find and determine:

      (1) Whether or not the claim has been filed within the time limited in ORS 445.090.

      (2) Whether or not the claim is predicated upon care supplied to a person suffering from a motor vehicle injury.

      (3) Whether or not the injured person is unable to pay the charges for which the claim is filed, within the meaning of ORS 445.020.

      (4) Whether or not the claimant has made reasonable and timely effort to effect collection of its claim. [Amended by 1969 c.260 §6; 1985 c.279 §9; 2009 c.595 §808]

 

      445.150 Order allowing or rejecting claim; notice. (1) If, in the matter of the claim, the Oregon Health Authority finds and determines in the affirmative in respect of items listed in ORS 445.140, the authority shall, by its order made and filed in the matter, allow the claim in such amount, not exceeding the limitations in ORS 445.060 and 445.070, less such amount as has been paid on the account.

      (2) If in its judgment the maintenance of the solvency of the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund so requires, the authority may make payment in monthly installments of any claim which has been allowed by it, or finally adjudged affirmatively by a court on appeal.

      (3) If the authority finds and determines in the negative in respect of any item listed in ORS 445.140, the authority shall, by its order made and filed therein, reject the claim.

      (4) The authority promptly shall serve the claimant with a copy of its order, addressed to the claimant at the claimant’s last-known post-office address as shown by the records and files of the authority. [Amended by 1983 c.45 §5; 1983 c.740 §116; 1985 c.279 §10; 2009 c.595 §809]

 

      445.155 Judicial review. Judicial review of regulations under ORS 445.050 and orders under ORS 445.150 shall be in accordance with ORS chapter 183, provided that the amount involved in the appeal from the order exceeds $100, and provided further that the amount involved in the appeal from the decision of the court exceeds $500. [1971 c.734 §62]

 

      445.160 [Repealed by 1971 c.734 §21]

 

      445.170 [Repealed by 1985 c.279 §14]

 

      445.180 Reassignment of rights to claimant on notice of finding person liable for care. (1) If it comes to the knowledge of a claimant who has received payment of a claim under this chapter that the patient in respect of whom the claim has been paid, or any other person chargeable by law with the care or support of the patient, has been paid, or is able to pay, the amount of the claim, the claimant shall diligently pursue such payment.

      (2) A claimant who has received payment of a claim from the Oregon Health Authority under this chapter shall inform the authority promptly and in writing if:

      (a) The claimant receives any payment from or on behalf of the patient in respect of whom the claim has been paid or from any person chargeable by law with the care or support of the patient;

      (b) The claimant knows or has reason to believe that the patient or any person chargeable by law with the care or support of the patient is able to pay the amount of the claim or any part thereof; or

      (c) The claimant or any person on behalf of the claimant institutes an action against the patient or any person chargeable by law with the care or support of the patient to recover all or part of the amount of the claim.

      (3) All moneys paid to or for the use or benefit of the claimant by or on behalf of the patient shall, after deduction of the reasonable cost of recovering them, be paid to the authority for deposit in the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund. [Amended by 1985 c.279 §11; 2009 c.595 §810]

 

      445.185 When deduction may be made from payments on claim. When a claimant fails to pursue payment as required by ORS 445.180 or to pay to the Oregon Health Authority the amount required by ORS 445.180 to be paid, the authority shall, after 60 days, deduct the amount paid by it on the claim from any subsequent payment made to the claimant unless it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the authority that:

      (1) Upon due and diligent search and inquiry neither the patient nor any person chargeable by law with the care or support of the patient can be found;

      (2) An action against the patient or a person chargeable by law with the care or support of the patient has been instituted and is pending; or

      (3) An action has been prosecuted to final judgment, all legal remedies for satisfaction of the judgment have been exhausted and the judgment has not been collected. [1985 c.279 §13; 2009 c.595 §811]
