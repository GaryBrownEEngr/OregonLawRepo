     (2) If the manufactured structure is sold by or otherwise acquired through a person other than a manufactured structure dealer, the information described in ORS 446.566 (3) to (7) shall be provided to the department:

     (a) By the seller if title is being transferred by a sale;

     (b) By the person to whom the ownership interest is being transferred if title is being transferred by operation of law; or

     (c) By the owner if the owner will have a recorded ownership interest in the manufactured structure after issuance of the ownership document. [2007 c.502 §3]

Upon receipt of an application in appropriate form as described in ORS 446.736 (2), the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall issue an ownership document for a manufactured structure. Except as provided in ORS 308.875, a manufactured structure for which an ownership document is issued is subject to assessment and taxation as personal property under the ad valorem tax laws of this state.

     (b)(A) For a new manufactured structure, except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the application must be filed on behalf of the owner by the manufactured structure dealer as provided in ORS 446.736, by a lender or by an escrow agent as provided in ORS 446.591.

     (B) For a used manufactured structure, except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the owner must file the application with the county assessor for the county in which the manufactured structure is sited.

     (C) If a dealer, lender or escrow agent refuses to file an application as required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, or if a county assessor refuses to accept an application in appropriate form as required by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the owner may file an application for an ownership document directly with the department.

     (2) The department shall maintain ownership records on manufactured structures for which the department has issued ownership documents. The department shall maintain a record of ownership documents or other documents evidencing ownership that have been canceled.

     (3) The department shall note all security interests in the manufactured structure on the ownership document and in the records maintained by the department pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The recording of the security interests in the records maintained by the department is constructive notice of the interests.

     (4) The department shall send the ownership document to the holder of the earliest perfected unreleased security interest in the manufactured structure or, if none, to the owner of the structure. The department shall also send a copy of the ownership document to the county assessor for the county in which the manufactured structure is being sited.

     (5) If an interest in a manufactured structure other than an ownership interest is satisfied or assigned, the holder of the interest shall notify the department. If the holder of the satisfied interest is in possession of the ownership document for the structure, the holder shall return the ownership document to the department. The department shall adjust the ownership document and send the adjusted ownership document and copy as described in subsection (4) of this section. [2003 c.655 §11]

     446.601 Treatment of application provided by escrow agent. (1) The Department of Consumer and Business Services shall treat an application described in ORS 446.591 (5):

     (a) As an application for issuance of a replacement or original ownership document that reflects the sale of the manufactured structure or the creation or transfer of the security interest, or as an application to make other changes to an ownership document consistent with the transaction;

     (b) As satisfactory proof that any previously issued ownership document for the manufactured structure is not available; and

     (c) As a release of any perfected security interest in the manufactured structure by the holder or other person responsible for providing the application information, ownership document or other document evidencing ownership, or a release thereon.

     (2) Upon receipt of an application described in ORS 446.591 (5) and the payment of appropriate fees, the department may issue a replacement or original ownership document for the manufactured structure, add or delete a security interest or make any other changes consistent with the transaction. The department shall send the ownership document to the holder of the earliest perfected unreleased security interest in the manufactured structure or, if none, to the owner. The department shall also send a copy of the ownership document to the county assessor for the county in which the manufactured structure is sited or being sited. [2003 c.655 §16]

 

     Note: See note under 446.561.

 

     446.606 Prohibition on providing application; escrow agent fees; action for damages.

     446.610 [1959 c.314 §§11,12,13,14; 1971 c.734 §64; repealed by 1973 c.833 §48]

 

     446.611 Perfection of security interest in manufactured structure having ownership document. (1)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the exclusive means for perfecting a security interest in a manufactured structure that has an ownership document is by application for and notation of the security interest in the manufactured structure ownership document records of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The application to have a security interest noted may be included as part of the application for issuance of an original ownership document. The department shall record the date of receipt of an application to have a security interest noted on the ownership document. The security interest is perfected as provided in ORS 79.0311 upon the department’s entering the security interest in the records maintained by the department under ORS 446.571. The department shall note the interest on a new or updated ownership document and send the document as provided in ORS 446.571. A security interest perfected under this section continues in effect until released by the holder of the interest.

     (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply if the debtor who granted the security interest is in the business of selling manufactured structures and the structure constitutes inventory held for sale or lease. The filing provisions of ORS 79.0501 to 79.0528 apply to security interests in manufactured structures described in this paragraph.

     (2) The department shall issue or update an ownership document to reflect a security interest described in subsection (1)(a) of this section and note the interest in the manufactured structure ownership document records maintained by the department. The department shall deliver the ownership document to the holder of the earliest perfected unreleased security interest in the manufactured structure or, if none, to the owner of the structure. The department shall also send a copy of the ownership document to the county assessor for the county in which the manufactured structure is being sited.

     (3) If the department cancels an ownership document because the manufactured structure is recorded in the deed records of a county, the department shall notify the county assessor of any unreleased security interest recorded in the department’s record for the manufactured structure. The county assessor shall record the security interest information for the structure in the deed records.

     (4) If a manufactured structure is recorded in the deed records of a county prior to the recording of a security interest, the recording of a security interest in the county deed records satisfies the requirement in ORS 72A.3095 that the security interest be recorded as a mortgage on real estate and is effective as a financing statement perfecting the security interest in the structure as provided in ORS 79.0502 (3).

     (5) If a manufactured structure ceases to be exempt from the ownership document requirement, upon recording the termination of the exemption in the deed records, the county assessor shall notify the department of any unreleased interest shown on the deed record for the manufactured structure. The department shall note the security interest information on the ownership document issued by the department. [2003 c.655 §18]

 

     Note: See note under 446.561.

 

     446.615 [1971 c.588 §15; repealed by 1973 c.833 §48]

 

     446.616 Transfer of interest in manufactured structure. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) or (3) of this section, upon the transfer of any interest in a manufactured structure shown on an ownership document, each person whose interest is released, terminated, assigned or transferred shall acknowledge the release, termination, assignment or transfer of that interest in a manner specified by the Department of Consumer and Business Services by rule. The department shall design the rules adopted for purposes of this subsection to protect the interests of all parties to the transfer of interest.

     (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section:

     (a) In the case of a transfer of an interest by operation of law, the personal representative, receiver, trustee, sheriff, landlord or other representative or successor in interest of the person whose interest is transferred shall file the acknowledgment described in subsection (1) of this section. The representative or successor shall also provide the transferee with information satisfactory to the department concerning all facts entitling the representative or successor to transfer the interest. If there is no person to transfer the interest, the person to whom interest is awarded or otherwise transferred is responsible for providing the information concerning the person’s entitlement to the interest.

     (b) In the case of a transfer at death of the interest of the owner or security interest holder of the manufactured structure, if the estate is not being probated and ownership is not being transferred under the provisions of ORS 114.545, an interest in the manufactured structure may be assigned through the use of an affidavit. The affidavit must be on a form prescribed by the department and signed by all of the known heirs of the person whose interest is being transferred, and shall state the name of the person to whom the ownership interest has been passed. If any heir has not arrived at the age of majority or is otherwise incapacitated, the parent or guardian of the heir shall sign the affidavit.

     (c) In the case of a transfer at death of the interest of the owner or security interest holder where transfer occurs under ORS 114.545, the affiant, as defined in ORS 114.505, is the person required to assign interest.

     (d) A security interest holder, without the consent of the owner, may assign interest of the holder in a manufactured structure to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity or priority of the interest. A person who is not given notice of the assignment is protected in dealing with the security interest holder as the holder of the interest until the assignee files notice of the interest with the department as provided in ORS 446.571. This paragraph does not exempt an assignment of interest from the acknowledgment requirement under subsection (1) of this section.

     (e) If an interest in a manufactured structure is transferred pursuant to an application under ORS 446.591 (5), the recital by the escrow company that no written objections were received constitutes both a release, termination, assignment or transfer of interest and an acknowledgment by the person whose interest is released, terminated, assigned or transferred.

     (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a transfer of a security interest where the security interest holder is a financial institution, a financial holding company or a bank holding company, as those terms are defined in ORS 706.008, a licensee under ORS chapter 725, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any of the foregoing and the transfer of the interest of the security interest holder:

     (a) Results from the merger, conversion, reorganization, consolidation or acquisition of the security interest holder; or

     (b) Is to an entity that is a member of the same affiliated group as the security holder. [2003 c.655 §19]

 

     Note: See note under 446.561.

 

     446.620 [1959 c.314 §15; 1963 c.170 §1; 1971 c.588 §5b; repealed by 1973 c.833 §48]

 

     446.621 Effect of certificate of title or other documentation of ownership. (1) A certificate of title for a manufactured structure issued by the Department of Transportation prior to May 1, 2005, is effective as a document evidencing ownership of the manufactured structure. If the manufactured structure does not have a title pursuant to ORS 308.855 or 308.860 (1969 Replacement Part), a tax record showing that a person has paid the ad valorem tax assessment on the structure since 1972 is a document evidencing the person’s ownership of the structure.

     (2) The owner of a manufactured structure described in subsection (1) of this section is not required to obtain an ownership document for the structure unless the structure is moved or sold. Except as provided in subsections (3) and (5) of this section, upon the moving or sale of a manufactured structure described in subsection (1) of this section, the owner shall submit the document evidencing ownership of the structure to the Department of Consumer and Business Services as provided in ORS 446.631 and 446.641. Upon receipt of the document, the department shall enter the information regarding the manufactured structure in the department’s records and issue an ownership document for the structure.

     (3) If the owner of a manufactured structure has misplaced a certificate of title, the Department of Consumer and Business Services may require the person to provide proof sufficient to satisfy the department concerning any questions about the ownership of the manufactured structure or security interests in the structure. The proof required by the department may include, but is not limited to, completion of an affidavit that:

     (a) Is in a form required by the department by rule;

     (b) Contains any information the department requires by rule as necessary to establish ownership of the manufactured structure or to determine any security interests in the structure; and

     (c) Is verified by the person making the affidavit.

     (4) The Department of Consumer and Business Services is not liable to any person for issuing an ownership document based on proof provided under subsection (3) of this section.

     (5) The movement or sale of a manufactured structure described in subsection (1) of this section does not require the owner to obtain an ownership document if:

     (a) The move or sale will qualify the manufactured structure for recording in the deed records of a county under ORS 446.626; and

     (b) The person who will own the structure after the move or sale files an affidavit with the Department of Consumer and Business Services prior to the move or sale stating that the person will apply within 25 business days after completion of the move or sale to have the manufactured structure recorded in the county deed records.

     (6) ORS 803.220 does not apply to a certificate of title for a manufactured structure issued by the Department of Transportation.

     (7) If the Department of Consumer and Business Services issues an ownership document for a manufactured structure that was previously issued a certificate of title by the Department of Transportation, the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall record in the department’s records and note on the ownership document any unreleased secured interest that was noted on the certificate of title. A secured interest described in this subsection retains the original perfection date of the interest, but provides the same creditor rights and remedies available for a secured interest in personal property perfected under ORS 446.611 (1). [2003 c.655 §§20,146(2)]

 

     Note: See note under 446.561.

 

     446.626 Recording manufactured structures in county deed records; effect on security interest; recording as establishment of real property interest. (1) The owner of a manufactured structure that qualifies under this subsection may apply to the county assessor to have the structure recorded in the deed records of the county. The application must be on a form approved by the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The application must include a description of the location of the real property on which the manufactured structure is or will be sited. If the structure is being sold by a manufactured structure dealer, the dealer may file the application on behalf of the owner within the time described in ORS 446.736 (7). A manufactured structure qualifies for recording in the deed records if the owner of the structure:

     (a) Also owns the land on which the manufactured structure is located;

     (b) Is the holder of a recorded leasehold estate of 20 years or more if the lease specifically permits the manufactured structure owner to record the structure under this section; or

     (c) Is a member of a manufactured dwelling park nonprofit cooperative formed under ORS 62.800 to 62.815 that owns the land on which the manufactured structure is located.

     (2) If the assessor, as agent for the department, determines that the manufactured structure qualifies for recording in the deed records of the county, the assessor shall cause the structure to be recorded in the deed records. The deed records must contain any unreleased security interest in the manufactured structure. If the department has issued an ownership document for the manufactured structure, the owner must submit the ownership document to the assessor with the application described in subsection (1) of this section. Upon recording the manufactured structure in the deed records, the assessor shall send the ownership document to the department for cancellation. The department shall cancel the ownership document and send confirmation of the cancellation to the assessor and the owner.

     (3) The recording of a security interest in the deed records of the county under this section satisfies the requirements for filing a financing statement for a fixture to real property under ORS 79.0502. The recording of a manufactured structure in the deed records of the county is independent of the assessment and taxation of the structure as real property under ORS 308.875. The recording of a manufactured structure in the deed records of the county makes the structure subject to the same provisions of law applicable to any other building, housing or structure on the land. However, the manufactured structure may not be sold separately from the land or leasehold estate unless the owner complies with subsection (4) of this section.

     (4) The owner of a manufactured structure that is recorded in the deed records of the county may apply to have the structure removed from the deed records and an ownership document issued for the structure. Unless the manufactured structure is subject to ORS 446.631, the owner must apply to the county assessor, as agent for the department, for an ownership document as provided in ORS 446.571. Upon approval of the application, the assessor shall terminate the recording of the manufactured structure in the deed records.

     (5) If a manufactured structure described in subsection (1)(b) or (c) of this section is recorded in the deed records, the owner of the structure has a real property interest in the manufactured structure for purposes of:

     (a) Recordation of documents pursuant to ORS 93.600 to 93.802, 93.804, 93.806 and 93.808;

     (b) Deed forms pursuant to ORS 93.850 to 93.870;

     (c) Mortgages, trust deeds and other liens pursuant to ORS chapters 86, 87 and 88; and

     (d) Real property tax collection pursuant to ORS chapters 311 and 312. The structure owner is considered the owner of the real property for purposes of assessing the structure under ORS 308.875. [2003 c.655 §21; 2005 c.4 §1; 2005 c.22 §320; 2009 c.609 §9; 2015 c.27 §48]

     446.630 [1959 c.314 §16; repealed by 1973 c.833 §48]

 

     446.631 Process for moving manufactured structure; fees. (1) A person may not move a manufactured structure to a different situs unless the Department of Consumer and Business Services approves the move and the county assessor issues a trip permit on behalf of the department. An application to move a manufactured structure must be filed in the manner and form required by department rule and include the following:

     (a) The ownership document or, if an ownership document does not exist, another document acceptable to the department evidencing ownership of the structure or, if the structure is recorded in the deed records of the county, the property description for the current and proposed situses for the structure.

     (b) The identity of the owner of the proposed situs or, if the proposed situs is a facility as defined in ORS 90.100, the name of the facility.

     (c) Any other information required by the department by rule.

     (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the department may not approve an application to move a manufactured structure to a situs in another county unless all taxes and special assessments for the current year that will become a lien against the structure prior to the move as described in ORS 311.405 and all delinquent taxes and special assessments for past years are paid.

     (b) A purchaser or landlord may obtain a trip permit from the county assessor without payment if the county cancels the taxes and assessments as provided in ORS 90.425 or 90.675.

     (3) If the assessor cannot compute the exact amount of taxes due, the owner shall pay an amount based on the current assessed value of the manufactured structure or the value that would be used on the next assessment roll, or an amount based on the assessor’s best estimate of the total taxes and assessments. ORS 311.370 applies to taxes and assessments collected under this section.

     (4) If the county assessor determines that all due or pending taxes and assessments have been paid, the assessor may issue a trip permit on behalf of the department and shall forward the application information to the department. The department shall update the department’s record for the manufactured structure and issue an updated ownership document for the structure indicating the change in information. If no ownership document exists for the manufactured structure, the department shall record the information for the structure and issue an ownership document.

     (5) The department shall deliver an ownership document updated or issued under subsection (4) of this section to the holder of the earliest perfected unreleased security interest in the manufactured structure or, if none, to the owner of the structure. The department shall also send a copy of the ownership document to any other holders of unreleased security interests in the structure and to the county assessor for the county in which the structure is to be sited.

     (6) The Department of Consumer and Business Services or a county may charge fees for services provided under this section. The fees charged pursuant to this subsection may not exceed the cost of the services provided.

     (7) Subsections (1) to (6) of this section do not apply to the movement of a manufactured structure described under ORS 446.576 (1)(a) or (b) or 446.736. [2003 c.655 §22; 2005 c.22 §321]
