However, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may provide greater protection to individuals with disabilities by adopting more stringent standards than prescribed by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

      (2) The director shall, to assist in the identification of architectural barriers and in the development of the standards and specifications referred to in subsection (1) of this section, be assisted by the Oregon Disabilities Commission or its designee. [1971 c.320 §3; 1973 c.539 §3; 1979 c.133 §3; 1983 c.740 §169; 1987 c.414 §27b; 1987 c.672 §1; 1989 c.224 §111; 1989 c.703 §1; 1993 c.503 §3; 1993 c.744 §75a]

 

      447.231 Rules to eliminate architectural barriers. Notwithstanding any other provision of law and the authority of any board within the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall adopt rules to conform the state building code to the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act and the regulations adopted thereunder. In addition, the director shall adopt rules to conform the state building code to the provisions of ORS 447.210 to 447.280, to the extent to which any statute is stricter than the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Fair Housing Act. [1991 c.691 §2; 1993 c.503 §4; 2003 c.14 §269]

      447.241 Standards for renovating, altering or modifying certain buildings; barrier removal improvement plan. (1) Every project for renovation, alteration or modification to affected buildings and related facilities that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function shall be made to insure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the paths of travel to the altered area and the rest rooms, telephones and drinking fountains serving the altered area are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, unless such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope.

      (2) Alterations made to the path of travel to an altered area may be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 25 percent of the alteration to the primary function area.

      (3) If the cost of alterations to make the paths of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the paths of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.

      (4) In choosing which accessible elements to provide under this section, priority shall be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access. Elements shall be provided in the following order:

      (a) Parking;

      (b) An accessible entrance;

      (c) An accessible route to the altered area;

      (d) At least one accessible rest room for each sex or a single unisex rest room;

      (e) Accessible telephones;

      (f) Accessible drinking fountains; and

      (g) When possible, additional accessible elements such as storage and alarms.

      (5) A series of small alterations to an area served by a single path of travel does not satisfy the obligation to provide an accessible path of travel created under subsection (1) of this section.

      (6) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to the area and subsequent alterations affecting the same path of travel are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of the alterations to the primary function area on the path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making the path of travel accessible is disproportionate.

      (7)(a) A barrier removal improvement plan may satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) of this section. The plan shall require an equivalent or greater level of barrier removal than required by subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) The barrier removal improvement plan shall include:

      (A) A letter of participation from the building owner;

      (B) A building survey that identifies existing architectural barriers;

      (C) An improvement plan and time schedule for removal of architectural barriers; and

      (D) An implementation agreement.

      (c) The barrier removal improvement plan may be reviewed and accepted through the waiver process under ORS 447.250. The plan shall be reviewed upon completion or every three years for compliance with the requirements of this section.

      (8) For purposes of this section, “primary function” is a major activity for which the facility is intended. [1993 c.503 §7]

      (b) In all other commercial facilities, private entities and places of public accommodation covered by Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act that have more than one floor level and more than 3,000 square feet in ground area or that are more than 20 feet in height, measured from the top surface of the lowest flooring to the highest interior overhead finish of the building; and

      (c) In all private membership clubs and churches that have more than one floor level and more than 4,000 square feet in ground area or that are more than 20 feet in height, measured from the top surface of the lowest flooring to the highest interior overhead finish of the building.

      (2) The Department of Consumer and Business Services may by rule create exceptions to the requirements of this section if this section would require an elevator in a building that would not be required to have an elevator under the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Fair Housing Act. [1993 c.503 §6; 1995 c.307 §2]

 

      447.250 Waiver or modification of standards and specifications; appeals board; procedures; fees. (1) When a person or governmental entity undertaking the construction, renovation, alteration or modification of an affected building or its related facilities determines that a particular standard or specification exceeds the standards or specifications imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act, and that full compliance with the standard or specification is impractical in that it would defeat the purpose of the project proposed or in process, it may apply to the appeals board having jurisdiction over the project for a waiver or modification of such standard or specification, setting forth the reasons for its determination and a proposal for the work complying with the particular standard or specification to the maximum extent that it considers practical.

      (2)(a) For projects involving a state correctional facility as defined in ORS 421.005 (2), or a local correctional facility, as defined in ORS 169.005, the appeals board referred to in subsection (1) of this section is the Building Codes Structures Board established under ORS 455.132.

      (b) For all other projects, the appeals board referred to in subsection (1) of this section is the appeals board established under ORS 455.020 (4) by the municipality having jurisdiction over the project.

      (3) The appeals board shall thereupon investigate the application. The board in its investigation shall be required to seek the advice of the Oregon Disabilities Commission or its designee in dealing with architectural barrier waivers. If the appeals board finds that the proposal submitted with the application would constitute a substantial compliance with, or an acceptable alternative to, the particular standard or specification in view of the objectives of ORS 447.210 to 447.280, the waiver shall be granted. If the board finds otherwise, the application shall be promptly denied with notice to the requesting person or governmental entity of the denial.

      (4) The findings of the appeals board shall include the estimated building costs and the additional cost of construction to conform to the requirements of ORS 447.210 to 447.280 over the cost of a nonconforming feature or any other special reason or circumstance that, in the judgment of the board, justifies the decision.

      (5) Any person aggrieved by the final decision of an appeals board may within 30 days of the decision appeal to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. In the case where no appeals board has been created the director shall have original jurisdiction of an application for a waiver. The applicant for a waiver or an appeal shall submit a fee of $20 payable to the director with the request for waiver or appeal. In determining an appeal or an original application, the procedures and standards of subsections (1) to (4) of this section shall apply to the director.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall by rule establish criteria for determining the lowest flooring of a building for the purposes of the definition of “affected buildings” provided by ORS 447.210 and for the purposes of ORS 447.247.

Each curb cut or ramp shall be at least 48 inches wide, where possible, and a minimum of 36 inches wide where a 48-inch width will not fit, at a slope not to exceed one-inch rise per 12-inch run. If a slope of 1:12 will not fit, a slope between 1:10 and 1:12 is allowed for a maximum rise of six inches and a slope between 1:8 and 1:10 is allowed for a maximum rise of three inches.
