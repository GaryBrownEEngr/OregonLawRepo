If no hearing is requested within 10 days of the date that notice is given, the authority may grant the variance.

      (2) The authority may grant variances from standards requiring the use of a specified water treatment technique if the authority:

      (a) Determines that the use of a specified water treatment technique is not necessary to protect the public health based on the nature of the raw water source for a public water system;

      (b) Has conditioned the variance as required by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300g-4;

      448.250 Remedy when system a health hazard; special master; sale of system. (1) Whenever a water system or part thereof presents or threatens to present a public health hazard requiring immediate action to protect the public health, safety and welfare, the Director of the Oregon Health Authority may request the district attorney of the county wherein the system is located to institute an action. The action may be commenced without the necessity of prior administrative procedures or hearing and entry of an order or at any time during such administrative proceedings, if such proceedings have been commenced. The action may petition for a mandatory injunction compelling the water supplier to cease and desist operation or to make such improvements and corrections as are necessary to remove the public health hazard or threat thereof.

      (2)(a) If the water supplier refuses to comply with the order of the court, in addition to other remedies, the court may appoint a special master to operate the water system. Costs of operation and improvement during operation by the special master are to be charged to the water supplier and may be collected by impounding revenue due to the water supplier from customers of the supplier; or, if those funds are insufficient, from other revenues due to the water supplier.

      (b) The court may require sale of a water system under a special master to a responsible party if the water supplier refuses to comply with the standards and requirements of the Oregon Health Authority.

      (3) Cases filed under provisions of this section or any appeal therefrom shall be given preference on the docket over all other civil cases except those given an equal preference by statute.

      (4) Nothing in this section is intended to prevent the maintenance of actions for legal or equitable remedies relating to private or public nuisance or for recovery of damages brought by private persons or by the state on relation of any person.

(Federal Safe Drinking Water Act Administration)

 

      448.273 Federal Safe Drinking Water Act administration. The Legislative Assembly finds that an agreement between this state and the federal government to assume primary enforcement responsibility in this state for the federal Safe Drinking Water Act is in the best interest of this state, subject to the following assumptions:

      (1) The federal government provides an annual program grant in an amount no less than that allocated for the state in the 1984 fiscal year.

      (2) The federal government provides technical assistance to this state, as requested, in emergency situations and during outbreaks of waterborne diseases.

      (3) The federal government must negotiate an annual work plan for the Oregon Health Authority that can be accomplished within the amount of program grant funding available.

      (4) The authority adopts standards no less stringent than the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

      (5) The authority provides engineering assistance through regional offices in at least four geographically distributed areas in this state.

      (6) In cooperation with representatives of local health departments, the authority develops an equitable formula for distribution of available funds to support local health department water programs.

      (7) The primacy agreement may be canceled by the authority, upon 90 days’ notice, if at any time the federal requirements exceed the amount of federal funding and the cancellation is approved by the legislative review agency as defined in ORS 291.371 (1).

      (8) The federal government can impose financial sanctions against this state if the state fails to meet the objectives of the annual negotiated work plan without reasonable explanation by tying the next annual funding to specific state production and by withholding of funds a possibility if continued unexplained failures occur but no sanction exists to interfere with other types of federal funding in this state.

      (9) The federal government may seek to enforce the safe drinking water standards if this state fails to take timely compliance action against a public water system that violates such standards.

      (10) Enforcement under subsection (9) of this section may be by injunctive relief or, in the case of willful violation, civil penalties authorized by 42 U.S.C. 300g-3(a) and (b). [1985 c.178 §1; 2001 c.900 §257; 2009 c.595 §856]

The Oregon Health Authority is authorized to enter into an agreement with the federal government to administer the federal Safe Drinking Water Act in this state. The agreement is subject to the legislative assumption stated in ORS 448.273. The agreement shall remain in effect subject to annual renegotiation of the duties to be performed and the remuneration to be received by the authority except that it may be canceled by the authority, upon 90 days’ notice, if at any time the federal requirements exceed the amount of federal funding and the cancellation is approved by the legislative review agency as defined in ORS 291.371 (1). [1985 c.178 §2; 2009 c.595 §857]

 

(Cross-Connections and Backflow Assemblies)

      (2) The authority may assess an annual fee on community water systems for the purpose of implementing the cross-connection and backflow assembly program established pursuant to this section. The fee may not exceed:

      (a) $30 for a water system that has 15 to 99 service connections;

      (b) $75 for a water system that has 100 to 999 service connections;

      (c) $200 for a water system that has 1,000 to 9,999 service connections; or

      (d) $350 for a water system that has 10,000 or more service connections. [2005 c.806 §11; 2009 c.595 §858]

 

      Note: 448.278 was added to and made a part of 448.119 to 448.285 by legislative action but was not added to any other series in ORS chapter 448. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      448.279 Certification of inspectors of cross-connections and testers of backflow assemblies; fees; rules. (1) The Oregon Health Authority by rule shall establish a certification program for persons who inspect cross-connections or test backflow assemblies. The program shall include minimum qualifications necessary for a person to be certified to:

      (a) Conduct a cross-connection inspection; and

      (b) Test a backflow assembly.

      (2) Except for an employee of a water supplier as defined in ORS 448.115, a person certified under this section must:

      (a) Become licensed as a construction contractor with the Construction Contractors Board as provided under ORS chapter 701; or

      (b) Be employed by a landscape contracting business licensed under ORS 671.510 to 671.760.

      (3) In conjunction with the certification program established under subsection (1) of this section, the authority may establish and collect a fee from an individual requesting certification under the program. A fee imposed under this subsection:

      (a) Is not refundable; and

      (b) May not exceed the cost of administering the certification program of the authority for which purpose the fee is established, as authorized by the Legislative Assembly within the budget of the authority and as the budget may be modified by the Emergency Board.
