The revenue bonds shall be issued as prescribed in ORS chapter 287A, but they are payable, both as to principal and interest from revenues only, as specified by this section. The revenue bonds are not subject to the percentage limitation applicable to general obligation bonds and are not a lien upon any of the taxable property within the boundaries of such district, but are payable solely from such part of the revenues of the district as remain after payment of obligations having a priority and of all expenses of operation and maintenance of the district. All revenue bonds shall contain a clause reciting that both the principal and interest are payable solely from operating revenues of the district remaining after paying such obligations and expenses.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies:

      (a) If the entire area of a special district is incorporated in or annexed to a district; and

      (b) If the district has the authority to provide the same service as the special district. [1965 c.475 §3; 1969 c.646 §14; 1973 c.785 §27; 1989 c.374 §8]

(1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 451.410 to 451.610, all moneys received by a district shall be paid to the county treasurer and deposited by the county treasurer in an appropriate district fund. The county treasurer, when ordered by a district governing body, shall establish separate accounts in the district fund or separate funds in the county treasury for the segregation of sinking or reserve funds or accounts, of operating funds or accounts or of any other funds or accounts found necessary or expedient by the district. However, no moneys received by a district shall be used for any purpose other than for carrying out the purposes of ORS 451.410 to 451.610 and all funds, facilities, personnel or supplies of the county used for those purposes shall be charged to the appropriate district fund or account.

      (2) Notwithstanding the requirement for a district to pay district moneys to the county treasurer for deposit in an appropriate district fund in the county treasury under subsection (1) of this section, the governing body of a county, with the consent of the county treasurer if the county treasurer is an elected county officer, may order a service district established under ORS 451.410 to 451.610 to hold and manage its own moneys in one or more district funds or accounts deposited in a financial institution as defined in ORS 706.008. The order must provide for transfer of any moneys of the district then held or later received by the county treasurer for the district. Thereafter, the district shall be solely responsible for management of moneys of the district and shall designate a district officer or employee to assume the duties and responsibilities otherwise imposed upon the county treasurer.

      (3) Moneys deposited by the district in a district fund or account may be withdrawn or paid out only upon a proper order and warrant or upon a check signed by the district officer or employee designated to assume the duties and responsibilities otherwise imposed upon the county treasurer.

The district officers shall forthwith deliver to the city officers the district assets and records. Uncollected taxes theretofore levied by such district shall become the property of the city and be delivered to it by the county treasurer upon collection.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a district, the entire area of which becomes incorporated in a city, may continue to provide services if the continuation is proposed by petitioners in a petition for incorporation that is subsequently approved by voters in an incorporation election. At any time after incorporation, a city may cause a district to be extinguished and succeed to all the assets and become charged with all the liabilities, obligations and functions of the district if:

      (a) The governing body of the city holds a public hearing on the question of the extinguishment, hears objections to the extinguishment at the hearing, determines that the extinguishment is in the best interest of the city and adopts an ordinance extinguishing the district;

      (b) After the hearing, the governing body of the city refers the ordinance extinguishing the district to the electors of the city; and

      (c) The majority of all votes cast favors that the district be extinguished.

      (3) For the public hearing required in subsection (2)(a) of this section, the governing body shall fix a date, time and place for the hearing and cause notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing to be published once each week for two successive weeks prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and shall cause notices of the hearing to be posted in four public places in the city for a like period.
