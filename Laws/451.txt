     (2) Notwithstanding the requirement for a district to pay district moneys to the county treasurer for deposit in an appropriate district fund in the county treasury under subsection (1) of this section, the governing body of a county, with the consent of the county treasurer if the county treasurer is an elected county officer, may order a service district established under ORS 451.410 to 451.610 to hold and manage its own moneys in one or more district funds or accounts deposited in a financial institution as defined in ORS 706.008. The order must provide for transfer of any moneys of the district then held or later received by the county treasurer for the district. Thereafter, the district shall be solely responsible for management of moneys of the district and shall designate a district officer or employee to assume the duties and responsibilities otherwise imposed upon the county treasurer.

Uncollected taxes theretofore levied by such district shall become the property of the city and be delivered to it by the county treasurer upon collection.

     (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a district, the entire area of which becomes incorporated in a city, may continue to provide services if the continuation is proposed by petitioners in a petition for incorporation that is subsequently approved by voters in an incorporation election. At any time after incorporation, a city may cause a district to be extinguished and succeed to all the assets and become charged with all the liabilities, obligations and functions of the district if:

     (a) The governing body of the city holds a public hearing on the question of the extinguishment, hears objections to the extinguishment at the hearing, determines that the extinguishment is in the best interest of the city and adopts an ordinance extinguishing the district;

     (b) After the hearing, the governing body of the city refers the ordinance extinguishing the district to the electors of the city; and

     (c) The majority of all votes cast favors that the district be extinguished.

     (3) For the public hearing required in subsection (2)(a) of this section, the governing body shall fix a date, time and place for the hearing and cause notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing to be published once each week for two successive weeks prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and shall cause notices of the hearing to be posted in four public places in the city for a like period.

     (a) Liquidation and dissolution cannot be accomplished in a manner that would protect the rights of nonassenting creditors; or

     (b) The services provided continue to be needed by the public, the district is providing the services in an efficient and effective manner and continuation will not significantly discourage future boundary change proposals.

Notice of the hearing shall also be mailed to all incorporated cities within the district and to the boundary commission, if any.
