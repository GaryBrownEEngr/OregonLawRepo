     (3) If the court finds that a detained or embargoed article is misbranded or a banned hazardous substance, after entry of the judgment, the article shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner or claimant thereof, under supervision of the director or a designated representative, and all court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be taxed against the owner or claimant of such article or the owner or claimant agent. However, when the misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling of the article, after entry of the judgment and after such costs, fees, and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond or irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, conditioned that such article shall be so labeled, has been executed, the court may order that such article be delivered to the owner or claimant thereof for such labeling under the supervision of an agent of the director. The expense of such supervision shall be paid by claimant. The article shall be returned to the claimant on the representation to the court by the director that the article is no longer in violation of ORS 453.005 to 453.135 and 453.990 (2), and that the expenses of such supervision have been paid.

ART AND CRAFT MATERIALS

 

(Generally)

 

     453.205 Definitions for ORS 453.205 to 453.275. As used in ORS 453.205 to 453.275:

     (1) “Art or craft material” means any raw or processed material or manufactured product marketed or being represented by the manufacturer, repackager or principal importer as being suitable for use in any phase of the creation of any work of visual or graphic art of any medium. “Art or craft material” does not include economic poisons subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (61 Stats. 163) or drugs, devices or cosmetics, which are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (52 Stats. 1040).

     (2) “Authority” means the Oregon Health Authority.

     (3) “Human carcinogen” means any substance listed as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

     (4) “Medium” includes, but is not limited to, paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, ceramics, enamels, jewelry, stained glass, plastic sculpture, photographs and leather and textile goods.

     (5) “Potential human carcinogen” means one of the following:

     (a) Any substance which does not meet the definition of human carcinogen, but for which there exists sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals, as determined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

     (b) Any chemical shown to be changed by the human body into a human carcinogen.

     (6) “Toxic substance causing chronic illness” means any of the following:

     (a) Human carcinogens.

     (b) Potential human carcinogens.

     (c) Any substance included in the list of hazardous substances prepared by the Department of Consumer and Business Services pursuant to the Hazard Communication Rule, Division 155, notwithstanding exemptions made for substances on the list which are used in particular forms, circumstances or concentrations, if the health hazard presented by the substance is not the subject of label statements required by federal law. [1985 c.539 §1; 2009 c.595 §890]

 

     453.210 [Repealed by 1971 c.409 §16]

 

     453.215 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly:

     (1) Finds and declares that there exists a significant danger to the public health and safety from exposure to art or craft material which contains toxic chemicals. This health risk threatens not only professional artists and craftspersons, but art teachers, students at every educational level, hobbyists and children. Toxic substances may be employed during the course and scope of creating art or craft objects of all varieties.

     (2) Finds and declares that present labeling of ingredients and hazards of art or craft material is insufficient to adequately protect the consumers of this state from chronic adverse health effects. Because many persons do not know what toxic chemical substances they work with, proper precautionary actions cannot be taken. Disclosure of toxic ingredients, their possible adverse effects on health, and instructions for safe handling, will substantially minimize unnecessary exposure to excessive risk.

     (3) Finds and declares that it is consistent to impose upon those who manufacture, repackage and distribute art or craft material a duty to convey to consumers information about the potential health hazards of the products they manufacture.

     (4) Finds and declares that school children are not sufficiently protected by present health laws insofar as materials which may be seriously harmful are not so labeled and therefore children are not properly warned as to the dangers inherent in the use of these materials.

     (5) Intends by ORS 453.205 to 453.275 to insure that consumers be provided information concerning the nature of the toxic substances with which they are working and the known and suspected health hazards of these substances and to insure the uniformity of labeling standards, so that materials with similar hazards also have essentially similar labels and to insure that elementary school children are protected by prohibiting the sale of those toxic substances to schools and school districts for use in kindergarten and grades 1 through 6. [1985 c.539 §2]

 

     453.220 [Repealed by 1971 c.409 §16]

 

(Regulation; Prohibited Acts)

 

     453.225 When presumption of toxic ingredient arises. For the purposes of ORS 453.205 to 453.275, an art or craft material shall be presumed to contain an ingredient which is a toxic substance causing chronic illness if the ingredient, whether an intentional ingredient or an impurity, is one percent or more by weight of the mixture or product, or if the Oregon Health Authority determines that the toxic or carcinogenic properties of the art or craft material are such that labeling is necessary for the adequate protection of the public health and safety. [1985 c.539 §3; 2009 c.595 §891]

 

     453.230 [Repealed by 1971 c.409 §16]

     (D) More than one chronically toxic substance, or if a single substance can cause more than one chronic health effect, the required statements may be combined into one warning statement.

     (c) Has failed to affix on the label a list of ingredients that are toxic substances causing chronic illness.

     (d) Has failed to affix on the label a statement or statements of safe use and storage instructions, conforming to the following list. The label shall contain, but not be limited to, as many of the following risk statements as are applicable:

     (f) Has failed to affix on the label the name and address of the manufacturer.

     (2)(a) If the information listed in subsection (1)(d) of this section cannot fit on the package label, a package insert shall be required to convey all the necessary information to the consumer. In this event, the label shall contain a statement to refer to the package insert, such as “CAUTION: See package insert before use.” The language on this insert shall be nontechnical and nonpromotional in tone and content.

     (b) For purposes of this subsection, “package insert” means a display of written, printed or graphic matter upon a leaflet or suitable material accompanying the art supply.

     (3) The requirements set forth in this section shall not be considered to be complied with unless the required words, statements or other information appear on the outside container or wrapper, or on a package insert that is easily legible through the outside container or wrapper and is painted in a color in contrast with the product or the package containing the product.

     (4) The Oregon Health Authority may exempt a material from full compliance with ORS 453.205 to 453.275. In considering this exemption, the authority shall take into consideration the potential for reasonably foreseeable misuse of a material by a child.

     (5) If an art or craft material complies with labeling standards D-4236 of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), the material complies with the provisions of ORS 453.205 to 453.275, unless the authority determines that the label on an art or craft material does not satisfy the purposes of ORS 453.205 to 453.275.

     453.245 Order or purchase by school of material considered to contain toxic substance prohibited; exceptions. (1) Art or craft material that is considered by the Oregon Health Authority to contain a toxic substance causing chronic illness may not be ordered or purchased by a school or school district for use by students in kindergarten and grades 1 through 6.

     (2) Any substance that is a toxic substance causing chronic illness may not be ordered or purchased by a school or school district for use by students in grades 7 through 12 unless the substance meets the labeling standards specified in ORS 453.235.

     (3) If the authority finds that, because the chronically toxic, carcinogenic or radioactive substances contained in an art or craft material cannot be ingested, inhaled or otherwise absorbed into the body during any reasonably foreseeable use of the material in a way that could pose a potential health risk, the authority may exempt the material from these requirements to the extent the authority determines to be consistent with adequate protection of the public health and safety. [1985 c.539 §5; 2005 c.22 §325; 2009 c.595 §893]

The county or local government may resume efforts to decontaminate and obtain certification of a property if the county or local government determines, after opportunity for a hearing, that an owner or lienholder has failed to diligently pursue the course of action proposed by the owner or lienholder and to complete the course of action within a reasonable time.

     (4) A lien under ORS 105.585 (2) for costs incurred by the county or local government in decontaminating and obtaining certification of the property is superior to, has priority over and shall be fully satisfied before all other liens, judgments, mortgages, security interests or encumbrances on the property other than tax liens, regardless of the date of creating, filing or recording of the lien, judgment, mortgage, security interest or encumbrance, if the county or other local government incurs the cost after giving notice to owners and lienholders under subsection (1) of this section and:

     (a) No owner or lienholder provided a response on or before the 60th day after the giving of the notice; or

     (b) An owner or lienholder for the property timely responded to the notice with a proposed course of action for decontaminating and obtaining certification of the property, but failed to complete the course of action within:

     (A) Eight months after the notice date; or

     (B) A date more than eight months after the notice date that was agreed to by the county or local government that gave the notice and the owner or lienholder that timely responded to the notice. [2007 c.673 §1]
