(1) Any municipality may own, acquire, construct, equip, operate and maintain, either within or without its statutory or corporate limits, in whole or in part, disposal systems with all appurtenances necessary, useful or convenient for the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage. The municipality may acquire by gift, grant, purchase or condemnation necessary lands and rights of way therefor, either within or without its statutory or corporate limits. For the purpose of acquiring property for such uses, the municipality may invoke and shall have the rights, powers and privileges granted to public corporations under the provisions of existing or future laws pertaining to this subject.

      (2) The authority given by ORS 454.205 to 454.255 shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of any power existing in the municipality under any constitutional, statutory or charter provisions now or hereafter existing. [1973 c.213 §3]

 

      454.225 Rates and charges; collection. The governing body of the municipality may establish just and equitable rates or charges to be paid for the use of the disposal system by each person, firm or corporation whose premises are served thereby, or upon subsequent service thereto.

Once the service charges are certified and presented to the assessor, the payment for the service charges must be made to the tax collector pursuant to ORS 311.370. Such payment shall be made by the person responsible for the delinquent service charge or by the municipality who has received payment for the delinquent service charge. These charges shall thereupon be collected and paid over in the same manner as other taxes are certified, assessed, collected and paid over.

(1) The governing body of the municipality, by proposed charter amendment or ordinance, may refer the question of acquiring and constructing a disposal or water system, as defined in ORS 448.115, to a vote of its electors, and after approval thereof by a majority of such electors, may authorize the issuance of and cause to be issued bonds of the municipality for such purposes. The bonds may be general obligation, limited obligation or self-liquidating in character in a sum not more than the amount authorized at such election and shall be subject to ORS 454.205 to 454.255. The bonds may provide for payment of principal and interest thereon from service charges to be imposed by the governing body for services to be extended through employment and use of the disposal or water system. If service charges are imposed to be paid as provided in ORS 454.225, such portion thereof as may be deemed sufficient shall be set aside as a sinking fund for payment of interest on the bond and the principal thereof at maturity.

      (2)(a) When the Environmental Quality Commission or the Oregon Health Authority enters an order pursuant to ORS chapter 183 that requires the acquisition or construction of a disposal system or a water system in a municipality, respectively, the governing body of the municipality shall refer to its electors the question of a bond issue in an amount sufficient to finance the necessary acquisition or construction of such disposal or water system. The election shall be held within one year of the date the order of the commission or authority is entered.

      (b) If, within eight months after the order of the commission or authority, the governing body of the municipality has not called an election in compliance with paragraph (a) of this subsection, the commission or authority, whichever is appropriate, may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the municipality is located, or to the Circuit Court of Marion County for an order compelling the holding of an election.

      (c) If the electors do not approve the disposal system bond issue, submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, the commission may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the municipality is located or to the Circuit Court of Marion County for an order directing that self-liquidating bonds of the municipality be issued and sold pursuant to ORS 454.205 to 454.255, and directing that the proceeds be applied to the acquisition or construction of a disposal system required to comply with the final order of the commission. If the court finds that the disposal system required by the final order of the commission is necessary under the rules or standards of the commission, it shall issue an order directing that such bonds be issued and sold without elector approval in such an amount as the court finds necessary to acquire or construct such disposal system, and that the proceeds be applied for such purposes.

      (d) Any court proceeding authorized by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection shall be advanced on the court docket for immediate hearing. [1973 c.213 §5; 1981 c.749 §22; 2009 c.595 §937]

 

      454.245 Serial bonds; term and content; interest; amount. (1) The governing body of the municipality may determine the maturities and tenor of the bonds issued under ORS 454.235. However, the bonds shall be serial in character in accordance with present or future provisions of law or the charter. They shall be payable in not to exceed 40 years from the date of issuance thereof, and shall be sold at a price to net the municipality not less than the par value thereof with accrued interest. They shall bear interest at not to exceed six percent per annum payable semiannually.

      (2) The amount of any bonds issued under ORS 454.205 to 454.255 shall not be within any limitation of indebtedness fixed by law or charter, but shall be in addition thereto. [1973 c.213 §§6,7]

 

      454.255 Plans and cost estimates; examination by electors. Before calling any election under ORS 454.235, the governing body of the municipality shall cause to be prepared plans, specifications and estimates of costs of any proposed disposal or water system, as defined in ORS 448.115, to be voted upon, which may be examined by any elector of the municipality. [1973 c.213 §8; 1981 c.749 §23]
