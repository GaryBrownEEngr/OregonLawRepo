The state building code shall establish uniform performance standards providing reasonable safeguards for health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the residents of this state who are occupants and users of buildings, and will provide for the use of modern methods, devices, materials, techniques and practicable maximum energy conservation.

      (2) The rules adopted pursuant to this chapter shall include structural standards; standards for the installation and use of mechanical, heating and ventilating devices and equipment; and standards for prefabricated structures; and shall, subject to ORS 455.210, prescribe reasonable fees for the issuance of building permits and similar documents, inspections and plan review services by the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The department may also establish, by rule, the amount of any fee pertaining to the state building code or any specialty code that is authorized by statute, but for which an amount is not specified by statute.

      (3) This chapter does not affect the statutory jurisdiction and authority of the Workers’ Compensation Board, under ORS chapter 654, to promulgate occupational safety and health standards relating to places of employment, and to administer and enforce all state laws, regulations, rules, standards and lawful orders requiring places of employment to be safe and healthful.

      (4) This chapter and any specialty code does not limit the authority of a municipality to enact regulations providing for local administration of the state building code; local appeal boards; fees and other charges; abatement of nuisances and dangerous buildings; enforcement through penalties, stop-work orders or other means; or minimum health, sanitation and safety standards for governing the use of structures for housing, except where the power of municipalities to enact any such regulations is expressly withheld or otherwise provided for by statute. Pursuant to the regulation of dangerous buildings, a municipality may adopt seismic rehabilitation plans that provide for phased completion of repairs that are designed to provide improved life safety but that may be less than the standards for new buildings.

      455.022 Appropriation of program fees established by department rule. All moneys deposited to the Consumer and Business Services Fund that are derived pursuant to ORS 455.240 or 460.370, or from state building code or specialty code program fees for which the amounts are established by Department of Consumer and Business Services rule pursuant to ORS 455.020 (2), are continuously appropriated to the department for carrying out any of the duties, functions and powers of the department under ORS 455.240 or 460.310 to 460.370 or under a program for which a fee amount is established by department rule pursuant to ORS 455.020 (2), without regard to the source of the moneys.

The retained moneys are not subject to any appropriation to the board, any authorization for or limitation on the expenditure of moneys by the board, any restriction on the source, use or transfer of board moneys or any judgment, lien or other claim against moneys of the board. Notwithstanding any requirement or limitation on the retention of moneys by a state agency, the retention of department moneys by the board under an interagency agreement described in this section shall be governed solely by the terms of the agreement.

(Director)

 

      455.100 Duties of director. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall have general supervision over the administration of the state building code regulations, including providing statewide interpretations for the plumbing, elevator, electrical, manufactured structures, boiler, amusement ride, structural, mechanical, low-rise residential dwelling and prefabricated structures codes. [Formerly 456.790; 1993 c.18 §113; 1993 c.744 §88; 2003 c.675 §§14,15]

 

      455.110 Other duties of director; rules. Except as otherwise provided by ORS 479.015 to 479.200, 479.210 to 479.220, 479.510 to 479.945, 479.990 and 479.995 and ORS chapters 446, 447, 460, 476 and 480:

      (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall coordinate, interpret and generally supervise the adoption, administration and enforcement of the state building code.

      (2) The director, with the approval of the appropriate advisory boards, shall adopt codes and standards, including regulations as authorized by ORS 455.020 governing the construction, reconstruction, alteration and repair of buildings and other structures and the installation of mechanical devices and equipment therein. The regulations may include rules for the administration and enforcement of a certification system for persons performing work under the codes and standards adopted under this subsection. However, this subsection does not authorize the establishment of a separate certification for performing work on low-rise residential dwellings.

      (3) The director, with the approval of the appropriate advisory boards, may amend such codes from time to time. The codes of regulations and any amendment thereof shall conform insofar as practicable to model building codes generally accepted and in use throughout the United States. If there is no nationally recognized model code, consideration shall be given to the existing specialty codes presently in use in this state. Such model codes with modifications considered necessary and specialty codes may be adopted by reference. The codes so promulgated and any amendments thereof shall be based on the application of scientific principles, approved tests and professional judgment and, to the extent that it is practical to do so, the codes shall be promulgated in terms of desired results instead of the means of achieving such results, avoiding wherever possible the incorporation of specifications of particular methods or materials. To that end the codes shall encourage the use of new methods, new materials and maximum energy conservation.

      (4) The director shall adopt rules requiring a journeyman plumber licensed under ORS chapter 693 or an apprentice plumber, as defined in ORS 693.010, who tests backflow assemblies to complete a state-approved training program for the testing of those assemblies. [Formerly 456.770; 2003 c.675 §16; 2005 c.736 §2; 2007 c.71 §140; 2015 c.27 §49]

 

      455.112 Elimination of unclear, duplicative, conflicting or inadequate provisions; rules. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may initiate the adoption of rules the director considers necessary to interpret, harmonize, streamline, adjust, promote consistency within, reduce confusion regarding, administer or enforce the state building code or any requirement for a license, registration, certification, endorsement or other authorization to perform work related to the administration and enforcement of the state building code when any provision of the state building code or a requirement for authorization to perform work is unclear, duplicative or in conflict with another or when the code or a requirement for authorization to perform work does not adequately address a project of a unique type or scope. The director must obtain the approval of the appropriate advisory boards prior to adopting a rule under this section. [2003 c.367 §2; 2013 c.110 §3]

 

      Note: 455.112 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 455 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      455.157 Process for municipal imposition of monetary penalties. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that enforcement of the state building code in a fair, equitable and uniform manner throughout this state is a matter of state concern.

      (2) If a municipality administers a building inspection program under ORS 455.148 or 455.150, a monetary penalty assessed under the program for a violation must be assessed as a civil penalty. This subsection does not prohibit a municipality from charging a violator an increased permit fee or investigative fee, seeking injunctive relief from a violation or taking any enforcement action that does not include a monetary penalty. This subsection does not limit the terms or conditions of any voluntary agreement for the resolution of a violation.

      (3) A municipality may not assess a civil penalty for a violation under a building inspection program unless the municipality provides to the party that is subject to the civil penalty:

      (a) Notice that:

      (A) Describes the alleged violation, including any relevant code provision numbers, ordinance numbers or other identifying references;

      (B) States that the municipality intends to assess a civil penalty for the violation and states the amount of the civil penalty;

      (C) States that the party may challenge the assessment of a civil penalty; and

      (D) Describes the means and the deadline for informing the municipality that the party is challenging the assessment of the civil penalty; and

      (b) A municipal administrative process other than a judicial proceeding in a court of law, that affords the party an opportunity to challenge the civil penalty assessment before an individual, department or body that is other than the municipality’s building inspector or building official.

      (4) If the municipality assesses a civil penalty for a violation under a building inspection program, the amount of the civil penalty assessed for the violation may not exceed the maximum civil penalty amount authorized for an equivalent specialty code violation under ORS 455.895.

      (5) The costs incurred by a municipality in providing notice and administrative process under this section are building inspection program administration and enforcement costs for the purpose of fee adoption under ORS 455.210. [2009 c.476 §2]

 

      Note: 455.157 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 455 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

(1) The municipality that is responsible for state building code administration and enforcement in a municipality pursuant to ORS 455.148 or 455.150, or the Department of Consumer and Business Services if the department is responsible for state building code administration and enforcement pursuant to ORS 455.148 or 455.150, may not engage in a pattern of conduct of failing to provide timely inspections or plan reviews without reasonable cause.

      (4) If the department, within five days of receipt of the demand, fails to provide timely inspections or plan reviews without reasonable cause, the person who served the demand may seek to compel the inspections or plan reviews through a writ of mandamus pursuant to ORS 34.105 to 34.240. If the court finds that the department has engaged in a pattern of conduct of failing to provide timely inspections or plan reviews without reasonable cause, it may direct the department to provide timely inspections or plan reviews or to transfer the administration and enforcement of the code in question to an appropriate municipality, if the municipality accepts the responsibility. A municipality may accept the transfer of the administration and enforcement of a code under this subsection without becoming subject to ORS 455.148 as a result of accepting the transfer.

A decision by the director regarding whether to enter into an agreement under subsection (1) of this section, and the content of any agreement that the director enters into under subsection (1) of this section, is not subject to review by the Attorney General or the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and is subject to challenge or appeal under ORS chapter 183 only for failure to comply with an express requirement created under ORS 455.185 to 455.198.

      (3) An agreement under subsection (1) of this section is not an abandonment of a building inspection program for purposes of ORS 455.148 or 455.150.

      (4) If the Department of Consumer and Business Services enters into an agreement under subsection (1) of this section, the department and a public body that offers construction-related services in the geographic area may enter into an agreement for providing access to the construction-related services on the electronic information system described in ORS 455.095 and 455.097. The agreement may include, but need not be limited to, provision for access that allows the electronic submission of an application to the public body for a construction-related permit. As used in this subsection, “public body” has the meaning given that term in ORS 174.109. [2013 c.528 §5; 2015 c.170 §4]

ENERGY CONSERVATION

 

(Generally)

 

      455.490 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) The use of a consensus-based expedited review system for the uniform statewide adoption, implementation, application and enforcement of certain state building code requirements to promote energy efficiency and energy conservation will facilitate and expedite compliance with those state building code requirements by providing a comprehensive source for interpretation of requirements that integrate elements affecting a variety of specialty codes.

      (2) The establishment of a Construction Industry Energy Board as an advisory board to the Department of Consumer and Business Services is an appropriate means for furthering the goal of facilitating and expediting state building code compliance related to energy efficiency and energy conservation.

      (3) The creation of a Construction Industry Energy Board will improve state building code compliance with regard to energy efficiency and energy use standards by creating an additional body empowered to enforce those standards.

      (4) The reorganization of certain existing advisory boards and the realignment of code enforcement responsibilities will enable the Department of Consumer and Business Services to more effectively ensure compliance with state building code specialty codes by increasing the focus of appropriate technical expertise, making the advisory boards more responsive to inquiries regarding code requirements and streamlining code enforcement responsibilities. [2009 c.567 §1]

 

      Note: 455.490 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 455 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (3) If the director requires, by rule, an applicant for a particular certification to pass an examination prepared by a national organization, the applicant shall pay in addition to the fee required in subsection (2) of this section, the cost of the examination. If the director requires an applicant for certification to pass an examination administered by the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the department may charge the applicant an examination administration fee.

      (4) Upon determining that the applicant is qualified under ORS 455.715 to 455.740, the director shall issue a certificate or cause a certificate to be issued to the applicant.

The criteria shall be adopted in a manner that facilitates review of a person’s qualifications by a local building official.

      (2)(a) A local building official who wishes to employ a person who is not certified under ORS 455.735 as an inspector shall submit the person’s qualifications to the director. The director shall review the stated qualifications against the criteria adopted under subsection (1) of this section, including verification of experience and training. The director shall respond to the local building official in writing within 10 working days of receiving the applicant’s qualifications, stating whether the person meets the applicable criteria.

      (b) Upon application and payment of the required fee, the director shall allow a person whose qualifications meet the criteria adopted under subsection (1) of this section to sit for any examination necessary for the required certification. [1997 c.677 §2; 2005 c.758 §21d]

      455.815 Establishment of master builder programs; waiver of inspections; builder verification of performance. (1) Local government establishment of a master builder program is voluntary. A local government electing to establish or terminate a program shall notify the Department of Consumer and Business Services. If terminating a program, the local government must give the notice six months before the program terminates.

      (2) The Department of Consumer and Business Services may implement a master builder program in one or more geographic areas for which the department provides plan review or inspection services. A department decision to include an area as a participant in the program affects only those areas, and those reviews or inspections, for which the department provides services instead of a local government. The department shall notify a county prior to implementing a master builder program in areas of the county that are served by the department.

      (3) A local government may not allow an individual to perform the duties of a master builder unless the local government has a master builder program. The department may allow an individual to perform the duties of a master builder in any geographic area administered by the department.

      (4) A building official of a government having a master builder program may waive plan review elements by that government and may waive government performance of one or more of the required inspections identified by department rule, including but not limited to inspections described in subsection (6) of this section, if:

      (a) An individual certified as a master builder submits construction plans for a one or two family dwelling regulated by the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code; and

      (b) The building official determines that:

      (A) The work is not of a highly technical nature; and

      (B) There is no unreasonable potential risk to safety of the structure.

      (5) A building official may not waive government performance of plan review or required inspections for:

      (a) Special design applications that are complex and highly technical engineered systems; or

      (b) Unique building sites, including but not limited to sites containing geologic hazards such as landslide hazard areas, floodplains and wetlands.

      (6) Subject to subsections (3) to (5) of this section, a building official may allow a master builder to verify that the master builder has properly performed an installation on a project and, to the extent that inspection would duplicate the verification conducted by the master builder, may waive government performance of the following required inspections:

      (a) Drywall;

      (b) Footings and setbacks;

      (c) Foundation walls, Ufer grounding rods and rebar;

      (d) Insulation;

      (e) Masonry fireplace pre-cover;

      (f) Masonry rebar;

      (g) Gutters, downspouts and foundation drains;

      Note: See note under 455.800.

 

      455.820 Plan review and verification; documentation; duties of building official; effect of waiver revocation. (1) A master builder must perform all plan review and required verifications for which government review or inspection has been waived by a building official. The master builder shall maintain copies of all documents and reports required by the government granting the waiver and provide those copies to the building official.

      (2) When waiving government performance of plan review or required inspections, a building official shall require the master builder to sign a form that specifically identifies each waiver and states that the master builder accepts the duty of performing the review and verifications. A master builder who accepts the duty of performing a review or verification remains responsible for that duty unless released by written and signed permission of the building official. A building official may release a master builder from a review or verification duty by a written and signed assumption of the review or inspection duty by the building official or written and signed assumption of the review and verification duty by another master builder.

      (3) A building official for a government that has a master builder program:

      (a) Must conduct inspections of at least 10 percent of projects that are built under a master builder program;

      (b) May revoke a waiver for a plan review or required inspection if the master builder fails to properly perform, or document performance of, review or verification duties; and

      (c) Must notify the Department of Consumer and Business Services when the official revokes a waiver pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (4) When revoking a waiver, a building official shall provide the master builder with a release under subsection (2) of this section from future performance of review or verification duties. A release does not relieve a master builder from liability for the failure to perform, or document performance of, review or verification duties prior to the revocation of the waiver.

      (5) A government having a master builder program has no legal duty with regard to plan review or required inspections properly waived under ORS 455.815 and accepted by a master builder in a signed form described under subsection (2) of this section. This subsection does not release a government from a duty arising due to a waiver revocation under subsection (3) of this section or an assumption under subsection (2) of this section.

      (6) A local government may refuse to grant recognition to a certified master builder if a waiver granted to the master builder under that government’s master builder program has been revoked pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section. If a waiver is revoked pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section, a local government or building official may send a recommendation to the department for action against the master builder who was granted the waiver. The local government or building official may also send the department any information supporting the recommendation. [2001 c.406 §5]
