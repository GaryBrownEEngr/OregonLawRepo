[Formerly 456.750; 1991 c.227 §1; 1991 c.310 §1; 1993 c.18 §112; 1993 c.744 §85; 1997 c.259 §3; 1999 c.484 §1; 1999 c.1045 §12; 2003 c.655 §75; 2003 c.675 §§10,11; 2009 c.567 §§4,13]

 

     455.015 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

     (1)(a) It is in the best interests of this state that construction-related development activities proceed in a manner that is as quick and efficient as practicable;

     (b) Ensuring that construction-related development activities proceed quickly and efficiently requires a flexible and responsive system for state building code administration and enforcement; and

     (c) Having a flexible and responsive system for state building code administration and enforcement requires that sufficient staff and resources be available to assist the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services as needed.

     (2) It is in the best interests of this state that state building code regulations encourage economic development, experimentation, innovation and cost effectiveness in construction, especially construction in rural or remote parts of this state. [2013 c.528 §2]

 

     Note: 455.015 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 455 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

     455.020 Purpose; scope of application; exceptions; scope of rules; fees by rule. (1) This chapter is enacted to enable the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to promulgate a state building code to govern the construction, reconstruction, alteration and repair of buildings and other structures and the installation of mechanical devices and equipment therein, and to require the correction of unsafe conditions caused by earthquakes in existing buildings. The state building code shall establish uniform performance standards providing reasonable safeguards for health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the residents of this state who are occupants and users of buildings, and will provide for the use of modern methods, devices, materials, techniques and practicable maximum energy conservation.

     (2) The rules adopted pursuant to this chapter shall include structural standards; standards for the installation and use of mechanical, heating and ventilating devices and equipment; and standards for prefabricated structures; and shall, subject to ORS 455.210, prescribe reasonable fees for the issuance of building permits and similar documents, inspections and plan review services by the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The department may also establish, by rule, the amount of any fee pertaining to the state building code or any specialty code that is authorized by statute, but for which an amount is not specified by statute.

     (3) This chapter does not affect the statutory jurisdiction and authority of the Workers’ Compensation Board, under ORS chapter 654, to promulgate occupational safety and health standards relating to places of employment, and to administer and enforce all state laws, regulations, rules, standards and lawful orders requiring places of employment to be safe and healthful.

     (4) This chapter and any specialty code does not limit the authority of a municipality to enact regulations providing for local administration of the state building code; local appeal boards; fees and other charges; abatement of nuisances and dangerous buildings; enforcement through penalties, stop-work orders or other means; or minimum health, sanitation and safety standards for governing the use of structures for housing, except where the power of municipalities to enact any such regulations is expressly withheld or otherwise provided for by statute. Pursuant to the regulation of dangerous buildings, a municipality may adopt seismic rehabilitation plans that provide for phased completion of repairs that are designed to provide improved life safety but that may be less than the standards for new buildings. [Formerly 456.755; 1991 c.227 §2; 1991 c.310 §2; 1995 c.304 §1; 1995 c.400 §5; 1999 c.1045 §13; 1999 c.1082 §11; 2001 c.710 §8]

 

     455.022 Appropriation of program fees established by department rule. All moneys deposited to the Consumer and Business Services Fund that are derived pursuant to ORS 455.240 or 460.370, or from state building code or specialty code program fees for which the amounts are established by Department of Consumer and Business Services rule pursuant to ORS 455.020 (2), are continuously appropriated to the department for carrying out any of the duties, functions and powers of the department under ORS 455.240 or 460.310 to 460.370 or under a program for which a fee amount is established by department rule pursuant to ORS 455.020 (2), without regard to the source of the moneys. [2001 c.710 §2]

 

     Note: 455.022 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 455 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

     455.028 Interagency agreements. (1) The Department of Consumer and Business Services may enter into interagency agreements with the Construction Contractors Board for the board to perform duties on behalf of the department under ORS 446.566 to 446.646, 446.666 to 446.746, 479.510 to 479.945 or 480.510 to 480.670, this chapter or ORS chapter 447, 460 or 693 regarding:

     (a) Licenses, registrations and other authorizations; or

     (b) The construction, reconstruction, renovation, alteration or repair of structures.

     (2) Subject to the approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the affected advisory board, the department or advisory board may enter into an agreement with the Construction Contractors Board under this section regarding performance of advisory board duties by the Construction Contractors Board. An agreement described in this subsection is considered for purposes of this section to be an agreement between the department and the Construction Contractors Board.

     (3) An interagency agreement under this section may provide for the board to perform all or part of the duties described in the agreement within one or more municipalities, geographic areas described in agreements under ORS 455.185 or state building code administrative regions established as provided under ORS 455.042, or on a statewide basis. The director may use an agreement under this section for the purpose of ensuring adequate staff and resources as provided under ORS 455.192. Any board employees utilized to carry out an agreement under this section shall remain employees of the board without loss of seniority or reduction in pay or benefits, but the agreement may provide for the department to retain control over the final work product of the employees. An agreement under this section may not be used to avoid any provision of a collective bargaining agreement.

     (4) An interagency agreement under this section may provide for:

     (a) Good faith cooperation between the board and the department to enable the board and the department to carry out their respective duties under law or under the agreement;

     (b) The sharing of resources, including but not limited to the system described in ORS 455.095 and 455.097, equipment, systems, processes and records, documents and other information;

     (c) Using board and department information, including but not limited to complaints, reports, findings and orders, to carry out the laws that the board administers and enforces on behalf of the department;

     (d) Ensuring the security of information shared under the agreement;

     (e) Purchases by the board of supplies and equipment to carry out duties on behalf of the department, subject to the department’s reimbursement of the board;

     (5)(a) A financing agreement provided for as described in subsection (4)(f) of this section is exempt from ORS 283.085 to 283.092 and ORS chapter 286A.

     (b) Any department moneys accepted by the board as provided in subsection (4)(g) of this section must be identified and accounted for separately from any other moneys in the possession of or available to the board. Department moneys temporarily retained by the board, regardless of where kept or deposited, are moneys of the department. The retained moneys are not subject to any appropriation to the board, any authorization for or limitation on the expenditure of moneys by the board, any restriction on the source, use or transfer of board moneys or any judgment, lien or other claim against moneys of the board. Notwithstanding any requirement or limitation on the retention of moneys by a state agency, the retention of department moneys by the board under an interagency agreement described in this section shall be governed solely by the terms of the agreement.

     (6) An interagency agreement under this section may not:

     (a) Delegate the authority of the director to establish policies or to make a final determination on any matter;

     (b) Allow the board to hold department fee moneys in a board account under ORS 182.470 that does not allow for the separate tracking and accounting of those moneys;

     (c) Allow the board to hold department fee moneys past the end of the fiscal quarter in which the fee moneys were collected; or

     (d) Transfer department expenses to the board. [2015 c.110 §2]

     (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall coordinate, interpret and generally supervise the adoption, administration and enforcement of the state building code.

     (2) The director, with the approval of the appropriate advisory boards, shall adopt codes and standards, including regulations as authorized by ORS 455.020 governing the construction, reconstruction, alteration and repair of buildings and other structures and the installation of mechanical devices and equipment therein. The regulations may include rules for the administration and enforcement of a certification system for persons performing work under the codes and standards adopted under this subsection. However, this subsection does not authorize the establishment of a separate certification for performing work on low-rise residential dwellings.

     (3) The director, with the approval of the appropriate advisory boards, may amend such codes from time to time. The codes of regulations and any amendment thereof shall conform insofar as practicable to model building codes generally accepted and in use throughout the United States. If there is no nationally recognized model code, consideration shall be given to the existing specialty codes presently in use in this state. Such model codes with modifications considered necessary and specialty codes may be adopted by reference. The codes so promulgated and any amendments thereof shall be based on the application of scientific principles, approved tests and professional judgment and, to the extent that it is practical to do so, the codes shall be promulgated in terms of desired results instead of the means of achieving such results, avoiding wherever possible the incorporation of specifications of particular methods or materials. To that end the codes shall encourage the use of new methods, new materials and maximum energy conservation.

     (4) The director shall adopt rules requiring a journeyman plumber licensed under ORS chapter 693 or an apprentice plumber, as defined in ORS 693.010, who tests backflow assemblies to complete a state-approved training program for the testing of those assemblies.

     455.112 Elimination of unclear, duplicative, conflicting or inadequate provisions; rules. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may initiate the adoption of rules the director considers necessary to interpret, harmonize, streamline, adjust, promote consistency within, reduce confusion regarding, administer or enforce the state building code or any requirement for a license, registration, certification, endorsement or other authorization to perform work related to the administration and enforcement of the state building code when any provision of the state building code or a requirement for authorization to perform work is unclear, duplicative or in conflict with another or when the code or a requirement for authorization to perform work does not adequately address a project of a unique type or scope. The director must obtain the approval of the appropriate advisory boards prior to adopting a rule under this section. [2003 c.367 §2; 2013 c.110 §3]

     (d) A program to provide a division of the moneys recovered by the department with the municipality that initiated the charges, when a person charged with a violation as provided in subsection (2) of this section, other than a violation of a licensing requirement, requests a hearing and is assessed a penalty. One-half of the amounts recovered shall be paid to the municipality. The department shall keep an amount equal to its costs of processing the proceeding and collection expenses out of the remaining one-half and remit the balance, if any, to the municipality; and

     (e) A program to require municipalities to investigate violations of the department’s permit requirements for plumbing installations and services under the plumbing specialty code and for plumbing and electrical installations and services under the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code, and to:

     455.157 Process for municipal imposition of monetary penalties. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that enforcement of the state building code in a fair, equitable and uniform manner throughout this state is a matter of state concern.

     (2) If a municipality administers a building inspection program under ORS 455.148 or 455.150, a monetary penalty assessed under the program for a violation must be assessed as a civil penalty. This subsection does not prohibit a municipality from charging a violator an increased permit fee or investigative fee, seeking injunctive relief from a violation or taking any enforcement action that does not include a monetary penalty. This subsection does not limit the terms or conditions of any voluntary agreement for the resolution of a violation.

     (3) A municipality may not assess a civil penalty for a violation under a building inspection program unless the municipality provides to the party that is subject to the civil penalty:

     (a) Notice that:

     (A) Describes the alleged violation, including any relevant code provision numbers, ordinance numbers or other identifying references;

     (B) States that the municipality intends to assess a civil penalty for the violation and states the amount of the civil penalty;

     (C) States that the party may challenge the assessment of a civil penalty; and

ENERGY CONSERVATION

 

(Generally)

 

     455.490 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

     (1) The use of a consensus-based expedited review system for the uniform statewide adoption, implementation, application and enforcement of certain state building code requirements to promote energy efficiency and energy conservation will facilitate and expedite compliance with those state building code requirements by providing a comprehensive source for interpretation of requirements that integrate elements affecting a variety of specialty codes.

     (2) The establishment of a Construction Industry Energy Board as an advisory board to the Department of Consumer and Business Services is an appropriate means for furthering the goal of facilitating and expediting state building code compliance related to energy efficiency and energy conservation.

     (3) The creation of a Construction Industry Energy Board will improve state building code compliance with regard to energy efficiency and energy use standards by creating an additional body empowered to enforce those standards.

     (4) The reorganization of certain existing advisory boards and the realignment of code enforcement responsibilities will enable the Department of Consumer and Business Services to more effectively ensure compliance with state building code specialty codes by increasing the focus of appropriate technical expertise, making the advisory boards more responsive to inquiries regarding code requirements and streamlining code enforcement responsibilities. [2009 c.567 §1]

The director may recognize any training program certified by the director under ORS 455.723 or 455.725 for purposes of certifying an inspector to perform inspections throughout a building code administrative region. This subsection does not require a municipality administering and enforcing a building inspection program under ORS 455.148 or 455.150 to allow an inspector certified under this subsection who is not employed by the municipality to perform building inspections on behalf of the municipality.

     (4) In determining the appropriate experience, training or other qualifications for an inspector under ORS 455.720 or 455.723, the director shall consult with the appropriate advisory boards. The factors to be considered by the director may include, but need not be limited to:

     (3) If the director requires, by rule, an applicant for a particular certification to pass an examination prepared by a national organization, the applicant shall pay in addition to the fee required in subsection (2) of this section, the cost of the examination. If the director requires an applicant for certification to pass an examination administered by the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the department may charge the applicant an examination administration fee.

     (4) Upon determining that the applicant is qualified under ORS 455.715 to 455.740, the director shall issue a certificate or cause a certificate to be issued to the applicant.

     455.737 Experience and training outside Oregon; examination; rulemaking. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 455.720 (1), the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, by rule, shall adopt criteria for review of the experience and training in building inspection and building plan review acquired by a person outside the State of Oregon. The criteria shall be adopted in a manner that facilitates review of a person’s qualifications by a local building official.

     (2)(a) A local building official who wishes to employ a person who is not certified under ORS 455.735 as an inspector shall submit the person’s qualifications to the director. The director shall review the stated qualifications against the criteria adopted under subsection (1) of this section, including verification of experience and training. The director shall respond to the local building official in writing within 10 working days of receiving the applicant’s qualifications, stating whether the person meets the applicable criteria.

     (b) Upon application and payment of the required fee, the director shall allow a person whose qualifications meet the criteria adopted under subsection (1) of this section to sit for any examination necessary for the required certification. [1997 c.677 §2; 2005 c.758 §21d]

     455.815 Establishment of master builder programs; waiver of inspections; builder verification of performance. (1) Local government establishment of a master builder program is voluntary. A local government electing to establish or terminate a program shall notify the Department of Consumer and Business Services. If terminating a program, the local government must give the notice six months before the program terminates.

     (2) The Department of Consumer and Business Services may implement a master builder program in one or more geographic areas for which the department provides plan review or inspection services. A department decision to include an area as a participant in the program affects only those areas, and those reviews or inspections, for which the department provides services instead of a local government. The department shall notify a county prior to implementing a master builder program in areas of the county that are served by the department.

     (3) A local government may not allow an individual to perform the duties of a master builder unless the local government has a master builder program. The department may allow an individual to perform the duties of a master builder in any geographic area administered by the department.

     (4) A building official of a government having a master builder program may waive plan review elements by that government and may waive government performance of one or more of the required inspections identified by department rule, including but not limited to inspections described in subsection (6) of this section, if:

     (a) An individual certified as a master builder submits construction plans for a one or two family dwelling regulated by the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code; and

     (b) The building official determines that:

     (A) The work is not of a highly technical nature; and

     (B) There is no unreasonable potential risk to safety of the structure.

     (5) A building official may not waive government performance of plan review or required inspections for:

     (a) Special design applications that are complex and highly technical engineered systems; or

     (b) Unique building sites, including but not limited to sites containing geologic hazards such as landslide hazard areas, floodplains and wetlands.

     (6) Subject to subsections (3) to (5) of this section, a building official may allow a master builder to verify that the master builder has properly performed an installation on a project and, to the extent that inspection would duplicate the verification conducted by the master builder, may waive government performance of the following required inspections:

     (a) Drywall;

     (b) Footings and setbacks;

     (c) Foundation walls, Ufer grounding rods and rebar;

     (d) Insulation;

     (k) Wall sheathing nailing. [2001 c.406 §4; 2003 c.675 §40]

 

     Note: See note under 455.800.

 

     455.820 Plan review and verification; documentation; duties of building official; effect of waiver revocation. (1) A master builder must perform all plan review and required verifications for which government review or inspection has been waived by a building official. The master builder shall maintain copies of all documents and reports required by the government granting the waiver and provide those copies to the building official.

     (2) When waiving government performance of plan review or required inspections, a building official shall require the master builder to sign a form that specifically identifies each waiver and states that the master builder accepts the duty of performing the review and verifications. A master builder who accepts the duty of performing a review or verification remains responsible for that duty unless released by written and signed permission of the building official. A building official may release a master builder from a review or verification duty by a written and signed assumption of the review or inspection duty by the building official or written and signed assumption of the review and verification duty by another master builder.

     (3) A building official for a government that has a master builder program:

     (a) Must conduct inspections of at least 10 percent of projects that are built under a master builder program;

     (b) May revoke a waiver for a plan review or required inspection if the master builder fails to properly perform, or document performance of, review or verification duties; and

     (c) Must notify the Department of Consumer and Business Services when the official revokes a waiver pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.

     (4) When revoking a waiver, a building official shall provide the master builder with a release under subsection (2) of this section from future performance of review or verification duties. A release does not relieve a master builder from liability for the failure to perform, or document performance of, review or verification duties prior to the revocation of the waiver.

     (5) A government having a master builder program has no legal duty with regard to plan review or required inspections properly waived under ORS 455.815 and accepted by a master builder in a signed form described under subsection (2) of this section. This subsection does not release a government from a duty arising due to a waiver revocation under subsection (3) of this section or an assumption under subsection (2) of this section.

     (6) A local government may refuse to grant recognition to a certified master builder if a waiver granted to the master builder under that government’s master builder program has been revoked pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section. If a waiver is revoked pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section, a local government or building official may send a recommendation to the department for action against the master builder who was granted the waiver. The local government or building official may also send the department any information supporting the recommendation. [2001 c.406 §5]
