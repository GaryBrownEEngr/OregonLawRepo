The governing body of the city or the county shall also elect to have the powers of a housing authority exercised in any one of the two ways provided in ORS 456.095 (1). [Amended by 1969 c.630 §2; 1975 c.322 §1]

 

      456.080 Determination of need for housing authority.

The governing body of the city or county shall order the election when a petition is filed as provided in this section.

      (2) A petition under this section must state that there is a need for a housing authority to function.

      (3) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the requirements for preparing, circulating and filing a petition under this section shall be as provided for an initiative petition:

      (a) In the case of a county, in ORS 250.165 to 250.235.

      (b) In the case of a city, in ORS 250.265 to 250.346.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 250.325, a city governing body shall submit the question to the electors without first considering its adoption or rejection.

      (5) If ORS 250.155 makes ORS 250.165 to 250.235 inapplicable to a county or if ORS 250.255 makes ORS 250.265 to 250.346 inapplicable to a city, the requirements for preparing, circulating and filing a petition under this section shall be as provided for an initiative petition under the county or city charter or an ordinance adopted under the county or city charter.

      (6) An election under this section shall be conducted under ORS chapters 246 to 260, and:

      (a) In the case of a city, must be held on a date specified in ORS 221.230.

      (b) In the case of a county, must be held on a date specified in ORS 203.085.

      (7) If the electors voting at the election favor the functioning of the housing authority, the governing body shall declare that there is need for such housing authority to function.

      (8) The question of need shall not again be submitted at any election within one year immediately following the election at which the question was voted upon. [Amended by 1983 c.350 §275]

 

      456.085 Adopting resolution declaring need for authority. The governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is need for a housing authority in the city or county, if it finds that there exists a need for additional safe, decent and sanitary affordable housing for persons or families of lower income. [Amended by 1973 c.672 §5; 1995 c.445 §5]

 

      456.090 Sufficiency of resolution; copy as evidence. (1) In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of authority, the authority is conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority. The resolution is deemed sufficient if it declares that there is a need for an authority and finds that the condition described in ORS 456.085 exists in the city or county, in substantially the terms used in that subsection, no further detail being necessary.

      (2) A copy of such resolution duly certified by the clerk shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding. [Amended by 1995 c.445 §15]

 

      456.095 Appointment and qualification of commissioners of housing authorities. (1) When the governing body of a city or county adopts a resolution pursuant to ORS 456.085, the governing body may then elect to have the powers of a housing authority under this chapter, ORS chapter 455 and ORS 446.515 to 446.547 exercised in any of the following ways:

      (a) Appointing by resolution, a commission composed of five, seven or nine persons.

      (b) Declaring, by resolution, that the governing body, itself, shall exercise the powers of a housing authority under this chapter, ORS chapter 455 and ORS 446.515 to 446.547. A governing body that exercises the powers of a housing authority may appoint at least one but not more than two additional commissioners for the housing authority. An appointed commissioner has the same authority as other housing authority commissioners, but may not exercise any powers of the governing body. At least one appointed commissioner must be a resident who receives direct assistance from the housing authority. The second appointed commissioner, if any, at a minimum must live within the jurisdiction of the authority. An appointed commissioner serves a term of office equal in length to the terms of office for governing body members, but not more than four years. An appointed commissioner may be removed only for cause as described in ORS 456.110 or if the commissioner ceases to meet the requirements for being an appointed commissioner. In the event that a housing authority commission consisting of the governing body of a city and one or more appointed commissioners has an even number of members, the mayor shall be included as a member of the commission for the housing authority. An act of a governing body exercising the powers of a housing authority is an act of the commission for the housing authority only and not of the governing body.

      (2) When the governing bodies of two or more authorities join and cooperate with one another and create a regional authority to exercise all the powers conferred by the Housing Authorities Law, as authorized by ORS 456.140, the governing bodies of the cooperating cities and counties shall by resolution appoint a commission for the regional authority consisting of nine persons. The cooperating cities and counties shall each appoint an equal number of the nine commissioners. If nine divided by the number of joining or cooperating cities and counties produces a fraction, then the commissioners appointed by such cities and counties shall appoint one commissioner so that nine commissioners in all are appointed. The nine commissioners appointed by or on behalf of cities or counties may appoint at least one but not more than two additional commissioners for the housing authority. At least one additional commissioner must be a resident who receives direct assistance from the housing authority. The second additional commissioner, if any, at a minimum must live within the jurisdiction of the authority. The term of office for an additional commissioner is equal to the term of office for a commissioner appointed by or on behalf of cities or counties. An additional commissioner may be removed only for cause as described under ORS 456.110 or if the person ceases to meet the requirements for being an additional commissioner.

      (3) A commissioner of an authority may not be an officer or employee of any city or county for which the authority is created, unless the commissioner is a member of the governing body or one of the governing bodies.

      (4) Persons appointed to the commission shall include a variety of occupations. At least one commissioner, but not more than two commissioners, appointed under subsection (1)(a) of this section must be a resident who receives direct assistance from the housing authority.

      (5) A governing body shall adopt a resolution for the appointment or reappointment of a commissioner. A governing body resolution is conclusive evidence that the commissioner was properly appointed.

      456.105 Organization; officers; quorum; employees; legal services. (1) A majority of the commissioners of an authority shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes.

This section does not allow the removal of a member of a governing body exercising power as a housing authority. A commissioner shall not be removed until after the commissioner has been given a copy of the charges at least 10 days prior to the hearing thereon and had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. In the event of the removal of any commissioner, a record of the proceedings, together with the charges and findings thereon, shall be filed in the office of the clerk for each city and county in the authority.

      (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the leasehold interest of a tenant appointed to the board or commission under ORS 456.095 shall not be considered an interest in a project, property or contract if the leasehold interest is granted on the same basis and is subject to the same terms and conditions as other leasehold interests of other tenants of the authority. A tenant-commissioner shall refrain from voting on any action that affects the individual interest of the tenant-commissioner as distinguished from the interests of tenants as a class.

      (3) If any commissioner or employee of an authority owns or controls an interest in any property included or planned to be included in any housing project, the commissioner or employee immediately shall disclose the same in writing to the authority. Such disclosure shall be entered upon the minutes of the authority. Failure so to disclose such interest shall constitute misconduct in office.

Any housing authority may bring a civil suit to enjoin a violation of this section, regardless of whether the housing authority shows that the authority will suffer damage from the violation. [2007 c.606 §3]

      (2) By action or proceeding, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful, or the violation of any rights of the obligee. [Amended by 1979 c.284 §149]

 

      456.210 Power of authority to confer additional rights upon obligee. An authority, by its resolution, trust indenture, mortgage, lease or other contract, may confer upon any obligee holding or representing a specified amount in bonds, or holding a lease, the right, in addition to all rights that may otherwise be conferred, upon the happening of an event of default as defined in such resolution or instrument, by suit, action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction:

      (1) To cause possession of any housing project or any part thereof to be surrendered to an obligee.

      (2) To obtain the appointment of a receiver of any housing project of the authority or any part thereof and of the rents and profits therefrom.

      456.220 Exemption of property from process or judgment lien. All real property of an authority is exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an execution. No execution or other judicial process shall issue against such property nor shall any judgment against an authority be a charge or lien upon its real property. However, this section does not apply to or limit the right of obligees to foreclose or otherwise enforce any mortgage of an authority or the right of obligees to pursue any remedies for the enforcement of any pledge or lien given by an authority on its rents, fees or revenues.

The governing body of the city or county may, by resolution, transfer the powers and authority to act as the housing authority to itself. All duties and obligations of the governing body as the housing authority of the municipality shall thereafter be assumed and performed by the body to which such powers and authority are transferred. [1969 c.630 §1; 1975 c.322 §2; 1979 c.621 §17]

 

      456.235 Dissolution of housing authorities. (1) A housing authority may be dissolved upon a majority vote of its commissioners at any regular or special meeting of the commission whereof all the members of the commission have been notified. Except with the consent of the obligees of the housing authority to dissolution, no authority having outstanding bonds or indebtedness shall be dissolved unless the assets of the authority are sufficient to pay such bonds and indebtedness. A copy of the order or resolution of dissolution shall be filed with the clerk of the city or the county, as the case may be.

      (2) Upon dissolution of an authority, the property and assets thereof not required for the liquidation of indebtedness of the authority shall vest in or be paid over to the city or the county for which the authority was created or, where a regional authority is dissolved, be paid over to the cities and counties in the authority in proportion to the population within each cooperating city and county according to the most recent determination under ORS 190.510 to 190.610; provided, that if the housing project be located within an incorporated city, then such property and assets shall be paid over and delivered to such city, even though the authority may have been created by a county. Any moneys so received by the clerk shall be credited to the general fund of the city or the county, as the case may be.

      (3) After voting for dissolution the authority shall be dissolved for all purposes, excepting, there shall be allowed a period of not to exceed three years after said vote for the liquidation of indebtedness and final settlement of its affairs. [1953 c.716 §2; 1973 c.672 §16]

      (b) The contracts for many participating properties in this state that are publicly supported housing are about to expire or otherwise terminate. State and local governments need an effective process for assessing these expiring and terminating contracts and determining whether to assume ownership of the participating properties. The assessment and determination process should ensure appropriate statewide uniformity while maintaining local flexibility. The process should also ensure the rights of property owners and tenants to fair treatment as the contracts expire.

      (2) ORS 456.255 to 456.265 are intended to provide a framework for addressing the withdrawal of participating property from publicly supported housing. [1999 c.275 §2; 2017 c.608 §2]

      (d) Refrain from taking any action, other than notifying the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or other party to the contract of the owner’s intention to not renew the contract or to withdraw the participating property from publicly supported housing, that would preclude a qualified purchaser from succeeding to the contract or negotiating with the owner for the purchase of the property.

      (2) A local government is entitled to notice under this section if the participating property is located within the boundaries of the local government.

      (3) If the property owner does not comply with the notice requirements under subsection (1) of this section, the property owner shall extend the affordability restriction on the participating property by the number of months that the property owner is in noncompliance with the notice requirements under subsection (1) of this section and immediately provide notice to the Housing and Community Services Department and each local government that is entitled to notice of the extension of the affordability restriction pursuant to this section together with the notice required under subsection (1) of this section.

      (c) Make application to the Housing and Community Services Department requesting that a local subsidy program be included in the definition of publicly supported housing, as long as the program otherwise complies with and is not excluded from the definition of publicly supported housing.

      (6) Any notices provided under subsection (1)(a) of this section shall specify whether the owner:

      (a) Intends to withdraw the participating property from publicly supported housing.

      (b) Intends to convert the participating property to a nonparticipating use.

The property owner shall accept the first matching offer the property owner receives from a qualified purchaser under this section.

      (c) A qualified purchaser’s offer is a matching offer if it is on the same terms and conditions as the third party’s offer to purchase but for modifications to ensure compliance with subsection (2) of this section, unless those terms and conditions are modified by mutual consent among the qualified purchaser and the property owner.

      Note: 456.270 to 456.295 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 456 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      456.275 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) There is a serious shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing available and affordable to low and moderate income households in the State of Oregon.

      (2) The inadequacy in the supply of decent, safe and sanitary affordable housing endangers the public health and jeopardizes the public safety and general welfare of the state.

      (3) To obtain the benefits of covenants and restrictions that seek to preserve and maintain affordable housing, the Legislative Assembly authorizes the creation and enforcement of affordable housing covenants. [2007 c.691 §1]

 

      Note: See note under 456.270.

 

      456.280 Covenant creation, effect, conveyance, duration and termination. (1) A person may create an affordable housing covenant as a condition of giving or receiving a subsidy during ownership or upon conveying real property, in the form of a covenant, servitude, easement, condition or restriction in a deed, declaration, land sale contract, trust deed, mortgage, security agreement, assignment, will, trust, rental agreement, lease or other written instrument that is:

      (a) Executed by the owner of the real property and the covenant holder; and

      (b) Recorded in the deed and mortgage records of the county in which the real property is located.

      (2) The affordable housing covenant creates a real property right in an eligible covenant holder to:

      (a) Limit the use of real property to occupancy by low or moderate income households in rental or owner-occupied housing;

      (b) Restrict the rental rate or sale price of real property to ensure affordability by future low and moderate income households;

      (c) Limit, restrict or condition the use and enjoyment of real property to create or retain rental or owner-occupied affordable housing for occupancy by low or moderate income households; or

      (d) Purchase real property at a trustee’s sale under terms set forth in ORS 86.782.

      (3) The affordable housing covenant may be conveyed, assigned, modified or terminated by a written instrument recorded in the deed and mortgage records of the county in which the real property is located. The affordable housing covenant may be:

      (a) Conveyed or assigned by a written instrument executed by the conveying or assigning covenant holder and the accepting covenant holder;

      (b) Modified by a written instrument executed by the covenant holder and the owner of the real property; or

      (c) Terminated by a written instrument executed by the covenant holder and a third party with the right to enforce the covenant.

      (4) An affordable housing covenant is not invalid because a holder of the covenant is not an eligible covenant holder. A covenant holder who is not an eligible covenant holder may not modify, terminate or commence an action to enforce the covenant. However, the covenant holder may convey or assign the covenant to an eligible covenant holder who may modify or terminate the covenant or commence an action to enforce the covenant.

      (5) An affordable housing covenant is unlimited in duration unless:

      (a) The instrument creating the covenant provides otherwise;

      (b) The duration of the covenant is modified before the stated term of the covenant expires; or

      (c) The covenant is terminated.

      (6) Upon termination of an affordable housing covenant for any reason before the stated term of the covenant expires, the covenant holder is entitled to receive the difference between the fair market value of the real property immediately before termination and the fair market value of the real property immediately after termination.

      (7) An affordable housing covenant does not impair an interest in real property that exists at the time the affordable housing covenant is created unless the owner of the interest is a party to the affordable housing covenant, subordinates the interest to the affordable housing covenant or otherwise agrees to be bound by the affordable housing covenant.

      (8) An instrument that creates an affordable housing covenant may grant the eligible covenant holder, or a designee of the eligible covenant holder, a right to enter the real property to ensure compliance with the covenant and, if the right is granted, the instrument shall designate the time and manner in which the eligible covenant holder or designee may enter the real property.

      (9) An affordable housing covenant holder may assign a third-party right of enforcement, by a written instrument executed by the covenant holder and recorded in the deed and mortgage records of the county in which the real property is located, to a person that qualifies as an eligible covenant holder but that is not the holder of that covenant.

      (10) An affordable housing covenant is automatically terminated if:

      456.290 Validity of covenant. (1) An affordable housing covenant is valid and enforceable even though the covenant is not of a character traditionally recognized at common law or is inconsistent with a common law doctrine of real property law that might invalidate, impair enforcement of or cause the termination of the covenant, including but not limited to common law doctrine that holds that:

      (a) The covenant is not appurtenant to an interest in the real property.

      (b) The covenant imposes a negative burden.

      (c) The covenant imposes affirmative obligations upon the owner of an interest in the burdened real property or the eligible covenant holder.

      (d) The covenant is held by an eligible covenant holder that does not have an interest in the real property that is benefited by enforcement of the covenant against the burdened property.

      (e) The benefit of the covenant does not touch or concern real property in any other way.

      (f) There is no privity of estate or privity of contract.

      (g) The covenant can be or has been conveyed or assigned to a covenant holder.

      (h) The covenant is an unreasonable restraint on alienability.

      (i) The covenant is a clog on the equity of redemption.

      (j) The covenant lacks adequate consideration.

      (2) An affordable housing covenant is valid and enforceable even if the covenant violates the rule against perpetuities set forth in ORS 105.950 to 105.975.

      (3) If a court denies equitable enforcement of an affordable housing covenant because of a change of circumstances that renders the covenant not in the public interest, the court may award damages as the only remedy in an action to enforce the affordable housing covenant.

      (4) The court may not use a comparative economic test as a basis for a determination that an affordable housing covenant is not in the public interest. [2007 c.691 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 456.270.

RURAL RENTAL HOUSING LOANS

      456.500 Legislative findings; required notice of loan maturity; mailing; consequences of failure to provide notice. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) There is a significant number of rental properties in this state whose owners have obtained rural rental housing loans from Rural Development or the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture under 7 C.F.R. 3560. Many of these rental properties contain rental units in which very low, low and moderate income families, elderly persons and persons with disabilities live and receive federal rental assistance.

      (b) Beginning in 2015, many of the mortgage loans made to the owners of these rental properties will mature and federal rental assistance to tenants residing on the premises of these rental properties will no longer be available.

      (c) Currently, there is no legal mechanism in place requiring the owners of these rental properties to provide notice of loan maturity to tenants, the Housing and Community Services Department, housing authorities as defined in ORS 456.005 and local governments.

      (d) Requiring notice at least one year before maturity of a loan described in paragraph (a) of this subsection would provide:

      (A) Tenants with time to locate alternative housing and rental assistance; and

      (B) The Housing and Community Services Department, housing authorities and local governments with time to work with Rural Development or the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture to develop arrangements that will protect the housing status of existing tenants.

      (2) The owner of any rental property that has received a rural rental housing loan from Rural Development or the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture under 7 C.F.R. 3560 shall provide written notice by first class mail with postage prepaid and by posting in a common area on the rental property notice of all of the following:

      (a) The date upon which the loan matures;

      (b) That federal rental assistance will no longer be available after the date of loan maturity with respect to the rental property that includes the premises on which the tenants reside; and

      (c) That there may be other program use restrictions and rent controls that expire after the date of loan maturity.

      (3) The notice required by subsection (2) of this section must be mailed to:

      (a) Any tenant residing on the premises of the rental property that is the subject of the loan, mailed to the street address of the premises on which the tenant resides, on or after the date that is one year before the date of loan maturity;

      (b) The Director of the Housing and Community Services Department;

      (c) The local housing authority as defined in ORS 456.375 that is located in the county or area of operation in which the rental property is located; and

AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

 

      456.502 Affordable Housing Land Acquisition Revolving Loan Program; rules. (1) The Affordable Housing Land Acquisition Revolving Loan Program is established within the Housing and Community Services Department.

The department may contract with a qualifying nonprofit organization to serve in a fiduciary capacity as program administrator.

      (2) The department or the program administrator, with the department’s approval, may make loans to eligible organizations to purchase land on which to develop affordable housing and to build facilities intended to provide supportive services to affordable housing residents and low income households in the nearby community.

      (4) Each eligible organization must include in the organization’s loan application a proposed affordable housing development plan that indicates the number of affordable housing units planned, a description of any other facilities that are being considered for the property and an estimated timeline for completion of the development. The department or the department’s program administrator may require additional information from eligible organizations and may consider the efficient use of land, project readiness, organizational capacity and other factors as criteria in making loans.

      (5) Forty percent of loans made by the program shall go to eligible organizations operating home ownership programs for low income households. If the entire 40 percent cannot be loaned to the types of eligible organizations described in this subsection, the remainder may be loaned to other eligible organizations under subsection (6) of this section.

      (6) Sixty percent of loans shall be made to eligible organizations not described in subsection (5) of this section.

      (7) Within five years of receiving a loan, a loan recipient must present the department or the program administrator with an updated development plan, including a proposed development design, committed and anticipated additional financial resources to be dedicated to the development and an estimated development schedule that indicates completion of the development within eight years of receipt of the loan. The updated development plan must be substantially consistent with the development plan submitted as part of the original loan application required in subsection (4) of this section.

      (8) Within eight years of receiving a loan under this section, a loan recipient must complete development of affordable housing on the property for which the loan was made and place the affordable housing into service.

      (9) A loan recipient must preserve the affordable housing developed on the property acquired under this section as affordable housing for a minimum of 30 years.

      (10)(a) If a loan recipient does not place affordable housing into service on a property for which a loan was received under this section within the eight-year period specified in subsection (8) of this section, or if a loan recipient fails to use the property for the intended affordable housing purpose consistent with the loan recipient’s original affordable housing development plan, the loan recipient must pay to the department an amount consisting of the principal of the original loan plus compounded interest calculated at the current market rate. The department shall develop guidelines for the time period in which this repayment must take place and include the time period in the original loan agreement entered into with the loan recipient. The department may grant a partial or total exemption from this repayment requirement if the department determines that a development is substantially complete or that the property has been substantially used as described in the original affordable housing development plan.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “current market rate” means the current average market interest rate that is determined at the time any individual loan is closed upon using a widely recognized current market interest rate measurement to be selected for use by the department or by the program administrator, with the approval of the department. This interest rate must be noted in an attachment to the closing documents for each loan.

      (11) The department, or the program administrator with the approval of the department, may adopt guidelines and requirements that are necessary to administer the program.

      (12) Interest rates on loans granted under this section may not exceed one percent.

      (13) The department, or the program administrator with the approval of the department, must develop performance measures for the program, including at a minimum measures related to:

      (b) The total number of dwelling units by housing type and the total number of low income households and persons served; and

      (c) The financial efficiency of the program as demonstrated by certain factors, including the cost per unit developed for affordable housing units in different areas of this state and a measure of the effective use of funds to produce the greatest number of units for low income households.

      (15) For purposes of this section, “low income household” has the meaning given that term in ORS 456.270.

      (16) The department shall adopt rules to implement and carry out the provisions of this section. [2017 c.666 §1]

      456.655 When bonds not to be issued; debt service reserve; bond declaration. (1) Bonds may be secured additionally by a pledge of amounts in the capital reserve account if provided in the housing finance bond declaration authorizing their issuance. The State Treasurer shall not issue bonds secured by a pledge of amounts in the capital reserve account unless the amount then on deposit in the capital reserve account, together with the amount of the proceeds of the bonds to be deposited in the account, is equal to or greater than the required debt service reserve. Subject to existing agreements with bondholders, the required debt service for any issue reserve shall be, as determined in the housing finance bond declaration, either (i) the maximum or (ii) the average of the amounts payable as annual debt service on all outstanding bonds secured by a pledge of amounts in the capital reserve account in any one fiscal year during the remaining term of such bonds. The annual debt service is an amount equal to the aggregate of:

      (a) All interest payable during the fiscal year on all bonds secured by a pledge of amounts in the capital reserve account outstanding on the date of computation; and

      (b) The principal amount of such bonds maturing during the same fiscal year; and

      (c) All amounts as specified in any housing finance bond declaration or in any contract with bondholders as payable during such fiscal year as a sinking fund payment with respect to any bond issues as the Housing and Community Services Department has determined a debt service shall be required which mature after such fiscal year.

      (2) The required debt service reserve shall be calculated on the assumption that bonds will after the date of computation cease to be outstanding by reason of payment of the bonds when due at their respective maturity, and upon application, in accordance with the resolution or any contract with bondholders, of all sinking fund payments payable at or after such date of computation. However, the department may, at the time of issuance of additional bonds, deposit in the capital reserve account, from the proceeds of the additional bonds to be issued, or other sources, an amount, which, together with the amount then in such fund will be not less than the maximum required debt service reserve.

      (3) No bonds shall be issued by the State Treasurer unless they are part of an issue described in a written instrument signed by the Director of the Housing and Community Services Department and filed in the office of the State Treasurer. Each instrument shall set forth or otherwise determine or provide for the date of the bonds, the amount, the maturity or maturities, the rate or rates of interest, the form of bonds, the place of payment, registration provisions, terms of redemption, and time, place and manner of sale of the issue. Each instrument, when the State Treasurer shall have certified approval thereon, shall be known as a “housing finance bond declaration.” Each housing finance bond declaration shall be deemed to be and shall constitute conclusive proof of the authorization to issue the bonds therein described and may contain such further pledges and provisions concerning bonds. The State Treasurer and the director of the department shall have and exercise all powers necessary or incidental to carry out the purposes of this subsection. [1973 c.828 §13; 1975 c.154 §3; 1983 c.519 §5]

No more than $10 million of the bonds authorized under this section or proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be made available for residential loans for home improvements.

      (2) ORS 286A.095 applies for purposes of determining limitations under this section.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Pursuant to ORS 456.515 to 456.725, the Housing and Community Services Department has served as the sole department or instrumentality of the state authorized to coordinate and establish statewide priorities for housing programs and to provide planning and technical assistance to sponsors of housing for persons and families of lower income throughout the state.

      (2) All obligations issued by the State Treasurer under ORS 456.548 to 456.725 shall not constitute a debt, liability or general obligation of this state or any political subdivision thereof or a pledge of the faith and credit of this state or any such political subdivision, but shall be payable solely from the revenues or assets of the department acquired pursuant to ORS 456.548 to 456.725. Each obligation issued under ORS 456.548 to 456.725 shall contain on the face thereof a statement that the department shall not be obligated to pay the same nor the interest thereon except from the revenues or assets pledged therefor and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of this state or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such obligation.

      (3) All bonds issued by the State Treasurer under ORS 456.548 to 456.725 shall be fully negotiable.

Moneys in the account may not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of moneys in the account below the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing and becoming due in the succeeding fiscal year on all such bonds then outstanding, except for the purpose of paying principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the bonds of the department maturing and becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys in the Housing Finance Fund are not available.

      (5) In order to assure the continual operation and maintenance of the capital reserve account in the Housing Finance Fund and to carry out ORS 456.548 to 456.725, if the amount of money on deposit in the capital reserve account in any year is less than the debt service reserves described in ORS 456.655 (1), the Director of the Housing and Community Services Department shall certify to the Governor and the Legislative Assembly or, during the interim, to the Emergency Board the amount needed to restore the account to its required debt service reserves. The amount so certified by the director may be appropriated by the Legislative Assembly or, during the interim, allocated by the Emergency Board and paid to the department during the then current fiscal year for deposit in the capital reserve account.

      (6) For the purposes of this section, the department shall annually value investments in the capital reserve account at the amortized cost of the investments.

      (10) The department may enter into agreements regarding use of moneys received for the Housing Development Account with the source of the moneys, and may comply with the provisions of such agreements. [1973 c.828 §27; 1975 c.97 §1; 1975 c.154 §6; 1987 c.567 §3; 1989 c.966 §51; 1995 c.79 §267; 2007 c.783 §203a]

 

      456.722 Preferences in funding grants to low-income housing providers; rules. (1)(a) The Housing and Community Services Department shall, when awarding public funds for low-income rental housing, give a substantial preference to low-income housing providers that do not require applicants for such housing to have net income greater than two times the rent.

      (b) As used in this section, “public funds” includes all low-income rental housing grants, loans or tax credits administered or awarded by the department, whether state, federal or otherwise, but does not include funds derived from the sale of bonds by the department.

      (c) Enforcement of the preference following an award of funds shall be by complaint to the department.

      (2) The department shall adopt any rules necessary to implement this section. [1997 c.577 §41]

(Bonding)

 

      456.723 Legislative finding on bonding authority of department. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) There exists a shortage of safe, affordable and readily available housing in this state, particularly for people of low income, fixed income or modest means.

      (2) It is in the best interests of the people of this state to insure that there is an adequate supply of housing for people of all income levels, particularly low-income people, in order to reduce:

      (a) The number of people who are homeless or who live in inadequate housing in this state; and

      (b) Dependence on various state services that exist because of the needs created by homelessness and inadequate housing.

      (3) The Housing and Community Services Department’s authority to issue bonds is an effective tool that will increase funds available to provide safe, affordable housing and reduce homelessness in this state. [1989 c.719 §1]
