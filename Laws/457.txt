      Note: 457.445 was reorganized and amended by section 8, chapter 580, Oregon Laws 2019. References to 457.445 in 457.010 do not reflect the reorganization and amendments. Editorial adjustment of 457.010 for the reorganization and amendments to 457.445 has not been made.

 

      457.020 Declaration of necessity and purpose. It hereby is found and declared:

      (1) That there exist within the state blighted areas.

      (2) That such areas impair economic values and tax revenues.

      (3) That such areas cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state and that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health, safety and welfare, fire and accident protection and other public services and facilities.

      (4) That certain blighted areas may require acquisition and clearance since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation, but other areas or portions thereof may be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such manner that the conditions and evils mentioned in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section may be eliminated, remedied or prevented and that such areas should, if possible, be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas.

      (5) That the acquisition, conservation, rehabilitation, redevelopment, clearance, replanning and preparation for rebuilding of these areas, and the prevention or the reduction of blight and its causes, are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern.

      (6) That there are also certain areas where the condition of the title, the diverse ownership of the land to be assembled, the street or lot layouts or other conditions prevent a proper development of the land, and that it is in the public interest that such areas, as well as blighted areas, be acquired by eminent domain and made available for sound and wholesome development in accordance with a redevelopment or urban renewal plan, and that the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the financing of the acquisition and preparation of land by a public agency for such redevelopment or urban renewal is likewise a public use and purpose.

      (7) That redevelopment and urban renewal activities will stimulate residential construction which is closely correlated with general economic activity; that undertakings authorized by this chapter will aid the production of better housing and more desirable neighborhood and community development at lower costs and will make possible a more stable and larger volume of residential construction, which will assist materially in maintaining full employment.

      (8) That the necessity in the public interest for this chapter is a matter of legislative determination. [Amended by 1957 c.456 §2; 1979 c.621 §11]

 

      457.025 Powers supplemental to other laws. The powers conferred by this chapter are in addition and supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law. [Formerly 457.110]

      (2) By appointing a board or commission composed of not less than three members.

      (3) By the governing body, itself, provided, however, that any act of the governing body acting as the urban renewal agency shall be, and shall be considered, the act of the urban renewal agency only and not of the governing body. [Formerly 457.140]

All duties and obligations of the urban renewal agency shall thereafter be assumed by the body to which those powers are transferred. [1979 c.621 §16 (enacted in lieu of 457.145)]

      457.075 Termination of urban renewal agency.

The termination of an urban renewal agency shall not affect any outstanding legal actions, contracts or obligations of the agency and the municipality shall be substituted for the agency and, for the purpose of those legal actions, contracts or obligations, shall be considered a continuation of the urban renewal agency and not a new entity. No urban renewal agency shall be terminated under this section unless all indebtedness to which a portion of taxes is irrevocably pledged for payment under ORS 457.420 to 457.470 is fully paid.

The additional notices required under ORS 457.120 are not required for an amendment adopted pursuant to this paragraph.

      (B) The maximum amount of indebtedness that may be issued or incurred under the plan, as determined for purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, shall be based upon good faith estimates of the scope and costs of projects, including but not limited to increases in costs due to reasonably anticipated inflation, in the existing urban renewal plan and the schedule for their completion as completion dates were anticipated as of December 5, 1996. The maximum amount of indebtedness shall be specified in dollars and cents.

      (C) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if a maximum amount of indebtedness is not adopted for an existing urban renewal plan as described in this paragraph before July 1, 1998, the urban renewal agency may not collect funds under ORS 457.435.

      (d) Beginning July 1, 2010, the dollar limits set forth in this subsection may be increased on July 1 of each year by the index used in the urban renewal report to compute the future costs of projects that will be financed under the plan.

      (e) The limits in this subsection do not apply if the agency obtains concurrence as provided in ORS 457.470. [1957 c.456 §14; 1991 c.459 §333; 1997 c.541 §446; 2007 c.606 §12; 2009 c.700 §1]

      (a) The aggregate of all amendments under this subsection may not exceed 20 percent of the plan’s initial maximum indebtedness, as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) For purposes of computing the 20 percent limit on increases in maximum indebtedness, the initial maximum indebtedness may be increased annually on the anniversary date of initial approval of the plan by the index used in the urban renewal report to compute the future costs of projects that will be financed under the plan, beginning on the later of July 1, 1999, or the first anniversary of plan approval. This increase may be applied only to the first amendment to the maximum indebtedness that is made on or after January 1, 2010.

      (5) The limits in subsection (4) of this section do not apply if the agency obtains concurrence as provided in ORS 457.470. [1957 c.456 §9; 1979 c.621 §20; 2009 c.700 §2; 2019 c.580 §9]

      (B) The urban renewal areas of the plan when added to the areas included in other urban renewal plans of the municipality providing for a division of ad valorem taxes, exceed a figure equal to 15 percent of the total land area of that municipality.

      (b) For municipalities having a population of less than 50,000, according to the latest state census:

      (A) The assessed value for the urban renewal areas of the plan, when added to the total assessed value previously certified by the assessor for other urban renewal plans of the municipality for which a division of ad valorem taxes is provided, exceeds a figure equal to 25 percent of the total assessed value of that municipality, exclusive of any increased assessed value for other urban renewal areas and without regard to adjustments made pursuant to ORS 457.435 (2)(c), 457.455 or 457.470 (2) to (5); or

      (2) Wherever only a part of an urban renewal area is located in a taxing district, the assessor also shall show in the statement required by subsection (1) of this section the assessed value of the real and personal property in the part of the urban renewal area located in the taxing district.

      (3) One copy of the certified statement shall be filed by the assessor with the agency and the other copy shall constitute a part of the public records of the county assessor’s office.

      (4) Whenever a part of an urban renewal area comes within the territory of a taxing district either by annexation, incorporation of a new taxing district or consolidation, after the approval of a plan containing a provision authorized by ORS 457.420, the county assessor shall in the same manner as under subsection (3) of this section file a certified statement or an amendment to a certified statement to show the assessed value of the real and personal property in that part of the urban renewal area incorporated by annexation or consolidation into the taxing district.

(1) For each existing urban renewal plan that includes a provision for a division of ad valorem taxes under ORS 457.420 to 457.470, the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency that is carrying out the plan shall adopt an ordinance choosing one of the options listed in subsection (2) of this section as the method of collecting ad valorem property taxes sufficient to pay, when due, indebtedness issued or incurred to carry out the plan as permitted by section 11 (16), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

      (2) The options referred to in subsection (1) of this section are as follows:

      (a) Option One: To collect amounts sufficient to pay the obligations, as budgeted for the plan, from ORS 457.440, and if the amount estimated to be received from ORS 457.440 is not sufficient to meet the budgeted obligations of the plan for the tax or fiscal year, to make a special levy in the amount of the remainder upon all of the taxable property of the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency and upon all of the taxable property lying outside the municipality but included in an urban renewal area of the plan.

      (b) Option Two: To make a special levy in the amount stated in the notice given under ORS 457.440 (2) upon all of the taxable property of the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency, and upon all of the taxable property lying outside the municipality but included in an urban renewal area of the plan.

      (c) Option Three: To collect an amount equal to the amount stated in the ordinance adopted as provided in subsection (1) of this section by dividing the taxes pursuant to ORS 457.440, and to make a special levy upon all of the taxable property of the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency and upon all of the taxable property lying outside the municipality but within an urban renewal area of the plan. The county assessor shall adjust the amount of the total assessed value included in the certified statement filed under ORS 457.430 so that the amount collected by dividing the taxes pursuant to ORS 457.440 does not exceed the amount stated in the ordinance to be collected by dividing the taxes pursuant to ORS 457.440.

      (3)(a) The total amount obtained under an option listed in subsection (2) of this section for any plan shall not exceed the maximum amount that could have been certified to the assessor for the plan under ORS 457.440 (1995 Edition) for the tax year beginning July 1, 1997.

      (b) For each tax year beginning after the 1997-1998 tax year, the limitation of paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be adjusted by a percentage change equal to the percentage change in the increment within the urban renewal area from the preceding year.

      (4)(a) The ordinance choosing the option referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be adopted no later than July 1, 1998, and shall be applicable for tax years beginning on or after July 1, 1998. If not so adopted, the municipality shall be considered to have chosen Option One as its method of collection of ad valorem property taxes sufficient to pay, when due, indebtedness issued or incurred to carry out the existing urban renewal plan. An option, once chosen, may not be changed to another option. In addition, if Option Three is chosen, the amount specified in the ordinance choosing the option to be collected by dividing the taxes pursuant to ORS 457.440 shall not be changed by subsequent ordinance or amendment to the certified statement.

      (b) The option chosen, together with the particulars of the option, including but not limited to any limit on the amount to be received from ORS 457.440, shall be reflected in the notice filed by the urban renewal agency with the county assessor.

      (5)(a) The county assessor, or county assessors if the taxable property is in more than one county, shall extend the special levy against all of the taxable property of the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency and all of the taxable property lying outside the municipality but included in an urban renewal area of the plan.

      (b) Any amounts collected from special levies made under this section shall be paid into the special fund or funds of the urban renewal agency referred to in ORS 457.440 (6) and shall be used to pay the principal and interest to finance or refinance the existing urban renewal plan or plans of the urban renewal agency.

      (6) This section applies to existing urban renewal plans with respect to principal and interest on indebtedness until the indebtedness is fully paid or it is found that deposits in the special fund are sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the indebtedness issued or incurred under the existing urban renewal plan.

      (7) Nothing in this section shall prevent the funding of urban renewal indebtedness as provided under ORS 457.440. [1997 c.541 §454; 1999 c.579 §32]

 

      457.437 Consultation with municipalities; resolution requirements. (1) Prior to the establishment of a maximum amount of indebtedness for an urban renewal plan under ORS 457.190 and before an option is adopted under ORS 457.435, the urban renewal agency that is carrying out the plan shall meet with the governing bodies of the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency and other municipalities affected by the urban renewal plan and review the proposed maximum amount of indebtedness for the plan and the agency’s recommended option under ORS 457.435.

      (2) After the meeting described in subsection (1) of this section, the governing bodies shall adopt resolutions in support of or opposition to the recommended option under ORS 457.435.

      (3) If an affected municipality adopts a resolution in opposition to the recommended option, then the agency’s recommendations may be adopted only by the adoption of a separate resolution by the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency. [1997 c.541 §454a]

      (c) If the municipality that activated the urban renewal agency has chosen Option Three as provided in ORS 457.435 (2)(c), the notice shall state the amount of funds to be raised by special levy in addition to the amount to be raised by dividing the taxes as stated in the ordinance adopted under ORS 457.435 (1).

      (d) For plans that are initially approved or substantially amended to increase maximum indebtedness on or after January 1, 2010, the notice must comply with ORS 457.470.

The decision of the municipality to limit the amount of funds to be included in the notice filed under subsection (2) of this section shall be reflected in the certified statement filed by the urban renewal agency with the county assessor.

      (4) Not later than September 25 of each tax year, the assessor of any county in which a joint district is located shall provide, to the assessor of each other county in which the joint district is located, the assessed values of the property in the joint district that is located within the county, including the certified statement value and the increment for each code area containing any urban renewal area located within the joint district, and a copy of the notice filed by the urban renewal agency for the area located within the joint district under subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) The maximum amount of funds that may be raised for an urban renewal plan by dividing the taxes as provided in Article IX, section 1c, of the Oregon Constitution, shall be computed by the county assessor as follows:

      (a) The county assessor shall compute, in the manner required under ORS 457.445, the total consolidated billing tax rate for each code area in which an urban renewal area of the plan is located.

      (b) The assessor shall determine the amount of taxes that would be produced by extending the tax rate computed under paragraph (a) of this subsection against the increment of each code area.

      (6)(a) The county assessor shall certify to the tax collector the amount of funds to be raised for an urban renewal agency as determined under subsection (2) of this section. The tax collector shall include the amount so certified in the percentage schedule of the ratio of taxes on property prepared under ORS 311.390 and filed with the county treasurer. Notwithstanding ORS 311.395 (6), the county treasurer shall credit the amount to the urban renewal agency and shall distribute its percentage amount to the urban renewal agency as determined by the schedule at the times other distributions are made under ORS 311.395 (7).

      (b) The county assessor shall notify the urban renewal agency of the amounts received under subsection (5) of this section or amounts received pursuant to the notice provided in subsection (2) of this section for each urban renewal plan area. Any amounts received by the urban renewal agency under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be attributed to the urban renewal plan in which the urban renewal area is included, shall be paid into a special fund of the urban renewal agency for the urban renewal plan and shall be used to pay the principal and interest on any indebtedness issued or incurred by the urban renewal agency to finance or refinance the urban renewal plan.

      (7) Unless and until the total assessed value of the taxable property in an urban renewal area exceeds the total assessed value specified in the certified statement, all of the ad valorem taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property in the urban renewal area shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing districts.

      (8) The agency may incur indebtedness, including obtaining loans and advances in carrying out the urban renewal plan, and the portion of taxes received under this section may be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the indebtedness.

      (9) The Department of Revenue shall by rule establish procedures for giving notice of amounts to be raised for urban renewal agencies and for determination of amounts to be raised and distributed to urban renewal agencies.

      (10) The notice required under this section shall serve as the notice required under ORS 310.060 for the special levy described under ORS 457.435.

      (11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a city with a population of more than 500,000 on January 1, 2010, may, in lieu of its urban renewal agency, take any actions that an urban renewal agency is authorized to take under this section and any other actions that are required to certify, collect, receive, hold and apply tax revenues raised for the urban renewal agency under Article IX, section 1c, of the Oregon Constitution, and taxes authorized for the urban renewal agency by Article XI, section 11 (16), of the Oregon Constitution.

      (C) State that the urban renewal agency has reasonably determined that excluding the post-2012 local option tax from the consolidated billing tax rate for the fiscal year under this subsection would impair contracts that the agency has entered into with owners of indebtedness incurred before October 7, 2013, to carry out the standard rate plan; and

      (D) Be signed by an authorized representative of the agency.

      (5)(a) The governing body of a municipality that adopted a standard rate plan, other than an existing urban renewal plan designated as an Option Three plan under ORS 457.435 (2)(c), may, by ordinance or resolution, irrevocably elect to become a reduced rate plan.

      (b) If the assessor is not provided notice of plan adoption or amendment changing area boundaries by the agency prior to January 1 before the tax year to which ORS 457.440 would otherwise first apply, then ORS 457.440 shall first apply to the assessment roll next following the assessment roll described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (2) When the principal and interest on the maximum indebtedness of an urban renewal plan to which the portion of taxes is irrevocably pledged for payment under ORS 457.435 or 457.440 is fully paid, or it is found that deposits in the special fund are sufficient to fully pay principal and interest on the maximum indebtedness either through direct payment of the indebtedness or by payment of principal and interest on bonds or notes issued to finance the indebtedness, the agency shall notify the assessor of that fact.

      (3) All moneys remaining unexpended from the special fund provided for in ORS 457.435 or 457.440, after payment of all the principal and interest on indebtedness is provided for, shall be turned over to the county treasurer by the agency and prorated by the treasurer back to the taxing districts in which the area, or part thereof, is located, in proportion to the amount of money in the fund attributable to each taxing district for the last fiscal year in which tax levy moneys were paid into the special fund of the agency under ORS 457.435 or 457.440. [1961 c.554 §6; 1971 c.426 §1; 1979 c.621 §27; 1991 c.459 §335b; 1997 c.541 §450; 2009 c.700 §5]

(1) If the maximum amount of funds under ORS 457.440 is not required to pay the principal and interest on indebtedness incurred for an urban renewal plan, the urban renewal agency may take formal action to limit collections under a plan for a single fiscal year, and may notify the county assessor pursuant to ORS 457.440 (2)(e) to compute the division of taxes for the urban renewal area using an assessed value that is equal to the amount specified by the agency. The assessor may not use an amount that is greater than the increment.

      (2) If the maximum amount of funds under ORS 457.440 is not required to pay the principal and interest on indebtedness incurred for an urban renewal plan, the urban renewal agency may limit future collections under a plan by notifying the county assessor to permanently increase the amount of the total assessed value included in the certified statement filed under ORS 457.430. The assessed value included in the certified statement may not be subsequently decreased except in connection with boundary changes.

      (3) Before taking formal action under this section, the urban renewal agency shall consult and confer with each taxing district affected by the urban renewal plan. [2009 c.700 §7]

      (B) 75 percent of the amount by which the assumed increment exceeds the assessed value of the increment the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greatest amount of division of tax revenues the agency was permitted to use in any prior year under this paragraph or paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (d) Beginning with the first year after the year described in paragraph (c) of this subsection in which the division of tax revenues equals or exceeds 10 percent of the initial maximum indebtedness in the plan, the agency shall notify the assessor pursuant to ORS 457.440 (2)(d) to compute the division of taxes for the urban renewal area using an amount of assessed value the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues that does not exceed 10 percent of the initial maximum indebtedness in the plan.

      (e) After computing the assessed value as required under paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this subsection, an agency shall further modify the value if, for reasons other than use of the assumed increment, the value included in the prior year’s notice to the assessor resulted in division of tax revenues different from the respective target amounts under paragraphs (b) to (d) of this subsection. The modification under this paragraph may not exceed an amount that would result in the difference between the actual revenues and the target amounts.

      (5)(a) As used in this subsection, “substantial amendment” refers to the first substantial amendment to increase maximum indebtedness for the urban renewal plan after January 1, 2010.

      (b) This subsection applies to an urban renewal plan that becomes a large metropolitan plan because it is substantially amended to increase its maximum indebtedness on or after January 1, 2010. This subsection applies beginning in the first year after the year in which the urban renewal plan is first amended to increase its maximum indebtedness on or after January 1, 2010. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) to (e) of this subsection, an urban renewal agency may notify the assessor to impose the maximum division of taxes.

      (c) In the first year following a year that the maximum division of taxes exceeds three percent of the maximum indebtedness in effect for the plan immediately before the substantial amendment, the agency shall notify the assessor pursuant to ORS 457.440 (2)(d) to compute the division of taxes for the urban renewal area using an assessed value that is not greater than the sum of:

      (A) The amount of assessed value the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greater of:

      (i) The transition amount; or

      (ii) Three percent of the maximum indebtedness in the plan immediately before the substantial amendment; and

      (B) 75 percent of the amount by which the assumed increment exceeds the assessed value of the increment the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greater of:

      (i) The transition amount; or

      (ii) Three percent of the maximum indebtedness in the plan immediately before the substantial amendment.

      (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this subsection, beginning with the year after the year described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the agency shall notify the assessor pursuant to ORS 457.440 (2)(d) to compute the division of taxes for the urban renewal area using an assessed value that is not greater than the sum of:

      (A) The amount of assessed value the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greatest amount of division of tax revenues the agency was permitted to use in any prior year to compute assessed value under this paragraph or paragraph (c) of this subsection; and

      (B) 75 percent of the amount by which the assumed increment exceeds the assessed value of the increment the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greatest amount of division of tax revenues the agency was permitted to use in any prior year under this paragraph or paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (e) Beginning with the first year after the year in which the division of tax revenues equals or exceeds the greater of the transition amount or 10 percent of the maximum indebtedness in effect for the plan immediately before the substantial amendment, the agency shall notify the assessor pursuant to ORS 457.440 (2)(d) to compute the division of taxes for the urban renewal area using an amount of assessed value that is not greater than an amount the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greater of the transition amount or 10 percent of the maximum indebtedness in effect for the plan immediately before the substantial amendment.

      (f) After computing the assessed value as required under paragraph (c), (d) or (e) of this subsection, an agency shall further modify the value if, for reasons other than use of the assumed increment, the value included in the prior year’s notice to the assessor resulted in division of tax revenues different from the respective target amounts under paragraphs (c) to (e) of this subsection. The modification under this paragraph may not exceed an amount that would result in the difference between the actual revenues and the target amounts.

      (6)(a) The initial maximum indebtedness for a large metropolitan plan that is initially approved after January 1, 2010, shall be established as provided in ORS 457.190 (4)(a) to (c).

      (b) Beginning in 2010, the dollar amounts in this subsection may be increased on July 1 of any year by the percent change in average construction costs since July 1, 2009, according to the Engineering News-Record Northwest (Seattle, Washington) Construction Cost Index. The adjusted dollar amounts may be used only when a large metropolitan plan is initially approved.

      (c) The maximum indebtedness may not be increased by more than 20 percent of the initial maximum indebtedness of the plan.

      (d) The maximum indebtedness for a plan that becomes a large metropolitan plan because it is substantially amended on or after January 1, 2010, to increase its maximum indebtedness may not be increased above 20 percent of the maximum indebtedness in effect for the plan immediately before the first substantial amendment to increase maximum indebtedness that was made on or after January 1, 2010.

      (7) Limitations imposed under this section and ORS 457.190 (4), 457.220 (4) and 457.455 do not apply to the extent the municipality approving a plan obtains the written concurrence of taxing districts imposing at least 75 percent of the amount of taxes imposed under permanent rate limits in the urban renewal area. For plans that are initially approved or substantially amended on or after January 1, 2010, compliance with this section is determined based on the amount of taxes imposed under permanent rate limits in the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the plan is approved or amended, as applicable.

      (8) For purposes of this section, a plan is treated as approved or amended on the day on which the municipality took final action to enact the nonemergency ordinance approving or amending the plan.

      (9) The amounts shown in the certified statement filed under ORS 457.430 are not affected by subsections (2) to (5) of this section. If the increment for an area is less than the assessed value that the assessor is directed to use under subsections (2) to (5) of this section, the division of taxes shall be computed based on the increment and the assessor shall impose the maximum division of taxes for the plan.

      (10)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, as used in this subsection, “transition amount” means the maximum division of taxes for the plan in the fiscal year that the first amendment made after June 1, 2008, to increase maximum indebtedness takes effect.

      (b) Notwithstanding any provisions in this section to the contrary, an urban renewal plan that was first approved in 1998 and had an initial maximum indebtedness of $224,780,350 may be substantially amended after June 1, 2008, to increase maximum indebtedness by not more than $343,719,650.

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, an urban renewal agency may notify the assessor to collect the maximum division of taxes for an urban renewal plan described in paragraph (b) of this subsection that is substantially amended to increase its maximum indebtedness after June 1, 2008.

      (d) Beginning with the first fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the first amendment made after June 1, 2008, to increase maximum indebtedness in the plan described in paragraph (b) of this subsection takes effect that the maximum division of taxes exceeds three percent of the maximum indebtedness in effect for the plan immediately after the first amendment made after June 1, 2008, to increase maximum indebtedness takes effect, the agency shall notify the assessor pursuant to ORS 457.440 (2)(d) to compute the division of taxes for the urban renewal area using an assessed value that is the sum of:

      (A) The amount of assessed value the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greater of:

      (i) The transition amount; or

      (ii) Three percent of the maximum indebtedness in effect for the plan immediately after the first amendment made after June 1, 2008, to increase maximum indebtedness takes effect; and

      (B) 75 percent of the amount by which the assumed increment exceeds the assessed value of the increment the agency estimates will produce division of tax revenues equal to the greater of:

      (i) The transition amount; or

      (ii) Three percent of the maximum indebtedness in effect for the plan immediately after the first amendment made after June 1, 2008, to increase maximum indebtedness takes effect.

      (e)(A) To the extent permitted by law, a plan amendment described in this subsection shall provide direct economic benefits to the county in which the plan’s urban renewal area is located in the following amounts:

      (i) If the plan is substantially amended to increase maximum indebtedness by $343,719,650 or more, at least $35,000,000.

      (ii) If the plan is amended to increase maximum indebtedness by less than $343,719,650, no less than 10.18 percent of any increase in maximum indebtedness.

      (B) Benefits required under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be paid as follows:

      (i) $10,000,000 no later than June 30, 2014; and

      (ii) The balance no later than June 30, 2021.

      (11)(a) The Director of the Department of Revenue shall adopt rules necessary to apportion assessed value among tax code areas in an urban renewal area for which the urban renewal agency has notified the assessor pursuant to this section or ORS 457.440 (2)(d) or 457.455 to compute the division of taxes.

      (b) The director may adopt any rule necessary or convenient for the imposition and collection of taxes under this section or ORS 457.455.

      (12) The taxing districts affected by the urban renewal plan and the urban renewal agency are not liable for any amount by which amounts intended to be collected pursuant to this section differ from the targeted amounts in subsections (2) to (5) of this section. The sole remedy for any difference is the agency’s modification of assessed value in subsequent years’ notices as provided in subsections (2)(d), (3)(d), (4)(e) and (5)(f) of this section.
