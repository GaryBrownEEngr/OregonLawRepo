HOUSING REVITALIZATION PROGRAM

:VS1.

 

      458.305 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) A critical shortage exists of suitable, affordable housing for households with an income below the median income. This shortage is particularly acute with respect to rental housing.

      (2) During the past half decade, the supply of rental housing that is affordable to households at or below the median income level has not kept pace with the demand.

      (3) The lack of suitable, affordable housing is a barrier to Oregon’s development.

      (4) It is in the economic and social interest of the state to encourage public agencies and private parties to efficiently expand the supply of housing in Oregon for households at or below the median income level.

      (5) The quantity of public resources available to support the expansion and rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing stock is limited. Consequently, it is the policy of this state to attempt to target the use of these resources so that a maximum amount of usable housing product is delivered to Oregon citizens at the minimum cost required for prudent program administration. [1989 c.1016 §1]

 

      458.310 Housing revitalization program; criteria; rules. (1) The Oregon Housing Stability Council shall adopt rules to develop and administer a housing revitalization program for low and moderate income housing.

      (d) An applicant eligible under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection who contracts with another entity, including a private for-profit corporation.

      (3) Housing revitalization projects shall bring into use vacant and abandoned property or rehabilitate substandard property, or both. Eligible project activities include, but are not limited to:

      (a) Purchase of property;

      (b) Rehabilitation of housing units;

      (c) New construction to replace units for which rehabilitation is infeasible;

      (d) Mortgage interest subsidies or reduction of principal loan amounts; or

      (e) Other activities that have the effect of making properties available to and occupied by persons of lower income, such as loan guarantees.

      (4) Projects funded by the housing revitalization program shall be rental or owner-occupied single or multifamily housing.

      (5) The housing rehabilitation program shall create affordable housing in which rent levels are no higher than 30 percent of 80 percent of median income levels.

      (6) Priority shall be given to projects applied for under subsections (1) to (5) of this section that provide opportunities for low and moderate income persons to own their housing units.

      (7) Priority among rental housing projects shall be given to projects applied for under subsections (1) to (5) of this section that:

      (a) Have rent levels no higher than 30 percent of 50 percent of the median income level, or less;

      (b) Are owned and operated by a nonprofit or a governmental unit; and

      (c) Demonstrate a coordinated local effort to integrate housing, job placement and social services.

      (8) In implementing this section and ORS 458.305, the council shall work to ensure a reasonable geographic distribution of funds among different regions of the state and shall place special emphasis on ensuring that funds are available to projects in rural areas.

LOW INCOME HOUSING INVOLVING STATE PROPERTY

 

      458.405 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Safe, affordable and readily available housing options for low-income individuals and families do not match the increasing need for such housing in this state.

      (2) Much state-owned property is unused and could be made available to increase housing options for low-income individuals and families.

      (3) Unused property kept for long periods of time generally decreases in value.

      (4) A method to dispose of or transfer such property and have it utilized for a public purpose is in the interests of the people of this state.

      (5) It will further the public interest to put unused state-owned real property at the disposal of nonprofit housing providers and housing authorities to address the housing needs of low-income individuals and families in this state. [1989 c.440 §1]

      458.410 Purposes. The purposes of ORS 458.405 to 458.460 are to provide low-income housing options including but not limited to:

      458.420 Conveyance of certain state real property for low-income housing. Whenever the state or any state agency possesses or controls real property that might be used to further the public use of providing housing options for low-income individuals and families that is unused for any other public purpose and in which no long-term policy exists to use it for another public purpose, then the state or its agency may sell, convey or lease for a period not to exceed 99 years, all or any part of its interest in the property to a nonprofit organization involved with providing low-income housing options or to a housing authority. The consideration for the transfer may be cash or real property, or both. [1989 c.440 §4]

 

      458.425 Restriction on conveyance of certain state real property. Real property needed for a public use other than low-income housing shall not be sold, exchanged, leased or conveyed under the authority of ORS 458.405 to 458.460. [1989 c.440 §5]

      (2) Any lease of state real property to be used for the purposes of ORS 458.405 to 458.460 exceeding five years shall be approved in advance by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. [1989 c.440 §6]

 

      458.440 Authorization to lease; terms and conditions. Every lease entered into pursuant to ORS 458.405 to 458.460 shall be authorized by order of the state agency executing the lease and shall provide such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the government body executing the lease. [1989 c.440 §7]

 

      458.445 Authority to relinquish title to property; purpose. The state is hereby granted express power to relinquish the title to any of its property not needed for another public purpose to the United States Government or any other governmental body, political subdivision, housing authority or nonprofit organization involved with providing low-income housing, in order to promote the public purpose of increasing housing options for low-income individuals and families in this state. [1989 c.440 §8]

 

      458.450 Approval required by governing body where property located. Before the transfer of any state-owned real property under the provisions of ORS 458.405 to 458.460 to a housing authority or a nonprofit organization involved with providing low-income housing to individuals and families in this state, the state or its agency, board or commission shall obtain approval of the governing body in which such property is located. [1989 c.440 §9]

 

      458.460 Bidding procedure for multiple applicants. In the event that more than one housing authority or appropriate nonprofit organization is interested in a building available for transfer under ORS 458.405 to 458.460, the state or its agency shall conduct a bidding process that takes into account:

      458.528 Policy on homelessness. (1) As used in this section, “homelessness” means the lack of a decent, safe, stable and permanent place to live that is fit for human habitation.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (a) Homelessness is a detriment to individuals, families and communities. The effects of homelessness impact quality of life, productivity and self-sufficiency, career and educational opportunities, health and wellness. Those effects may also extend to future generations.

      (b) Preventing and ending homelessness is important for all levels of government, business and the community.

      (3) The Housing and Community Services Department and the Department of Human Services shall serve as the lead agencies in administering the state policy regarding homelessness.

      (4) It is the policy of this state that the Housing and Community Services Department, the Department of Human Services, the Oregon Housing Stability Council and the Community Action Partnership of Oregon work to encourage innovation by state, regional and local agencies that will create the comprehensive and collaborative support system and housing resources vital for a successful campaign to end and prevent homelessness. The comprehensive and collaborative support system should include, but not be limited to:

      (a) The redesign of existing response systems to homelessness to include a realignment of services with permanent housing.

      (b) The inclusion of community-based treatment, outreach services, early intervention strategies, housing and service management and an interagency system that can address individuals with compound needs.

      (c) The coordination of multiagency services provided to people with chronic needs, older adults and homeless and runaway youths, including but not limited to criminal justice, housing, public welfare, health, mental health and youth and family services, to create integrated and cost-effective programs that deliver housing and service needs of homeless persons in a seamless and timely manner.

      (d) Programs of care for the homeless that have an accompanying set of outcomes to increase accountability and further development of more effective methods in reaching client outcome goals and cost effectiveness. Outcomes for increasing the accountability of programs of care for the homeless include shortening the length of stay in emergency housing, eliminating repeated periods of homelessness and addressing the issue of homelessness in all areas of the state.

      (e) An individualized approach to the homeless person that includes an assessment of individual needs, identification of appropriate solutions that may include services, coordination and cost-effective use of support across agencies and appropriate monitoring and evaluation of the homeless person’s individual progress.

      458.530 Policy on hunger. (1) The Department of Human Services shall serve as the lead public body in administering the state policy on hunger.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that it is the policy of this state that:

      (a) Hunger is defined as the state of being unable to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet from nonemergency food channels. Hunger is not one discrete event. Hunger is a series of events that lead up to and follow a lack of adequate food intake. It is the process in which people become at risk of hunger, attempt to cope with the problem and suffer a variety of health and social consequences.

      (b) All persons have the right to be free from hunger.

      (c) Freedom from hunger means all persons have food security. Persons lack food security if they are uncertain of having, or being able to acquire in socially acceptable ways, enough acceptable food at all times to meet basic needs because they have insufficient money or other resources for food.

      (d) Oregon will strive to rank among the top states in the nation in providing food security without hunger.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares that the policy of this state is to provide and encourage activities and programs necessary to fulfill the commitment stated in subsection (2) of this section and that the purpose of policies stated in this section is to provide a guide for the establishment, implementation and operation of activities and programs designed to alleviate or eradicate hunger in this state. The Legislative Assembly further declares that the activities and programs shall be initiated, promoted and developed through:

      (a) Volunteers and volunteer groups;

      (b) Public and private not-for-profit organizations;

      (c) Partnership with local governmental agencies;

      (d) Coordinated efforts of state agencies;

      (e) Coordination and cooperation with federal programs;

      (f) Partnership with private health and social service agencies; and

      (g) The Hunger Task Force. [Formerly 411.848; 2007 c.145 §2; 2009 c.407 §4; 2015 c.180 §21]

[1999 c.1000 §1; 2001 c.648 §3; 2007 c.765 §2; 2008 c.45 §16; 2009 c.5 §26; 2009 c.63 §1; 2009 c.541 §22; 2009 c.909 §29; 2010 c.82 §31; 2011 c.7 §26; 2012 c.31 §26; 2013 c.377 §26; 2014 c.52 §28; 2015 c.442 §20; 2016 c.33 §24; 2017 c.527 §25; 2018 c.101 §25; 2019 c.319 §27]

 

      Note: 458.670 to 458.700 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 458 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      458.675 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The problem of poverty will not be solved solely by government programs and income subsidies.

      (2) Family economic well-being does not come solely from income, spending or consumption, but instead requires savings, investment and the accumulation of assets.

      (3) It is appropriate for the state to institute an asset-based antipoverty strategy.

      (4) The state has an opportunity to take advantage of private and federal resources by making the transition to an asset-based antipoverty strategy. Those resources include, but are not limited to, the Assets for Independence Act (42 U.S.C. 604) and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.).

      (5) Investment through an individual development account system will help lower income households obtain the assets they need to succeed. Communities and this state will experience resultant economic and social benefits accruing from the promotion of job training and higher education, home ownership and small business development.

      (6) It is desirable for this state to enact legislation that enables an authorized fiduciary organization sufficient flexibility to receive private, state and federal moneys for individual development accounts. The Legislative Assembly should periodically review the provisions of ORS 458.675 to 458.700 to ensure that this state maximizes the receipt of available federal moneys for individual development accounts. [1999 c.1000 §2; 2017 c.185 §12; 2017 c.297 §35]

 

      Note: See note under 458.670.

 

      458.680 Persons qualifying as account holders. (1) A person who qualifies to become an account holder may enter into an agreement with a fiduciary organization for the establishment of an individual development account.

      (2) To become an account holder a person must, in addition to meeting any other qualifications, be a member of a lower income household that has a net worth of less than $20,000. As used in this subsection, “net worth” means the value of all assets owned in whole or part by household members, excluding equity in a residence and in one vehicle, and excluding holdings in pension accounts, as defined by the Housing and Community Services Department by rule, that are valued at less than $60,000, minus the total debts and obligations of household members, all as measured at the time that the person applies to establish the account.

      (3) Every account holder, with support from the fiduciary organization, shall develop a personal development plan to advance account holder self-reliance. The personal development plan must include appropriate coaching, mentorship, social support, financial adequacy training and asset-specific training designed to increase the independence of the person and the person’s household through achievement of the account’s approved purpose.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a fiduciary organization may refuse to allow a qualified person to establish an account if establishment of the account would result in the members of a lower income household having more than one account. Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a fiduciary organization shall refuse to allow a qualified person to establish an account if establishment of the account would result in the members of a lower income household having more than two accounts. [1999 c.1000 §3; 2007 c.765 §3; 2013 c.270 §1]

 

      Note: See note under 458.670.

 

      458.685 Approved purpose of account; emergency withdrawal; withdrawal upon achievement of account purpose; removal of account holder from program.

      (c) If the account holder has established a savings network account for higher education under ORS 178.300 to 178.360 on behalf of a designated beneficiary, the funding of qualified higher education expenses as defined in ORS 178.300 by one or more deposits into a savings network account for higher education on behalf of the same designated beneficiary.

      (d) The purchase of a primary residence. In addition to payment on the purchase price of the residence, account moneys may be used to pay any usual or reasonable settlement, financing or other closing costs. The account holder must not have owned or held any interest in a residence during the three years prior to making the purchase. However, this three-year period shall not apply to displaced homemakers, individuals who have lost home ownership as a result of divorce or owners of manufactured homes.

      (e) The rental of a primary residence when housing stability is essential to achieve state policy goals. Account moneys may be used for security deposits, first and last months’ rent, application fees and other expenses necessary to move into the primary residence, as specified in the account holder’s personal development plan for increasing the independence of the person.

      (f) The capitalization of a small business. Account moneys may be used for capital, plant, equipment and inventory expenses and to hire employees upon capitalization of the small business, or for working capital pursuant to a business plan.

      (g) Improvements, repairs or modifications necessary to make or keep the account holder’s primary dwelling habitable, accessible or visitable for the account holder or a household member. This paragraph does not apply to improvements, repairs or modifications made to a rented primary dwelling to achieve or maintain a habitable condition for which ORS 90.320 (1) places responsibility on the landlord. As used in this paragraph, “accessible” and “visitable” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 456.508.

      (h) The purchase of equipment, technology or specialized training required to become competitive in obtaining or maintaining employment or to start or maintain a business, as specified in the account holder’s personal development plan for increasing the independence of the person.

      (i) The purchase or repair of a vehicle, as specified in the account holder’s personal development plan for increasing the independence of the person.

      (2)(a) If an emergency occurs, an account holder may withdraw all or part of the account holder’s deposits to an individual development account for a purpose not described in subsection (1) of this section. As used in this paragraph, “emergency” includes making payments for necessary medical expenses, to avoid eviction of the account holder from the account holder’s residence and for necessary living expenses following a loss of employment.

      (b) The account holder must reimburse the account for the amount withdrawn under this subsection within 12 months after the date of the withdrawal. Failure of an account holder to make a timely reimbursement to the account is grounds for removing the account holder from the individual development account program. Until the reimbursement has been made in full, an account holder may not withdraw any matching deposits or accrued interest on matching deposits from the account.

      (3) If an account holder withdraws moneys from an individual development account for other than an approved purpose, the fiduciary organization may remove the account holder from the program.

      (4)(a) If the account holder of an account established for the purpose set forth in subsection (1)(c) or (j) of this section has achieved the account’s approved purpose in accordance with the personal development plan developed by the account holder under ORS 458.680, the account holder may withdraw, or authorize the withdrawal of, the remaining amount of all deposits, including matching deposits, and interest in the account as follows:

      (A) For an account established for the purpose set forth in subsection (1)(c) of this section, by rolling over the entire withdrawal amount, not to exceed the limit established pursuant to ORS 178.335, into one or more of the savings network accounts for higher education under ORS 178.300 to 178.360, the establishment of which is the purpose of the individual development account; or

      (B) For an account established for the purpose set forth in subsection (1)(j) of this section, by rolling over the entire withdrawal amount into an individual retirement account, a retirement plan or a similar account or plan established under the Internal Revenue Code.

      (b) Upon withdrawal of all moneys in the individual development account as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the account relationship shall terminate.

      (c) The rollover of moneys into a savings network account for higher education under this subsection may not cause the amount in the savings network account for higher education to exceed the limit on total contributions established pursuant to ORS 178.335.

      (d) Any amount of the rollover that has been subtracted on the taxpayer’s federal return pursuant to section 219 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be added back in the determination of taxable income.

      (5) If an account holder moves from the area where the program is conducted or is otherwise unable to continue in the program, the fiduciary organization may remove the account holder from the program.

      (6) If an account holder is removed from the program under subsection (2), (3) or (5) of this section, all matching deposits in the account and all interest earned on matching deposits shall revert to the fiduciary organization.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

 

      458.705 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) The population of the state is growing and is expected to continue growing well into the 21st century. That population growth is uneven, resulting in some places struggling to manage new people, jobs and building, and other places being eager to attract a share of growth and economic development. A community’s pattern of development can accommodate a growing population and help rebuild rural and distressed economies while maintaining the state’s quality of life. Downtown areas need to be revitalized to accommodate more business and civic activity. Affordable housing must be developed near job centers. Rural and distressed communities need to be rebuilt to allow all sectors of the state to share in economic prosperity.

      (2) Numerous barriers exist to achieving vibrant downtown areas and community centers, ample affordable housing and thriving rural economies. Overcoming those barriers will require the state to work in partnership with local communities, the private sector and community-based groups to provide livability. Regulations must be balanced with incentives. Private sector financing must be better leveraged. Local planning and zoning codes must allow the redevelopment of strategic infill sites. The needs of working families for housing, transportation and services that are affordable and accessible must be addressed by the entire community.

      (3) A critical element in the creation of effective partnerships is a flexible funding source that can serve as an incentive to achieving quality development. Careful targeting of financial incentives can provide the needed impetus for revitalization of downtown areas throughout the state, the creation of affordable housing in the proper places and new job centers in places working to attract new growth.

      (4) State government, in tandem with local and federal governments, nonprofit organizations and the business sector, provides a variety of tools to help build strong Oregon communities. Targeted financial incentives will complement existing tools and allow state government and its partners to enhance livability and make cost-effective use of public infrastructure. The resulting communities will be economically viable and will have housing that is affordable to community residents. [1999 c.956 §1]

 

      Note: 458.705 to 458.740 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 458 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
