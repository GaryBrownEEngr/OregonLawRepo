     (b) The opportunity to recycle should be provided to every person in Oregon.

     (c) There is a shortage of appropriate sites for landfills in Oregon.

     (d) It is in the best interests of the people of Oregon to extend the useful life of solid waste disposal sites by encouraging waste prevention and the recycling and reuse of materials, and by requiring solid waste to undergo volume reduction through recycling and reuse measures to the maximum extent feasible before disposal. Implementation of waste prevention and recycling and reuse measures will not only increase the useful life of solid waste disposal sites, but also decrease the potential public health and safety impacts associated with the operation of disposal sites.

     (e) There are limits to Oregon’s natural resources and the capacity of the state’s environment to absorb the impacts of increasing consumption of resources, increasing waste generation and increasing solid waste disposal.

     (f) It is in the best interests of the people of Oregon to conserve resources and energy by developing an economy that encourages waste prevention and recycling.

     (g) The State of Oregon should make it a priority to support efforts that assist each wasteshed in meeting its recovery goal so the statewide recovery goal may be achieved.

     (2) In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare and in order to conserve energy and natural resources, it is the policy of the State of Oregon to establish a comprehensive statewide program for solid waste management which will:

     (a) After consideration of technical and economic feasibility, establish priority in methods of managing solid waste in Oregon as follows:

     (A) First, to reduce the amount of solid waste generated;

     (B) Second, to reuse material for the purpose for which it was originally intended;

     (C) Third, to recycle material that cannot be reused;

     (D) Fourth, to compost material that cannot be reused or recycled;

     (E) Fifth, to recover energy from solid waste that cannot be reused, recycled or composted so long as the energy recovery facility preserves the quality of air, water and land resources; and

     (F) Sixth, to dispose of solid waste that cannot be reused, recycled, composted or from which energy cannot be recovered by landfilling or other method approved by the Department of Environmental Quality.

     (b) Clearly express the Legislative Assembly’s previous delegation of authority to cities and counties for collection service franchising and regulation and the extension of that authority under the provisions of this section and ORS 459.125 and 459A.005 to 459A.085.

     (c) Retain primary responsibility for management of adequate solid waste management programs with cities, counties or metropolitan service districts, reserving to the state those functions necessary to ensure effective programs, cooperation among cities, counties or metropolitan service districts and coordination of solid waste management programs throughout the state.

     (d) Promote, encourage and develop markets first for reusable material and then for recyclable material.

     (e) Promote research, surveys and demonstration projects to encourage material or energy recovery.

     (f) Promote research, surveys and demonstration projects to aid in developing more sanitary, efficient and economical methods of solid waste management.

     (g) Provide advisory technical assistance and planning assistance to affected persons, in the planning, development and implementation of solid waste management programs.

     (h) Develop, in coordination with federal, state and local agencies and other affected persons, long-range plans including regional approaches to promote reuse, to provide land reclamation in sparsely populated areas, and in urban areas necessary disposal facilities.

     (i) Provide for the adoption and enforcement of recycling rates and standards as well as performance standards necessary for safe, economic and proper solid waste management.

     (j) Provide authority for counties to establish a coordinated program for solid waste management, to regulate solid waste management and to license or franchise the providing of service in the field of solid waste management.

     (k) Encourage utilization of the capabilities and expertise of private industry.

     (L) Promote means of preventing or reducing at the source, materials which otherwise would constitute solid waste.

     (m) Promote application of material or energy recovery systems which preserve and enhance the quality of air, water and land resources. [1971 c.648 §1; 1975 c.239 §2; 1983 c.729 §15; 1989 c.541 §1; 1991 c.385 §7; 1993 c.560 §3; 1997 c.552 §2; 2001 c.513 §1]

 

     459.017 Relationship of state to local governments in solid waste management. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

     (a) The planning, location, acquisition, development and operation of landfills is a matter of statewide concern.

     (b) Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning for solid waste management.

     (c) Where the solid waste management plan of a local government unit has identified a need for a landfill, the state has a responsibility to assist local government and private persons in establishing such a site.

     (2) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that any action taken by the Environmental Quality Commission to establish a landfill under ORS 459.049 be recognized as an extraordinary measure that should be exercised only in the closest cooperation with local government units that have jurisdiction over the area affected by the proposed establishment of a landfill. [1979 c.773 §2; 1993 c.560 §4]

     (1) Assist the local government unit in the establishment of the landfill including assisting in planning, location, acquisition, development and operation of the site.

     (2) Locate a site and issue a solid waste disposal permit under ORS 459.205 to 459.385 for a landfill within the boundaries of the requesting local government unit. Subject to the conditions set forth in the permit and except for permit decisions delegated by the federal government to the Department of State Lands, any permit for a landfill authorized by the Environmental Quality Commission under this subsection shall bind the state and all counties and cities and political subdivisions in this state as to the approval of the site and the construction and operation of the proposed facility. Except for those statutes and rules for which compliance decisions have been delegated by the federal government to the Department of State Lands, all affected state agencies, counties, cities and political subdivisions shall issue the appropriate permits, licenses and certificates necessary to construction and operation of the landfill, subject only to condition of the site certificate. Each state or local government agency that issues a permit, license or certificate shall continue to exercise enforcement authority over such permit, license or certificate.

 

     459.049 Mandated landfills in certain counties; establishment by state. (1) Upon its own motion or upon the recommendation of the Department of Environmental Quality, the Environmental Quality Commission may determine that a landfill within the counties of Marion, Polk, Clackamas, Washington or Multnomah must be established in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of an area for which a local government solid waste management plan has identified the need for a landfill. In making its determination on the need for a landfill or, where applicable, on the location of a landfill, the commission shall give due consideration to:

     (a) The legislative policy and findings expressed in ORS 459.015, 459.017 and 459.065, and particularly the policy that action taken under this section be exercised in cooperation with local government;

     (b) The provisions of the solid waste management plan or plans for the affected area;

     (c) Applicable local government ordinances, rules, regulations and plans other than for solid waste management;

     (d) The statewide land use planning goals as defined in ORS 197.015;

     (e) The need for a landfill;

     (f) The availability and capacity of alternative disposal sites or material or energy recovery facilities;

     (g) The time required to establish a landfill;

     (h) Information received from public comment and hearings; and

     (i) Any other factors the commission considers relevant.

     (2) If the commission makes a determination under subsection (1) of this section that there is a need for a landfill within a plan area, the commission may issue an order directing the local government unit responsible for implementing the plan to establish a landfill within a specified period of time. The order may specify a time schedule for the completion of the major elements required to establish the site. A local government unit directed to establish a landfill under this section may request assistance from the department or request that the department establish the disposal site as provided in ORS 459.047.

     (3) If the commission determines that the establishment of a landfill ordered by the commission under subsection (2) of this section is not being accomplished or that the completion of major elements has fallen behind the time schedule specified in the order, the commission may direct the department to establish the landfill or complete the establishment of the landfill undertaken by the local government unit. The commission may direct the department to establish or complete the establishment of a landfill under this section only if the commission finds that:

     (a) The action is consistent with the statewide planning goals relating to solid waste management adopted under ORS chapters 195, 196 and 197 and any applicable provisions of a comprehensive plan or plans; and

     (b) The responsible local government unit is unable to establish the landfill ordered by the commission under subsection (2) of this section.

     (4) If the commission directs the department to establish or complete the establishment of a landfill under subsection (3) of this section, the department may establish the site subject only to the approval of the commission and the provisions of the solid waste management plan adopted for the area and in consultation with all affected local government units. Notwithstanding any city, county or other local government charter or ordinance to the contrary, the department may establish a landfill under this subsection without obtaining any license, permit, franchise or other form of approval from a local government unit.

     459.055 Landfills in farm use areas; waste reduction programs. (1) Before issuing a permit for a landfill established after October 3, 1979, in any area zoned for exclusive farm use, the Department of Environmental Quality shall determine that the site can and will be reclaimed for uses permissible in the exclusive farm use zone. A permit issued for a landfill in an exclusive farm use zone must contain requirements that:

     (a) Ensure rehabilitation of the site at the termination of the use for solid waste disposal to a condition comparable to its original use;

     (b) Protect the public health and safety and the environment;

     (c) Minimize the impact of the landfill on adjacent property;

     (d) Minimize traffic; and

     (e) Minimize rodent and vector production and sustenance.

     (2) Before issuing a permit for any disposal site, including a landfill established under ORS 459.047 or 459.049, the department shall require:

     (a) Any person who sends more than 75,000 tons of solid waste a year to the disposal site to prepare a waste reduction program accepted by the department; and

     (b) That any contract or agreement to dispose of more than 75,000 tons of out-of-state solid waste a year in an Oregon disposal site established under ORS 459.047 or 459.049 provides for a waste reduction program accepted by the department.

     (3) A disposal site subject to the requirements of subsection (2) of this section may not accept solid waste from any person disposing of solid waste originating in any local government unit that does not have a waste reduction program or a contract accepted by the department. The department shall review the local government programs and the contract programs in the manner provided in subsection (5) of this section. A waste reduction program shall provide for:

     (a) A commitment by the local government unit to reduce the volume of waste that would otherwise be disposed of in a landfill through techniques such as waste prevention, recycling, reuse, composting and energy recovery;

     (b) An opportunity to recycle that:

     (A) Includes a program for recycling that achieves the applicable recovery rate in ORS 459A.010 (2) for waste originating in Oregon, or as demonstrated by the disposal site operator for waste originating outside Oregon, either a recovery rate equivalent to that achieved in a comparable county in Oregon or a recycling and waste prevention program equivalent to the opportunity to recycle in ORS 459A.005 (1)(a) and (2) and the program elements in ORS 459A.007; and

     (B) For waste originating inside Oregon, meets or exceeds the requirements of ORS 459.250 and 459A.005 to 459A.085;

     (c) A timetable for implementing each portion of the waste reduction program;

     (d) Energy efficient, cost-effective approaches for waste reduction;

     (e) Procedures commensurate with the type and volume of solid waste generated in the area; and

     (f) Legal, technical and economic feasibility.

     (4) For each area outside the state from which a disposal site receives solid waste, the disposal site has two years after first accepting solid waste from the area to demonstrate how the area complies with the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. If after two years the waste reduction program required under subsection (3) of this section is not implemented, the Environmental Quality Commission may, by order, direct such implementation, or may prohibit the disposal site from accepting waste from the person responsible for preparing the waste reduction program. The disposal site operator shall provide written notice to the department prior to first accepting solid waste from outside the state. The requirements of this subsection apply only to contracts entered into after September 9, 1995.

     (5) The department shall review a waste reduction program prepared under subsection (2) of this section and shall accept the program if it meets the criteria prescribed in subsection (3) of this section.

     (6) Notwithstanding ORS 459.245 (1), if the department fails to act on an application subject to the requirements of this section within 60 days, the application is not considered granted.

     (7) A contract or agreement for the disposal of solid waste made between an owner or operator of a disposal site and a person does not affect the authority of the commission to establish or modify the requirements of an acceptable waste reduction program under subsection (2) of this section.

     (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to solid waste disposal, if the state of origin prohibits or restricts the disposal of any kind of solid waste within the state of origin, the prohibition or restriction also applies to the disposal of the solid waste in Oregon. [1979 c.773 §8a; 1989 c.541 §2; 1991 c.765 §8; 1993 c.560 §12; 1995 c.541 §1; 1997 c.552 §3; 2015 c.534 §14]

 

     459.057 Department to limit wastes allowed in landfills in certain counties. (1) Before issuing a permit for a landfill to be established under ORS 459.047 or 459.049 or for a disposal site established as a conditional use in an area zoned for exclusive farm use within the boundaries of Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah, Polk or Washington County, the Department of Environmental Quality shall require that, to the extent legally, technically and economically feasible only solid waste from transfer stations or solid waste residues from material or energy recovery facilities will be deposited in the disposal site. As used in this section, “transfer station” means a site established for the collection and temporary storage of solid waste pending shipment in a compact and orderly manner to a disposal site.

     (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the department from allowing other solid waste to be deposited in the disposal site in order to protect the public health and safety or the waters of this state during a temporary emergency condition. [1979 c.773 §86; 1993 c.560 §13]

 

     459.060 [1967 c.428 §6; 1969 c.593 §46; repealed by 1971 c.648 §33]

 

     459.061 Upland placement of dredged material; rules. (1) For purposes of any rules adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission pursuant to ORS 459.005 to 459.437 that require a determination that the use of a solid waste is productive, upland placement of dredged material by a port district shall be determined productive. Nothing in this section is intended to affect any other requirement adopted by rule by the commission related to the upland placement of dredged material or other material that is solid waste.

     (2) For purposes of this section, “dredged material” means rock, gravel, sand, silt or other similar material removed from waters of the state, whether saturated or not. [2015 c.494 §2]

 

     Note: 459.061 was added to and made a part of 459.005 to 459.437 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

     (3)(a) When a city annexes all or a portion of a service area previously franchised by a county, the city, county and affected persons or local government units providing collection service shall attempt to reach an agreement to protect the extent and quality of service in areas remaining outside the city, to protect the quality of service within the city and to protect the rights of affected persons or local government units providing collection service.

     (b) A city and county may, with permission of the city collector and the county franchisee, provide by prior agreement that an area, or portion of an area, annexed by the city but previously franchised by the county shall continue to be served by the county franchisee for at least 10 years after the effective date of the annexation.

     (c) A city with permission of the city collector, or a city-regulated collector with permission of the city, may provide by prior agreement that an area, or portion of an area, annexed by the city but previously served by a collector located in an unfranchised area of the county shall continue to be served by the county collector or shall be transferred to the city collector with compensation from the city collector to the county collector.

     (B) The expiration of the longer of the county franchise term or the term of the current city license, contract or franchise regulating solid waste collection. However, the term shall not include any renewals or extensions made after the effective date of the annexation and the total term shall not exceed 10 years after the effective date of the annexation.

     (e) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the right of a county to franchise, license or regulate solid waste management or any portion thereof as otherwise provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. [1971 c.648 §16; 1977 c.639 §1; 1993 c.357 §1; 1993 c.560 §15a]

 

     459.095 Restrictions on authority of local government units. (1) No ordinance, order, regulation or contract affecting solid waste management shall be adopted by a local government unit if such ordinance, order, regulation or contract conflicts with rules adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission under ORS 459.045 or 459A.025 or with a solid waste management plan or program adopted by a metropolitan service district and approved by the Department of Environmental Quality or any ordinances or regulations adopted under such plan or program.

     (2) Solid waste management regulations adopted by a sanitary district or sanitary authority shall be limited to regulations supplemental to the rules adopted by the commission under ORS 459.045 or 459A.025 and necessary to meet special local conditions. [1971 c.648 §17; 1973 c.835 §139; 1977 c.95 §7; 1993 c.560 §16]

The total amount of the civil penalty may be increased to include all of the costs incurred by the city or county in removing the refuse or offensive substance unlawfully placed on property and in eliminating the effects of such unlawful placement.

     (3) A civil penalty imposed for violation of an ordinance prohibiting any action or conduct described in ORS 164.775, 164.785 or 164.805 shall be an alternative to criminal enforcement of the ordinance. A city or county that commences and maintains a civil action to collect such a civil penalty from any person shall not cause a criminal prosecution to be commenced or maintained against that person for the same violation of the ordinance.

     (4) When a city or county ordinance prohibits any action or conduct that is described in ORS 164.775, 164.785 or 164.805, a name found on various items in a deposit of rubbish or other solid waste placed on land or in water in violation of the ordinance constitutes rebuttable evidence that the person whose name appears on the items has violated the ordinance. However, the rebuttable presumption created by this subsection exists only when a name on items denotes ownership of the items, such as the name of an addressee on an envelope. [1991 c.653 §7]

DISPOSAL SITES

 

     459.205 Permit required. (1) Except as provided by ORS 459.215, a disposal site shall not be established, operated, maintained or substantially altered, expanded or improved, and a change shall not be made in the method or type of disposal at a disposal site, until the person owning or controlling the disposal site obtains a permit therefor from the Department of Environmental Quality as provided in ORS 459.235.

     (2) The person who holds or last held the permit issued under subsection (1) of this section, or, if that person fails to comply, then the person owning or controlling a land disposal site that is closed and no longer receiving solid waste must continue or renew the permit required under subsection (1) of this section after the site is closed for the duration of the period in which the department continues to actively supervise the site, even though solid waste is no longer received at the site. [1971 c.648 §6; 1983 c.766 §7; 1993 c.560 §21a]

 

     459.209 [1993 c.526 §4; renumbered 459.046 in 1995]

 

     459.210 [1969 c.90 §2; repealed by 1971 c.648 §33]

 

     459.215 Exclusion of certain sites from permit requirement; rules. (1) By rule and after public hearing, the Environmental Quality Commission may prescribe criteria and conditions for excluding classes of disposal sites from the permit requirements of ORS 459.205. Disposal sites so excluded shall be limited to those which, because of the nature or volume of solid waste handled, are not likely to create a public nuisance, health hazard, air or water pollution, or other serious problem. Facilities operated under a permit issued under ORS 468B.050 or 468B.053 are not required to obtain a permit from the Department of Environmental Quality pursuant to ORS 459.205. However, exclusion from the permit requirements of ORS 459.205 does not relieve any person from compliance with other requirements of ORS 459.005 to 459.105 and 459.205 to 459.385 and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

     (2) By rule and after public hearing the commission may establish classes of disposal sites that qualify for exclusion under this section. [1971 c.648 §7; 1973 c.835 §140; 1993 c.560 §22; 1997 c.286 §4]

 

     459.220 [1969 c.90 §1; repealed by 1971 c.648 §33]

 

     459.225 Variances authorized. (1) If the Environmental Quality Commission finds that a disposal site cannot meet one or more of the requirements of ORS 459.005 to 459.105 and 459.205 to 459.385 or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, it may issue a variance from such requirement either for a limited or unlimited time or it may issue a permit containing a schedule of compliance specifying the time or times permitted to bring the disposal site into compliance with such requirements, or it may do both.

     (2) In carrying out the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the commission may grant specific variances from particular requirements or may grant a permit to an applicant or to a class of applicants or to a specific disposal site, and specify conditions it considers necessary to protect the public health.

     (3) The commission shall grant a variance only if:

     (a) Conditions exist that are beyond the control of the applicant.

     (b) Special conditions exist that render strict compliance unreasonable, burdensome or impractical.

     (c) Strict compliance would result in substantial curtailment or closing of a disposal site and no alternative facility or alternative method of solid waste management is available.

     (4) A variance may be revoked or modified by the commission after a public hearing held upon not less than 10 days’ notice. Such notice shall be served upon all persons who the commission knows will be subjected to greater restrictions if such variance is revoked or modified, or who are likely to be affected or who have filed with the commission a written request for such notification.

     (5) In addition to the authority to issue a variance under subsections (1) to (4) of this section, the commission may modify an existing disposal site permit to specify the conditions under which the disposal site may accept and dispose of infectious waste. The commission also may require that an energy recovery facility or solid waste incinerator accept infectious waste generated in Oregon if the infectious waste has been contained and transported in accordance with ORS 459.390 and 825.256, but only so long as the volume of infectious waste generated outside the county in which the facility or incinerator is located does not affect the ability of the facility or incinerator to process or dispose of all waste generated within the county in which the facility or incinerator is located. As used in this subsection, “infectious waste” has the meaning given that term in ORS 459.386.

     (6) The establishment, operation, maintenance, expansion, alteration, improvement or other change of a disposal site in accordance with a variance is not a violation of ORS 459.005 to 459.105 and 459.205 to 459.385 or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto. [1971 c.648 §8; 1973 c.835 §141; 1989 c.763 §13; 1993 c.560 §23]

     459.235 Applications for permits; fees. (1) Applications for permits shall be on forms prescribed by the Department of Environmental Quality. An application shall contain a description of the existing and proposed operation and the existing and proposed facilities at the site, with detailed plans and specifications for any facilities to be constructed. The application shall include a recommendation by each local government unit having jurisdiction and such other information the department deems necessary in order to determine whether the site and solid waste disposal facilities located at the site and the operation will comply with applicable requirements.

     (2) The Environmental Quality Commission shall establish a schedule of fees for disposal site permits. Consistent with the policies in ORS 459.015, moneys collected under this section shall be used to fund oversight activities related to solid waste disposal sites, including but not limited to policy development, permitting, inspecting, monitoring, enforcement, training, technical assistance, responding to complaints, rulemaking and any other activities that support the safe management of solid waste.

     (3) Notwithstanding any other fee or surcharge imposed under ORS 459.005 to 459.437 or 459A.005 to 459A.120, for the disposal of solid waste, in order to encourage the use of suitable material other than virgin material for daily cover at a disposal site, the only fee that may be charged for the disposal of substitute material that is also used for daily cover is the permit fee established under this section. [1971 c.648 §9; 1977 c.37 §1; 1983 c.144 §1; 1987 c.876 §18; 1989 c.833 §154; 1991 c.331 §65; 1991 c.385 §12a; 1993 c.343 §2; 1993 c.560 §§24,24a; 1995 c.281 §1; 2003 c.794 §285; 2015 c.662 §§1,8]

     (2) The amount raised under subsection (1) of this section shall be up to $1 million per year, based on the estimated tonnage or the actual tonnage, if known, received at the site or transported out of state for final disposal or destruction and any other similar or related factors the Environmental Quality Commission finds appropriate. Such fees shall be within the budget authorized by the Legislative Assembly as that budget may be modified by the Emergency Board.

     (3) For solid waste delivered to a disposal site owned and operated by a metropolitan service district, the fee imposed under subsection (1) of this section shall be levied on the district, not the disposal site.

     (4) Before transporting or arranging for transport of solid waste out of the State of Oregon to a disposal site that receives domestic solid waste, a person shall notify the Department of Environmental Quality in writing.

     (5)(a) A local government unit that franchises or licenses a domestic solid waste site shall allow the disposal site to pass through the amount of the fees established by the commission in subsection (1) of this section to the users of the site.

     (b) If a disposal site that receives domestic solid waste passes through all or a portion of the fees established by the commission in subsection (1) of this section to a solid waste collector who uses the site, a local government unit that franchises or licenses the collection of solid waste shall allow the franchisee or licensee to include the amount of the fee in the collection service rate.

     (6) Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, moneys collected under this section shall be deposited in the Orphan Site Account created under ORS 465.381 to be used to pay the costs of removal or remedial action of hazardous substances, in excess of the maximum amount collected under ORS 459.311 at:

     (b) The local government unit repays any moneys equal to the amount that may be raised by the charge imposed under ORS 459.311 and interest on such moneys, in accordance with an agreement between the local government unit and the department. A local government unit is not required to repay the first $100,000 the local government unit expends on removal or remedial action.

     (8) As used in this section:

     (a) “Domestic solid waste” has the meaning given that term in ORS 459A.100.

     459.305 Certification or demonstration that government unit has implemented opportunity to recycle; rules; fee. (1) Except as otherwise provided by rules adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission under subsection (4) of this section, a disposal site may not accept solid waste generated outside the county in which the disposal site is located unless the Department of Environmental Quality certifies or, for waste that originates outside Oregon in an amount exceeding 75,000 tons annually from a single source generator or wasteshed, the disposal site operator demonstrates to the department, that the person responsible for solid waste management in the area from which the solid waste originates has implemented an opportunity to recycle that:

     (a) For waste originating outside Oregon, achieves either a recovery rate equivalent to that achieved in a comparable county in Oregon or a recycling and waste prevention program equivalent to the opportunity to recycle in ORS 459A.005 (1)(a) and (2) and the program elements in ORS 459A.007; and

     (b) For waste originating inside Oregon, meets the requirements of ORS 459.250 and 459A.005 to 459A.085.

     (2) The commission shall adopt rules to establish a program for certification of recycling programs established by a person in order to comply with the requirement of subsection (1) of this section. A contract or agreement for the disposal of solid waste made between an owner or operator of a disposal site and a person does not affect the authority of the commission to establish or modify the requirements established under subsection (1) of this section.

     (3) For each area outside the state from which a disposal site receives solid waste, the disposal site has two years after first accepting solid waste from the area to demonstrate how the area complies with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section. The disposal site operator shall provide written notice to the department prior to first accepting solid waste from outside the state. The requirements of this subsection apply only to contracts entered into after September 9, 1995.

     (4) The commission shall establish by rule the amount of solid waste that may be accepted from outside the county in which the disposal site is located before the person must comply with the requirements set forth in subsection (1) of this section.

     (5) Subject to prior approval of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and a report to the Emergency Board prior to adopting the fee, and within the budget authorized by the Legislative Assembly as that budget may be modified by the Emergency Board, the Department of Environmental Quality may establish a certification fee in accordance with ORS 468.065. The fees may not exceed the cost of the program.

     (6) The certification requirement under subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a person implementing a waste reduction program under ORS 459.055.

     (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to solid waste disposal, if the laws of the state of origin prohibit or restrict the disposal of any kind of solid waste within the state of origin, the prohibition or restriction also applies to the disposal of the solid waste in Oregon. [1987 c.876 §6; 1989 c.541 §3; 1991 c.703 §8; 1991 c.765 §9; 1993 c.560 §38; 1995 c.541 §2; 1997 c.807 §1; 2003 c.14 §291; 2015 c.534 §15]

(1) Each board of county commissioners of a county in which a regional disposal site is operating under provisions of ORS 459.005 to 459.437 may impose a surcharge on the solid waste received at the regional disposal site. The county may negotiate with the owner or operator of the regional disposal site to establish the amount of the surcharge imposed under this subsection. If the regional disposal site is publicly owned, the board of county commissioners shall give priority in expending the moneys to mitigation of adverse impacts on the area in and around the regional disposal site and related transfer stations located in the county including but not limited to rehabilitation and enhancement of the area, development of alternate water systems, road construction and maintenance and mitigation of adverse effects on wildlife and the environment, if provisions to mitigate such adverse impacts are not assured by permit conditions or bond requirements.

     (2) If the parties negotiating a surcharge under subsection (1) of this section do not reach an agreement within 90 days after the Department of Environmental Quality receives an application under ORS 459.235 for a permit for the regional disposal site, the board of county commissioners shall unilaterally impose the following surcharge:

 

(a) For the first 2,000

     tons per day         $         0.75/ton

(b) For each ton between

     2,000 to 4,000 tons

     per day                $         1.00/ton

(c) For each ton above

     4,000 tons per day $         1.25/ton

 

     (3) If a board of county commissioners imposes the surcharge under subsection (2) of this section:

     (a) The surcharge shall be adjusted annually in accordance with the Portland Consumer Price Index;

     (b) Up to 10 percent of the surcharge shall go into a transition fund to be used by the county after the regional disposal site is closed for the purpose of minimizing the dislocation resulting from the loss of revenue from closure of the site; and

     (c) Of that portion of the surcharge not placed into a transition fund under paragraph (b) of this subsection, priority shall be given in expending the moneys to mitigation of adverse impacts on the area in and around the regional disposal site and related transfer stations located in the county including but not limited to rehabilitation and enhancement of the area, development of alternate water systems, road construction and maintenance and mitigation of adverse effects on wildlife and the environment, if provisions to mitigate such adverse impacts are not assured by permit conditions or bond requirements. [1987 c.876 §7; 1993 c.560 §39]

 

     459.311 Charge for remedial action or removal; amount; collection; allocation. A local government unit responsible for conducting a remedial action or removal or related activities under ORS 465.260 at a solid waste disposal site, or a local government unit that contributed solid waste to a solid waste disposal site for which the local government is liable under ORS 465.255 or other applicable law, shall impose a charge to be added to all billings for collection services rendered within the boundaries of that local government unit unless the local government unit provides an equivalent amount of funding through another source. A charge imposed under this section shall be subject to the following requirements:

     (1) The charge shall be:

     (a) An amount equal to a maximum amount of $12 per capita per year and $60 per capita per local government unit;

     (b) Collected for each volumetric or weight unit of solid waste collected;

     (c) Imposed equitably on all persons who dispose of solid waste; and

     (d) For a local government unit imposing and collecting a charge on behalf of another local government unit responsible for remedial action or related activities at a disposal site, an amount that, as a proportion of the total cost, equals the proportion of solid waste the local government unit contributed to such disposal site.

     (2) The charge shall be collected on behalf of the local government unit by solid waste collectors who are subject to franchising, licensing or permitting requirements adopted by the local government unit. Notwithstanding any restriction on rates contained in a franchise or other local regulations, a solid waste collector may add the charge to bills for solid waste collection. The local government unit may enter into an intergovernmental agreement with any other local government unit to provide for imposition and collection of the charge on behalf of the local government unit.

     (3) The solid waste collector shall remit the proceeds of the charge to the local government unit according to procedures adopted by the local government unit by ordinance. However, solid waste collectors shall not be responsible for covering any shortage caused by failure of a customer to pay charges for solid waste collection.

     (4) A local government unit imposing a charge under this subsection may require solid waste collectors to submit reports or other documentation necessary to establish compliance with the requirements of this section or the ordinance adopted by the local government unit. All information contained in such reports relating to the number of accounts served by the solid waste collector or the revenue produced from such accounts shall be exempt from public disclosure.

     (5) A solid waste collector required to collect charges under this section may retain five percent of the charge in order to defray the costs of collecting and accounting for the proceeds of the charge.

     (6) If a person disposes of solid waste at a disposal site within the boundaries of a local government unit imposing a charge under this section without using the services of a solid waste collector, the person shall pay the charge established by this section at the time the person disposes of solid waste at the disposal site. That portion of the charge attributable to administrative costs as provided in subsection (5) of this section shall be retained by the operator of the solid waste disposal site. The operator of the solid waste disposal site shall remit the balance of the charge according to procedures established by ordinance by the local government unit imposing the charge.

     (7) Except for the amount allocated to defray the administrative expenses of a solid waste collector or disposal site operator under subsections (5) and (6) of this section, proceeds of the charge shall be placed into a dedicated local government remedial action fund established by the local government unit and may be used only to pay for remedial action costs. As used in this subsection, “remedial action costs” also includes the cost of retiring debt incurred in connection with a remedial action.

     (8) The amount collected by imposing a charge under this section shall be the amount necessary to fund the local government unit’s remedial action costs at one or more solid waste disposal sites for which the local government unit is responsible for conducting a remedial action or removal or related activities under ORS 465.260, or is liable under ORS 465.255 or other applicable law and necessary administrative expenses incurred under this section, and may include an increment to cover any delinquencies in collections. The amount of the charge may be adjusted from time to time as necessary to maintain the remedial action fund at the level necessary to accommodate the local government unit’s remedial action responsibilities, but may not exceed the maximum amounts provided in subsection (1)(a) of this section.

     (9) Any local government unit located within the boundaries of a metropolitan service district may enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the district to transfer to the district the funding authority granted under this section and the responsibility for performing all remedial action obligations for which the local government unit may be responsible.

     (10) As used in this section, “remedial action,” “remedial action costs” and “removal” have the meaning given those terms in ORS 465.200. [1989 c.833 §137; 1993 c.560 §40; 2007 c.71 §142]

 

     459.315 Definitions for ORS 459.315 to 459.330. As used in ORS 459.315 to 459.330:

LIMITATION ON DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS

 

     Note: Sections 12 to 16 and 18, chapter 653, Oregon Laws 1991, provide:

     Sec. 12. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares:

     (a) It is the policy of this state to minimize the release to the environment of radioactive material resulting from human activities;

     (b) The United States Congress, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the United States Department of Energy and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have adopted measures intended to make possible federal deregulation of certain radioactive material;

     (c) Deregulation would result in virtually unrestricted disposal or release of this radioactive material into land disposal sites, incinerators, transportation systems, waterways, sewage systems, recycling centers, consumer products or other parts of the environment;

     (d) Such dissemination of radioactive material in the environment would represent an unnecessary increased risk to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this state and the environment;

     (e) Such risk would necessitate the implementation of a costly and widespread radiation monitoring system to enable this state to insure that citizens are not exposed to radiation from deregulated radioactive material; and

     (f) Such monitoring and verification of the absence of unacceptable risks resulting from federal deregulation will be more costly to this state than the current regulatory regime.

     (2) Therefore, the State of Oregon hereby declares that radioactive material shall continue to be subject to regulatory control by this state. It is the purpose of sections 12 to 15 of this Act to guarantee that all radioactive material that was subject to regulation by this state, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the United States Department of Energy, the United States Environmental Protection Agency or any other state or federal agency as of January 1, 1989, shall remain subject to regulation by this state and shall be stored and disposed of only in licensed or approved radioactive waste storage or disposal facilities.

     (c) An owner of real property fails to remove waste tires as required by the department.

     (4) The department may abate any danger or nuisance created by waste tires or other waste tire materials by removing or processing the tires or other waste tire materials. Before taking any action to abate the danger or nuisance, the department shall give any persons having the care, custody or control of the waste tires or materials, or owning the property upon which the tires or materials are located, notice of the department’s intentions and order the person to abate the danger or nuisance in a manner approved by the department. After the abatement, the department, upon request, may conduct a hearing according to the provisions of ORS chapter 183 applicable to contested case hearings to determine the financial responsibility of any party involved. If a hearing is not requested, the department may proceed to recover the costs incurred in abating the waste tires or other waste tire materials.

     (5) If a person fails to take action as required under subsection (4) of this section within the time specified the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality may abate the danger or nuisance.

     (7) In lieu of entering an order and conducting a contested case hearing, the department may enter into a stipulation, agreed settlement or consent order with any or all of the applicable parties, allowing the department to enter and remove the waste tires on the property. The stipulation, agreed settlement or consent order also may provide that the parties shall pay to the department either a specified sum of money representing the department’s costs in removing the waste tires from the property, or if the exact amount of the costs are unknown at the time of the agreement, the parties may agree to pay to the department a percentage of the department’s final costs incurred in removing the waste tires from the property. Upon completion of the waste tire removal, the department shall send to the applicable parties a certified statement indicating the total cost of removal and the percentage of the total costs the parties are required to pay to the department. The costs or percentage of costs to be paid by the parties shall be computed according to rules adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission.

     (8) Nothing in ORS 459.705 to 459.790 shall affect the right of any person or local government unit to abate a danger or nuisance or to recover for damages to real property or personal injury related to the transportation, storage or disposal of waste tires. The department may reimburse a person or local government unit for the cost of abatement.

     (9) No state or local government shall be liable for costs or damages as a result of actions taken under the provisions of ORS 459.705 to 459.790.
