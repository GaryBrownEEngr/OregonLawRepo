     (c) The Environmental Quality Commission may temporarily revise the waste recovery goal for a wasteshed downward if the commission determines that a revision is necessary because reasonably available markets do not exist for one or more high-volume recoverable materials, including but not limited to paper, scrap metal, yard debris, wood, glass, food waste and plastic.

     (d) For purposes of providing the opportunity to recycle under ORS 459A.005, the recovery goals provided under this subsection are voluntary and may not be interpreted to authorize the Department of Environmental Quality to require compliance with the goals by a wasteshed.

     (e)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, if the commission or the department initiates efforts to revise the waste recovery goals in this subsection, the department must provide written notice and an opportunity to comment to members of the governing body of each city, county or metropolitan service district within the wastesheds that would be affected by any proposed revisions.

     (B) As used in this paragraph, “governing body” means the council, commission, board or other controlling body, however designated, in which the legislative powers of the city, county or metropolitan service district are vested.

     (3)(a) Recovery rates under this section shall be calculated by dividing the total weight of material recovered by the sum of the total weight of the material recovered plus the total weight of solid waste disposed that was generated in each wasteshed.

     (b) Recovery rates may not include:

     (A) Industrial and manufacturing wastes such as boxboard clippings and metal trim that are recycled before becoming part of a product that has entered the wholesale or retail market.

     (B) Metal demolition debris for which arrangements are made to sell or give the debris to processors before demolition such that it does not enter the solid waste stream.

     (C) Discarded vehicles or parts of vehicles that do not routinely enter the solid waste stream.

     (D) Material recovered for composting or energy recovery from mixed solid waste, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

     (c)(A) In calculating the recovery rates set forth in subsection (2) of this section, commercial, industrial and demolition scrap metal, vehicles, major equipment and home or industrial appliances that are handled or processed for use in manufacturing new products and that do not routinely enter the solid waste stream through land disposal facilities, transfer stations, recycling depots or on-route collection programs may not be counted as material recovery or recycling.

     (B) The Department of Environmental Quality shall annually conduct an industry survey to determine the contribution of post-consumer residential scrap metal, including home appliances, to recycling and recovery levels in a manner that prevents double counting of material recovered.

     (C) Information collected under the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, as it relates specifically to private sector customer lists or specific amounts and types of materials collected or marketed, is confidential and exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478. The department may use and disclose such information in aggregate form.

     (d) As used in this subsection, “solid waste disposed” means the total weight of solid waste disposed other than the following:

     (A) Sewage sludge or septic tank and cesspool pumpings;

     (B) Waste disposed of at an industrial waste disposal site;

     (C) Industrial waste, ash, inert rock, dirt, plaster, asphalt and similar material if delivered to a municipal solid waste disposal site or demolition disposal site and if a record is kept of such deliveries and submitted as part of the annual report submitted under ORS 459A.050;

     (D) Waste received at an ash monofill from an energy recovery facility; and

     (E) Solid waste not generated within this state.

     (4)(a) If there is not a viable market for recycling a material, the composting or burning of the material for energy recovery may be included in the recovery rate for the wasteshed calculated under subsection (3) of this subsection.

     (b) If the material is burned for energy recovery and then included in the recovery rate for Clackamas, Multnomah or Washington Counties in aggregate or for Benton, Lane, Linn, Marion, Polk or Yamhill County wastesheds, the same material, when burned as part of mixed solid waste, may be included in the recovery rate for a wasteshed that burns mixed solid waste for energy recovery. The amount of the material within the mixed solid waste that may be included in the recovery rate for energy recovery shall be determined by a waste composition study performed by the wasteshed at least every six years.

     (c) Mixtures of materials that are composted or burned for energy recovery may not be included in the recovery rate if more than half of the mixed materials by weight could have been recycled if properly source separated.

     (d) In its annual report to the department, the county or metropolitan service district shall state how much composting or energy recovery under this subsection is included as recovery and state the basis for the determination that there was not a viable market for recycling the material.

     (e) As used in this subsection, “viable market” means a person located within a wasteshed that will pay for the material or accept the material free of charge or a person located outside a wasteshed that will pay a price for the material that, at minimum, covers the cost of transportation of the material.

     (5) As an alternative to achieving the weight-based recovery goals described in this section, wastesheds may achieve outcome-based recovery goals as adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission in accordance with ORS 459A.012. [1991 c.385 §2; 1993 c.560 §74; 1995 c.541 §3; 1997 c.552 §9; 2001 c.513 §2; 2015 c.534 §7]

 

     459A.012 Alternative recovery rate calculation methods; rules. (1)(a) The Environmental Quality Commission shall develop and adopt by rule a method for calculating recovery rates based on the rate of energy savings achieved by recovering materials from the general solid waste stream. The calculation method must account for:

     (A) The energy savings achieved from material recovery, as opposed to material disposal;

     (B) Recovery of energy from waste, including methane recovery at landfills; and

     (C) Energy saving practices implemented as part of local solid waste reduction, reuse and recycling programs or solid waste management programs, including but not limited to:

     (i) Fuel, efficiency and other improvements involving waste collection vehicles;

     (ii) Energy efficiency improvements at recycling and solid waste facilities; and

     (iii) Production of energy from renewable sources at solid waste facilities through means other than recovery of energy from waste, such as the use of solar energy to produce electricity.

     (b) A recovery rate of 100 percent under the calculation method is equivalent to the energy savings achieved if all materials in the general solid waste stream are directed to their optimal final destinations for purposes of the energy savings that can be achieved through the recovery of each type of material.

     (2) Using the calculation method developed under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall adopt by rule recovery goals consistent with the goals under ORS 459A.010 (1) and (2).

     (3)(a) The commission may develop and adopt by rule other methods for calculating recovery rates from the general solid waste stream that are based on achieving outcomes that result from waste recovery and management, and may include but are not limited to the following:

     (A) Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

     (B) Reductions in the emissions of toxic or potentially toxic chemicals.

     (C) Water conservation.

     (b) The commission may adopt by rule other outcome-based recovery goals consistent with the goals under ORS 459A.010 (1) and (2) using outcome-based calculation methods developed under this subsection. [2015 c.534 §9]

     459A.027 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

     (1) Public and private recycling programs that collect source separated recyclable materials from residences and from commercial and institutional establishments on a schedule that is convenient to the generator, are effective and efficient methods of recovering recyclable material in the ongoing effort to achieve the solid waste recovery goals of the State of Oregon; and

     (2) An effective way to support the efforts of local government units responsible for implementing solid waste programs directed at achieving solid waste recovery goals is by using existing state resources to support local recycling programs through grants. [1997 c.552 §7]

 

     459A.029 Provision of materials to local governments; commercial generator recovery rate goal. (1) The Department of Environmental Quality shall work with local government units to provide educational and promotional materials that local government units may distribute to commercial generators of solid waste. The educational and promotional materials should be targeted to businesses and include reasons to recycle, including economic benefits, common barriers to recycling and solutions to the barriers, additional resources for commercial generators and other information designed to assist and encourage meeting the state’s 55 percent recovery rate.

     (2) Each wasteshed is encouraged to involve local business organizations in publicly recognizing outstanding recycling efforts by commercial generators of solid waste. The recognition may include awards designed to provide additional incentives to increase recycling efforts.

     (3) Each commercial generator of solid waste shall strive to achieve 55 percent recovery from its solid waste stream by 2025.

     (4) The Legislative Assembly encourages local government units that have chosen to implement commercial recycling programs to evaluate the effectiveness of those programs. The effectiveness of a program may be determined by measuring solid waste diverted by programs, by participation in programs or by some other method. [1997 c.552 §8; 2015 c.534 §16]

 

     459A.030 Technical assistance to local governments. The Department of Environmental Quality shall provide technical assistance to cities, counties or metropolitan service districts in the development, revision, amendment and implementation of local solid waste reduction, reuse and recycling and waste prevention programs and solid waste management programs that comply with the opportunity to recycle established in ORS 459A.005 and 459A.007. The department shall give special emphasis to assisting rural and remote counties. [1991 c.385 §52; 1993 c.560 §78; 2015 c.534 §17]

 

     459A.035 Solid waste composition study. The Department of Environmental Quality shall conduct a solid waste composition study to determine the quantities and sources of different materials disposed of in the waste stream at least once every three biennia for all areas of the state not covered by other solid waste composition studies.

     459A.060 [1991 c.385 §4; 1997 c.552 §15; repealed by 2001 c.513 §6]

 

     459A.065 Mandatory participation in recycling. (1) Upon findings made under subsection (3) of this section, the Environmental Quality Commission may require one or more classes of solid waste generators within all or part of a wasteshed to recycle identified recyclable material that has been source separated from other solid waste or otherwise make the material available for recycling.

     (2) In determining which materials are recyclable for purposes of mandatory participation, the cost of recycling from commercial or industrial sources shall include the generator’s cost of source separating or otherwise making the material available for recycling or reuse.

     (3) Before requiring solid waste generators to participate in recycling under this section, the commission must find, after a public hearing, that:

     (a) The opportunity to recycle has been provided for a reasonable period of time and the level of participation by generators does not fulfill the policy set forth in ORS 459.015;

     (b) The mandatory participation program is economically feasible within the affected wasteshed or portion of the wasteshed; and

     (c) The mandatory participation program is the only practical alternative to carry out the policy set forth in ORS 459.015.

     (4) After a mandatory participation program is established for a class of generators of solid waste, no person within the identified class of generators shall put solid waste out to be collected nor dispose of solid waste at a disposal site unless the person has separated the identified recyclable material according to the requirements of the mandatory participation program and made the recyclable material available for recycling. [Formerly 459.188; 1993 c.560 §82; 2001 c.513 §3]

 

     459A.070 Limitation on amount charged person who source separates recyclable material. (1) A collection service or disposal site may charge a person who source separates recyclable material and makes it available for reuse or recycling less, but not more, for collection and disposal of solid waste and collection of recyclable material than the collection service charges a person who does not source separate recyclable material.

     (2) A collection service or disposal site may charge a person who does not have solid waste collection service but who source separates recyclable material and makes the material available for reuse or recycling, for the cost of providing that service. In no case shall the charge be greater than the charge to collect or dispose of that material as solid waste. [Formerly 459.190]

 

     459A.075 Exemptions. Nothing in ORS 459.005, 459.015, 459.035, 459.250, 459.992, 459.995 and 459A.005 to 459A.665 applies to recyclable material which is:

     (1) Source separated by the generator; and

     (2) Purchased from or exchanged by the generator for fair market value for recycling or reuse. [Formerly 459.192]

 

     459A.080 Prohibitions against removing or mixing recyclable material. A person may not:

     (1) Without the permission of the owner or generator of recyclable material, take recyclable material set out to be collected by a person authorized by a city or county to provide collection service for that recyclable material.

     (2) Remove any recyclable material from a container, box, collection vehicle, depot or other receptacle for the accumulation or storage of recyclable material without permission of the owner of the receptacle.

     (3) Mix source separated recyclable material with solid waste in any vehicle, box, container or receptacle used in solid waste collection or disposal. [Formerly 459.195]

(1) The Legislative Assembly finds that providing for collection service including but not limited to the collection of recyclable material as part of the opportunity to recycle is a matter of statewide concern.

     (2) The exercise of the authority granted by this section is subject to ORS 221.735 and 459.085 (3).

     (3) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that a city or county may displace competition with a system of regulated collection service by issuing franchises which may be exclusive if service areas are allocated. The city or county may recognize an existing collection service. A city or county may award or renew a franchise for collection service with or without bids or requests for proposals.

     (4) In carrying out the authority granted by this section, a city or county acts for and on behalf of the State of Oregon to carry out:

     (a) The purposes of ORS 459.015;

     (b) The requirements of ORS 459.005, 459.015, 459.035, 459.250, 459.992 (1) and (2), 459.995 and 459A.005 to 459A.665;

     (c) Waste reduction programs; and

     (d) The state solid waste management plan.

     (5) After October 15, 1983, a city or a county may continue, extend or renew an existing franchise or grant a new franchise for collection service. If a city or county, in furtherance of ORS 459.005 to 459.426, 459.705 to 459.790 and 459A.005 to 459A.665, has granted a collection service franchise before October 15, 1983, it may treat the franchise as if adopted under this section.

     (6)(a) If a collection service franchise is continued, extended, renewed or granted on or after October 15, 1983, the opportunity to recycle shall be provided to a franchise holder’s customers no later than July 1, 1986. This subsection does not apply to that portion of the opportunity to recycle provided at or in connection with a disposal site under ORS 459.250.

     (b) The opportunity to recycle may be provided by:

     (A) The person holding the franchise;

     (B) Another person who provides the opportunity to recycle to the franchise holder’s customers; or

     (C) A person who is granted a separate franchise from the city or county solely for the purpose of providing the opportunity to recycle.

     (c) In determining who shall provide the opportunity to recycle, a city or county shall first give due consideration to any person lawfully providing recycling or collection service on June 1, 1983, if the person continues to provide the service until the date the determination is made and the person has not discontinued the service for a period of 90 days or more between June 1, 1983, and the date the city or county makes the determination.

     (7) In granting a collection service franchise, the city or county may:

     (a) Prescribe the quality and character of and rates for collection service and the minimum requirements to guarantee maintenance of service, determine level of service, select persons to provide collection service and establish a system to pay for collection service.

     (b) Divide the regulated area into service areas, grant franchises to persons for collection service within the service areas and collect fees from persons holding such franchises.

     (8) The rates established under this section shall be just and reasonable and adequate to provide necessary collection service. The rates established by the city or county shall allow the person holding the franchise to recover any additional costs of providing the opportunity to recycle at the minimum level required by ORS 459.005, 459.015, 459.035, 459.250, 459.992 (1) and (2), 459.995 and 459A.005 to 459A.665 or at a higher level of recycling required by or permitted by the city or county. The rates shall also allow the person to recover the costs of education, promotion and notice of the opportunity to recycle provided by a person holding a franchise.

     (9) Instead of providing funding for the opportunity to recycle through rates established pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, a city or county may provide an alternative method of funding all or part of the opportunity to recycle.

     (10) In establishing service areas, the city or county shall consider:

     (a) The policies contained in ORS 459.015;

     (b) The requirements of ORS 459.250 and 459A.005 to 459A.665;

     (c) Any applicable local or regional solid waste management plan approved by the Department of Environmental Quality;

     (d) Any applicable waste reduction plan approved by the department; and

     (e) The need to conserve energy, increase efficiency, provide the opportunity to recycle, reduce truck traffic and improve safety.

     (11) A city or county may further restrict competition by permitting one or more collection service franchise holders to cooperate to provide the opportunity to recycle if the city or county finds that such cooperation will:

     (a) Improve collection service efficiency;

     (b) Guarantee an adequate volume of material to improve the feasibility and effectiveness of recycling;

     (c) Increase the stability of recycling markets; or

     (d) Encourage joint marketing of materials or joint education and promotion efforts.

     (12) The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of any other authority granted to a city or county. A city or county’s exercise of authority under this section is not intended to create any presumption regarding an activity of the local government unit not addressed in this section. This section shall not be construed to mean that it is the policy of Oregon that other local government activities may not be exercised in a manner that supplants or limits economic competition. [Formerly 459.200; 1993 c.560 §84]

If for any year thereafter, the department determines that the aggregate rate is less than 25 percent, the department also shall determine whether the recycling rate for compliance for rigid plastic containers made from the major resin types is 25 percent or more.

     (2) If the recycling rate for rigid plastic containers in the aggregate determined by the department for compliance purposes is less than 25 percent for 1996 or any subsequent year, the department shall present relevant information regarding the decrease in the rate to the appropriate legislative committees or interim committees. The legislative committees shall hold hearings to determine the factors that caused the rate to decrease, including a review of the status of collection programs in the state and the capacity available to process rigid plastic containers collected and reclaim the resin from the collected containers. [1995 c.584 §2; 1997 c.552 §16]

 

     459A.660 Manufacturer records; certification by package manufacturer; exempt containers. (1) Each product manufacturer and package manufacturer shall maintain the records specified in this section that demonstrate for all rigid plastic containers of the manufacturer, how the manufacturer has complied with one or more of the requirements of ORS 459A.655, or for what reason, if any, the containers are exempt under subsection (5) of this section for the applicable period of time. Proprietary information included in the records, if submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality under this section shall not be made available to the general public. The records documenting the compliance shall be submitted to the department upon its request. Each manufacturer required to keep records under this section may be audited by the department. The department shall not take enforcement action, audit or request copies of the records kept by a manufacturer under this section before January 1, 1996, and until the department calculates the recycling rates in ORS 459A.655 (2) for the calendar year 1995.

     (2) To the extent a rigid plastic container complies with ORS 459A.655 (1)(c) or (2)(c) because the product manufacturer’s particular product-associated package or all of the product manufacturer’s rigid plastic containers are being reused under ORS 459A.655 (1)(c) or recycled in the state at the rate specified in ORS 459A.655 (2)(c), the product manufacturer shall keep records that include the information the department may require to determine the product manufacturer’s compliance.

     (3) To the extent a rigid plastic container complies with ORS 459A.655 (1)(a) or (b) or (2)(a) or (b), the package manufacturer shall keep records that include the information the department may require to determine the package manufacturer’s compliance.

     (4) If subsection (3) of this section applies, the product manufacturer also shall maintain a record of the written certification by the package manufacturer that the rigid plastic containers comply with ORS 459A.655 (1)(a) or (b) or (2)(a) or (b). The certification also shall state that the package manufacturer will maintain the records required in subsection (3) of this section, and upon request of the department, submit to the department records that include the information the department may require to determine compliance. The product manufacturer may rely on the certification as a defense in any action or proceeding for violation of or to enforce ORS 459A.650 to 459A.665, whether such action or proceeding is brought under ORS 459.992, 459.995 or under any other law.

     (5) Rigid plastic containers are exempt from the requirements of ORS 459A.655 if the containers are not subject to the requirements of ORS 459A.700 to 459A.740 and if:

     (a) The containers contain drugs, medical devices, medical food or infant formula as defined by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.

     (b) The packages are associated with products produced in or brought into the state that are destined for shipment to other destinations outside the state and that remain with such products upon such shipment.

     (c) The packaging is necessary to provide tamper-resistant seals for public health purposes.

     (d) The packages are reduced packages. A package shall qualify as reduced when the ratio of package weight per unit of product has been reduced by at least 10 percent when compared with the packaging used for the same product by the same packager five years earlier. In no case may packaging reduction be achieved, for purposes of this paragraph, by substituting a different material category for a material that constituted a substantial part of the packaging in question, or by packaging changes that adversely impact either the potential for the package to be recycled or contain recycled material. Exemptions under this paragraph shall be limited to five years, shall not be renewable and shall not be applicable to packages for which the ratio of package weight per unit of product increased after January 1, 1990.

     (e) There has been substantial investment in achieving the recycling goal, viable markets for the material, if collected, can be demonstrated, the material is within five percent of the goal, there is substantial evidence of accelerating recycling rates and reasonable projections show that the material will meet the goal within two years.

     (f) The containers contain food. A container shall be considered to contain food if it contains an article used, or intended to be used, for food, ice, confection or condiment, whether simple or compound, or any part or ingredient thereof or in the preparation thereof, and for human consumption, but a container shall not be considered to contain food if it contains a drinkable liquid and is a rigid plastic bottle. As used in this paragraph, “rigid plastic bottle” means a container that has a mouth narrower than its base.

     (6) For any rigid plastic container not described in subsection (3) of this section, each product manufacturer shall keep records that include the information the department may require as evidence that the container is exempt from the requirements of ORS 459A.655.

     (7) The department shall not enforce the provisions of ORS 459A.650 to 459A.660 during the first full calendar year after the department determines for the first time that the rate for compliance for rigid plastic containers in the aggregate is less than 25 percent. For any period for which the department determines that the rate for compliance for rigid plastic containers in the aggregate equals or exceeds 25 percent, product manufacturers and package manufacturers are not required to keep records under this section and are not required to comply with the requirements of ORS 459A.655 (1)(a) and (c) and (2)(b) and (c). [1991 c.385 §34c; 1993 c.560 §98; 1993 c.563 §1; 1993 c.568 §3; 1995 c.584 §§3,4]

 

     459A.665 Opportunity to recycle rigid plastic containers. A local government shall provide the opportunity to recycle rigid plastic containers in metropolitan and urban wastesheds when there is a stable market price for those containers that equals or exceeds 75 percent of the necessary and reasonable collection costs for those containers.
