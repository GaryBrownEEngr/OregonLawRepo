      (10) Payments made according to the terms of a deceased prize winner’s signed beneficiary designation form filed with the commission are effective by reason of the contract involved and this statute and are not to be considered as testamentary devices or subject to ORS chapter 112. The director, commission and state shall be discharged of all liability upon payment of a prize.

      (11) In accordance with the provisions of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 U.S.C. 3935, a person while in active military service may claim exemption from the one-year ticket redemption requirement under subsection (7) of this section.

[2015 c.316 §2]

 

      461.253 Voluntary assignment of prizes; petition for judicial order; issuance of order; commission intervention in proceeding. (1) Payment of a prize may be made to any person pursuant to a voluntary assignment of the right to receive future periodic prize payments, in whole or in part. Payment of a prize pursuant to an assignment made under this section must be made to a person designated as assignee under an appropriate judicial order of the circuit court for the county in which the assignor resides or in which the headquarters of the Oregon State Lottery Commission are located.

      (2) A copy of the petition for an order described in subsection (1) of this section and copies of all notices of any hearing in the matter shall be served on the commission not later than 10 days prior to any hearing or entry of any order.

      (3) The commission may intervene in a proceeding to protect the interests of the commission but shall not be considered an indispensable or necessary party.

      (4) A circuit court receiving a petition may issue an order approving the assignment and directing the commission to pay to the assignee all future prize payments so assigned upon finding that all of the following conditions have been met:

      (a) The assignment has been memorialized in writing and executed by the assignor and is subject to Oregon law;

      (b) The assignor provides a sworn declaration to the court attesting that the assignor is represented by independent legal counsel in connection with the assignment, has had the opportunity to receive independent financial and tax advice concerning the effects of the assignment, is of sound mind and is not acting under duress;

      (c) The proposed assignment does not and will not include or cover payments or portions of payments that are subject to a 30-day hold under ORS 461.715, unless appropriate provision is made in the order to satisfy the obligations giving rise to the hold; and

      (d) The proposed assignment and court order shall not require the commission to divide any prize payment so that portions of a single prize payment must be made to more than three persons at a time.

      (5) After receipt of a certified copy of a court order granted under this section, the commission shall acknowledge in writing to both the assignor and the assignee the agreement of the commission to make the prize payments in accordance with the provisions of the order. The commission shall thereafter make the prize payments in accordance with the order.

      (6) No modification or amendment to any assignment authorized by this section, and no additional or subsequent assignment of any prize, shall be valid or binding on the commission unless the modification, amendment or assignment is authorized by a separate judicial order issued in compliance with this section.

Notwithstanding ORS 461.250 (8) or 461.253, if it is ever determined that prize winners who do not seek to assign their prize payments are subject to immediate income taxes on the prize payments just as if those prize winners had so assigned their prizes, the Oregon State Lottery Commission may intervene in a proceeding commenced under ORS 461.253 in order to raise the issue of adverse tax consequences in the proceeding. If the court determines that ORS 461.250 (8) and 461.253 or the issuance of an order approving an assignment of prize payments subjects prize winners who do not seek assignment of prize payments to immediate income taxes on their prize payments, the court shall refuse to authorize an assignment and shall issue an order that ORS 461.250 (8) and 461.253 are suspended and are of no force or effect so long as such determination and adverse tax consequences are in effect. An order issued by a court under this section shall suspend ORS 461.250 (8) and 461.253 throughout this state. An order issued under this section shall be final and shall remain in effect unless or until overturned or modified by a subsequent court order or the order of a reviewing court. [1995 c.478 §5; 2003 c.58 §6]

LOTTERY GAME RETAILERS

 

      461.300 Selection of retailers; rules; contracts. (1) The Oregon State Lottery Commission shall adopt rules specifying the terms and conditions for contracting with lottery game retailers so as to provide adequate and convenient availability of tickets or shares to prospective buyers of each lottery game as appropriate for each such game. Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude the lottery from selling tickets or shares directly to the public.

      (2)(a) The Director of the Oregon State Lottery shall, pursuant to this chapter, and the rules of the commission, select as lottery game retailers such persons as deemed to best serve the public convenience and promote the sale of tickets or shares. A person under the age of 18 may not be a lottery game retailer. In the selection of a lottery game retailer, the director shall consider factors such as financial responsibility, integrity, reputation, accessibility of the place of business or activity to the public, security of the premises, the sufficiency of existing lottery game retailers for any particular lottery game to serve the public convenience and the projected volume of sales for the lottery game involved.

      (b) Except when the director recommends, and the commission concludes, that it is reasonable and prudent to waive disclosure requirements under this section and that to do so will not jeopardize the fairness, integrity, security and honesty of the lottery, prior to the execution of any contract with a lottery game retailer, the lottery game retailer shall disclose to the lottery the names and addresses of the following:

      (A) If the lottery game retailer is a corporation but not a nonprofit private club as described in ORS 471.175, the officers, each director who owns or controls three percent or more of the voting stock and each stockholder who owns 10 percent or more of the outstanding stock in such corporation.

      (B) If the lottery game retailer is a trust, the trustee and all persons entitled to receive income or benefit from the trust.

      (C) If the lottery game retailer is an association but not a nonprofit private club as described in ORS 471.175, the members, officers and directors.

      (D) If the lottery game retailer is a subsidiary but not a nonprofit private club as described in ORS 471.175, the officers, each director who owns or controls three percent or more of the voting stock and each stockholder who owns 10 percent or more of the outstanding stock of the parent corporation thereof.

      (E) If the lottery game retailer is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company, all of the general partners, limited partners, joint venturers, members of a limited liability company whose investment commitment or membership interest is 10 percent or more, and managers of a limited liability company.

      (F) If the parent company, general partner, limited partner, joint venturer, stockholder, member or manager of a limited liability company is itself a corporation, trust, association, subsidiary, partnership, joint venture or limited liability company, then the director may require that all of the information required by this paragraph be disclosed for such other entity as if it were itself a lottery game retailer to the end that full disclosure of ultimate ownership be achieved.

      (G) If any member, 18 years of age or older, of the immediate family of any video lottery game retailer, or any member, 18 years of age or older, of the immediate family of any individual whose name is required to be disclosed under this paragraph, is involved in the video lottery game retailer’s business in any capacity, then all of the information required in this paragraph shall be disclosed for such immediate family member as if the family member were a video lottery game retailer.

      (H) If any immediate family member, 18 years of age or older, of any lottery game retailer, other than a video lottery game retailer, or of any person whose name is required to be disclosed under this paragraph is involved in the lottery game retailer’s business in any capacity, then the lottery game retailer shall identify the immediate family member to the Oregon State Lottery, and shall report the capacity in which the immediate family member is involved in the lottery game retailer’s business if requested by the director. Full disclosure of immediate family members working in the business may be required only if the director has just cause for believing the immediate family member may be a threat to the fairness, integrity, security or honesty of the lottery.

      (I) If the lottery game retailer is a nonprofit private club as described in ORS 471.175, the treasurer, officers, directors and trustees who oversee or direct the operation of the food, beverage, lottery or other gambling-related activities of the nonprofit private club and each manager in charge of the food, beverage, lottery or other gambling-related activities of the nonprofit private club.

      (J) Any other person required by rule of the commission.

      (c) Any person required to disclose information under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall disclose additional information for retail contract approval that the director determines to be appropriate.

      (d) The commission may refuse to grant a lottery game retail contract to any lottery game retailer or any natural person whose name is required to be disclosed under paragraph (b) of this subsection, who has been convicted of violating any of the gambling laws of this state, general or local, or has been convicted at any time of any crime. The lottery may require payment by each lottery game retailer to the lottery of an initial nonrefundable application fee or an annual fee, or both, to maintain the contract to be a lottery game retailer.

      (e) A person who is a lottery game retailer may not be engaged exclusively in the business of selling lottery tickets or shares. A person lawfully engaged in nongovernmental business on state or political subdivision property or an owner or lessee of premises which lawfully sells alcoholic beverages may be selected as a lottery game retailer. State agencies, except for the state lottery, political subdivisions or their agencies or departments may not be selected as a lottery game retailer. The director may contract with lottery game retailers on a permanent, seasonal or temporary basis.

      (3) The authority to act as a lottery game retailer is not assignable or transferable.

      (4) The director may terminate a contract with a lottery game retailer based on the grounds for termination included in the contract or commission rules governing the contract. The grounds for termination must include, but are not limited to, the knowing sale of lottery tickets or shares to any person under the age of 18 years or knowingly permitting a person under the age of 21 years to operate a video lottery game terminal.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, when a lottery game retail contract requires the lottery game retailer to maintain a minimum weekly sales average, the lottery game retailer may avoid termination of the contract for failure to meet the minimum weekly sales average by agreeing, prior to termination, to pay the state lottery the difference between the actual weekly cost incurred by the lottery to maintain the contract and the weekly proceeds that are collected by the lottery from the sales of that lottery game retailer, less expenses that are dedicated by statute, rule or contract to other purposes. The director may not terminate the contract of a lottery game retailer for failure to meet a minimum weekly sales average unless the director first allows the lottery game retailer an opportunity to make the payment described in this subsection.

      (6) The commission shall adopt by rule an alternative dispute resolution process for disputes arising from a contract with a lottery game retailer that must be included in every contract between the commission and lottery game retailers. The commission shall develop the dispute resolution process required by this section in conformity with ORS 183.502.

Until the commission shall otherwise determine, the compensation paid to lottery game retailers shall be five percent of the retail price of the tickets or shares plus an incentive bonus of one percent based on attainment of sales volume or other objectives specified by the director for each lottery game. In cases of a lottery game retailer whose rental payments for premises are contractually computed in whole or in part, on the basis of a percentage of retail sales, and where such computation of retail sales is not explicitly defined to include sales of tickets or shares in a state-operated lottery, the compensation received by the lottery game retailer from the Oregon State Lottery shall be deemed to be the amount of the retail sale for the purposes of such contractual computation.

      (3) No payment by lottery game retailers to the lottery for tickets or shares shall be in cash. All such payments shall be in the form of a check, bank draft, electronic fund transfer or other recorded financial instrument as determined by the director.

A temporary letter of authority issued under this section does not constitute a lottery game retail contract for the purposes of ORS 461.300.

      (2) The commission, summarily and without prior administrative proceedings, may revoke a temporary letter of authority any time during the 90 days if the commission finds that any of the grounds for refusing a lottery game retail contract or terminating a contract under ORS 461.300 exist.

      (3) A person subject to subsection (2) of this section shall be given an interview under the direction of the commission if the person requests an interview prior to revocation of a temporary letter of authority.
