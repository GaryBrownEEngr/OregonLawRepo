      (5) When a licensee under ORS 462.062 or 462.067 is prevented from conducting a race meet for the authorized number of days, the commission, upon written request therefor, may refund to the licensee the daily license fee based upon the number of days lost for good cause shown. The commission is the sole judge of good cause.

[1955 c.641 §1; 1957 c.313 §5; 1969 c.356 §15; 1973 c.612 §20; 1979 c.330 §2; 1981 c.544 §18; 1987 c.413 §4; 1995 c.260 §1; 1997 c.865 §6]

      (4) Revocation of a license shall operate as a forfeiture of all rights and privileges granted by the commission and of all sums of money paid to the commission by the offender.

      (5) When grounds exist for the revocation or suspension of a license issued pursuant to this chapter, the commission may, in its discretion, impose a civil penalty, not in excess of $1,000, on the licensee in lieu of or in addition to revoking or suspending the license. All sums paid the commission pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited as provided in ORS 462.260.

      (6) Civil penalties under this section shall be imposed as provided in ORS 183.745. [Subsection (5) enacted as 1953 c.499 §3; 1957 c.313 §7; 1969 c.356 §17; 1973 c.612 §22; 1981 c.544 §19; 1983 s.s. c.7 §7; 1987 c.413 §6; 1991 c.734 §33; 1997 c.865 §7]

      462.110 Public liability insurance required; bond of licensee; actions on bond; insurance for jockeys and drivers. (1) For the protection of the public, and all members thereof, the exhibitors and visitors, every race meet licensee shall carry public liability insurance written on an approved form by a company licensed to do business in Oregon and in an amount approved by the Oregon Racing Commission.

      (2) Every person licensed to conduct a race meet shall provide and deliver to the commission a bond signed by a surety company authorized to do business in Oregon in such form as is required by the commission and in an amount determined by the commission.

      (3) The Attorney General or the district attorney of the county wherein the race meet is held shall prosecute all actions on such bonds on behalf of the state.

      (4) Any person having a claim against the licensee for any obligation covered by the bond or bond substitute, except cause of action covered by public liability insurance, may prosecute the same in an action in behalf of the claimant brought in the name of the state for the use and benefit and at the expense of such claimant. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this subsection. If the amount of the bond or bond substitute is insufficient to cover all obligations, amounts owing to and for the benefit of the state pursuant to ORS 462.073 (3) shall have priority over any other claims. No action may be brought for recovery on the bond or bond substitute unless written notice of the claim is made to the commission and to the race meet licensee within 120 days after the last day of the race meet or continuous race meet in which the obligation arose. The notice must be by registered mail, certified mail with return receipt or personal service to the licensee or to the licensee’s registered agent. Any action for recovery on the bond or bond substitute must be brought no earlier than 60 days and no later than 180 days after service of the written notice on the race meet licensee or on the licensee’s registered agent. These limitations shall not apply to claims for valid winning tickets if the claimant has made a timely claim pursuant to ORS 462.073 (2).

      (5) Every person licensed to conduct a race meet for horses shall carry insurance to protect jockeys and, if appropriate, drivers.

      462.125 Number and classes of race meets; unused race days; conflicting race dates. (1) The Oregon Racing Commission shall determine the number and classes of race meets to be held in any fiscal year, and the total number of racing dates to be granted to a licensee subject to provisions of ORS 462.062 and 462.067. Not more than 350 days of racing, exclusive of racing days authorized to designated licensees pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, shall be held in any metropolitan area in any fiscal year. A licensee shall conduct at least 720 live races under the license during each fiscal year race meets are held under the license. The commission may reduce the number of races required under this section upon application by a horsemen’s association that negotiates with the race meet licensee.

      (2) If a licensee under ORS 462.062 or 462.067 fails, for good cause, to complete all of the allocated days in a licensed race meet or if the commission does not receive and approve license applications for all of the days allocated to either class of racing, the commission may add the unused or unallocated days no later than June 30 of the following fiscal year, to the racing days allocated to and available to the licensee or, in the discretion of the commission, to any other licensee of either class of racing in the metropolitan area. Additional race days allocated under this subsection are exempt from the limit of 350 days of racing in a fiscal year imposed by subsection (1) of this section. The additional racing days granted by the commission to any eligible licensee may not exceed the total of the unused or unallocated racing days in any one fiscal year.

      (3) If an emergency occurs on the day of racing, and a night racing program runs past the hour of midnight, such time after midnight is not considered an additional racing day.

      (4) As used in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, “metropolitan area” means:

      (a) Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington Counties.

      (b) Marion and Polk Counties.

      (c) Linn and Benton Counties.

      (d) A county other than those designated in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection.

      (5) Each licensee designated in ORS 462.057 may be granted up to 12 days of horse, mule or greyhound racing to be held within the county in which the licensee holds its fair or show or at a race course owned by a governmental agency or a nonprofit corporation in an adjoining county. If a licensee does not use all of the licensee’s allocated race days during the fiscal year, the commission, in the commission’s discretion, may allow that licensee to use the leftover days in the next fiscal year. If a licensee referred to in this subsection wishes to make application to the commission to schedule racing days that conflict with racing days previously scheduled by another such licensee, at least 30 days prior to the date of a meeting of the commission, the governing bodies of the applicant and the previous licensee shall meet at a time and place prescribed by the previous licensee to discuss the applicant’s proposed racing day schedule. The conclusion of the parties regarding the proposals for conflicting racing days and the matters upon which the parties agree or disagree shall be reduced to writing signed by the parties and submitted to the commission not later than 14 days prior to a meeting of the commission. The commission may approve or disapprove proposals for conflicting racing days upon such terms and conditions as the commission considers appropriate.

      (6) The commission may not grant a license for any race meet within a county for dates that conflict with racing dates granted to the county fair of such county.

      (7) The commission may not grant a licensee that is subject to ORS 462.062 a license for a race meet for a date that conflicts with a race meet date granted to a licensee that is subject to ORS 462.057, unless the commission has the consent of the licensee that is subject to ORS 462.057. This subsection applies only if the licensee that is subject to ORS 462.057 held a race meet during the 2002 calendar year on a date substantially similar to the date that is the subject of the conflict. A licensee that is subject to ORS 462.057 may not unreasonably withhold consent under this subsection.

Such racing must be sponsored by the Oregon Quarter Horse Racing Association, Incorporated, or the Oregon Division Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, and the net licensee income shall be used only for the payment of purses to horsemen participating at the meeting. The commission shall schedule the racing for the Oregon Quarter Horse Racing Association, Incorporated, and the Oregon Division Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, in such a manner as to avoid conflict with other race meets previously licensed under ORS 462.057. The Oregon Quarter Horse Racing Association, Incorporated, and the Oregon Division Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, shall make payments as specified in ORS 462.057 (1).

      (2) Racing days granted pursuant to this section may not be included in the number of racing days counted for purposes of the 350-day limitation established in ORS 462.125. [1979 c.698 §9; 1981 c.544 §10; 1985 c.54 §1; 2003 c.14 §296; 2003 c.783 §2; 2007 c.177 §5]

      (4) In addition to other grounds provided in this chapter, the commission may refuse to issue or renew or may revoke or suspend the license of any race meet licensee, or any employee thereof, for failure to comply with ORS 462.700 to 462.740 or commission rules.

      (b) ORS 462.080, 462.190 and 462.195 apply to the race meet licensee and to individuals at the facility in the same manner as if the mutuel wagering activity were being conducted at a race course.

      (6) In addition to other requirements of ORS 462.700 to 462.740, the commission may authorize a race meet licensee to conduct off-race course mutuel wagering on a particular race that is held at a race course outside this state subject to the following conditions:

      (B) A greyhound race meet licensee may conduct off-race course mutuel wagering on horse races only if there is no active horse race meet licensee.

      (d) If a licensee applies for authority to conduct mutuel wagering on horse races held at race courses outside this state, the commission may require that the licensee provide such evidence as the commission considers appropriate regarding the ability of the licensee to comply with the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. 3001 to 3007, as amended.

      462.720 Pooling wagered moneys; surcharge on wagering by licensee. (1) All moneys wagered in off-race course mutuel wagering on races held at race courses in this state shall be included in the computation of the mutuel pool for that race at the race course. Subject to rules adopted by the Oregon Racing Commission and upon application of the race meet licensee, the commission may authorize:

      (b) Moneys wagered in off-race course mutuel wagering at locations in this state on races held at race courses outside this state to be included in the computation of the mutuel pool for the race at the race course.

      (3) A race meet licensee that is authorized to conduct off-race course mutuel wagering may exact a surcharge on off-race course mutuel wagering at a rate not exceeding five percent. At the discretion of the race meet licensee, the surcharge shall be paid by the wagerer on the amount wagered to the race meet licensee at the time the wager is made, or the surcharge shall be paid on the winnings and shall be deducted at the time winnings are paid. All surcharges collected by the race meet licensee shall be reported to the commission at such time and in such manner as the commission may require.
