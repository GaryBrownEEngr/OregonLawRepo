     465.006 Policy. (1) In the interest of protecting the public health, safety and the environment, the Legislative Assembly declares that it is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage reduction in the use of toxic substances and to reduce the generation of hazardous waste whenever technically and economically practicable, without shifting risks from one part of a process, environmental media or product to another. Priority shall be given to methods that reduce the amount of toxics used and, where that is not technically and economically practicable, methods that reduce the generation of hazardous waste.

     (2) The Legislative Assembly finds that the best means to achieve the policy set forth in subsection (1) of this section is by:

     (a) Providing toxics users and generators with technical assistance;

     (b) Requiring toxics users to engage in comprehensive planning and develop measurable performance goals; and

     (c) Monitoring the use of toxic substances and the generation of hazardous waste. [1989 c.833 §3]

 

     465.009 Rules. The Environmental Quality Commission by rule may:

     (1) Add or remove any toxic substance or hazardous waste from the provisions of ORS 465.003 to 465.034; and

     (2) Modify the definition of “large user” to coincide with the amounts specified in federal regulations for the reporting of toxic chemical releases. [1989 c.833 §4; 2005 c.206 §4]

 

     465.010 [Amended by 1971 c.743 §371; repealed by 1989 c.846 §15]

 

     465.012 Technical assistance to users and generators; priority; restrictions on enforcement resulting from technical assistance; rules.

     (2) At the time of trial, if a person who is otherwise liable under ORS 465.255 is no longer subject to a judgment due to bankruptcy, dissolution or death (an orphan share), the court may, in its discretion, allocate that person’s equitable share to the other liable persons in proportion to their equitable shares or on any other equitable basis taking into consideration any relationship between the orphan share’s liable person and each other liable person. [1995 c.662 §5]

 

     Note: 465.257 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 465 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

     465.260 Removal or remedial action; reimbursement of costs; liability; damages. (1) The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality may undertake any removal or remedial action necessary to protect the public health, safety, welfare and the environment.

     (2) The director may authorize any person to carry out any removal or remedial action in accordance with any requirements of or directions from the director, if the director determines that the person will commence and complete removal or remedial action properly and in a timely manner.

     (3) Nothing in ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900 shall prevent the director from taking any emergency removal or remedial action necessary to protect public health, safety, welfare or the environment.

     (4) The director may require a person liable under ORS 465.255 to conduct any removal or remedial action or related actions necessary to protect the public health, safety, welfare and the environment. The director’s action under this subsection may include but need not be limited to issuing an order specifying the removal or remedial action the person must take.

     (5) The director may request the Attorney General to bring an action or proceeding for legal or equitable relief, in the circuit court of the county in which the facility is located or in Marion County, as may be necessary:

     (a) To enforce an order issued under subsection (4) of this section; or

     (b) To abate any imminent and substantial danger to the public health, safety, welfare or the environment related to a release.

     (6) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 183, and except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, any order issued by the director under subsection (4) of this section shall not be appealable to the Environmental Quality Commission or subject to judicial review.

     (7)(a) Any person who receives and complies with the terms of an order issued under subsection (4) of this section may, within 60 days after completion of the required action, petition the director for reimbursement from the fund for the reasonable costs of such action.

     (b) If the director refuses to grant all or part of the reimbursement, the petitioner may, within 30 days of receipt of the director’s refusal, file an action against the director seeking reimbursement from the fund in the circuit court of the county in which the facility is located or in the Circuit Court of Marion County. To obtain reimbursement, the petitioner must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is not liable under ORS 465.255 and that costs for which the petitioner seeks reimbursement are reasonable in light of the action required by the relevant order. A petitioner who is liable under ORS 465.255 may also recover reasonable remedial action costs to the extent that the petitioner can demonstrate that the director’s decision in selecting the removal or remedial action ordered was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.

     (8) If any person who is liable under ORS 465.255 fails without sufficient cause to conduct a removal or remedial action as required by an order of the director, the person shall be liable to the department for the state’s remedial action costs and for punitive damages not to exceed three times the amount of the state’s remedial action costs.

     (9) Nothing in this section is intended to interfere with, limit or abridge the authority of the State Fire Marshal or any other state agency or local unit of government relating to an emergency that presents a combustion or explosion hazard. [Formerly 466.570]

 

     465.265 “Person” defined for ORS 465.265 to 465.310. As used in ORS 465.265 to 465.310, “person” includes but need not be limited to a person liable under ORS 465.255. Except as provided in ORS 465.275 (2), “person” does not include the state or any state agency or the federal government or any agency of the federal government. [1989 c.833 §103]

 

     465.270 Legislative findings and intent. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

     (a) The costs of cleanup may result in economic hardship or bankruptcy for individuals and businesses that are otherwise financially viable;

     (b) These persons may be willing to clean up their sites and pay the associated costs; however, financial assistance from private lenders may not be available to pay for the cleanup; and

     (c) It is in the interest of the public health, safety, welfare and the environment to establish a program of financial assistance for cleanups, to help individuals and businesses maintain financial viability, increasing the share of cleanup costs paid by responsible persons and ultimately decreasing amounts paid from state funds.

     (2) Therefore, the Legislative Assembly declares that it is the intent of ORS 465.265 to 465.310:

     (a) To assure that moneys for financial assistance are available on a continuing basis consistent with the length and terms provided by the financial assistance agreements; and

     (b) To provide authority to the Department of Environmental Quality to develop and implement innovative approaches to financial assistance for cleanups conducted under ORS 465.200 to 465.545 or, at the discretion of the department, under other applicable authorities. [1989 c.833 §102]

 

     465.275 Remedial action and financial assistance program; contracts for implementation. (1) The Department of Environmental Quality may conduct:

     (a) A financial assistance program, including but not limited to loan guarantees, to assist persons in financing the cost of remedial action.

     (b) Activities necessary to carry out the purpose of ORS 465.381, 468.220, 468.230 and 465.265 to 465.310, including but not limited to entering into contracts or agreements, making and guaranteeing loans, taking security and instituting appropriate actions to enforce agreements made under ORS 465.285.

     (2) The department may enter into a contract or agreement for services to implement a financial assistance program with any person, including but not limited to a financial institution or a unit of local, state or federal government. The services may include but need not be limited to evaluating creditworthiness of applicants, preparing and marketing financial assistance packages and administering and servicing financial assistance agreements. [1989 c.833 §104]

 

     465.280 Rules; insuring tax deductibility of interest on bonds. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, the Environmental Quality Commission may adopt rules necessary to carry out the provisions of ORS 465.381, 468.220, 468.230 and 465.265 to 465.310 and to insure that interest on bonds issued under ORS 468.195 to be used for removal or remedial action of hazardous substances is not includable in gross income under the United States Internal Revenue Code. [1989 c.833 §105]

 

     465.285 Requirements for financial assistance; contents of agreements. (1) The Department of Environmental Quality may provide financial assistance only to persons who meet all of the following eligibility requirements:

     (a) The department has determined that removal or remedial action proposed by the applicant is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare or the environment.

     (b) The applicant demonstrates to the department’s satisfaction that the applicant either is unable to obtain financing for the removal or remedial action from other sources or that financing for the removal or remedial action is not available to the applicant at reasonable rates and terms.

     (c) The applicant demonstrates to the department’s satisfaction that there is a reasonable likelihood the applicant has the ability to repay.

     (d) The applicant agrees to conduct the removal or remedial action according to an agreement with the department.

     (e) Any other requirement the department considers necessary or appropriate.

     (2) A financial assistance agreement shall include any provision the department considers necessary, but shall at least include the following provisions:

     (a) Terms of the financial assistance; and

     (b) A statement that moneys obligated by the department under the agreement are limited to moneys in the Hazardous Substance Remedial Action Fund expressly designated by the department for financial assistance purposes. [1989 c.833 §106]

 

     465.290 Financial assistance agreement not General Fund obligation; cost estimates; security; recovery of costs; compromise of obligations. (1) The obligation of the Department of Environmental Quality to provide financial assistance or to advance money under a financial assistance agreement made under ORS 465.285 shall not constitute an obligation against the General Fund or any other state fund except against the Hazardous Substance Remedial Action Fund to the extent moneys in the Hazardous Substance Remedial Action Fund are expressly designated by the department for such financial assistance purposes.

     (2) The department may provide a remedial action cost estimate for use by the department, a lender or a guarantor in determining the amount of financial assistance, evaluating the creditworthiness of a borrower, providing loan guarantees or as the department considers appropriate.

     (3) When financial assistance is provided to a local governmental unit, the agreement may be secured as the department requires for adequate security.

     (4) The department may take any action under ORS 465.260, 465.330 or 465.335 or other applicable authority to recover costs incurred or moneys advanced under a financial assistance agreement. Costs incurred or money advanced under a financial assistance agreement entered into under ORS 465.285 shall be remedial action costs. At the department’s discretion, the department may file a claim of lien for such remedial action costs in accordance with the procedures set forth in ORS 465.335 (1), (2)(a) to (c), (3) and (4).

     (5) The department may settle, compromise or release all or part of any obligation arising under a financial assistance agreement so long as the department’s action is consistent with the purposes of ORS 465.265 to 465.310. [1989 c.833 §107]

 

     465.295 Decision regarding financial assistance not subject to judicial review. Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 183, the decision of the Department of Environmental Quality to approve or deny financial assistance under ORS 465.265 to 465.310 or the department’s determination of the amount or use of a remedial action cost estimate under ORS 465.290 shall not be subject to appeal to the Environmental Quality Commission or subject to judicial review. [1989 c.833 §108]

 

     465.300 Records and financial assistance applications exempt from disclosure as public record. Financial records and other information that are submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality as part of an application for financial assistance under ORS 465.265 to 465.310 shall be exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478, unless the public interest requires disclosure in a particular instance. [1989 c.833 §109]

 

     465.305 Application fees; rules. The Environmental Quality Commission may establish by rule reasonable fees for applicants for financial assistance sufficient to pay for the costs of the Department of Environmental Quality of carrying out the provisions of ORS 465.265 to 465.310. [1989 c.833 §110]

 

     465.310 Accounting procedure for financial assistance moneys. For the purposes of ORS 465.265 to 465.310, the Department of Environmental Quality may place moneys for the purpose of providing financial assistance in reserve status or subaccounts within the Hazardous Substance Remedial Action Fund. Moneys placed in reserve status or subaccounts under this section in connection with a financial assistance agreement shall not be subject to claims under ORS 465.260 or otherwise except as provided in the financial assistance agreement. [1989 c.833 §111]

 

     465.315 Standards for degree of cleanup required; Hazard Index; risk protocol; hot spots of contamination; exemption; rules. (1)(a) Any removal or remedial action performed under the provisions of ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900 shall attain a degree of cleanup of the hazardous substance and control of further release of the hazardous substance that assures protection of present and future public health, safety and welfare and of the environment.

     (b) The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality shall select or approve remedial actions that are protective of human health and the environment. The protectiveness of a remedial action shall be determined based on application of both of the following:

     (A) The acceptable risk level for exposures. For protection of humans, the acceptable risk level for exposure to individual carcinogens shall be a lifetime excess cancer risk of one per one million people exposed, and the acceptable risk level for exposure to noncarcinogens shall be the exposure that results in a Hazard Index number equal to or less than one. “Hazard Index number” means a number equal to the sum of the noncarcinogenic risks (hazard quotient) attributable to systemic toxicants with similar toxic endpoints. For protection of ecological receptors, if a release of hazardous substances causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant adverse impacts to the health or viability of a species listed as threatened or endangered pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. or ORS 496.172, or a population of plants or animals in the locality of the facility, the acceptable risk level shall be the point before such significant adverse impacts occur.

     (B) A risk assessment undertaken in accordance with the risk protocol established by the Environmental Quality Commission in accordance with subsection (2)(a) of this section.

     (c) A remedial action may achieve protection of human health and the environment through:

     (A) Treatment that eliminates or reduces the toxicity, mobility or volume of hazardous substances;

     (B) Excavation and off-site disposal;

     (C) Containment or other engineering controls;

     (D) Institutional controls;

     (E) Any other method of protection; or

     (F) A combination of the above.

     (d) The method of remediation appropriate for a specific facility shall be determined through an evaluation of remedial alternatives and a selection process to be established pursuant to rules adopted by the commission. The director shall select or approve a protective alternative that balances the following factors:

     (A) The effectiveness of the remedy in achieving protection;

     (B) The technical and practical implementability of the remedy;

     (C) The long term reliability of the remedy;

     (D) Any short term risk from implementing the remedy posed to the community, to those engaged in the implementation of the remedy and to the environment; and

     (E) The reasonableness of the cost of the remedy. The cost of a remedial action shall not be considered reasonable if the costs are disproportionate to the benefits created through risk reduction or risk management. Subject to the preference for treatment of hot spots, when two or more remedial action alternatives are protective as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the least expensive remedial action shall be preferred unless the additional cost of a more expensive alternative is justified by proportionately greater benefits within one or more of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) to (D) of this paragraph. The director shall use a higher threshold for evaluating the reasonableness of the costs for treating hot spots than for remediation of areas other than hot spots.

     (e) For contamination constituting a hot spot as defined by the commission pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this section, the director shall select or approve a remedial action requiring treatment of the hot spot contamination unless treatment is not feasible considering the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this subsection. For contamination constituting a hot spot under subsection (2)(b)(A) of this section, the director shall evaluate, with the same preference as treatment, the excavation and off-site disposal of the contamination at a facility authorized for such disposal under state or federal law. For excavation and off-site disposal of contamination that is a hazardous waste as described in ORS 466.005, the director shall consider the method and distance for transportation of the contamination to available disposal facilities in selecting or approving a remedial action that is protective under subsection (1)(d) of this section. If requested by the responsible party or recommended by the Department of Environmental Quality, the director may select or approve excavation and off-site disposal as the remedial action for contamination constituting a hot spot under subsection (2)(b)(A) of this section.

     (f) The Department of Environmental Quality shall develop or identify generic remedies for common categories of facilities considering the balancing factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this subsection. The department’s development of generic remedies shall take into consideration demonstrated remedial actions and technologies and scientific and engineering evaluation of performance data. Where a generic remedy would be protective and satisfy the balancing factors under paragraph (d) of this subsection at a specific facility, the director may select or approve the generic remedy for that site on a streamlined basis with a limited evaluation of other remedial alternatives.

     (g) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (d) of this subsection, in selecting or approving a remedial action, the director shall consider current and reasonably anticipated future land uses at the facility and surrounding properties, taking into account current land use zoning, other land use designations, land use plans as established in local comprehensive plans and land use implementing regulations of any governmental body having land use jurisdiction, and concerns of the facility owner, neighboring owners and the community.

     (2) The commission shall adopt rules:

     (a) Establishing a risk protocol for conducting risk assessments. The risk protocol shall:

     (A) Require consideration of existing and reasonably likely future human exposures and significant adverse effects to ecological receptor health and viability, both in a baseline risk assessment and in an assessment of residual risk after a remedial action;

     (B) Require risk assessments to include reasonable estimates of plausible upper-bound exposures that neither grossly underestimate nor grossly overestimate risks;

     (C) Require risk assessments to consider, to the extent practicable, the range of probabilities of risks actually occurring, the range of size of the populations likely to be exposed to the risk, current and reasonably likely future land uses, and quantitative and qualitative descriptions of uncertainties;

     (D) Identify appropriate sources of toxicity information;

     (E) Define the use of probabilistic modeling;

     (F) Identify criteria for the selection and application of fate and transport models;

     (G) Define the use of high-end and central-tendency exposure cases and assumptions;

     (H) Define the use of population risk estimates in addition to individual risk estimates;

     (I) To the extent deemed appropriate and feasible by the commission considering available scientific information, define appropriate approaches for addressing cumulative risks posed by multiple contaminants or multiple exposure pathways, including how the acceptable risk levels set forth in subsection (1)(b)(A) of this section shall be applied in relation to cumulative risks; and

     (J) Establish appropriate sampling approaches and data quality requirements.

     (b) Defining hot spots of contamination. The definition of hot spots shall include:

     (A) Hazardous substances that are present in high concentrations, are highly mobile or cannot be reliably contained, and that would present a risk to human health or the environment exceeding the acceptable risk level if exposure occurs.

     (B) Concentrations of hazardous substances in ground water or surface water that have a significant adverse effect on existing or reasonably likely future beneficial uses of the water and for which treatment is reasonably likely to restore or protect such beneficial use within a reasonable time.

     (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the director may exempt the on-site portion of any removal or remedial action conducted under ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900 from any requirement of ORS 466.005 to 466.385 and ORS chapters 459, 468, 468A and 468B. Without affecting substantive requirements, no state or local permit, license or other authorization shall be required for, and no procedural requirements shall apply to, the portion of any removal or remedial action conducted on-site where such removal or remedial action has been selected or approved by the director under this section, unless the permit, license, authorization or procedural requirement is necessary to preserve or obtain federal authorization of a state program or the person performing a removal or remedial action elects to obtain the permit, license or authorization or comply with the procedural requirement. The person performing a removal or remedial action shall notify the appropriate state or local governmental body of the permits, licenses, authorizations or procedural requirements waived under this subsection and, at the request of the governmental body, pay applicable fees. Any costs paid as a fee to a governmental body under this subsection shall not also be recoverable by the governmental body as remedial action costs.

     (4) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (3) of this section, any on-site treatment, storage or disposal of a hazardous substance shall comply with the standard established under subsection (1)(a) of this section and any activities conducted in a public right of way under a removal or remedial action pursuant to this section shall comply with the requirements of the applicable jurisdiction.

     (5) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of the director to undertake, order or authorize an interim or emergency removal action.

     (6) Nothing in this section or in rules adopted pursuant to this section shall prohibit the application of rules in effect on July 18, 1995, that use numeric soil cleanup standards to govern remediation of motor fuel and heating oil releases from underground storage tanks.

     465.320 Notice of proposed remedial action or release from liability; receipt and consideration of comment; notice of approval of remedial action or release from liability. Except as provided in ORS 465.260 (3), before approval of any remedial action to be undertaken by the Department of Environmental Quality or any other person, adoption of a certification decision under ORS 465.325 or providing a release from liability under ORS 465.327 to a party in a judicial consent judgment or an administrative consent order, the department shall:

     (2) Provide at least 30 days for submission of written comments regarding the proposed action, and, upon written request by 10 or more persons or by a group having 10 or more members, conduct a public meeting at or near the facility for the purpose of receiving verbal comment regarding the proposed action.

     (3) Consider any written or verbal comments before approving the removal or remedial action or providing a release from liability under ORS 465.327 to a party in a judicial consent judgment or an administrative consent order.

     (4) Upon final approval of the remedial action or providing a release from liability under ORS 465.327 to a party in a judicial consent judgment or an administrative consent order, publish notice, as provided under subsection (1) of this section, and make copies of the approved action available to the public. [Formerly 466.575; 2011 c.487 §2]

 

     465.325 Agreement to perform removal or remedial action; reimbursement; agreement as order and consent judgment; effect on liability. (1)(a) The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality, in the director’s discretion, may enter into an agreement with any person including the owner or operator of the facility from which a release emanates, or any other potentially responsible person to perform any removal or remedial action if the director determines that the actions will be properly done by the person. Whenever practicable and in the public interest, as determined by the director, the director, in order to expedite effective removal or remedial actions and minimize litigation, shall act to facilitate agreements under this section that are in the public interest and consistent with the rules adopted under ORS 465.400. If the director decides not to use the procedures in this section, the director shall notify in writing potentially responsible parties at the facility of such decision. Notwithstanding ORS chapter 183, a decision of the director to use or not to use the procedures described in this section shall not be appealable to the Environmental Quality Commission or subject to judicial review.

     (b)(A) At least 30 days before an agreement is entered into under this section, the director shall provide written notice to any person who has entered into an agreement with the Department of Environmental Quality under ORS 465.327 related to the facility and who is in substantial compliance with the agreement entered into under ORS 465.327. A person receiving notice under this paragraph shall be provided with an opportunity to participate in any negotiations under this section related to an agreement concerning the facility, and the person may provide written comments related to the proposed agreement.

     (B) At the conclusion of any negotiations described in this paragraph and at least 30 days before submittal to the appropriate circuit court as a proposed consent judgment, the director shall provide written notice of the proposed agreement to any person who has entered into an agreement with the department under ORS 465.327 related to the facility.

     (2)(a) An agreement under this section may provide that the director will reimburse the parties to the agreement from the fund, with interest, for certain costs of actions under the agreement that the parties have agreed to perform and the director has agreed to finance. In any case in which the director provides such reimbursement and, in the judgment of the director, cost recovery is in the public interest, the director shall make reasonable efforts to recover the amount of such reimbursement under ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900 or under other relevant authority.

     (b) Notwithstanding ORS chapter 183, the director’s decision regarding fund financing under this subsection shall not be appealable to the commission or subject to judicial review.

     (c) When a remedial action is completed under an agreement described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the fund shall be subject to an obligation for any subsequent remedial action at the same facility but only to the extent that such subsequent remedial action is necessary by reason of the failure of the original remedial action. Such obligation shall be in a proportion equal to, but not exceeding, the proportion contributed by the fund for the original remedial action. The fund’s obligation for such future remedial action may be met through fund expenditures or through payment, following settlement or enforcement action, by persons who were not signatories to the original agreement.

     (3) If an agreement has been entered into under this section, the director may take any action under ORS 465.260 against any person who is not a party to the agreement, once the period for submitting a proposal under subsection (5)(c) of this section has expired. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect either of the following:

     (a) The liability of any person under ORS 465.255 or 465.260 with respect to any costs or damages which are not included in the agreement.

     (b) The authority of the director to maintain an action under ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900 against any person who is not a party to the agreement.

     (4)(a)(A) Whenever the director enters into an agreement under this section with any potentially responsible person with respect to remedial action, following approval of the agreement by the Attorney General and except as otherwise provided in the case of certain administrative settlements referred to in subsection (8) of this section, the agreement shall be entered in the appropriate circuit court as a consent judgment. The director need not make any finding regarding an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health, safety, welfare or the environment in connection with any such agreement or consent judgment.

     (B)(i) A person described in subsection (1)(b) of this section who submits written comments to the director regarding the proposed agreement may intervene as a party in the proceedings related to the entry of a consent judgment.

     (ii) If a person described in subsection (1)(b) of this section intervenes in the proceedings, the circuit court shall review the proposed agreement, and the circuit court may not enter the proposed agreement as a consent judgment, unless the circuit court determines that the proposed agreement is fair, reasonable and consistent with the provisions of ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and that any contribution protections provided under subsection (6)(b) of this section are supported by substantial evidence as being in the public interest.

     (b) The entry of any consent judgment under this subsection shall not be construed to be an acknowledgment by the parties that the release concerned constitutes an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health, safety, welfare or the environment. Except as otherwise provided in the Oregon Evidence Code, the participation by any party in the process under this section shall not be considered an admission of liability for any purpose, and the fact of such participation shall not be admissible in any judicial or administrative proceeding, including a subsequent proceeding under this section.

     (c) The director may fashion a consent judgment so that the entering of the judgment and compliance with the judgment or with any determination or agreement made under this section shall not be considered an admission of liability for any purpose.

     (d) The director shall provide notice and opportunity to the public and to persons not named as parties to the agreement to comment on the proposed agreement before its submittal to the court as a proposed consent judgment, as provided under ORS 465.320. The director shall consider any written comments, views or allegations relating to the proposed agreement. The director or any party may withdraw, withhold or modify its consent to the proposed agreement if the comments, views and allegations concerning the agreement disclose facts or considerations which indicate that the proposed agreement is inappropriate, improper or inadequate.

     (5)(a) If the director determines that a period of negotiation under this subsection would facilitate an agreement with potentially responsible persons for taking removal or remedial action and would expedite removal or remedial action, the director shall so notify all such parties and shall provide them with the following information to the extent the information is available:

     (A) The names and addresses of potentially responsible persons including owners and operators and other persons referred to in ORS 465.255.

     (B) The volume and nature of substances contributed by each potentially responsible person identified at the facility.

     (C) A ranking by volume of the substances at the facility.

     (b) The director shall make the information referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection available in advance of notice under this subsection upon the request of a potentially responsible person in accordance with procedures provided by the director. The provisions of ORS 465.250 (5) regarding confidential information apply to information provided under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

     (c) Any person receiving notice under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice to submit to the director a proposal for undertaking or financing the action under ORS 465.260. The director may grant extensions for up to an additional 60 days.

     (6)(a) Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under ORS 465.255. In resolving contribution claims, the court shall allocate remedial action costs among liable parties in accordance with ORS 465.257.

     (b) A person who has resolved its liability to the state in an administrative or judicially approved settlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement. Such settlement does not discharge any of the other potentially responsible persons unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the potential liability of the others by the amount of the settlement.

     (c)(A) If the state has obtained less than complete relief from a person who has resolved its liability to the state in an administrative or judicially approved settlement, the director may bring an action against any person who has not so resolved its liability.

     (B) A person who has resolved its liability to the state for some or all of a removal or remedial action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement may seek contribution from any person who is not party to a settlement referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

     (C) In any action under this paragraph, the rights of any person who has resolved its liability to the state shall be subordinate to the rights of the state.

     (7)(a) In entering an agreement under this section, the director may provide any person subject to the agreement with a covenant not to sue concerning any liability to the State of Oregon under ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900, including future liability, resulting from a release of a hazardous substance addressed by the agreement if each of the following conditions is met:

     (A) The covenant not to sue is in the public interest.

     (B) The covenant not to sue would expedite removal or remedial action consistent with rules adopted by the commission under ORS 465.400 (2).

     (C) The person is in full compliance with a consent judgment under subsection (4)(a) of this section for response to the release concerned.

     (D) The removal or remedial action has been approved by the director.

     (b) The director shall provide a person with a covenant not to sue with respect to future liability to the State of Oregon under ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900 for a future release of a hazardous substance from a facility, and a person provided such covenant not to sue shall not be liable to the State of Oregon under ORS 465.255 with respect to such release at a future time, for the portion of the remedial action:

     (A) That involves the transport and secure disposition offsite of a hazardous substance in a treatment, storage or disposal facility meeting the requirements of section 3004(c) to (g), (m), (o), (p), (u) and (v) and 3005(c) of the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, P.L. 96-482 and P.L. 98-616, if the director has rejected a proposed remedial action that is consistent with rules adopted by the commission under ORS 465.400 that does not include such offsite disposition and has thereafter required offsite disposition; or

     (B) That involves the treatment of a hazardous substance so as to destroy, eliminate or permanently immobilize the hazardous constituents of the substance, so that, in the judgment of the director, the substance no longer presents any current or currently foreseeable future significant risk to public health, safety, welfare or the environment, no by-product of the treatment or destruction process presents any significant hazard to public health, safety, welfare or the environment, and all by-products are themselves treated, destroyed or contained in a manner that assures that the by-products do not present any current or currently foreseeable future significant risk to public health, safety, welfare or the environment.

     (c) A covenant not to sue concerning future liability to the State of Oregon shall not take effect until the director certifies that the removal or remedial action has been completed in accordance with the requirements of subsection (10) of this section at the facility that is the subject of the covenant.

     (d) In assessing the appropriateness of a covenant not to sue under paragraph (a) of this subsection and any condition to be included in a covenant not to sue under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, the director shall consider whether the covenant or conditions are in the public interest on the basis of factors such as the following:

     (A) The effectiveness and reliability of the remedial action, in light of the other alternative remedial actions considered for the facility concerned.

     (B) The nature of the risks remaining at the facility.

     (C) The extent to which performance standards are included in the order or judgment.

     (D) The extent to which the removal or remedial action provides a complete remedy for the facility, including a reduction in the hazardous nature of the substances at the facility.

     (E) The extent to which the technology used in the removal or remedial action is demonstrated to be effective.

     (F) Whether the fund or other sources of funding would be available for any additional removal or remedial action that might eventually be necessary at the facility.

     (G) Whether the removal or remedial action will be carried out, in whole or in significant part, by the responsible parties themselves.

     (e) Any covenant not to sue under this subsection shall be subject to the satisfactory performance by such party of its obligations under the agreement concerned.

     (f)(A) Except for the portion of the removal or remedial action that is subject to a covenant not to sue under paragraph (b) of this subsection or de minimis settlement under subsection (8) of this section, a covenant not to sue a person concerning future liability to the State of Oregon:

     (i) Shall include an exception to the covenant that allows the director to sue the person concerning future liability resulting from the release or threatened release that is the subject of the covenant if the liability arises out of conditions unknown at the time the director certifies under subsection (10) of this section that the removal or remedial action has been completed at the facility concerned; and

     (ii) May include an exception to the covenant that allows the director to sue the person concerning future liability resulting from failure of the remedial action.

     (B) In extraordinary circumstances, the director may determine, after assessment of relevant factors such as those referred to in paragraph (d) of this subsection and volume, toxicity, mobility, strength of evidence, ability to pay, litigative risks, public interest considerations, precedential value and the inequities and aggravating factors, not to include the exception referred to in paragraph (f)(A) of this subsection if other terms, conditions or requirements of the agreement containing the covenant not to sue are sufficient to provide all reasonable assurances that public health, safety, welfare and the environment will be protected from any future release at or from the facility.

     (C) The director may include any provisions allowing future enforcement action under ORS 465.260 that in the discretion of the director are necessary and appropriate to assure protection of public health, safety, welfare and the environment.

     (8)(a) Whenever practicable and in the public interest, as determined by the director, the director shall as promptly as possible reach a final settlement with a potentially responsible person in an administrative or civil action under ORS 465.255 if such settlement involves only a minor portion of the remedial action costs at the facility concerned and, in the judgment of the director, both of the following are minimal in comparison to any other hazardous substance at the facility:

     (A) The amount of the hazardous substance contributed by that person to the facility; and

     (B) The toxic or other hazardous effects of the substance contributed by that person to the facility.

     (b) The director may provide a covenant not to sue with respect to the facility concerned to any party who has entered into a settlement under this subsection unless such a covenant would be inconsistent with the public interest as determined under subsection (7) of this section.

     (c) The director shall reach any such settlement or grant a covenant not to sue as soon as possible after the director has available the information necessary to reach a settlement or grant a covenant not to sue.

     (d) A settlement under this subsection shall be entered as a consent judgment or embodied in an administrative order setting forth the terms of the settlement. The circuit court for the county in which the release or threatened release occurs or the Circuit Court of Marion County may enforce any such administrative order.

     (e) A party who has resolved its liability to the state under this subsection shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement. The settlement does not discharge any of the other potentially responsible persons unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the potential liability of the others by the amount of the settlement.

     (f) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the authority of the director to reach settlements with other potentially responsible persons under ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900.

     (9)(a) Notwithstanding ORS chapter 183, except for those covenants required under subsection (7)(b)(A) and (B) of this section, a decision by the director to agree or not to agree to inclusion of any covenant not to sue in an agreement under this section shall not be appealable to the commission or subject to judicial review.

     (b) Nothing in this section shall limit or otherwise affect the authority of any court to review, in the consent judgment process under subsection (4) of this section, any covenant not to sue contained in an agreement under this section.

     (10)(a) Upon completion of any removal or remedial action under an agreement under this section, or pursuant to an order under ORS 465.260, the party undertaking the removal or remedial action shall notify the department and request certification of completion. Within 90 days after receiving notice, the director shall determine by certification whether the removal or remedial action is completed in accordance with the applicable agreement or order.

     (b) Before submitting a final certification decision to the court that approved the consent judgment, or before entering a final administrative order, the director shall provide to the public and to persons not named as parties to the agreement or order notice and opportunity to comment on the director’s proposed certification decision, as provided under ORS 465.320.

     (c) Any person aggrieved by the director’s certification decision may seek judicial review of the certification decision by the court that approved the relevant consent judgment or, in the case of an administrative order, in the circuit court for the county in which the facility is located or in Marion County. The decision of the director shall be upheld unless the person challenging the certification decision demonstrates that the decision was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to the provisions of ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900 or not supported by substantial evidence. The court shall apply a presumption in favor of the director’s decision. The court may award attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party if the court finds the challenge or defense of the director’s decision to have been frivolous. The court may assess against a party and award to the state, in addition to attorney fees and costs, an amount equal to the economic gain realized by the party if the court finds the only purpose of the party’s challenge to the director’s decision was delay for economic gain.

In addition to the rules adopted under ORS 465.405, the Environmental Quality Commission shall adopt by rule a procedure for ranking facilities on the inventory based on the short-term and long-term risks they pose to present and future public health, safety, welfare or the environment. [1989 c.485 §8]

 

     465.420 Remedial Action Advisory Committee. The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality shall appoint a Remedial Action Advisory Committee in order to advise the Department of Environmental Quality in the development of rules for the implementation of ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900. The committee shall be comprised of members representing at least the following interests:

     (1) Citizens;

     (2) Local governments;

     (3) Environmental organizations; and

     (4) Industry. [Formerly 466.555]

 

     465.425 “Security interest holder” defined for ORS 465.430 to 465.455. As used in ORS 465.430 to 465.455, “security interest holder” means a person who, without participating in the management of a facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a facility. [1991 c.680 §2]

 

     465.430 Legislative findings. (1)(a) The Legislative Assembly finds that existing federal and state law related to liability of a security interest holder for environmental contamination is unclear, and that such lack of clarity has created uncertainty on the part of security interest holders as to whether security interest holders are liable for environmental contamination caused by their borrowers or other third parties.

     (b) The Legislative Assembly therefore declares that clarification regarding such potential liability in a manner consistent with federal statutes and regulations is desirable in order to provide certainty for security interest holders and to encourage responsible practices by security interest holders and borrowers to protect the public health and the environment.

     (2)(a) The Legislative Assembly also finds that uncertainty exists in state law as to potential liability of certain fiduciaries for environmental contamination at property held in their fiduciary capacity.

     (b) The Legislative Assembly therefore declares that it is in the public interest to provide an exemption from such potential liability in certain circumstances. [1991 c.680 §3]

 

     465.435 Rules relating to exemption from liability for security interest holder. (1) The Environmental Quality Commission may adopt rules necessary to clarify the scope and meaning of the exemption from liability under ORS 465.255 of a security interest holder. The rules shall:

     (a) Identify activities that are consistent with holding and protecting a security interest in a facility and therefore exempt from liability under ORS 465.255;

     (b) Identify the extent to which a security interest holder may undertake activities to oversee the affairs of a borrower for purposes of protecting a security interest in a facility and continue to be exempt from the liability imposed under ORS 465.255;

     (c) Identify the activities a security interest holder may undertake in connection with foreclosure on a security interest in a facility and continue to be exempt from the liability imposed under ORS 465.255; and

     (d) Allow a security interest holder to encourage and require responsible environmental management by borrowers.

     (2) In adopting rules under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall:

     (a) Exclude the mere capacity or unexercised right to influence a facility’s management of hazardous substance from activities that might void a security interest holder’s exemption from liability; and

     (b) Distinguish activities that are consistent with holding, protecting and foreclosing of a security interest, and that are therefore exempt from liability, from activities that constitute actual participation in the management of a facility that may be grounds for liability under ORS 465.255.

     (3) In adopting rules under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall consider and, to the extent consistent with subsections (1) and (2) of this section, adopt rules parallel in effect to any federal statute or regulation, adopted and effective on or after May 1, 1991, pertaining to the scope and meaning of the exemption from liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (P.L. 96-510 and 99-499), of a security interest holder. [1991 c.680 §4]

 

     465.440 Rules relating to exemption from liability for fiduciary. In accordance with the purposes of ORS 465.425 to 465.455, the Environmental Quality Commission by rule shall define the instances in which a person acting under ORS chapter 709 and in a fiduciary capacity shall be exempt from liability for environmental contamination at property the fiduciary holds in a fiduciary capacity. In adopting the rules, the commission shall consider and, to the extent appropriate, provide exemptions from liability for the fiduciaries that are similar in purpose and effect to those exemptions provided for security interest holders under rules adopted under ORS 465.435. [1991 c.680 §5]

 

     465.445 Advisory committee. The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality shall appoint an advisory committee to advise the Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Quality Commission in the development of rules under ORS 465.435 and 465.440. [1991 c.680 §6]

 

     465.450 Limitation on commission’s discretion to adopt rules. Notwithstanding the discretion otherwise allowed under ORS 465.435, if federal law is enacted or regulations are adopted and become effective after May 1, 1991, the Environmental Quality Commission shall adopt rules under ORS 465.435. [1991 c.680 §7]

 

     465.455 Construction of ORS 465.425 to 465.455. Nothing in ORS 465.425 to 465.455 or any rule adopted under ORS 465.435 or 465.440 shall be construed to impose liability on a security interest holder or fiduciary or to expand the liability of a security interest holder or fiduciary beyond that which might otherwise exist. [1991 c.680 §8]

 

(Oregon Environmental Cleanup Assistance)

 

     465.475 Definitions for ORS 465.475 to 465.484. For the purposes of ORS 465.475 to 465.484:

     (1) “Environmental claim” means a claim for defense or indemnity submitted under a general liability insurance policy by an insured facing, or allegedly facing, potential liability for bodily injury or property damage arising from a release of pollutants onto or into land, air or water.

     (2) “General liability insurance policy” means any contract of insurance that provides coverage for the obligations at law or in equity of an insured for bodily injury, property damage or personal injury to others. “General liability insurance policy” includes but is not limited to a pollution liability insurance policy, a commercial general liability insurance policy, a comprehensive general liability policy, an excess liability policy, an umbrella liability insurance policy or any other kind of policy covering the liability of an insured for the claims of third parties. “General liability insurance policy” does not include homeowner or motor vehicle policies or portions of other policies relating to homeowner or motor vehicle coverages, claims-made policies or portions of other policies relating to claims-made policies or specialty line liability coverage such as directors and officers insurance, errors and omissions insurance or other similar policies.

     (3) “Insured” means any person included as a named insured on a general liability insurance policy who has or had a property interest in a site in Oregon that involves an environmental claim.

     (4) “Lost policy” means any part or all of a general liability insurance policy that is alleged to be ruined, destroyed, misplaced or otherwise no longer possessed by the insured.

     (5) “Policy” means the written contract or agreement, and all clauses, riders, endorsements and papers that are a part of the contract or agreement, for or effecting insurance. [1999 c.783 §2; 2003 c.799 §1]

 

     465.478 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that there are many insurance coverage disputes involving insureds who face potential liability for their ownership of or roles at polluted sites in this state. The State of Oregon has a substantial public interest in promoting the fair and efficient resolution of environmental claims while encouraging voluntary compliance and regulatory cooperation. [1999 c.783 §3]

 

     465.479 Lost policies; investigation by insurer required; minimum standards for investigation. (1) If, after a diligent investigation by an insured of the insured’s own records, including computer records and the records of past and present agents of the insured, the insured is unable to reconstruct a lost policy, the insured may provide a notice of a lost policy to an insurer.

     (2) An insurer must investigate thoroughly and promptly a notice of a lost policy. An insurer fails to investigate thoroughly and promptly if the insurer fails to provide all facts known or discovered during an investigation concerning the issuance and terms of a policy, including copies of documents establishing the issuance and terms of a policy, to the insured claiming coverage under a lost policy.

     (3) An insurer and an insured must comply with the following minimum standards for facilitating reconstruction of a lost policy and determining the terms of a lost policy as provided in this section:

     (a) Within 30 business days after receipt by the insurer of notice of a lost policy, the insurer shall commence an investigation into the insurer’s records, including computer records, to determine whether the insurer issued the lost policy. If the insurer determines that it issued the policy, the insurer shall commence an investigation into the terms and conditions relevant to any environmental claim made under the policy.

     (b) The insurer and the insured shall cooperate with each other in determining the terms of a lost policy. The insurer and the insured:

     (A) Shall provide to each other the facts known or discovered during an investigation, including the identity of any witnesses with knowledge of facts related to the issuance or existence of a lost policy.

     (B) Shall provide each other with copies of documents establishing facts related to the lost policy.

     (C) Are not required to produce material subject to a legal privilege or confidential claims documents provided to the insurer by another policyholder.

     (c) If the insurer or the insured discovers information tending to show the existence of an insurance policy applicable to the claim, the insurer or the insured shall provide an accurate copy of the terms of the policy or a reconstruction of the policy, upon the request of the insurer or the insured.

     (d) If the insurer is not able to locate portions of the policy or determine its terms, conditions or exclusions, the insurer shall provide copies of all insurance policy forms issued by the insurer during the applicable policy period that are potentially applicable to the environmental claim. The insurer shall state which of the potentially applicable forms, if any, is most likely to have been issued by the insurer, or the insurer shall state why it is unable to identify the forms after a good faith search.

     (4) Following the minimum standards established in this section does not create a presumption of coverage for an environmental claim once the lost policy has been reconstructed.

     (5) Following the minimum standards established in this section does not constitute:

     (a) An admission by an insurer that a policy was issued or effective; or

     (b) An affirmation that if the policy was issued, it was necessarily in the form produced, unless so stated by the insurer.

     (6) If, based on the information discovered in an investigation of a lost policy, the insured can show by a preponderance of the evidence that a general liability insurance policy was issued to the insured by the insurer, then if:

     (a) The insured cannot produce evidence that tends to show the policy limits applicable to the policy, it shall be assumed that the minimum limits of coverage, including any exclusions to coverage, offered by the insurer during the period in question were purchased by the insured.

     (b) The insured can produce evidence that tends to show the policy limits applicable to the policy, then the insurer has the burden of proof to show that a different policy limit, including any exclusions to coverage, should apply.

     (7) An insurer may claim an affirmative defense to a claim that the insurer failed to follow the minimum standards established under this section if the insured fails to cooperate with the insurer in the reconstruction of a lost policy under this section.

     (8) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall enforce this section and any rules adopted by the director to implement this section.

     (9) Violation by an insurer of any provision of this section or any rule adopted under this section is an:

     (a) Unfair environmental claims settlement practice under ORS 465.484; and

     (b) Unfair claim settlement practice under ORS 746.230.

     (10) As used in this section, “notice of a lost policy” means written notice of the lost policy in sufficient detail to identify the person or entity claiming coverage, including information concerning the name of the alleged policyholder, if known, and material facts concerning the lost policy known to the alleged policyholder. [2003 c.799 §4; 2013 c.350 §3]

 

     465.480 Insurance for environmental claims; rules of construction; duty to pay defense or indemnity costs; contribution; allocation. (1) As used in this section:

     (a) “Long-tail environmental claim” means an environmental claim covered by multiple general liability insurance policies.

     (b) “Suit” or “lawsuit” includes but is not limited to formal judicial proceedings, administrative proceedings and actions taken under Oregon or federal law, including actions taken under administrative oversight of the Department of Environmental Quality or the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to written voluntary agreements, consent decrees and consent orders.

     (c) “Uninsured” means an insured who, for any period of time after January 1, 1971, that is included in an environmental claim, failed to purchase and maintain an occurrence-based general liability insurance policy that would have provided coverage for the environmental claim, provided that such insurance was commercially available at such time. A general liability insurance policy is “commercially available” if the policy can be purchased under the Insurance Code on reasonable commercial terms.

     (2) Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, in any action between an insured and an insurer to determine the existence of coverage for the costs of investigating and remediating environmental contamination, whether in response to governmental demand or pursuant to a written voluntary agreement, consent decree or consent order, including the existence of coverage for the costs of defending a suit against the insured for such costs, the following rules of construction shall apply in the interpretation of general liability insurance policies involving environmental claims:

     (a) Oregon law shall be applied in all cases where the contaminated property to which the action relates is located within the State of Oregon. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to modify common law rules governing choice of law determinations for sites located outside the State of Oregon.

     (b) Any action or agreement by the Department of Environmental Quality or the United States Environmental Protection Agency against or with an insured in which the Department of Environmental Quality or the United States Environmental Protection Agency in writing directs, requests or agrees that an insured take action with respect to contamination within the State of Oregon is equivalent to a suit or lawsuit as those terms are used in any general liability insurance policy.

     (c) Insurance coverage for any reasonable and necessary fees, costs and expenses, including remedial investigations, feasibility study costs and expenses, incurred by the insured pursuant to a written voluntary agreement, consent decree or consent order between the insured and either the Department of Environmental Quality or the United States Environmental Protection Agency, when incurred as a result of a written direction, request or agreement by the Department of Environmental Quality or the United States Environmental Protection Agency to take action with respect to contamination within the State of Oregon, shall not be denied the insured on the ground that such expenses constitute voluntary payments by the insured.

     (d) A general liability insurance policy that provides that any loss covered under the policy must be reduced by any amounts due to the insured on account of such loss under prior insurance may not be construed to reduce the policy limits available to an insured that has filed a long-tail environmental claim, or to reduce those policies from which an insurer that has paid an environmental claim may seek contribution. Such provisions may be a factor considered in the allocation of contribution claims between insurers under subsection (4) of this section.

     (e) The release of a hazardous substance into the waters of this state, as defined in ORS 196.800, or onto real property owned by a party other than the insured constitutes damage, destruction or injury to property. Any remedial action costs, as defined in ORS 465.200, that an insured incurs as a result of any action taken to cut off a pathway by which a hazardous substance threatens to, or has, migrated, leached or otherwise been released into the waters of this state, as defined in ORS 196.800, or onto real property owned by a party other than the insured are remedial action costs that the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages because of the damage, destruction or injury to such property even though such action also involves the property of the insured.

     (3)(a) An insurer with a duty to pay defense or indemnity costs, or both, to an insured for an environmental claim under a general liability insurance policy that provides that the insurer has a duty to pay all sums arising out of a risk covered by the policy, must pay all defense or indemnity costs, or both, proximately arising out of the risk pursuant to the applicable terms of its policy, including its limit of liability, independent and unaffected by other insurance that may provide coverage for the same claim.

     (b) If an insured who makes an environmental claim under one or more general liability insurance policies that provide that an insurer has a duty to pay all sums arising out of a risk covered by the policies has more than one such general liability insurance policy that is triggered with one or more insurers, the insured shall provide notice of the claim to all such insurers for whom the insured has current addresses. If the insured’s claim is not fully satisfied and the insured files suit on the claim against less than all the insurers, the insured may choose which of the general liability insurance policies respond to the loss if not all are required to satisfy the insured’s claim. The insured or the insurers have a right to contribution as specified in subsection (4) of this section from all other insurers whose policies are triggered, and an insurer that has an obligation to pay may not fail to make payment to the insured on the grounds that another insurer has not made payment, unless the insurer has no obligation to respond to a claim until the limits of the underlying policy have been paid. The insured must choose that insurer based on the following factors:

     (A) The total period of time that an insurer issued a general liability insurance policy to the insured applicable to the environmental claim;

     (B) The policy limits, including any exclusions to coverage, of each of the general liability insurance policies that provide coverage or payment for the environmental claim; or

     (C) The policy that provides the most appropriate type of coverage for the type of environmental claim for which the insured is liable or potentially liable.

     (c) If requested by an insurer chosen by an insured under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the insured shall provide information regarding other general liability insurance policies held by the insured that would potentially provide coverage for the same environmental claim.

     (d) An insurer chosen by an insured under paragraph (b) of this subsection may not be required to pay defense or indemnity costs in excess of the applicable policy limits, if any, on such defense or indemnity costs, including any exclusions to coverage.

     (4)(a) An insurer that has paid all or part of an environmental claim may seek contribution from any other insurer that is liable or potentially liable to the insured and that has not entered into a good-faith settlement agreement with the insured regarding the environmental claim.

     (b) There is a rebuttable presumption that all binding settlement agreements entered into between an insured and an insurer are good-faith settlements. A settlement agreement between an insured and insurer that has been approved by a court of competent jurisdiction after 30 days’ notice to other insurers is a good-faith settlement agreement with respect to all such insurers to whom such notice was provided.

     (c) For purposes of ascertaining whether a right of contribution exists between insurers, an insurer that seeks to avoid or minimize payment of contribution may not assert a defense that the insurer is not liable or potentially liable because another insurer has fully satisfied the environmental claim of the insured and damages or coverage obligations are no longer owed to the insured.

     (d) Contribution rights by and among insurers under this section preempt all common law contribution rights, if any, by and between insurers for environmental claims.

     (5) If a court determines that the apportionment of recoverable costs between insurers is appropriate, the court shall allocate the covered damages between the insurers before the court, based on the following factors:

     (a) The total period of time that each solvent insurer issued a general liability insurance policy to the insured applicable to the environmental claim;

     (b) The policy limits, including any exclusions to coverage, of each of the general liability insurance policies that provide coverage or payment for the environmental claim for which the insured is liable or potentially liable;

     (c) The policy that provides the most appropriate type of coverage for the type of environmental claim;

     (d) The terms of the policies that related to the equitable allocation between insurers; and

     (e) If the insured is an uninsured for any part of the time period included in the environmental claim, the insured shall be considered an insurer for purposes of allocation.

     (6) If an insured is an uninsured for any part of the time period included in the environmental claim, an insurer who otherwise has an obligation to pay defense costs may deny that portion of defense costs that would be allocated to the insured under subsection (5) of this section.

     (7)(a) There is a rebuttable presumption that the costs of preliminary assessments, remedial investigations, risk assessments or other necessary investigation, as those terms are defined by rule by the Department of Environmental Quality, are defense costs payable by the insurer, subject to the provisions of the applicable general liability insurance policy or policies.

     (b) There is a rebuttable presumption that payment of the costs of removal actions or feasibility studies, as those terms are defined by rule by the Department of Environmental Quality, are indemnity costs and reduce the insurer’s applicable limit of liability on the insurer’s indemnity obligations, subject to the provisions of the applicable general liability insurance policy or policies.

     (8) The rules of construction set forth in this section and ORS 465.481 and 465.483 do not apply if the application of the rule results in an interpretation contrary to the intent of the parties to the general liability insurance policy. [1999 c.783 §4; 2003 c.799 §2; 2013 c.350 §4]

 

     465.481 General liability insurance policies; assignment. (1) A general liability insurance policy that contains a provision that requires the consent of an insurance company before the rights under an insurance policy may be assigned may not prohibit the assignment without consent of an environmental claim for payment under the policy for losses or damages that commenced prior to the assignment. The assignment and any release or covenant given for the assignment may not extinguish the cause of action against the insurer unless the assignment specifically so provides.

     (2) The provisions of this section apply without limitation to voluntary assignments, assignments made in settlement of an environmental claim against a policyholder, assignments made as a matter of law and assignments made in the course of a corporate insured reorganization, merger, acquisition or liquidation. [2013 c.350 §2]

 

     465.482 [1999 c.783 §6; renumbered 465.485 in 2013]

 

     465.483 General liability insurance policies; duty to defend; environmental consultants. (1) If the provisions of a general liability insurance policy impose a duty to defend upon an insurer, and the insurer has undertaken the defense of an environmental claim on behalf of an insured under a reservation of rights, or if the insured has potential liability for the environmental claim in excess of the limits of the general liability insurance policy, the insurer shall provide independent counsel to defend the insured who shall represent only the insured and not the insurer.

     (2)(a)(A) Independent counsel retained by the insurer to defend the insured under the provisions of this section must be experienced in handling the type and complexity of the environmental claim at issue.

     (B) If independent counsel who meet the requirements specified in this paragraph are not available within the insured’s community, then independent counsel from outside the insured’s community who meet the requirements of this paragraph must be considered.

     (b)(A) An insurer may retain environmental consultants to assist an independent counsel described in subsection (1) of this section. Any environmental consultants retained by the insurer must be experienced in responding to the type and complexity of the environmental claim at issue.

     (B) If environmental consultants who meet the requirements specified in this paragraph are not available within the insured’s community, then environmental consultants from outside the insured’s community who meet the requirements of this paragraph must be considered.

     (c) As used in this subsection, “experienced” means an established environmental practice that includes substantial defense experience in the type and complexity of environmental claim at issue.

     (3)(a) The obligation of the insurer to pay fees to independent counsel and environmental consultants is based on the regular and customary rates for the type and complexity of environmental claim at issue in the community where the underlying claim arose or is being defended.

     (b) In the event of a dispute concerning the selection of independent counsel or environmental consultants, or the fees of the independent counsel or an environmental consultant, either party may request that the other party participate in nonbinding environmental claim mediation described in ORS 465.484 (2).

     (4) The provisions of this section do not relieve the insured of its duty to cooperate with the insurer under the terms of the insurance contract. [2013 c.350 §7]

 

     465.484 Unfair environmental claims settlement practices; environmental claim mediation; rules; fees; damages. (1) An insurer or any other person may not commit any of the following unfair environmental claims settlement practices:

     (a) Failure to commence investigation of an environmental claim within 15 working days after receipt of a notice of an environmental claim or failure to diligently respond to tenders of environmental claims, provided that an excess insurer may rely on the investigation of a primary insurer.

     (b) Failure to make timely payments for costs reasonably incurred in the defense of environmental claims or for reasonable costs for which indemnity is owed.

     (c) Denial of a claim for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation.

     (d) Require that the insured provide answers to repetitive questions and requests for information concerning matters or issues unnecessary for resolution of the environmental claim of the insured, provided that an insurer may reserve its rights as to information that is not available at the time of the correspondence.

     (e) Failure to pay interest as specified in ORS 82.010:

     (A) On payments that an insured has made and that the insurer is legally obligated to pay as costs of defense or indemnity, provided that interest begins to accrue only on the 31st day after the claim for payment or reimbursement is presented or payment is made by the insured, whichever is later; or

     (B) On overdue payments that an insurer agreed to make pursuant to an agreed settlement with an insured, provided that interest begins to accrue on the 31st day after the date of the settlement or on the date by which the insurer agreed to make the payment, whichever is later.

     (f) Violation by insurers as described in ORS 465.479 (9)(a).

     (2)(a) In addition to the unfair environmental claims settlement practices specified in subsection (1) of this section, it is an unfair environmental claims settlement practice for an insurer to fail to participate in good faith in a nonbinding environmental claim mediation described under this subsection that is requested by an insured concerning the existence, terms or conditions of a lost policy or regarding coverage for an environmental claim.

     (b) The insured may request in writing that the insurer participate in a nonbinding environmental claim mediation.

     (c) Upon request from an insured to participate in a nonbinding environmental claim mediation, an insurer shall provide an insured with information concerning a nonbinding environmental claim mediation program. The information must include, but need not be limited to, a description of how an insured can efficiently commence the mediation with the insurer.

     (d) The purposes of the nonbinding environmental claim mediation include, but are not limited to, the following:

     (A) To assist the parties in resolving disputes concerning whether or not a general liability insurance policy applicable to the environmental claim was issued to the insured by the insurer and concerning the relevant terms, conditions and exclusions;

     (B) To determine whether the entire claim, or a portion thereof, can be settled by agreement of the parties;

     (C) To determine, if the claim cannot be settled, whether one or more issues can be resolved to the satisfaction of the parties; and

     (D) To discuss any other methods of streamlining or reducing the cost of litigation.

     (e) The Attorney General shall:

     (A) Appoint a mediation service provider to operate a mediation program related to environmental claims;

     (B) Prescribe by rule requirements related to qualification, training and experience for mediators who participate in the mediation program; and

     (C) Establish by rule a schedule of fees related to the mediation program.

     (f) Unless otherwise agreed, information provided and statements made by either party in a mediation shall be kept confidential by the parties and used only for purposes of the mediation in accordance with ORS 36.220.

     (g) The insured and the insurer shall have representatives present, or available by telephone, with authority to settle the matter at all mediation sessions.

     (3) The unfair environmental claims settlement practices specified in this section are in addition to any provisions relating to unfair claim settlement practices under ORS 746.230.

     (4)(a) Any insured aggrieved by one or more unfair environmental claims settlement practices specified in this section may apply to the circuit court for the county in which the insured resides, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the actual damages sustained, together with the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs.

     (b) Twenty days prior to filing an action based on this section, the insured must provide written notice of the basis for the cause of action to the insurer and office of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. Notice and proof of notice must be provided by regular mail, registered mail or certified mail with return receipt requested. The insurer and director are deemed to have received notice three business days after the notice is mailed.

     (c) If the insurer fails to resolve the basis for the action within the 20-day period after the written notice by the insured, the insured may bring the action without any further notice.

     (d) If a written notice of claim is served under paragraph (b) of this subsection within the time prescribed for the filing of an action under this subsection, the statute of limitations for the action is tolled during the period of time required to comply with paragraph (b) of this subsection.

     (e) In any action brought pursuant to this subsection, the court may, after finding that an insurer has acted unreasonably, increase the total award of damages to an amount not to exceed three times the actual damages.

     (f) An action under this subsection must be brought within two years from the date the alleged violation is, or should have been, discovered.

     (5) The provisions of this section do not limit the ability of a court to provide for any other remedy that is available at law. [2013 c.350 §6]

 

     465.485 Short title. ORS 465.475 to 465.484 shall be known and may be cited as the Oregon Environmental Cleanup Assistance Act. [Formerly 465.482]

     (b) To ensure the cleanup of contamination resulting from dry cleaning facilities.

     (2) The provisions of ORS 465.200 to 465.545 and 465.900, and rules and programs adopted thereto, shall continue to apply to the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances from dry cleaning facilities, including but not limited to provisions and programs for:

     (a) Listing of facilities having a confirmed release of dry cleaning solvents;

     (b) Prioritizing dry cleaning facilities with confirmed releases for removal or remedial action;
