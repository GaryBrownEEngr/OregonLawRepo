      (4)(a) In awarding a public contract under ORS 279.835 to 279.855 or ORS chapter 279A, 279B or 279C for a removal or remedial action pursuant to ORS 465.200 to 465.545, a corrective action or cleanup action pursuant to ORS 466.005 to 466.385, 466.605 to 466.680 or 466.706 to 466.882 or a removal pursuant to ORS 468B.005 to 468B.030, 468B.035, 468B.048 to 468B.085, 468B.090, 468B.093, 468B.095 and 468B.300 to 468B.500, the department, and the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, when administering the establishment of such a contract on behalf of the Department of Environmental Quality under ORS 279A.050 and 279A.140, shall subtract from the amount of any bid or proposal the hazardous waste management fees and solid waste fees that would be required by law to be paid to the department for waste that would be disposed of at a solid waste disposal site or a hazardous waste or PCB disposal facility, based on the bid or proposal. The amount to be subtracted shall be established on the basis of reasonable preprocurement estimates of the amount of waste that would be disposed of under the contract and that would be subject to those fees.

      (b) The subtraction for fees under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall apply only to a contract reasonably anticipated to involve the disposal of no less than 50 tons of hazardous waste or no less than 500 tons of solid waste. The Legislative Assembly finds that making accurate advance estimates of amounts of waste that would be disposed of in projects of this character is technically challenging and requires the application of professional discretion. Therefore, no award of a contract under this subsection shall be subject to challenge, under ORS 279B.410, 279B.415 or 279C.460 or otherwise, on the ground of the inaccuracy or claimed inaccuracy of any such estimate.

      (c) The subtraction for fees under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply to the establishment, by or on behalf of the department, of master contracts by which the department engages the services of a contractor over a period of time for the purpose of issuing work orders for the performance of environmental activities on a project or projects for which the amounts of waste to be disposed of were not reasonably identified at the inception of the master contracts. However, the department shall require any contractor under a master contract to apply the subtraction for fees under paragraph (a) of this subsection in the selection of any subcontractor to perform the removal of waste in amounts equaling or exceeding the amounts set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the department or the Oregon Department of Administrative Services from establishing contracts pursuant to this section through contracting procedures authorized by ORS 279.835 to 279.855 and ORS chapters 279A, 279B and 279C that do not require the solicitation of bids or proposals.

      (3) The director may delegate to any of the employees of the department the exercise or discharge in the director’s name of any power, duty or function of whatever character, vested in or imposed by law upon the director. The official act of any such person so acting in the director’s name and by the authority of the director shall be considered to be an official act of the director. [Formerly 449.028]

 

      468.050 Deputy director. (1) With the approval of the commission, the director may appoint a deputy director in the unclassified service who shall serve at the pleasure of the director.

The appointment of the deputy director shall be by written order, filed with the Secretary of State.

      (2) The deputy director shall receive such salary as may be provided by law or, if not so provided, as may be fixed by the director, and shall be reimbursed for all expenses actually and necessarily incurred by the deputy director in the performance of the official duties of the deputy director.

      468.060 Enforcement of rules by local health authorities.

      (1) Applications for all permits authorized or required by ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B shall be made in a form prescribed by the Department of Environmental Quality. Any permit issued by the department shall specify its duration, and the conditions for compliance with the rules and standards, if any, adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission pursuant to ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B.

      (2) By rule and after hearing, the commission may establish a schedule of fees for permits issued pursuant to ORS 468A.040, 468A.045, 468A.155 and 468B.050. Except as provided in ORS 468A.315, 468A.345 and 468B.051, the fees contained in the schedule shall be based upon the anticipated cost of filing and investigating the application, of carrying out applicable requirements of Title V, of issuing or denying the requested permit, and of an inspection program to determine compliance or noncompliance with the permit. The fee shall accompany the application for the permit. The fees for a permit issued under ORS 468A.040 or 468B.050 may be imposed on an annual basis.

      (3) An applicant for certification of a project under ORS 468B.040 or 468B.045, and any person submitting a notice of intent to seek reauthorization, a preliminary application or an application for reauthorization of a water right for a hydroelectric project under ORS 543A.030, 543A.035, 543A.075, 543A.080 or 543A.095 shall pay as a fee all expenses incurred by the commission and department related to the review and decision of the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality and commission. These expenses may include legal expenses, expenses incurred in evaluating the project, issuing or denying certification and expenses of commissioning an independent study by a contractor of any aspect of the proposed project. These expenses shall not include the costs incurred in defending a decision of either the director or the commission against appeals or legal challenges. The department shall bill applicants for costs incurred on a monthly basis, and shall provide a biennial report describing how the moneys were spent. An applicant may arrange with the department to pay the fee on a quarterly basis. The department shall not charge a fee under the fee authority in this subsection if the holder is being charged a fee under ORS 543.088 and 543.090 or 543A.405. In no event shall the department assess fees under this section and under ORS 543A.405 for performance of the same work.

      (4) The department may require the submission of plans, specifications and corrections and revisions thereto and such other reasonable information as it considers necessary to determine the eligibility of the applicant for the permit.

      (5) The department may require periodic reports from persons who hold permits under ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.225, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B. The report shall be in a form prescribed by the department and shall contain such information as to the amount and nature or common description of the pollutant, contaminant or waste and such other information as the department may require.

      (6) Any fee collected under a schedule of fees established pursuant to this section or ORS 468A.315 or 468A.345 shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of an account of the department. The fees are continuously appropriated to meet the expenses of the program for which they are collected, except as follows:

      (a) The federal operating permit program shall include a commensurate amount of the fee for any permit specified in this section for which the department incurs costs associated with the requirements of Title V and any fees collected under ORS 468A.315. Fees collected for the federal operating permit program in any biennium that exceed the legislatively approved budget, including amounts authorized by the Emergency Board for the federal operating permit program for such biennium, shall be credited toward the federal operating permit program budget for the following biennium.

      (b) Fees collected for permits issued under ORS 468B.050 to authorize the discharge of wastes into the waters of the state may be used to pay the expenses of any of the programs associated with the issuance of permits under ORS 468B.050 to authorize the discharge of wastes into the waters of the state.

      (c) The fees collected under a schedule of fees established pursuant to this section or ORS 468A.315 or 468A.345 by a regional air pollution control authority pursuant to a permit program authorized by the commission shall be retained by and shall be income to the regional authority except as provided in ORS 468A.155 (2)(c). Such fees shall be accounted for and expended in the same manner as are other funds of the regional authority. However, if the department finds after hearing that the permit program administered by the regional authority does not conform to the requirements of the permit program approved by the commission pursuant to ORS 468A.155, such fees shall be deposited and expended as are permit fees submitted to the department.

      (7) As used in this section, “Title V” has the meaning given in ORS 468A.300. [Formerly 449.733; 1975 c.445 §7; 1983 c.144 §2; 1983 c.740 §182; 1989 c.199 §1; 1989 c.833 §77; 1991 c.723 §1; 1991 c.752 §15; 1993 c.790 §2; 1997 c.449 §40b; 1999 c.873 §12; 2005 c.523 §3; 2018 c.102 §18]

 

      468.067 Organizational standing to seek judicial review of final order in Title V permit proceeding. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 183.480 and 183.484, an association or organization has standing to seek judicial review of any final order, as defined in ORS 183.310, of the Department of Environmental Quality or of the Environmental Quality Commission that relates to a proceeding described in subsection (2) of this section if:

      (a) One or more members of the association or organization is adversely affected or aggrieved by the order;

      (b) The interests that the association or organization seeks to protect are germane to the purpose of the association or organization; and

      (c) The nature of the claim and the relief requested do not require that the members of the association or organization who are adversely affected or aggrieved by the order participate in the judicial review proceedings.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies to a permit proceeding pursuant to Title V of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7661 to 7661f, as implemented under ORS chapter 468A. [1999 c.511 §2]

 

      468.068 [1997 c.569 §§3,4(2); renumbered 468B.047 in 1999]

 

      468.070 Denial, modification, suspension or revocation of permits. (1) At any time, the Department of Environmental Quality may refuse to issue, modify, suspend, revoke or refuse to renew any permit issued pursuant to ORS 468.065 if it finds:

      (b) Failure to comply with the conditions of the permit.

      (c) Violation of any applicable provisions of ORS 466.605 to 466.680, 466.990 (3) and (4) and 466.995 (2) or ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B.

      (d) Violation of any applicable rule, standard or order of the Environmental Quality Commission.

      (2) The department may modify any permit issued pursuant to ORS 468.065 if it finds that modification is necessary for the proper administration, implementation or enforcement of the provisions of ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755, 466.605 to 466.680 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B.

      (3) The procedure for modification, suspension, revocation or refusal to issue or renew shall be the procedure for a contested case as provided in ORS chapter 183. [1973 c.835 §14; 1979 c.184 §1; 1985 c.733 §22; 1993 c.422 §32]

 

      468.073 Expedited or enhanced regulatory process; payment; disposition of payments. (1) The Department of Environmental Quality may enter into an agreement with any applicant, permittee or regulated entity setting a schedule of payments to the department for the purpose of enabling the department to expedite or enhance a regulatory process by contracting for services, hiring additional staff or covering costs of activities not otherwise provided during the ordinary course of department business. The department may expend moneys received under the agreements for:

      (a) Activities undertaken by the department under authority of any provision of ORS chapters 448, 453, 454, 459, 459A, 465, 466, 467, 468, 468A and 468B and ORS 475.405 to 475.495.

      (b) Administering and reviewing activities described under subsection (3) of this section that are performed by a third party.

The department shall not alter or establish processing priorities or schedules based upon an expectation of entering into an agreement under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Not later than July 1, 1998, the department shall identify department activities or portions thereof suitable for contracting out to third parties. Failure of the department to identify a specific activity shall not prevent the expenditure of funds for that activity or for department administration and review of that activity under an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) Any moneys received by the department under an agreement described under subsection (1) of this section shall not exceed the cost to the department of providing the service to the applicant, permittee or regulated entity.

      (5) Any payments received under an agreement described under subsections (1) to (4) of this section shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of an account of the Department of Environmental Quality and are continuously appropriated for the purposes specified in the individual agreements.

      468.079 Action for pollution originating in reciprocating jurisdiction. A person who suffers, or is threatened with, injury to the person or property in a reciprocating jurisdiction caused by pollution originating, or that may originate, in Oregon, has the same rights to relief with respect to the injury or threatened injury, and may enforce those rights in Oregon as if the injury or threatened injury occurred in Oregon. [1991 c.826 §4]

      468.080 Applicability of Oregon law. The law to be applied in an action or other proceeding brought under ORS 468.076 to 468.087, including what constitutes “pollution,” is the law of Oregon excluding Oregon’s choice of law rules. Nothing in ORS 468.076 to 468.087 restricts the applicability of federal law in actions in which federal law is preemptive. Nothing in ORS 468.076 to 468.087 determines whether state law or federal law applies in any particular legal action. [1991 c.826 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 468.076.

 

      468.081 Rights of injured person. ORS 468.076 to 468.087 do not accord a person injured or threatened with injury in another jurisdiction any rights superior to those that the person would have if injured or threatened with injury in Oregon. [1991 c.826 §6]

ENFORCEMENT

 

      468.090 Complaint procedure. (1) In case any written substantiated complaint is filed with the Department of Environmental Quality which it has cause to believe, or in case the department itself has cause to believe, that any person is violating any rule or standard adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission or any permit issued by the department by causing or permitting water pollution or air pollution or air contamination, the department shall cause an investigation thereof to be made. If it finds after such investigation that such a violation of any rule or standard of the commission or of any permit issued by the department exists, it shall by conference, conciliation and persuasion endeavor to eliminate the source or cause of the pollution or contamination which resulted in such violation.

      (2) In case of failure to remedy the violation, the department shall commence enforcement proceedings pursuant to the procedures set forth in ORS chapter 183 for a contested case and in ORS 468B.032. [Formerly 449.815; 1999 c.975 §3]

 

      468.095 Investigatory authority; entry on premises; status of records. (1) The Department of Environmental Quality shall have the power to enter upon and inspect, at any reasonable time, any public or private property, premises or place for the purpose of investigating either an actual or suspected source of water pollution or air pollution or air contamination or to ascertain compliance or noncompliance with any rule or standard adopted or order or permit issued pursuant to ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B.

      (2) Unless classified by the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality as confidential, any records, reports or information obtained under ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B shall be available to the public. Upon a showing satisfactory to the director by any person that records, reports or information, or particular parts thereof, other than emission data, if made public, would divulge a secret process, device or method of manufacturing or production entitled to protection as trade secrets of such person, the director shall classify such record, report or information, or particular part thereof, other than emission data, confidential and such confidential record, report or information, or particular part thereof, other than emission data, shall not be made a part of any public record or used in any public hearing unless it is determined by a circuit court that evidence thereof is necessary to the determination of an issue or issues being decided at a public hearing. [Formerly 449.169; 1975 c.173 §1]

 

      468.100 Enforcement procedures; powers of regional authorities; status of procedures.

      (2) The proceedings authorized by subsection (1) of this section may be instituted without the necessity of prior agency notice, hearing and order, or during said agency hearing if it has been initially commenced by the commission.

      (3) A regional authority formed under ORS 468A.105 may exercise the same functions as are vested in the commission by this section insofar as such functions relate to air pollution control and are applicable to the conditions and situations of the territory within the regional authority. The regional authority shall carry out these functions in the manner provided for the commission to carry out the same functions.

      (4) The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in substitution of any other civil or criminal enforcement provisions available to the commission or a regional authority. The provisions of this section shall not prevent the maintenance of actions for legal or equitable remedies relating to private or public nuisances brought by any other person, or by the state on relation of any person without prior order of the commission. [1973 c.826 §2; 1979 c.284 §153]

Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by any order of the Environmental Quality Commission may appeal from such order in accordance with the provisions of ORS chapter 183. However, notwithstanding ORS 183.482 (3), relating to a stay of enforcement of an agency order and the giving of bond or other undertaking related thereto, any reviewing court before it may stay an order of the commission shall give due consideration to the public interest in the continued enforcement of the commission’s order, and may take testimony thereon. [Formerly 449.090; 2007 c.71 §148]

 

      468.115 Enforcement in cases of emergency. (1) Whenever it appears to the Department of Environmental Quality that water pollution or air pollution or air contamination is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, at the direction of the Governor the department shall, without the necessity of prior administrative procedures or hearing, enter an order against the person or persons responsible for the pollution or contamination requiring the person or persons to cease and desist from the action causing the pollution or contamination. Such order shall be effective for a period not to exceed 10 days and may be renewed thereafter by order of the Governor.

      (2) The state and local police shall cooperate in the enforcement of any order issued pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and shall require no further authority or warrant in executing and enforcing such an order.

      (3) If any person fails to comply with an order issued pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the circuit court in which the source of water pollution or air pollution or air contamination is located shall compel compliance with the order in the same manner as with an order of that court. [Formerly 449.980]

      (2) Subpoenas authorized by this section may be served by any person authorized by the person issuing the subpoena. Witnesses who are subpoenaed shall receive the fees and mileage provided in ORS 44.415 (2). [Formerly 449.048; 1989 c.980 §14b]

 

      468.125 [Formerly 449.967; 1977 c.317 §2; 1983 c.703 §17; 1985 c.735 §3; 1987 c.741 §19; repealed by 1991 c.650 §8 (468.126 enacted in lieu of 468.125)]

 

      468.126 Advance notice. (1) No civil penalty prescribed under ORS 468.140 shall be imposed for a violation of an air, water or solid waste permit issued by the Department of Environmental Quality until the permittee has received five days’ advance warning in writing from the department, specifying the violation and stating that a penalty will be imposed for the violation unless the permittee submits the following to the department in writing within five working days after receipt of the advance warning:

      (a) A response certifying that the permitted facility is complying with applicable law;

      (b) A proposal to bring the facility into compliance with applicable law that is acceptable to the department and that includes but is not limited to proposed compliance dates; or

Notwithstanding the requirement for a response to the department within five working days, the permittee may file a request under this paragraph within 20 days from the date of service of the notice.

      (2) No advance notice shall be required under subsection (1) of this section if:

      (a) The violation is intentional;

      (b) The water or air violation would not normally occur for five consecutive days;

      (c) The permittee has received prior advance warning of any violation of the permit within the 36 months immediately preceding the violation;

      (d) The permittee is subject to the federal operating permit program under ORS 468A.300 to 468A.320 and violates any rule or standard adopted or permit or order issued under ORS chapter 468A and applicable to the permittee; or

      (e) The requirement to provide such notice would disqualify a state program from federal approval or delegation. [1991 c.650 §9 (enacted in lieu of 468.125); 1993 c.790 §3; 1999 c.975 §4]

Where the classification involves air pollution, the commission shall consult with the regional air quality control authorities before adopting any classification or schedule.

      (2) In imposing a penalty pursuant to the schedule or schedules authorized by this section, the commission and regional air quality control authorities shall consider the following factors:

      (a) The past history of the person incurring a penalty in taking all feasible steps or procedures necessary or appropriate to correct any violation.

      (b) Any prior violations of statutes, rules, orders and permits enforceable by the commission or by regional air quality control authorities.

      (c) The economic and financial conditions of the person incurring a penalty.

      (d) The gravity and magnitude of the violation.

PRESERVATION OF BASELINE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS

 

      468.148 Legislative findings and declarations. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that the purposes of ORS 468.149 are to:

      (1) Retain the protections afforded to public health and this state’s environment and natural resources under the baseline federal standards contained in federal environmental laws, regardless of actions taken at the federal level;

      (2) Protect the public health, safety and welfare of the people of Oregon from any actual or potential adverse effect that reasonably may be anticipated to occur from pollution, including the effects of climate change;

      (3) Preserve, protect and enhance this state’s environment and natural resources, including, but not limited to, state and national parks, recreation areas, wilderness areas, monuments and ocean shores and other areas with special national or regional natural, recreational, scenic or historic value;

      (4) Provide for stable regulatory conditions to support long-term economic growth; and

      (5) Ensure that decisions made by state agencies that may adversely impact public health, the environment or natural resources are made only after careful evaluation of all consequences and only after adequate procedural opportunities for informed public participation in decision-making processes. [2019 c.138 §1]

 

      Note: 468.148 and 468.149 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 468 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      468.149 Assessment of final changes to federal environmental law; state implementation of baseline federal standards. (1) As used in this section and ORS 468.148:

      (a) “Baseline federal standards” means the standards and requirements contained in a federal environmental law, as those standards and requirements were in effect on January 19, 2017.

      (b) “Federal environmental law” means any one or more of the following:

      (A) The federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., and any federal regulations issued pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act.

      (C) The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., and any federal regulations issued pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.

      (2) The Department of Environmental Quality and the Oregon Health Authority shall regularly assess final changes to federal environmental law that the department or the authority has been authorized or directed to administer to determine whether the final changes to federal environmental law are significantly less protective of public health, the environment or natural resources than baseline federal standards.

      (3) If the Department of Environmental Quality determines that a change assessed by the department under subsection (2) of this section results or will result in federal standards or requirements that are significantly less protective of public health, the environment or natural resources than baseline federal standards, the department shall promptly inform the Environmental Quality Commission and recommend to the commission actions as necessary to continue state implementation of standards and requirements that are at least as protective of public health, the environment or natural resources as baseline federal standards, regardless of the change assessed under subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) If the Oregon Health Authority determines that a change assessed by the authority under subsection (2) of this section results or will result in federal standards or requirements that are significantly less protective of public health, the environment or natural resources than baseline federal standards, the authority shall take actions as necessary to continue state implementation of standards and requirements that are at least as protective of public health, the environment or natural resources as baseline federal standards, regardless of the change assessed under subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) Nothing in this section prevents the Environmental Quality Commission or the Oregon Health Authority from adopting rules for the administration of federal environmental law that are more protective of public health, the environment or natural resources than baseline federal standards.

POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES TAX CREDIT

 

      468.150 Field sanitation and straw utilization and disposal methods as “pollution control facilities.” After alternative methods for field sanitation and straw utilization and disposal are approved by the Department of Environmental Quality, “pollution control facility,” as defined in ORS 468.155, shall include such approved alternative methods and persons purchasing and utilizing such methods shall be eligible for the benefits allowed by ORS 468.155 to 468.190. [1975 c.559 §15; 1999 c.59 §136]

 

      Note: 468.150 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 468 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      468.153 Legislative findings and declarations. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that the concept of environmental responsibility has matured beyond basic compliance with regulatory requirements to one in which citizens and businesses voluntarily implement innovative solutions to achieve shared environmental goals.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that a pollution control tax credit that shifts the majority of the incentive away from compensation for basic regulatory compliance and toward encouraging voluntary investment is an effective way to achieve environmental goals.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that it is the policy of this state to promote sustainability and provide incentives for the voluntary prevention, elimination, reduction or control of air pollution, water pollution, solid waste and hazardous waste through the voluntary application of innovative solutions to achieve the environmental goals of this state.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly declares it to be the policy of this state to promote social, economic and environmental principles of sustainability by providing incentives to individuals and businesses that support social, economic and environmental sustainability goals. [2001 c.928 §9]

[Formerly 449.615; 1975 c.496 §2; 1977 c.795 §2; 1979 c.802 §2]

 

      468.163 Commencement of construction or installation of facility. For purposes of ORS 468.155 to 468.190, the construction or installation of a facility is commenced when the person constructing or installing the facility has obtained all necessary preliminary approvals and has begun continuous on-site modification, construction, installation or other activity, the completion of which will cause the person to be able to obtain certification under ORS 468.155 to 468.190. Interruptions and delays resulting from natural disasters, strikes, litigation or other matters beyond the control of the owner shall be disregarded in determining whether the actions undertaken by the person are continuous. The burden of demonstrating that construction or installation of a facility is commenced shall be borne by the person filing an application for certification under ORS 468.165. [2001 c.928 §8a]

 

      468.165 Application for certification of pollution control facilities; rules; fees. (1) Any person may apply to the Environmental Quality Commission for certification under ORS 468.170 of a pollution control facility or portion thereof erected, constructed or installed by the person in Oregon if:

      (a) The air or water pollution control facility was erected, constructed or installed on or after January 1, 1967.

      (b) The noise pollution control facility was erected, constructed or installed on or after January 1, 1977.

      (c) The solid waste facility was under construction on or after January 1, 1973, the hazardous waste or used oil facility was under construction on or after October 3, 1979, and if:

      (3) The Director of the Department of Environmental Quality may require any further information the director considers necessary before a certificate is issued.

      (4) The application shall be accompanied by a fee established under subsection (5) of this section. The fee may be refunded if the application for certification is rejected.

      (5) By rule and after hearing the commission may adopt a schedule of reasonable fees which the department may require of applicants for certificates issued under ORS 468.167 and 468.170. Before the adoption or revision of any such fees the commission shall estimate the total cost of the program to the department. The fees shall be based on the anticipated cost of filing, investigating, granting and rejecting the applications and shall be designed not to exceed the total cost estimated by the commission. Any excess fees shall be held by the department and shall be used by the commission to reduce any future fee increases. The fee may vary according to the size and complexity of the facility. The fees may not be considered by the commission as part of the cost of the facility to be certified.

      (6) The application shall be submitted after construction of the facility is substantially completed and the facility is placed in service and within one year after construction of the facility is substantially completed. Failure to file a timely application shall make the facility ineligible for tax credit certification. An application may not be considered filed until it is complete and ready for processing. The commission may grant an extension of time to file an application for circumstances beyond the control of the applicant that would make a timely filing unreasonable. However, the period for filing an application may not be extended to a date beyond December 31, 2008. [Formerly 449.625; 1974 c.37 §2; 1975 c.496 §3; 1977 c.795 §3; 1979 c.802 §3; 1981 c.359 §1; 1983 c.637 §2; 1989 c.802 §5; 1995 c.746 §2; 1999 c.826 §2; 2001 c.928 §1]

 

      468.167 Application for precertification. (1) Any person proposing to apply for certification for tax relief under ORS 468.155 to 468.190 may apply, before the completion of a pollution control facility, for precertification of the facility with the Environmental Quality Commission.

      (2)(a) The application shall be made in writing in a form prescribed by the Department of Environmental Quality. The application shall contain the following information:

      (A) A statement of the purpose of prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or recycling or appropriate disposal of used oil served or to be served by the facility.

      (B) A description of the materials for incorporation into the facility or incorporated into the facility, machinery and equipment to be made or made a part of the facility and the proposed or existing operational procedure of the facility.

      (b) The application need not contain information on the actual cost of the facility or the portion of the actual cost properly allocable to the prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil.

      (c) The application shall be accompanied by a fee as provided under ORS 468.165 (5). The fee may be refunded if the application for preliminary certification is rejected.

      (3) If the commission determines that the person and the pollution control facility will be eligible for tax relief under ORS 307.405 or 315.304 if the facility is erected, constructed, reconstructed, added to, installed, improved or used in accordance with the application for precertification, the commission shall precertify the facility by approving the application.

      (4) If the facility is erected, constructed, reconstructed, added to, installed, improved or used as proposed in the application for precertification, the commission’s approval of the application shall be prima facie evidence that the facility is qualified for certification for tax relief under ORS 468.170. However, precertification shall not ensure that a facility erected, constructed, reconstructed, added to, installed, improved or used by the precertified person will receive certification under ORS 468.170 or tax relief under ORS 307.405 or 315.304.

      (5) If the commission fails or refuses to precertify a person and facility, the person may appeal as provided in ORS 468.170 (3). [1995 c.746 §6]

 

      468.170 Action on application; rejection; appeal; issuance of certificate; certification. (1) The Environmental Quality Commission shall act on an application for certification before the 120th day after the filing of the application under ORS 468.165. The action of the commission shall include certification of the actual cost of the facility and the portion of the actual cost properly allocable to the prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil. The actual cost or portion of the actual cost certified may not exceed the taxpayer’s own cash investment in the facility or portion of the facility. Each certificate shall bear a separate serial number for each such facility.

      (2) If the commission rejects an application for certification, or certifies a lesser actual cost of the facility or a lesser portion of the actual cost properly allocable to the prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil than was claimed in the application for certification, the commission shall cause written notice of its action, and a concise statement of the findings and reasons therefor, to be sent by registered or certified mail to the applicant before the 120th day after the filing of the application.

      (3) If the application is rejected for any reason, including the information furnished by the applicant as to the cost of the facility, or if the applicant is dissatisfied with the certification of actual cost or portion of the actual cost properly allocable to prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil, the applicant may appeal from the rejection as provided in ORS 468.110. The rejection or the certification is final and conclusive on all parties unless the applicant takes an appeal therefrom as provided in ORS 468.110 before the 30th day after notice was mailed by the commission.

      (4)(a) The commission shall certify a pollution control, solid waste, hazardous waste or used oil facility or portion thereof, for which an application has been made under ORS 468.165, if the commission finds that the facility:

      (A) Was erected, constructed or installed in accordance with the requirements of ORS 468.165 (1);

      (B) Is designed for, and is being operated or will operate in accordance with the requirements of ORS 468.155; and

      (b) No determination of the proportion of the actual cost of the facility to be certified shall be made until receipt of the application.

      (c) If one or more facilities constitute an operational unit, the commission may certify such facilities under one certificate.

      (d) A certificate under this section is effective for purposes of tax relief in accordance with ORS 307.405 and 315.304 if, on or before December 31, 2007, erection, construction or installation of the facility is completed, the facility is placed in service and the application for certification is filed with the commission under ORS 468.165.

      (5) A person receiving a certificate under this section may take tax relief only under ORS 315.304, depending upon the tax status of the person’s trade or business except that:

      (a) A corporation organized under ORS chapter 65 or any subsequent transferee of the corporation shall take tax relief only under ORS 307.405; and

      (b)(A) A corporation organized under ORS chapter 62 or any predecessor to ORS chapter 62 relating to the incorporation of cooperative associations or the subsequent transferee of the corporation may make an irrevocable election to take the tax relief under either ORS 315.304 or 307.405. The corporation shall make the election at the time of applying for the certificate, except that a corporation receiving a certificate prior to December 31, 1995, may make the election at any time on or before December 31, 1995. If a corporation elects on or before December 31, 1995, to take the tax relief under ORS 315.304, any income taxes, penalties or interest otherwise payable by the corporation for improperly taking the tax relief under ORS 315.304 in a taxable year prior to making the election shall be waived.

      (a) The certification was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation; or

      (b) The holder of the certificate has failed substantially to operate the facility for the purpose of, and to the extent necessary for, preventing, controlling or reducing air, water or noise pollution or solid waste, hazardous wastes or used oil as specified in such certificate.

      (2) As soon as the order of revocation under this section has become final, the commission shall notify the Department of Revenue and the county assessor of the county in which the facility is located of such order.

      (3) If the certification of a pollution control or solid waste, hazardous wastes or used oil facility is ordered revoked pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, all prior tax relief provided to the holder of such certificate by virtue of such certificate shall be forfeited and the Department of Revenue or the proper county officers shall proceed to collect those taxes not paid by the certificate holder as a result of the tax relief provided to the holder under any provision of ORS 307.405 and 315.304.

      (4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if the certification of a pollution control or solid waste, hazardous wastes or used oil facility is ordered revoked pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, the certificate holder shall be denied any further relief provided under ORS 307.405 or 315.304 in connection with such facility, as the case may be, from and after the date that the order of revocation becomes final.

      (5) The commission may reinstate a tax credit certification revoked under subsection (1)(b) of this section if the commission finds the facility has been brought into compliance. If the commission reinstates certification under this subsection, the commission shall notify the Department of Revenue or the county assessor of the county in which the facility is located that the tax credit certification is reinstated for the remaining period of the tax credit, less the period of revocation as determined by the commission.

(1) Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, in establishing the portion of costs properly allocable to the prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil for facilities qualifying for certification under ORS 468.170, the Environmental Quality Commission shall consider the following factors:

      (a) If applicable, the extent to which the facility is used to recover and convert waste products into a salable or usable commodity.

      (b) The estimated annual percent return on the investment in the facility.

      (c) If applicable, the alternative methods, equipment and costs for achieving the same pollution control objective.

      (d) Any related savings or increase in costs which occur or may occur as a result of the installation of the facility.

      (e) Any other factors which are relevant in establishing the portion of the actual cost of the facility properly allocable to the prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil.

      (2) The portion of actual costs properly allocable shall be from zero to 100 percent in increments of one percent. If zero percent, the commission shall issue an order denying certification.

      (3) If the cost of the facility (or facilities certified under one certificate) does not exceed $50,000, the portion of the actual costs properly allocable shall be in the proportion that the ratio of the time the facility is used for prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil bears to the entire time the facility is used for any purpose.

      (4) In the case of a business described in ORS 315.304 (4)(a)(C)(i), the Environmental Quality Commission shall consider the factors listed in subsection (1) of this section as if the person operating the facility or conducting the trade or business that utilizes property requiring such a facility were the applicant for the credit, regardless of whether the person is the lessee or lessor of the facility.

      (5) The commission may adopt rules establishing methods to be used to determine the portion of costs properly allocable to the prevention, control or reduction of air, water or noise pollution or solid or hazardous waste or to recycling or appropriately disposing of used oil.

      (3) The refusal of a municipal corporation, city, county or agency of the State of Oregon, or combinations thereof, to apply for federal funds in such amounts as determined by the commission as just and necessary for which it would otherwise be eligible, shall be sufficient grounds to terminate any further participation in construction of a facility by the commission.

      (4) The municipal corporation, city, county or agency of the State of Oregon, or combinations thereof, shall consent to and request that funds made available to it by an agency of the federal government shall be paid directly to the commission if required to do so under subsection (2) of this section.

      Note: See note under 468.263.

 

      468.266 Issuance of bonds. (1) All principal of and interest on bonds issued pursuant to ORS 468.263 to 468.272 shall be payable solely out of the revenues, proceeds and receipts from the lease or sale of the property, loan repayments, or out of the proceeds of revenue bonds issued pursuant to ORS 468.263 to 468.272 as shall be specified in the proceedings of the governing body by which the issuance of bonds shall have been authorized. The principal and interest shall not constitute nor give rise to a pecuniary liability of the municipality or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, and such limitation shall be plainly stated upon the face of each bond.

      (2) The bonds:

      (a) May be executed and delivered at any time and from time to time;

      (b) May be in such form, denomination, tenor and maturity;

      (c) May be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, and may provide for conversion between registered and coupon bonds of varying denominations;

      (4) Issuance by the county of one or more series of bonds for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same purpose or any other purpose, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds.

      (5) Any bonds of the county at any time outstanding may be refunded if permitted by the conditions of issuance, at any time and from time to time by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the governing body may deem necessary but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection therewith. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have then matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by the exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the bonds so to be refunded, and regardless of whether or not the bonds to be refunded were issued in connection with the same facilities or separate facilities, and regardless of whether or not the bonds proposed to be refunded shall be payable at the same date or different dates or shall be due serially or otherwise.

      (6) All bonds issued under ORS 468.263 to 468.272 and interest coupons attached thereto shall be construed to be negotiable instruments. [1974 c.34 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 468.263.

 

      468.267 Security for bonds. The principal of and interest on any bonds shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues, proceeds and receipts or any portion thereof out of which the principal and interest are made payable, and may be secured by a mortgage covering all or any part of the facilities from which the revenues, proceeds or receipts so pledged may be derived, including any enlargements thereof and additions thereto, by a pledge or assignment of the lease to such facility or by such other security as may be deemed to be prescribed in the proceedings of the governing body and authorizing the issuance of bonds. The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized to be issued and any mortgage securing such bonds may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the facilities and properties covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portions thereof leased by the municipality to others, the fixing and collection of proceeds from the sale of any facilities and properties by the municipality to others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, and such other provisions not inconsistent with ORS 468.263 to 468.272, all as the governing body shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions of ORS 468.263 to 468.272. Each pledge, lease, sublease, agreement and mortgage made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds shall continue effective until the principal of and interest on the bonds for the benefit of which the same were made have been fully paid. [1974 c.34 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 468.263.

 

      468.268 Enforcement of bond obligation. (1) The proceedings authorizing any bonds and any mortgage securing such bonds may provide that, in the event of a default in the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds or in the performance of any agreement contained in such proceedings or mortgage, such payment and performance may be enforced by suit, mandamus or by the appointment of a receiver with power to charge and collect rents and to apply the revenues from the facilities in accordance with such proceedings or the provisions of such mortgage by foreclosure of any mortgage or by any one or more remedies specified in the proceedings.

      (2) Such proceedings or mortgage may also provide that any trustee under such mortgage or the holder of any of the bonds secured thereby may become the purchaser at any foreclosure sale if the highest bidder therefor. [1974 c.34 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 468.263.

 

      468.269 Trustees; powers. The proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds may provide for the appointment of one or more trustees for the protection of the holders of the bonds, whether or not a mortgage is entered into as security for such bonds. A bank with trust powers or a trust company within or without the State of Oregon may be appointed as trustee and shall be located in the United States, and shall have the immunities, powers and duties provided in said proceedings, and may, to the extent permitted by such proceedings, hold and invest funds deposited with it in direct obligations of the United States, obligations guaranteed by the United States or certificates of deposit of a bank, including the trustee, which are continuously secured by such obligations of or guaranteed by the United States. Any bank acting as such trustee may, to the extent permitted by such proceedings, buy bonds issued under ORS 468.263 to 468.272 to the same extent as if it were not such trustee. The proceedings authorizing the bonds may provide that some or all of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds, the revenues of any facilities, the proceeds of the sale of any part of a facility, or of any insurance policy or of any condemnation award shall be deposited with the trustee and applied as provided in the proceedings. [1974 c.34 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 468.263.

 

      468.270 Tax status of leasehold interest in facilities. Nothing in ORS 468.263 to 468.272 is intended to exempt from taxation or assessment the leasehold interest of any lessee in any facility nor are ORS 468.263 to 468.272 intended to affect any exemption or credit from taxation which might otherwise be available to any lessee under the laws of the State of Oregon. Such leasehold interest is classified for purposes of taxation as having the same value as the fee interest in that property. [1974 c.34 §8]

 

      Note: See note under 468.263.

 

      468.271 Effect on procedure of awarding contracts; construction. (1) The construction, reconstruction or improvement of any facilities shall be completed in the manner determined by the governing body and shall be free from any requirement of competitive bidding or any other restriction imposed on the procedure for award of contracts with public bodies.

      (2) Nothing in ORS 468.263 to 468.272 is intended as a restriction or limitation upon any other powers which a county might otherwise have under the laws of this state, but shall be construed as cumulative.

      (3) If any provision of ORS 468.263 to 468.272 or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions of ORS 468.263 to 468.272 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of ORS 468.263 to 468.272 are declared to be severable. [1974 c.34 §9]

 

      Note: See note under 468.263.

 

      468.272 Application of other laws relating to bonds. Any restrictions, limitations, conditions or procedures provided by other statutes relating to the issuance and sale of bonds or other obligations do not apply to the issuance and sale of bonds authorized by ORS 468.263 to 468.272. [1974 c.34 §10; 2005 c.443 §26]

WILLAMETTE RIVER CLEANUP AUTHORITY

 

      468.531 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that the listing of an area on the National Priorities List described in 42 U.S.C. 9605, commonly known as establishing a Superfund site, and the remedial investigations and feasibility studies undertaken following such a listing identify the presence of pollutants, hazardous substances and contaminants in the area that are not directly traceable to a particular responsible party.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds that ORS 465.200 to 465.545 provide for joint and several liability among potentially responsible parties for the cleanup of Superfund sites. Because joint and several liability does not identify a potentially responsible party’s share of cleanup costs, remedial actions are often delayed as potentially responsible parties litigate each share of the liability.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares that the state has the authority and the ability to facilitate cleanup of the submerged and submersible lands in the Willamette River Superfund site.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly finds that cleanup of the submerged and submersible lands of the Willamette River, including the Superfund site, will provide benefits to the people of Oregon, to industries and to living resources, water quality, water uses, recreation, habitat protection, habitat preservation and other watershed qualities, and will provide significant economic enhancement to the State of Oregon. [2003 c.696 §1]

      468.533 Willamette River Cleanup Authority; purposes; membership; powers. (1) There is established a Willamette River Cleanup Authority consisting of five members. The authority shall be composed of:

      (a) The Governor;

      (b) Two members of the House of Representatives, appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives; and

      (c) Two members of the Senate, appointed by the President of the Senate.

      (2) The purpose of the authority is to:

      (a) Receive periodic reports from the Department of Environmental Quality, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and potentially responsible parties involved in the remedial investigation and feasibility study process relating to the listing of the Willamette River on the National Priorities List described in 42 U.S.C. 9605; and

      (b) Make recommendations to the Legislative Assembly on the amount of general obligation bonds or other bonds that would need to be issued to pay for the implementation of all or a portion of the record of decision of the remedial investigation and feasibility study process.

      (3) The Governor shall serve as chairperson, and a majority of members constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.

      (4) All agencies of the state government, as defined in ORS 174.111, are directed to assist the authority in the performance of its duties and, to the extent permitted by laws relating to confidentiality, to furnish such information and advice as the members of the authority consider necessary to perform their duties.

      (5) The authority may hold public meetings for the transaction of any of its business at the times and places as it may prescribe. At any such public hearing, any person interested in the matter being investigated may appear and testify.

      (6) The authority shall establish such advisory or technical committees as it considers necessary to aid and advise the authority in the performance of its duties. The authority shall determine the representation, membership, terms and organization of the committees and shall appoint committee members, except that at least one advisory committee shall be composed of representatives of property owners in the area that is the subject of the remedial investigation and feasibility study, state and local environmental organizations, the Port of Portland, the City of Portland and private-sector labor representatives.

      (7) Members of the advisory or technical committees are not entitled to compensation nor reimbursement for actual and necessary travel and other expenses. [2003 c.696 §3]

ECOSYSTEM SERVICES

 

      468.581 Definitions for ORS 468.581 to 468.587. As used in ORS 468.581 to 468.587:

      (1) “Adaptive management mechanisms” means the processes of implementing programs in a scientifically based, systematically structured approach that tests and monitors assumptions and predictions in management activities and then uses the resulting information to improve programs and management activities.

      (2) “Ecological values” means clean air, clean and abundant water, fish and wildlife habitat and other values that are generally considered public goods.

      (3) “Ecosystem services” means the benefits that human communities enjoy as a result of natural processes and biological diversity.

      (4) “Ecosystem services market” means a system in which providers of ecosystem services can access financing to protect, restore and maintain ecological values, including the full spectrum of regulatory, quasi-regulatory and voluntary markets.

      (5) “Payment for ecosystem services” means arrangements through which the beneficiaries of ecosystem services pay back the providers of ecosystem services. [2009 c.808 §1; 2013 c.1 §70]

 

      Note: 468.581 to 468.587 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 468 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      468.583 Policy. It is the policy of this state to support the maintenance, enhancement and restoration of ecosystem services throughout Oregon, focusing on the protection of land, water, air, soil and native flora and fauna. [2009 c.808 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 468.581.

 

      468.585 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Maintaining sustainable rural and urban landscapes is important for the quality of life of all Oregonians. Sustainable forestry, agriculture and ranching practices can help to maintain and restore the vitality of Oregon’s communities while also helping to preserve Oregon’s natural landscapes and ecosystems. It is necessary to assist landowners in gaining access to additional sources of revenue such as emerging ecosystem services markets and to help landowners diversify their incomes, improve the ecological functions of their lands and pass along their lands and the lands’ associated benefits to future generations.

      (2) Employment and economic opportunities are important to Oregonians in order to maintain a high quality of life and prosperity. A scarcity of land that is available for development is a significant limiting factor in some regions of Oregon. Oregon needs a system that will provide assurances that development will occur in suitable locations so that ecological values will be maintained and improve.

      (3) Many different local, state and federal agencies and the private sector have obligations to protect natural resources, to regulate the use of natural resources and to promote economic development while also minimizing adverse impacts to natural resources. However, these efforts are generally fragmented and uncoordinated and often work at cross-purposes.

      (4) Oregon’s natural resources, and the ways these natural resources are used, are important to Oregonians. These natural resources include native flora and fauna. These natural resources provide food and shelter, flood control, water filtration, clean air, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, aesthetic benefits, jobs and a high quality of life for all Oregonians. Science has demonstrated the importance of these natural resources to our daily lives. The adverse impacts of climate change may stress some natural resources to the point that they no longer provide ecosystem services. It is necessary to improve the overall health of our natural resources in order to maintain these resources for present and future generations.

      (5) The conservation and restoration of ecosystem services will help avoid carbon emissions, help address impacts associated with climate change and help natural resources adapt to these impacts. New or improved regulatory schemes and increased public awareness will make additional natural resources available to protect and enhance ecosystem services. Oregon has the opportunity to become a leader in developing and improving the ecological effectiveness and economic viability of payments for ecosystem services.

      (6) Given appropriate oversight, ecosystem services markets can save money, lead to more efficient, innovative and effective restoration actions than pure regulatory approaches and facilitate improved integration of public and private investment. [2009 c.808 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 468.581.

 

      468.587 State agencies and ecosystem services. (1) State agencies are encouraged to adopt and incorporate adaptive management mechanisms in their programs in order to support the maintenance, restoration and enhancement of ecosystem services.

      (2) State agencies are encouraged to use ecosystem services markets as a means to meet mitigation needs, after carefully avoiding the most sensitive resources and minimizing adverse impacts where development occurs. When a state agency adopts a strategy or a decision that calls for the mitigation of potentially adverse environmental consequences, the state agency must consider mitigation strategies that recognize the need for biological connectivity and the overall ecological viability of restoration efforts at a landscape scale rather than exercise an automatic preference for on-site, in-kind mitigation.

      (2) An Environmental Audit Report shall be privileged and shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil or administrative proceeding, except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section. The privilege provided in this subsection does not apply to a criminal investigation or proceeding. When an Environmental Audit Report is obtained in connection with a criminal investigation or proceeding, the privilege provided in this subsection related to civil or administrative proceedings is not waived.

      (3)(a) The privilege described in subsection (2) of this section does not apply to the extent that it is waived expressly or by implication by the owner or operator of a facility or persons conducting an activity that prepared or caused to be prepared the Environmental Audit Report. The release of an Environmental Audit Report by the owner or operator of a facility to any party or to any public body for purposes of negotiating, arranging or facilitating the sale, lease or financing of a property or a facility, or a portion of a property or facility:

      (A) Is not a waiver of the privilege; and

      (B) Does not create a right for a public body to require the release of an Environmental Audit Report.

      (b) In a civil or administrative proceeding, a court of record, after in camera review consistent with the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure, shall require disclosure of material for which the privilege described in subsection (2) of this section is asserted, if such court determines that:

      (c) A party asserting the environmental audit privilege described in subsection (2) of this section has the burden of proving the privilege, including, if there is evidence of noncompliance with ORS 824.050 to 824.110 or ORS chapter 465, 466, 468, 468A, 468B or 825, or the federal, regional or local counterpart or extension of such statutes, proof that appropriate efforts to achieve compliance were promptly initiated and pursued with reasonable diligence. A party seeking disclosure under subsection (3)(b)(A) of this section has the burden of proving that the privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose.

      (4)(a) A district attorney, the Attorney General or a governmental agency having probable cause to believe an offense has been committed under ORS 468.922 to 468.956 based upon information obtained from a source independent of an Environmental Audit Report, may obtain an Environmental Audit Report for which a privilege is asserted under subsection (2) of this section pursuant to search warrant, criminal subpoena or discovery as allowed by ORS 135.835. The district attorney, Attorney General or governmental agency shall immediately place the report under seal and shall not review or disclose its contents.

      (b) Within 30 days of the district attorney’s, Attorney General’s or governmental agency’s obtaining an Environmental Audit Report, the owner or operator who prepared or caused to be prepared the report may file with the appropriate court a petition requesting an in camera hearing on whether the Environmental Audit Report or portions thereof are privileged under this section or subject to disclosure. Failure by the owner or operator to file such petition shall waive the privilege.

      (c) Upon filing of such petition, the court shall issue an order scheduling an in camera hearing, within 45 days of the filing of the petition, to determine whether the Environmental Audit Report or portions thereof are privileged under this section or subject to disclosure. Such order further shall allow the district attorney, Attorney General or governmental agency to remove the seal from the report to review the report and shall place appropriate limitations on distribution and review of the report to protect against unnecessary disclosure. The district attorney, Attorney General or governmental agency may consult with enforcement agencies regarding the contents of the report as necessary to prepare for the in camera hearing. However, the information used in preparation for the in camera hearing shall not be used in any investigation or in any proceeding against the defendant, and shall otherwise be kept confidential, unless and until such information is found by the court to be subject to disclosure.

      (d) The parties may at any time stipulate to entry of an order directing that specific information contained in an Environmental Audit Report is or is not subject to the privilege provided under subsection (2) of this section.

      (e) Upon making a determination under subsection (3)(b) of this section, the court may compel the disclosure only of those portions of an Environmental Audit Report relevant to issues in dispute in the proceeding.

      (b) Information obtained by observation, sampling or monitoring by any regulatory agency; or

An environmental audit may be conducted by the owner or operator, by the owner’s or operator’s employees or by independent contractors.

      (b) “Environmental Audit Report” means a set of documents, each labeled “Environmental Audit Report: Privileged Document” and prepared as a result of an environmental audit. An Environmental Audit Report may include field notes and records of observations, findings, opinions, suggestions, conclusions, drafts, memoranda, drawings, photographs, computer-generated or electronically recorded information, maps, charts, graphs and surveys, provided such supporting information is collected or developed for the primary purpose and in the course of an environmental audit. An Environmental Audit Report, when completed, may have three components:

(1) In addition to any other penalty provided by law, any person who intentionally or recklessly violates any provision of ORS 164.785, 459.205 to 459.426, 459.705 to 459.790, ORS chapters 465, 466 or 467 or 468, 468A and 468B or any rule or standard or order of the Environmental Quality Commission adopted or issued pursuant to ORS 459.205 to 459.426, 459.705 to 459.790, ORS chapters 465, 466 or 467 or 468, 468A and 468B, which results in or creates the imminent likelihood for an extreme hazard to the public health or which causes extensive damage to the environment shall incur a civil penalty not to exceed $250,000. The Environmental Quality Commission shall adopt by rule a schedule and the criteria for determining the amount of a civil penalty that may be imposed for an extreme violation.

      (2) As used in this section:

      (a) “Intentionally” means conduct by a person with a conscious objective to cause the result of the conduct.

      (b) “Recklessly” means conduct by a person who is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care a reasonable person would observe in that situation. [1991 c.650 §2; 2009 c.267 §15]
