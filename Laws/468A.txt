      (1) “Air-cleaning device” means any method, process or equipment which removes, reduces or renders less noxious air contaminants prior to their discharge in the atmosphere.

      (2) “Air contaminant” means a dust, fume, gas, mist, odor, smoke, vapor, pollen, soot, carbon, acid or particulate matter or any combination thereof.

      (3) “Air contamination” means the presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more air contaminants which contribute to a condition of air pollution.

      (4) “Air contamination source” means any source at, from, or by reason of which there is emitted into the atmosphere any air contaminant, regardless of who the person may be who owns or operates the building, premises or other property in, at or on which such source is located, or the facility, equipment or other property by which the emission is caused or from which the emission comes.

      (5) “Air pollution” means the presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more air contaminants, or any combination thereof, in sufficient quantities and of such characteristics and of a duration as are or are likely to be injurious to public welfare, to the health of human, plant or animal life or to property or to interfere unreasonably with enjoyment of life and property throughout such area of the state as shall be affected thereby.

      (6) “Area of the state” means any city or county or portion thereof or other geographical area of the state as may be designated by the Environmental Quality Commission. [Formerly 468.275; 2009 c.387 §13]

 

      468A.010 Policy. (1) In the interest of the public health and welfare of the people, it is declared to be the public policy of the State of Oregon:

      (a) To restore and maintain the quality of the air resources of the state in a condition as free from air pollution as is practicable, consistent with the overall public welfare of the state.

      (b) To provide for a coordinated statewide program of air quality control and to allocate between the state and the units of local government responsibility for such control.

      (c) To facilitate cooperation among units of local government in establishing and supporting air quality control programs.

      (2) The program for the control of air pollution in this state shall be undertaken in a progressive manner, and each of its successive objectives shall be sought to be accomplished by cooperation and conciliation among all the parties concerned. [Formerly 449.765 and then 468.280]

 

      468A.015 Purpose of air pollution laws. It is the purpose of the air pollution laws contained in ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B to safeguard the air resources of the state by controlling, abating and preventing air pollution under a program which shall be consistent with the declaration of policy in this section and with ORS 468A.010. [Formerly 449.770 and then 468.285]

      (B) Nonfossilized and biodegradable organic fractions of industrial and municipal wastes; and

      (C) Gases and liquids recovered from the decomposition of nonfossilized and biodegradable organic matter. [Formerly 468.290; 1997 c.473 §2; 1999 c.439 §1; 2007 c.799 §4; 2009 c.387 §14; 2015 c.500 §1]

 

      468A.025 Air purity standards; air quality standards; treatment and control of emissions; rules. (1) By rule the Environmental Quality Commission may establish areas of the state and prescribe the degree of air pollution or air contamination that may be permitted therein, as air purity standards for such areas.

      (2) In determining air purity standards, the commission shall consider the following factors:

      (a) The quality or characteristics of air contaminants or the duration of their presence in the atmosphere which may cause air pollution in the particular area of the state;

      (b) Existing physical conditions and topography;

      (c) Prevailing wind directions and velocities;

      (d) Temperatures and temperature inversion periods, humidity, and other atmospheric conditions;

      (e) Possible chemical reactions between air contaminants or between such air contaminants and air gases, moisture or sunlight;

      (f) The predominant character of development of the area of the state, such as residential, highly developed industrial area, commercial or other characteristics;

      (g) Availability of air-cleaning devices;

      (h) Economic feasibility of air-cleaning devices;

      (i) Effect on normal human health of particular air contaminants;

      (j) Effect on efficiency of industrial operation resulting from use of air-cleaning devices;

      (k) Extent of danger to property in the area reasonably to be expected from any particular air contaminants;

      (L) Interference with reasonable enjoyment of life by persons in the area which can reasonably be expected to be affected by the air contaminants;

      (m) The volume of air contaminants emitted from a particular class of air contamination source;

      (n) The economic and industrial development of the state and continuance of public enjoyment of the state’s natural resources; and

      (o) Other factors which the commission may find applicable.

      (3) The commission may establish air quality standards including emission standards for the entire state or an area of the state. The standards shall set forth the maximum amount of air pollution permissible in various categories of air contaminants and may differentiate between different areas of the state, different air contaminants and different air contamination sources or classes thereof.

      (4) The commission shall specifically fulfill the intent of the policy under ORS 468A.010 (1)(a) as it pertains to the highest and best practicable treatment and control of emissions from stationary sources through the adoption of rules:

      (a) To require specific permit conditions for the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment to the extent the Department of Environmental Quality considers the permit conditions necessary to insure that pollution control equipment is operated and maintained at the highest reasonable efficiency and effectiveness level.

      (b) To require typically achievable control technology for new, modified and existing sources of air contaminants or precursors to air contaminants for which ambient air quality standards are established, to the extent emission units at the source are not subject to other emission standards for a particular air contaminant and to the extent the department determines additional controls on such sources are necessary to carry out the policy under ORS 468A.010 (1)(a).

      (c) To require controls necessary to achieve ambient air quality standards or prevent significant impairment of visibility in areas designated by the commission for any source that is a substantial cause of any exceedance or projected exceedance in the near future of national ambient air quality standards or visibility requirements.

      (d) To require controls necessary to meet applicable federal requirements for any source.

      (e) Applicable to a source category, contaminant or geographic area necessary to protect public health or welfare for air contaminants not otherwise regulated by the commission or as necessary to address the cumulative impact of sources on air quality.

      (5) Rules adopted by the commission under subsection (4) of this section shall be applied to a specific stationary source only through express incorporation as a permit condition in the permit for the source.

      (6) Nothing in subsection (4) of this section or rules adopted under subsection (4) of this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the commission to adopt rules, except rules addressing the highest and best practicable treatment and control.

      (7) As used in this section, “typically achievable control technology” means the emission limit established on a case-by-case basis for a criterion contaminant from a particular emission unit in accordance with rules adopted under subsection (4) of this section. For an existing source, the emission limit established shall be typical of the emission level achieved by emission units similar in type and size. For a new or modified source, the emission limit established shall be typical of the emission level achieved by recently installed, well controlled new or modified emission units similar in type and size. Typically achievable control technology determinations shall be based on information known to the department. In making the determination, the department shall take into consideration pollution prevention, impacts on other environmental media, energy impacts, capital and operating costs, cost effectiveness and the age and remaining economic life of existing emission control equipment. The department may consider emission control technologies typically applied to other types of emission units if such technologies can be readily applied to the emission unit. If an emission limitation is not feasible, the department may require a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard or a combination thereof. [Formerly 449.785 and then 468.295; 1993 c.790 §1]

 

      468A.030 When liability for violation not applicable. The several liabilities which may be imposed pursuant to ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B upon persons violating the provisions of any rule, standard or order of the Environmental Quality Commission pertaining to air pollution shall not be so construed as to include any violation which was caused by an act of God, war, strife, riot or other condition as to which any negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such person was not the proximate cause. [Formerly 449.825 and then 468.300]

 

      468A.035 General comprehensive plan. Subject to policy direction by the Environmental Quality Commission, the Department of Environmental Quality shall prepare and develop a general comprehensive plan for the control or abatement of existing air pollution and for the control or prevention of new air pollution in any area of the state in which air pollution is found already existing or in danger of existing. The plan shall recognize varying requirements for different areas of the state. [Formerly 449.782 and then 468.305]

 

      468A.040 Permits; rules. (1) By rule the Environmental Quality Commission may require permits for air contamination sources classified by type of air contaminants, by type of air contamination source or by area of the state. The permits shall be issued as provided in ORS 468.065. A permit subject to the federal operating permit program shall be issued in accordance with the rules adopted under ORS 468A.310.

      (2) If a request for review of the final Department of Environmental Quality action, or any part thereof, is made on an application for a permit issued under the federal operating permit program established under ORS 468A.310 in accordance with the rules adopted by the commission, the effect of the contested conditions and any conditions that are not severable from those contested shall be stayed upon a showing that compliance with the contested conditions during the pendency of the appeal would require substantial expenditures or losses that would not be incurred if the permittee prevails on the merits of the review and there exists a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. The department may require that the contested conditions not be stayed if the department finds that substantial endangerment of public health or welfare would result from the staying of the conditions.

      (3) Any source under an existing permit shall:

      (a) Comply with the conditions of the existing permit during any modification or reissuance proceeding; and

      (b) To the extent conditions of any new or modified permit are stayed under subsection (2) of this section, comply with the conditions of the existing permit that correspond to the stayed conditions, unless compliance would be technologically incompatible with compliance with other conditions of the new or modified permit that have not been stayed.

      (4) For purposes of this section, a small scale local energy project, as defined in ORS 470.050, located in a maintenance area or nonattainment area, and any infrastructure related to that project located in the same area, is considered to provide a net air quality benefit to the extent required by this chapter if the project provides reductions in each air contaminant in the maintenance area or nonattainment area equal to the ratio specified in rules adopted by the commission, unless the department determines that the project will pose a material threat to compliance with air quality standards in the maintenance area or nonattainment area.

      (3) A copy of each variance granted, renewed or extended by a local governmental body or regional authority shall be filed with the commission within 15 days after it is granted. The commission shall review the variance and the reasons therefor within 60 days of receipt of the copy and may approve, deny or modify the variance terms. Failure of the commission to act on the variance within the 60-day period shall be considered a determination that the variance granted by the local governmental body or regional authority is approved by the commission.

      (4) In determining whether or not a variance shall be granted, the commission or the local governmental body or regional authority shall consider the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to residents and to the person conducting the activity for which the variance is sought.

      (5) A variance may be revoked or modified by the grantor thereof after a public hearing held upon not less than 10 days’ notice. Such notice shall be served upon all persons who the grantor knows will be subjected to greater restrictions if such variance is revoked or modified, or are likely to be affected or who have filed with such grantor a written request for such notification.

CLIMATE CHANGE

 

(Oregon Global Warming Commission)

 

      468A.200 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) In December 2004 the Governor’s Advisory Group on Global Warming issued its report calling for immediate and significant action to address global warming, to reduce Oregon’s exposure to the risks of global warming and to begin to prepare for the effects of global warming. The advisory group also identified 46 specific recommendations for measurable reductions in the state’s greenhouse gas emissions.

      (2) In partnership with the Governor’s advisory group, 50 scientists signed the “Scientific Consensus Statement on the Likely Impacts of Climate Change on the Pacific Northwest,” which examined the potential effects of climate change on temperature, precipitation, sea level, marine ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems. The scientists recommended additional, improved scientific studies and modeling of the effects of climate change on the atmosphere, oceans and land, as well as modeling of the effects of economic and management policies.

      (3) Global warming poses a serious threat to the economic well-being, public health, natural resources and environment of Oregon.

      (4) Oregon relies on snowpack for summer stream flows to provide energy, municipal water, watershed health and irrigation. Also, a potential rise in sea levels threatens Oregon’s coastal communities. Reduced snowpack, changes in the timing of stream flows, extreme or unusual weather events, rising sea levels, increased occurrences of vector-borne diseases and impacts on forest health could significantly impact the economy, environment and quality of life in Oregon.

      (5) Oregon forests play a significant role in sequestering atmospheric carbon, and losing this potential to sequester carbon will have a significant negative effect on the reduction of carbon levels in the atmosphere.

      (6) Global warming will have detrimental effects on many of Oregon’s largest industries, including agriculture, wine making, tourism, skiing, recreational and commercial fishing, forestry and hydropower generation, and will therefore negatively impact the state’s workers, consumers and residents.

      (7) There is a need to assess the current level of greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon, to monitor the trend of greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon over the next several decades and to take necessary action to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent disruption of Oregon’s economy and quality of life and to meet Oregon’s responsibility to reduce the impacts and the pace of global warming.

      (8) Oregon has been a national leader in energy conservation and environmental stewardship, including the areas of energy efficiency requirements and investments, renewable energy investments, natural resource conservation, greenhouse gas offset requirements and investments, and global warming pollution standards for passenger vehicles. Significant opportunities remain to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide, especially from major contributors of greenhouse gas emissions, including electricity production, transportation, building construction and operation, and the residential and consumer sectors.

      (9) Actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will reduce Oregon’s reliance on foreign sources of energy, lead to the development of technology, attract new businesses to Oregon and increase energy efficiency throughout the state, resulting in benefits to the economy and to individual businesses and residents.

      (10) In devising measures to achieve reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, Oregon must strive to not disadvantage Oregon businesses as compared to businesses in other states with which Oregon cooperates on regional greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategies.

      (11) Policies pursued, and actions taken, by Oregon will:

      (a) In concert with complementary policies and actions by other states and the federal government, substantially reduce the global levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the impacts of those emissions;

      (b) Encourage similar policies and actions by various stakeholders;

      (c) Inform and shape national policies and actions in ways that are advantageous to Oregon residents and businesses; and

      (d) Directly benefit the state and local governments, businesses and residents. [2007 c.907 §1]

      468A.275 [2009 c.754 §6; 2015 c.4 §3; 2017 c.750 §160; renumbered 468A.266 in 2017]

 

      468A.276 Credit clearance markets. (1) The clean fuels program adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission by rule under ORS 468A.266 must include provisions necessary for the Department of Environmental Quality to hold credit clearance markets as a means to facilitate compliance with the low carbon fuel standards.

      (2)(a) The department shall hold a credit clearance market for any compliance period in which at least one regulated party reports that the regulated party has a net deficit balance at the end of the compliance period, after retirement of all credits held by the regulated party, that is greater than a small deficit. A regulated party described by this paragraph is required to participate in the credit clearance market.

      (b) If a regulated party has a small deficit at the end of a compliance period, the regulated party shall notify the department that it will achieve compliance with the low carbon fuel standard during the compliance period by either:

      (A) Participating in a credit clearance market; or

      (B) Carrying forward the small deficit.

      (3) For purposes of administering a credit clearance market required by this section, the department shall:

      (a) Allow any regulated party, credit generator or credit aggregator that holds excess credits at the end of a compliance period to voluntarily participate in the credit clearance market as a seller by pledging a specified number of credits for sale in the market.

      (b) Require each regulated party participating in the credit clearance market as a purchaser of credits to:

      (A) Have retired all credits in the party’s possession prior to participating in the credit clearance market; and

      (B) Purchase the specified number of the total pledged credits that the department has determined are that party’s pro rata share of the pledged credits.

      (c) Require all sellers to:

      (A) Agree to sell pledged credits at a price no higher than a maximum price for credits;

      (B) Accept all offers to purchase pledged credits at the maximum price for credits; and

      (C) Agree to withhold any pledged credits from sale outside the credit clearance market until the credit clearance market is closed.

      (4)(a) The commission shall set the maximum price for credits in a credit clearance market, which may not exceed $200 for 2018.

      (b) For 2019 and subsequent years, the maximum price for credits may exceed $200, but only to the extent that a greater maximum price for credits is necessary to annually adjust for inflation, beginning on January 1, 2019, pursuant to the increase, if any, from the preceding calendar year in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.

      (5) A regulated party that has a net deficit balance after the close of a credit clearance market:

      (a) Must carry over the remaining deficits into the next compliance period; and

      (b) May not be subject to interest greater than five percent, penalties or assertions of noncompliance that accrue based on the carryover of deficits under this subsection.

      (6) If a regulated party has been required under subsection (2) of this section to participate as a purchaser in two consecutive credit clearance markets and continues to have a net deficit balance after the close of the second consecutive credit clearance market, the Department of Environmental Quality shall complete, no later than two months after the close of the second credit clearance market, an analysis of the root cause of the inability of the regulated party to retire the remaining deficits. The department may recommend and implement any remedy that the department determines is necessary to address the root cause identified in the analysis, including but not limited to issuing a deferral, provided that the remedy implemented does not:

      (a) Require the regulated party to purchase credits for an amount that exceeds the maximum price for credits in the most recent credit clearance market; or

      (b) Compel a person to sell credits.

      (7) If credits sold in a credit clearance market are subsequently invalidated as a result of fraud or any other form of noncompliance on the part of the generator of the credit, the department may not pursue civil penalties against, or require credit replacement by, the regulated party that purchased the credits unless the regulated party was a party to the fraud or other form of noncompliance.

      (8) The department may not disclose the deficit balances or pro rata share purchase requirements of a regulated party that participates in the credit clearance market. [2017 c.750 §166; 2019 c.57 §25]

      468A.315 Emission fees for major sources; base fees; basis of fees; rules. (1) The fee schedule required under ORS 468.065 (2) for a source subject to the federal operating permit program shall be based on a schedule established by rule by the Environmental Quality Commission in accordance with this section. Except for the additional fees under subsection (2)(e) of this section and ORS 468A.345, this fee schedule shall be in lieu of any other fee for a permit issued under ORS 468A.040, 468A.045 or 468A.155. The fee schedule shall cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing the federal operating permit program and shall consist of:

      (a) An emission fee per ton of each regulated pollutant emitted during the prior calendar year as determined under subsection (2) of this section, subject to annual fee increases as set forth in paragraph (d) of this subsection. The following emission fees apply:

      (A) $27 per ton emitted during the 2006 calendar year.

      (B) $29 per ton emitted during the 2007 calendar year.

      (C) $31 per ton emitted during the 2008 calendar year and each calendar year thereafter.

      (b) Fees for the following specific elements of the federal operating permit program:

      (A) Reviewing and acting upon applications for modifications to federal operating permits.

      (B) Any activity related to permits required under ORS 468A.040 other than the federal operating permit program.

      (C) Department of Environmental Quality activities for sources not subject to the federal operating permit program.

      (D) Department review of ambient monitoring networks installed by a source.

      (E) Other distinct department activities created by a source or a group of sources if the commission finds that the activities are unique and specific and that additional rulemaking is necessary and will impose costs upon the department that are not otherwise covered by federal operating permit program fees.

      (c) A base fee for a source subject to the federal operating permit program. This base fee shall be no more than the fees set forth in subparagraphs (A) to (D) of this paragraph, subject to increases as set forth in paragraph (d) of this subsection:

      (A) $2,700 for the period of November 15, 2007, through November 14, 2008.

      (B) $2,900 for the period of November 15, 2008, through November 14, 2009.

      (C) $3,100 for the period of November 15, 2009, through November 14, 2010.

      (D) $4,100 for the period of November 15, 2010, through November 14, 2011, and for each annual period thereafter.

      (d) An annual increase in the fees set forth in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index exceeds the Consumer Price Index as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31, 1989, if the commission determines by rule that the increased fees are necessary to cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing the federal operating permit program.

      (2)(a) The fee on emissions of regulated pollutants required under this section shall be based on the amount of each regulated pollutant emitted during the prior calendar year as documented by information provided by the source in accordance with criteria adopted by the commission or, if the source elects to pay the fee based on permitted emissions, the fee shall be based on the emission limit for the plant site of the major source.

      (b) The fee required by subsection (1)(a) of this section does not apply to any emissions in excess of 4,000 tons per year of any regulated pollutant through calendar year 2010 and in excess of 7,000 tons per year of all regulated pollutants for each calendar year thereafter. The department may not revise a major source’s plant site emission limit due solely to payment of the fee on the basis of documented emissions.

      (c) The commission shall establish by rule criteria for the acceptability and verifiability of information related to emissions as documented, including but not limited to the use of:

      (A) Emission monitoring;

      (B) Material balances;

      (C) Emission factors;

      (D) Fuel use;

      (E) Production data; or

      (F) Other calculations.

      (d) The department shall accept reasonably accurate information that complies with the criteria established by the commission as documentation of emissions.

      (e) The rules adopted under this section shall require an additional fee for failure to pay, substantial underpayment of or late payment of emission fees.

      (4) As used in this section:

      (a) “Regulated pollutant” means particulates, volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide; and

      (b) “Consumer Price Index” has the meaning given in 42 U.S.C. 7661a(b), as in effect on June 20, 2007. [1991 c.752 §§5,25; 1993 c.790 §§6,7; 2007 c.480 §1; 2009 c.266 §1; 2018 c.102 §20]

 

      468A.320 Accountability for costs of program. The Department of Environmental Quality shall establish a method to account for the costs of the federal operating permit program. The method shall, at a minimum, account for costs incurred for each element of the program as described in section 502(b)(3)(A)(i) through (vi) of the Clean Air Act. In accounting for the costs of the federal operating permit program the department shall include a commensurate amount of the costs for any other permit issued under ORS 468A.040, 468A.045 or 468A.155 to the extent that those costs are considered to be part of the federal operating permit program by the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality. [1991 c.752 §6; 1993 c.790 §8]

 

      468A.325 Priority of department work schedule. (1) Nothing in ORS 468A.040, 468A.300 to 468A.320 or this section shall require the Environmental Quality Commission or Department of Environmental Quality to make less stringent any existing element of the state’s air pollution control program.

      (2) To the maximum extent possible under federal laws and regulations and within budgetary constraints, the department shall prioritize its permitting work schedule to address all of the following:

      (a) Sources required to have permits under the federal operating permit program;

      (b) Other sources over which the department has been granted authority for control of the emission of air contaminants that:

      (A) Are either within nonattainment areas or within attainment areas projected by the department to exceed air standards within five years, and which substantially contribute to or cause the nonattainment or projected nonattainment of air quality standards; or

      (B) May individually be causing exceedances of air quality standards;

      (c) Applications for construction or modification; and

      (d) Sources that request a federally enforceable permit from the department regardless of whether such a permit would be required under the federal operating permit program. Within budgetary constraints, the department shall cooperate with sources seeking a federally enforceable permit. [1991 c.752 §8]

 

      468A.327 Requirement for adoption, amendment or repeal of rules; oral hearing. (1) Prior to the adoption, amendment or repeal of any rule pursuant to ORS chapter 183 that applies to any facility required to pay fees under ORS 468A.315, the Environmental Quality Commission shall include with the notice of intended action required under ORS 183.335 (1) a statement of whether the intended action imposes requirements in addition to the applicable federal requirements and, if so, shall include a written explanation of:

      (a) The commission’s scientific, economic, technological, administrative or other reasons for exceeding applicable federal requirements; and

      (b) Any alternatives the commission considered and the reasons that the alternatives were not pursued.

      (2) The statement provided by the commission under subsection (1) of this section shall be based upon information available to the commission at the time the commission prepares the written explanation.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 183.335 (3), an opportunity for an oral hearing before the commission regarding the statement specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be granted only if:

      (a) The request for a hearing is received, within 14 days after the commission issues the notice of intended action required under ORS 183.335 (1), from 10 persons or from an association having no fewer than 10 members; and

      (b) The request describes how the persons or association that made the request will be directly harmed by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule under subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) If an oral hearing is granted under subsection (3) of this section, the commission shall give notice of the hearing at least 14 days before the hearing to the persons or association requesting the hearing, to any persons who have requested notice pursuant to ORS 183.335 (8) and to the persons specified in ORS 183.335 (15).

      (5) Subsection (3) of this section does not apply if the commission includes with the notice of intended action required under ORS 183.335 (1) a notice that an oral hearing will be held before the commission.

      (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to temporary rules adopted by the commission under ORS 183.335 (5). [2007 c.480 §3]

TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS

 

      468A.335 Definitions. As used in ORS 468A.335 to 468A.343 and section 7, chapter 102, Oregon Laws 2018:

      (1) “Benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk” means:

      (a) For a new or reconstructed air contamination source, an excess lifetime cancer risk level of 10 in one million.

      (b) For an existing air contamination source, an excess lifetime cancer risk level of 50 in one million.

      (2) “Benchmark for excess noncancer risk” means:

      (a) For a new or reconstructed air contamination source, a benchmark equal to a Hazard Index number of 1.

      (b) For an existing air contamination source, a benchmark equal to a Hazard Index number of 5.

      (3) “Hazard Index number” means a number equal to the sum of the hazard quotients attributable to toxic air contaminants that have noncancer effects on the same target organs or organ systems.

      (4) “Hazard quotient” means a calculated numerical value that is used to evaluate noncancer health risk from exposure to a single toxic air contaminant. The calculated numerical value is the ratio of the air concentration of a toxic air contaminant to the noncancer risk-based concentration at which no serious adverse human health effects are expected to occur.

      (5) “Reconstructed” means an individual project constructed at an air contamination source that, once constructed, increases the hourly capacity of any changed equipment to emit and where the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would have been required to construct a comparable new source. [2018 c.102 §2]

 

      Note: The amendments to 468A.335 by section 10, chapter 102, Oregon Laws 2018, become operative January 1, 2029. See section 9, chapter 102, Oregon Laws 2018. The text that is operative on and after January 1, 2029, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      468A.335. As used in ORS 468A.335 to 468A.343 and section 7, chapter 102, Oregon Laws 2018:

      (1) “Benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk” means:

      (a) For a new or reconstructed air contamination source, an excess lifetime cancer risk level of 10 in one million.

      (b) For an existing air contamination source, an excess lifetime cancer risk level established by the Environmental Quality Commission by rule, but no less than 25 in one million.

      (2) “Benchmark for excess noncancer risk” means:

      (a) For a new or reconstructed air contamination source, a benchmark equal to a Hazard Index number of 1.

      (b) For an existing air contamination source, a benchmark equal to a Hazard Index number established by the commission by rule.

      (3) “Hazard Index number” means a number equal to the sum of the hazard quotients attributable to toxic air contaminants that have noncancer effects on the same target organs or organ systems.

      (4) “Hazard quotient” means a calculated numerical value that is used to evaluate noncancer health risk from exposure to a single toxic air contaminant. The calculated numerical value is the ratio of the air concentration of a toxic air contaminant to the noncancer risk-based concentration at which no serious adverse human health effects are expected to occur.

      (5) “Reconstructed” means an individual project constructed at an air contamination source that, once constructed, increases the hourly capacity of any changed equipment to emit and where the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would have been required to construct a comparable new source.

 

      468A.337 Individual air contamination source program; rules. (1) The Environmental Quality Commission may adopt a program and rules to reduce public health risks from emissions of toxic air contaminants from individual stationary industrial and commercial air contamination sources. The program and rules adopted under this section may be in addition to any other programs or rules adopted pursuant to ORS chapter 468A.

      (2) Except as required by federal law, a program and rules adopted under this section may not require a person in control of an air contamination source to reduce risk associated with toxic air contaminant emissions from that source unless:

      (a) The air contamination source is one for which a person is otherwise subject to regulation under ORS 468A.040, 468A.050, 468A.055 or 468A.155 or is subject to the federal operating permit program pursuant to ORS 468A.310; and

      (b) Subject to periodic review by the Department of Environmental Quality, the total demonstrated public health risk from toxic air contaminant emissions from the air contamination source exceeds the benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk or the benchmark for excess noncancer risk.

      (3) For purposes of administration by the department of rules adopted under this section, rather than evaluating and regulating the public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from an air contamination source based on modeling for the potential to emit toxic air contaminants and land use zoning, a person in control of the air contamination source may elect to have the emissions from the air contamination source evaluated and regulated based on modeling for one or both of the following:

      (a) Public health risk due to toxic air contaminant emissions from the air contamination source’s actual production or, for a new or reconstructed air contamination source, the reasonably anticipated actual production by the new or reconstructed air contamination source.

      (b)(A) The impacts by toxic air contaminants on locations where people actually live or normally congregate. There is a presumption that people actually live or normally congregate in locations in the manner allowed by the land use zoning for the location, based on the most recent zoning maps available.

      (B) A person in control of an air contamination source subject to rules adopted under this section may rebut the presumption in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by submitting to the department documentation that the department determines is adequate to rebut the presumption. If the department determines that the documentation is adequate to rebut the presumption, the department shall adjust modeling inputs according to the documentation submitted.

      (C) Documentation required under this paragraph must be updated annually by the person in control of the air contamination source.

      (D) Documentation required under this paragraph may include a request by the person in control of the air contamination source for the department to exclude certain zoned areas from the modeling used for purposes of evaluating the toxic air contaminant emissions from the air contamination source. A request under this subparagraph must be based on documentation that the area to be excluded is not being used in a manner allowed by the land use zoning applicable to the area at the time the modeling is to be performed. If the department grants a request under this subparagraph, the person in control of the air contamination source shall annually submit to the department, as part of the update required under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, documentation showing that the excluded zoned areas continue to not be used in a manner allowed by the land use zoning applicable to the area.

      (4)(a) A person in control of an air contamination source subject to a program and rules adopted under this section may elect to have the public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from the air contamination source evaluated using air monitoring, if:

      (A) The person submits to the department an air monitoring plan and the department approves the submitted air monitoring plan; and

      (B) A modeled risk assessment using methods approved by the department is submitted to the department in advance of the commencement of the final, approved air monitoring plan.

      (b) The department shall work with a person in control of an air contamination source to develop public information concerning an approved air monitoring plan and the timeline for the approved air monitoring plan.

      (c) The department may not require a person in control of an air contamination source that elects to complete air monitoring under an approved air monitoring plan pursuant to this subsection to, pursuant to a program and rules adopted under this section, reduce public health risk from toxic air contaminants emitted by the air contamination source unless the results of the air monitoring:

      (A) Validate the modeling completed pursuant to subsection (3) of this section; or

      (B) Otherwise lead the department to reasonably conclude that the public health risks from toxic air contaminants emitted by the air contamination source exceed the benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk or the benchmark for excess noncancer risk.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this subsection, if the results of the modeling completed pursuant to subsection (3) of this section indicate that the public health risks from toxic air contaminants emitted by the air contamination source exceed four times the benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk or four times the benchmark for excess noncancer risk, a person in control of an air contamination source may not, pending completion of the approved air monitoring plan, delay implementation of any public health risk reduction measures that are required by the department pursuant to a program and rules adopted under this section.

      (5)(a) Except as required under ORS 468.115, 468.936, 468.939, 468.951 or 468.996, or federal law, the department may not, pursuant to a program and rules adopted under this section, require an existing air contamination source that employs toxics best available control technology on all significant emission units to undertake additional measures to limit or reduce toxic air contaminant emissions.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection and subsection (6)(d) of this section, the department may require an existing air contamination source that employs toxics best available control technology on all significant emission units to undertake additional measures to limit or reduce toxic air contaminant emissions if the public health risks from toxic air contaminants emitted by the air contamination source are greater than four times the benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk or are greater than two times the benchmark for excess noncancer risk.

      (6)(a) Toxics best available control technology described in subsection (5) of this section must be a toxic air contaminant emissions limitation or emissions control measure or measures based on the maximum degree of reduction of toxic air contaminants that is feasible, determined for each air contamination source on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration:

      (A) What has been achieved in practice for:

      (i) Air contamination sources in the same class as the air contamination source to which the toxic air contaminant emissions limitation or control measure will apply, as classified under ORS 468A.050; or

      (ii) Processes or emissions similar to the processes or emissions of the air contamination source;

      (B) Energy and health or environmental impacts not related to air quality; and

      (C) Economic impacts and cost-effectiveness, including the costs of changing existing processes or equipment or adding equipment or controls to existing processes and equipment.

      (b) Toxics best available control technology may be based on a design standard, equipment standard, work practice standard or other operational standard, or a combination thereof.

      (c) In assessing the cost-effectiveness of any measure for purposes of determining toxics best available control technology for an air contamination source, the department must assess only the economic impacts and benefits associated with controlling toxic air contaminants.

      (d) For an air contamination source that exists as of the date that a program and rules adopted under this section first become effective, compliance with emission control requirements, work practices or limitations established by a major source National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency after 1993 is deemed to be toxics best available control technology, provided that:

      (A) The emission control requirements, work practices or limitations result in an actual reduction to the emissions of the hazardous air pollutants regulated under the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants; and

      (B) There are no other toxic air contaminants emitted by the air contamination source that:

      (i) Are regulated under a program and rules adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission pursuant to subsection (1) of this section;

      (ii) Are not controlled by the emission control requirements, work practices or limitations established by a major source National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants; and

      (iii) Materially contribute to public health risks. [2018 c.102 §3]

 

      468A.339 Pilot program; rules; applicability. (1)(a) The Environmental Quality Commission may establish by rule a pilot program for evaluating and controlling public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from multiple stationary air contamination sources. The requirements of a pilot program adopted under this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any requirements applicable to a person in control of an air contamination source under a program and rules adopted under ORS 468A.337.

      (b) Rules adopted for purposes of evaluating and regulating the public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from air contamination sources subject to the pilot program must be consistent with, and administered subject to the provisions of, ORS 468A.337 (3) and (4).

      (2) The pilot program adopted under this section may apply to no more than one area in this state in a county with a population exceeding 500,000 people, selected based on:

      (a) The degree to which the level of excess lifetime cancer risk in the area from all sources of toxic air contaminants exceeds the statewide mean excess lifetime cancer risk from all sources of toxic air contaminants; and

      (b) The degree to which the area contains multiple stationary sources of toxic air contaminants, leading to high cumulative public health risks from the toxic air contaminant emissions of those air contamination sources.

      (3) In determining the boundary of the pilot program area, the department shall consider the degree to which the level of cumulative risk resulting from the toxic air contaminant emissions of existing stationary air contamination sources within the area exceeds the benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk or the benchmark for excess noncancer risk. The pilot program area may not be larger than a circle measuring 2.5 miles in diameter.

      (4) Subsection (5) of this section applies:

      (a) If ambient concentrations of toxic air contaminant emissions from all stationary air contamination sources within any portion of the pilot program area result in an exceedance of two times the benchmark for excess lifetime cancer risk or two times the benchmark for excess noncancer risk within that portion of the pilot program area; and

      (b) To persons in control of existing air contamination sources that significantly contribute to an exceedance described in paragraph (a) of this subsection and to any person in control of a new or modified source that is reasonably anticipated to significantly contribute to an exceedance described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (5) In order to obtain a permit or a permit modification that would authorize a significant increase in the public health risks from toxic air contaminants emitted by an air contamination source, and except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a person described in subsection (4)(b) of this section must prepare and submit to the Department of Environmental Quality a risk mitigation plan that includes one or more actions to offset the projected increase in public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from the new or modified air contamination source. The plan required by this subsection may include actions to reduce emissions from other sources in the area, including mobile sources. The department shall approve a risk mitigation plan submitted under this subsection if the department determines that the actions described in the plan are reasonably likely to achieve the projected reduction in public health risks necessary to offset the projected increase in public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from the new or modified air contamination source.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsection (5) of this section, if the department determines, considering cost and available technology, that a risk mitigation plan is not feasible because reasonable actions to reduce public health risks are not available, the person in control of the air contamination source, in lieu of a risk mitigation plan, shall make a payment into the Clean Communities Fund established under ORS 468A.341. The amount of the payment required by this subsection shall be determined by the department based on the following considerations:

      (a) The expected cost of actions to achieve the projected reduction in public health risks necessary to offset the increase in public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from the new or modified air contamination source; and

      (b) How to best incentivize payments for actions that will most directly offset the increase in public health risks from toxic air contaminant emissions from the new or modified air contamination source in the portion of the pilot program area where the cumulative public health risks are expected to be the highest.

      (7) The department may enter into a contract or agreement for services to implement a program for investing moneys deposited in the Clean Communities Fund in actions to reduce public health risks from toxic air contaminants emitted by air contamination sources located within the pilot program area. [2018 c.102 §4]

 

      468A.341 Clean Communities Fund; uses. (1) The Clean Communities Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned by the Clean Communities Fund shall be credited to the fund.

      (2) The Clean Communities Fund consists of moneys deposited in the fund pursuant to ORS 468A.339 and any other moneys deposited in the fund from any other public or private source.

      (3) Moneys in the Clean Communities Fund are continuously appropriated to the Department of Environmental Quality to be used for actions to reduce public health risks from toxic air contaminants emitted by air contamination sources located within the pilot program area designated by the department under ORS 468A.339. [2018 c.102 §5]

 

      468A.343 Public meetings; private actions. (1) The Department of Environmental Quality shall hold any public meeting required by rules adopted pursuant to ORS 468A.335 to 468A.343 and section 7, chapter 102, Oregon Laws 2018. At least one representative of a person in control of an air contamination source for which a permit or plan will be discussed at a public meeting required by a rule adopted under ORS 468A.335 to 468A.343 and section 7, chapter 102, Oregon Laws 2018, must appear at the meeting.

      (2) If the Environmental Quality Commission adopts a program and rules pursuant to ORS 468A.337 or a pilot program pursuant to ORS 468A.339, the programs and rules and their applicability to any air contamination source described in this section do not create a new standard of care or otherwise alter an existing standard of care for imposing liability in any private action. [2018 c.102 §6]

 

      Note: Sections 1, 7, 8, 11 and 12, chapter 102, Oregon Laws 2018, provide:

      Sec. 1. Sections 2 to 7 [468A.335 to 468A.343], 13 [468A.345], 14 and 16 of this 2018 Act are added to and made a part of ORS chapter 468A. [2018 c.102 §1]

      Sec. 7. Benchmarks for excess noncancer risk for existing air contamination sources; rules. (1) Notwithstanding section 2 (2)(b) of this 2018 Act [468A.335 (2)(b)], the Department of Environmental Quality may regulate an existing air contamination source pursuant to section 3 [468A.337] or 4 [468A.339] of this 2018 Act based on a benchmark for excess noncancer risk that is adjusted to equal a Hazard Index number other than 5, if the department determines that the existing air contamination source emits a material amount of one or more toxic air contaminants that are identified by the Environmental Quality Commission by rule to be toxic air contaminants that are expected to have:

      468A.615 Registration of acreage to be burned; fees; rules. (1)(a) On or before April 1 of each year, the grower of a grass seed crop shall register with the county court or board of county commissioners, the fire chief of a rural fire protection district, the designated representative of the fire chief or other responsible persons the number of acres to be open burned or propane flamed in the remainder of the year. At the time of registration, the Department of Environmental Quality shall collect a nonrefundable fee of $4 per acre registered to be sanitized by open burning or $2 per acre to be sanitized by propane flaming. The department may contract with counties and rural fire protection districts or other responsible persons for the collection of the fees which shall be forwarded to the department. Any person registering after April 1 in each year shall pay an additional fee of $2 per acre registered if the late registration is due to the fault of the late registrant or a person under the control of the late registrant. Late registrations must be approved by the department. Copies of the registration form shall be forwarded to the department. The required registration must be made and the fee paid before a permit shall be issued under ORS 468A.575.

      (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, the department shall collect a fee in accordance with paragraph (c) of this subsection for issuing a permit for open burning, propane flaming or stack or pile burning of perennial or annual grass seed crop residue or cereal grain crop residue under ORS 468A.555 to 468A.620 and 468A.992. The department may contract with counties and rural fire protection districts or other responsible persons for the collection of the fees which shall be forwarded to the department.

      (c) The fee required under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be paid within 10 days after the date of the invoice issued by the issuing authority and shall be:

      (A) $16 per acre of crop sanitized by open burning in the counties listed in ORS 468A.560;

      (B) $8 per acre of perennial or annual grass seed crop sanitized by open burning in any county not listed in ORS 468A.560;

      (C) $4 per acre of crop sanitized by propane flaming;

      (D) $10 per acre for acreage from which 100 percent of the straw is removed and burned in stacks or piles; and

      (E) For acreage from which less than 100 percent of the straw is removed and burned in stacks or piles, the same per acre as the fee imposed under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, but with a reduction in the amount of acreage for which the fee is charged by the same percentage as the reduction in the amount of straw to be burned.

      (d) The fee required by paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not be charged for any acreage where efficient burning of stubble is accomplished with equipment certified by the department for field sanitizing purposes or with any other certified alternative method to open field burning, propane flaming or stack or pile burning. The fee required by paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not be charged for any acreage not harvested prior to burning or for any acreage not burned.

      (2)(a) All fees collected under this section shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the Department of Agriculture Service Fund. Such moneys are continuously appropriated to the State Department of Agriculture for the purpose of carrying out the duties and responsibilities carried out by the State Department of Agriculture pursuant to the memorandum of understanding established under ORS 468A.585. Upon a request from the Environmental Quality Commission, the State Department of Agriculture shall transfer from the fund to the commission moneys sufficient for the commission to carry out its duties specified in ORS 468A.610 (10) and (11).

      (b) The State Department of Agriculture by rule may increase the fees required under this section as needed to carry out its duties and responsibilities pursuant to the memorandum of understanding established under ORS 468A.585, provided that the fees do not exceed the costs of the State Department of Agriculture in operating all of the field burning program.

      (3) It is the intention of the Legislative Assembly that the programs for smoke management, air quality monitoring and the enforcement of rules under ORS 468A.550 to 468A.620 and 468A.992 be operated in a manner that maximizes the resources available for the research and development program.

AEROSOL SPRAY CONTROL

 

      468A.650 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Scientific studies have revealed that certain chlorofluorocarbon compounds used in aerosol sprays may be destroying the ozone layer in the earth’s stratosphere;

      (2) The ozone layer is vital to life on earth, preventing approximately 99 percent of the sun’s mid-ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth’s surface;

      (3) Increased intensity of ultraviolet radiation poses a serious threat to life on earth including increased occurrences of skin cancer, damage to food crops, damage to phytoplankton which is vital to the production of oxygen and to the food chain, and unpredictable and irreversible global climatic changes;

      (4) It has been estimated that production of ozone destroying chemicals is increasing at a rate of 10 percent per year, at which rate the ozone layer will be reduced 13 percent by the year 2014;

      (5) It has been estimated that there has already been one-half to one percent depletion of the ozone layer;

      (6) It has been estimated that an immediate halt to production of ozone destroying chemicals would still result in an approximate three and one-half percent reduction in ozone by 1990; and

      (7) There is substantial evidence to believe that inhalation of aerosol sprays is a significant hazard to human health. [Formerly 468.600]

 

      Note: 468A.650 and 468A.655 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 468A or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      468A.655 Prohibition on sale or promotion; exemption for medical use. (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, after March 1, 1977, no person shall sell or offer to sell or give as a sales inducement in this state any aerosol spray which contains as a propellant trichloromonofluoromethane, difluorodichloromethane or any other saturated chlorofluorocarbon compound not containing hydrogen.

      (2) Nothing in this section prohibits the sale of any aerosol spray containing any propellant described in subsection (1) of this section if such aerosol spray is intended to be used for a legitimate medical purpose in the treatment of asthma or any respiratory disorder; or such aerosol spray is intended to be used for a legitimate medical purpose and the State Board of Pharmacy determines by administrative rule that the use of the aerosol spray is essential to such intended use. [Formerly 468.605]

 

      Note: See note under 468A.650.

 

      468A.660 Wholesale transactions permitted. Nothing in ORS 468A.655 shall prevent wholesale transactions, including but not limited to the transportation, warehousing, sale, and delivery of any aerosol spray described in ORS 468A.655 (1). [Formerly 468.610]

 

ASBESTOS ABATEMENT PROJECTS

 

      468A.700 Definitions for ORS 468A.700 to 468A.760. As used in ORS 468A.700 to 468A.760:

      (1) “Accredited” means a provider of asbestos abatement training courses is authorized by the Department of Environmental Quality to offer training courses that satisfy department requirements for contractor licensing and worker training.

      (2) “Agent” means an individual who works on an asbestos abatement project for a contractor but is not an employee of the contractor.

      (3) “Asbestos” means the asbestiform varieties of serpentine (chrysotile), riebeckite (crocidolite), cummungtonite-grunerite (amosite), anthophyllite, actinolite and tremolite.

      (4) “Asbestos abatement project” means any demolition, renovation, repair, construction or maintenance activity of any public or private facility that involves the repair, enclosure, encapsulation, removal, salvage, handling or disposal of any material with the potential of releasing asbestos fibers from asbestos-containing material into the air.

      (5) “Asbestos-containing material” means any material containing more than one percent asbestos by weight.

      (6) “Contractor” means a person that undertakes for compensation an asbestos abatement project for another person. As used in this subsection, “compensation” means wages, salaries, commissions and any other form of remuneration paid to a person for personal services.

      (7) “Facility” means all or part of any public or private building, structure, installation, equipment, vehicle or vessel, including but not limited to ships.

      (8) “Friable asbestos material” means any asbestos-containing material that hand pressure can crumble, pulverize or reduce to powder when dry.

      (9) “Person” means an individual, public or private corporation, nonprofit corporation, association, firm, partnership, joint venture, business trust, joint stock company, municipal corporation, political subdivision, the state and any agency of the state or any other entity, public or private, however organized.

      (11) “Worker” means an employee or agent of a contractor or facility owner or operator. [Formerly 468.875]

 

      468A.705 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Asbestos-containing material in a friable condition, or when physically or chemically altered, can release asbestos fibers into the air. Asbestos fibers are respiratory hazards proven to cause lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis and as such, are a danger to the public health.

      (2) There is no known minimal level of exposure to asbestos fibers that guarantees the full protection of the public health.

      (3) Asbestos-containing material found in or on facilities or used for other purposes within the state is a potential health hazard.

      (4) The increasing number of asbestos abatement projects increases the exposure of contractors, workers and the public to the hazards of asbestos.

      (5) If improperly performed, an asbestos abatement project creates unnecessary health and safety hazards that are detrimental to citizens and to the state in terms of health, family life, preservation of human resources, wage loss, insurance, medical expenses and disability compensation payments.

      (6) It is in the public interest to reduce exposure to asbestos caused by improperly performed asbestos abatement projects through the upgrading of contractor and worker knowledge, skill and competence. [Formerly 468.877]

 

      468A.707 Asbestos abatement program; rules; contractor licensing; worker certification. (1) The Environmental Quality Commission by rule shall:

      (c) Establish criteria and provisions for granting an extension of time for contractor licensing and worker certification, which may consider the number of workers and the availability of accredited training courses.

      (2) The program established under subsection (1) of this section shall include at least:

      (a) Criteria for contractor licensing and training;

      (b) Criteria for worker certification and training;

      (c) Standardized training courses; and

      (d) A procedure for inspecting asbestos abatement projects.

      (3) In establishing the training requirements under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the commission shall adopt different training requirements that reflect the different levels of responsibility of the contractor or worker, so that within the category of contractor, sublevels shall be separately licensed or exempted and within the category of worker, sublevels shall be separately certified or exempted. The commission shall specifically address as a separate class, those contractors and workers who perform small scale, short duration renovating and maintenance activity. As used in this subsection, “small scale, short duration renovating and maintenance activity” means a task for which the removal of asbestos is not the primary objective of the job, including but not limited to:

      (a) Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes;

      (b) Removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing insulation on beams or above ceilings;

      (c) Replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve;

      (d) Installation or removal of a small section of drywall; or

      (e) Installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing materials.

      (4) The Department of Environmental Quality, on behalf of the commission, shall consult with the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Oregon Health Authority about proposed rules for the asbestos abatement program to assure that the rules are compatible with all other state and federal statutes and regulations related to asbestos abatement.

      (5) The Department of Environmental Quality shall cooperate with the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Oregon Health Authority to promote proper and safe asbestos abatement work practices and compliance with the provisions of ORS 279B.055 (2)(g), 279B.060 (2)(g), 279C.365 (1)(j), 468.126, 468A.135 and 468A.700 to 468A.760. [1987 c.741 §4; 1993 c.18 §175; 2003 c.794 §293; 2009 c.595 §951]
