WATER POLLUTION CONTROL

 

(Generally)

 

      468B.005 Definitions for water pollution control laws. As used in the laws relating to water pollution, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Disposal system” means a system for disposing of wastes, either by surface or underground methods and includes municipal sewerage systems, domestic sewerage systems, treatment works, disposal wells and other systems.

      (2) “Industrial waste” means any liquid, gaseous, radioactive or solid waste substance or a combination thereof resulting from any process of industry, manufacturing, trade or business, or from the development or recovery of any natural resources.

      (3) “Nonpoint source” means any source of pollution other than a point source.

      (4) “Point source” means any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to a pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged. “Point source” does not include agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture.

      (5) “Pollution” or “water pollution” means such alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of any waters of the state, including change in temperature, taste, color, turbidity, silt or odor of the waters, or such discharge of any liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive or other substance into any waters of the state, which will or tends to, either by itself or in connection with any other substance, create a public nuisance or which will or tends to render such waters harmful, detrimental or injurious to public health, safety or welfare, or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational or other legitimate beneficial uses or to livestock, wildlife, fish or other aquatic life or the habitat thereof.

      (6) “Sewage” means the water-carried human or animal waste from residences, buildings, industrial establishments or other places, together with such ground water infiltration and surface water as may be present. The admixture with sewage of wastes or industrial wastes shall also be considered “sewage” within the meaning of ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.255, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B.

      (7) “Sewerage system” means pipelines or conduits, pumping stations, and force mains, and all other structures, devices, appurtenances and facilities used for collecting or conducting wastes to an ultimate point for treatment or disposal.

      (8) “Treatment works” means any plant or other works used for the purpose of treating, stabilizing or holding wastes.

      (9) “Wastes” means sewage, industrial wastes, and all other liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive or other substances which will or may cause pollution or tend to cause pollution of any waters of the state.

      (10) “Water” or “the waters of the state” include lakes, bays, ponds, impounding reservoirs, springs, wells, rivers, streams, creeks, estuaries, marshes, inlets, canals, the Pacific Ocean within the territorial limits of the State of Oregon and all other bodies of surface or underground waters, natural or artificial, inland or coastal, fresh or salt, public or private (except those private waters which do not combine or effect a junction with natural surface or underground waters), which are wholly or partially within or bordering the state or within its jurisdiction. [Formerly 449.075 and then 468.700; 2003 c.469 §1]

 

      468B.010 Authority of commission over water pollution; construction. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619 and 469.930, insofar as the authority of the Environmental Quality Commission over water pollution granted by ORS 448.305, 454.010 to 454.040, 454.205 to 454.225, 454.505 to 454.535, 454.605 to 454.755 and ORS chapters 468, 468A and 468B is inconsistent with any other law, or authority granted to any other state agency, the authority of the commission shall be controlling.

      (2) The water pollution control laws of this state shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of the purposes set forth in ORS 468B.015. [Formerly 449.070 and then 468.705]

 

      468B.015 Policy. Whereas pollution of the waters of the state constitutes a menace to public health and welfare, creates public nuisances, is harmful to wildlife, fish and aquatic life and impairs domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational and other legitimate beneficial uses of water, and whereas the problem of water pollution in this state is closely related to the problem of water pollution in adjoining states, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state:

      (1) To conserve the waters of the state through innovative approaches, including but not limited to the appropriate reuse of water and wastes;

      (2) To protect, maintain and improve the quality of the waters of the state for public water supplies, for the propagation of wildlife, fish and aquatic life and for domestic, agricultural, industrial, municipal, recreational and other legitimate beneficial uses;

      (3) To provide that no waste be discharged into any waters of this state without first receiving the necessary treatment or other corrective action to protect the legitimate beneficial uses of such waters;

      (4) To provide for the prevention, abatement and control of new or existing water pollution; and

      (5) To cooperate with other agencies of the state, agencies of other states and the federal government in carrying out these objectives. [Formerly 449.077 and then 468.710; 2009 c.248 §1]

 

      468B.020 Prevention of pollution. (1) Pollution of any of the waters of the state is declared to be not a reasonable or natural use of such waters and to be contrary to the public policy of the State of Oregon, as set forth in ORS 468B.015.

      (2) In order to carry out the public policy set forth in ORS 468B.015, the Department of Environmental Quality shall take such action as is necessary for the prevention of new pollution and the abatement of existing pollution by:

      (a) Fostering and encouraging the cooperation of the people, industry, cities and counties, in order to prevent, control and reduce pollution of the waters of the state; and

      (b) Requiring the use of all available and reasonable methods necessary to achieve the purposes of ORS 468B.015 and to conform to the standards of water quality and purity established under ORS 468B.048. [Formerly 449.095 and then 468.715]

 

      468B.025 Prohibited activities. (1) Except as provided in ORS 468B.050 or 468B.053, no person shall:

      (a) Cause pollution of any waters of the state or place or cause to be placed any wastes in a location where such wastes are likely to escape or be carried into the waters of the state by any means.

      (b) Discharge any wastes into the waters of the state if the discharge reduces the quality of such waters below the water quality standards established by rule for such waters by the Environmental Quality Commission.

      (2) No person shall violate the conditions of any waste discharge permit issued under ORS 468B.050.

      (3) Violation of subsection (1) or (2) of this section is a public nuisance. [Formerly 449.079 and then 468.720; 1997 c.286 §5]

 

      468B.030 Effluent limitations; rules. In relation to the waters of the state, the Environmental Quality Commission by rule may establish effluent limitations, as defined in Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by Public Law 92-500, October 18, 1972, and other minimum requirements for disposal of wastes, minimum requirements for operation and maintenance of disposal systems, and all other matters pertaining to standards of quality for the waters of the state. The commission may perform or cause to be performed any and all acts necessary to be performed by the state to implement within the jurisdiction of the state the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of October 18, 1972, and Acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, and federal regulations and guidelines issued pursuant thereto. [Formerly 449.081 and then 468.725]

 

      468B.032 Alternative enforcement proceeding; request; public notice; fees. (1) In addition to enforcement proceedings pursuant to ORS 468.090 for a violation of a provision, rule, permit or order under this chapter, the Department of Environmental Quality shall implement the procedures established under this section upon the request of the person to whom the notice of the civil penalty or other formal enforcement action is addressed if the person files the request within 20 days from the date of service of the notice. The written request shall serve in lieu of any other prescribed response.

      (2) The department shall provide public notice of, and reasonable opportunity to comment in writing on, the civil penalty or other formal enforcement action.

      (3) After the comment period closes, the department may determine either to modify the civil penalty or other formal enforcement action based on any comment received under subsection (2) of this section or to reissue the original civil penalty or other formal enforcement action. The department shall serve the person to whom the notice of civil penalty or other formal enforcement action was addressed with a copy of any comments filed and a new notice that includes the determination of the department. The person shall then have 20 days from the date of service of the new notice in which to make written application for a hearing.

      (4) The department shall give notice to any person who commented under subsection (2) of this section of the new notice that includes the determination of the department under subsection (3) of this section. The department also shall give notice to any person who commented under subsection (2) of this section if a hearing is requested under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) If a person does not apply for a hearing under subsection (3) of this section, a person who commented under subsection (2) of this section may request that the department hold a hearing if the person who commented makes the request in writing within 30 days of the mailing of the notice given under subsection (4) of this section. However, the department shall hold a hearing only if the request includes material evidence that the department did not consider when the department issued the civil penalty or other formal enforcement action. If the department denies the request for a hearing, the department shall provide a copy of the denial and the reasons for the denial to the requester and shall provide public notice of the denial that includes the reasons for the denial.

      (6) In a hearing under subsection (3) or (5) of this section, the person subject to the civil penalty or other formal enforcement action and any person who commented under subsection (2) of this section shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence. The department shall conduct the hearing in accordance with ORS 183.745.

      (7) If a person does not request a hearing pursuant to subsection (3) or (5) of this section, the department shall issue the civil penalty or other formal enforcement action.

For the procedures established by this section only, the civil penalty or other formal enforcement action shall be deemed to be commenced for purposes of the state’s implementation of section 309(g)(6) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, when the department first notifies a person in writing that a violation has been documented and that the violation is being referred for formal enforcement action or will result in a civil penalty or other formal enforcement action.

      (9) The Environmental Quality Commission shall ensure that state enforcement procedures for implementing section 309(g)(6) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, are comparable to and not greater than the federal enforcement procedures for enforcing that federal Act.

      (10) Any person who submits a request under subsection (1) of this section shall submit with the request a basic process fee in the amount of $2,000 and a refundable hearings fee in the amount of $3,650 to pay the expenses of the department incurred under this section. If a hearing is not conducted under this section, the department shall return the refundable hearing fee to the person who submitted the request under subsection (1) of this section. All fees received under this subsection shall be deposited into the State Treasury to the credit of an account of the department. Such moneys are continuously appropriated to the department for payment of the costs of the department in carrying out the provisions of this section. [1999 c.975 §2]

      468B.037 Federal Water Pollution Control Act; variances; minimization of negative economic impacts. To the extent allowable by federal law, the Department of Environmental Quality, through its administration of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and granting of variances, shall strive to protect human health and ecosystem health by controlling pollutants that are discharged into the waters of the state, as defined in ORS 468B.005, while also minimizing negative economic impacts on this state’s economy incurred through meeting conditions included in the variances. [2011 c.405 §1]

 

      Note: 468B.037 and 468B.038 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 468B or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      468B.038 Federal Water Pollution Control Act; consultation with applicant for variance. When the Department of Environmental Quality grants a variance as part of its administration of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the department shall consult with the applicant and, to the extent allowable by federal law, seek to:

      (1) Minimize negative economic impacts that will be incurred by the applicant as a result of the variance; and

      (2) Ensure that if conditions are included in the variance, the conditions are directly related to the purpose of the variance and that any negative economic impacts incurred by the applicant will be minimized. [2011 c.405 §2]

(Facility and Covered Vessel Contingency Planning)

 

      468B.340 Legislative findings and intent. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Oil spills present a serious danger to the fragile natural environment of the state.

      (b) Commercial vessel activity on the navigable waters of the state is vital to the economic interests of the people of the state.

      (c) Recent studies conducted in the wake of disastrous oil spills have identified the following problems in the transport and storage of oil:

      (A) Gaps in regulatory oversight;

      (B) Incomplete cost recovery by states;

      (C) Despite research in spill cleanup technology, it is unlikely that a large percentage of oil can be recovered from a catastrophic spill;

      (D) Because response efforts cannot effectively reduce the impact of oil spills, prevention is the most effective approach to oil spill management; and

      (E) Comprehensive oil spill prevention demands participation by industry, citizens, environmental organizations and local, state, federal and international governments.

      (2) Therefore, the Legislative Assembly declares it is the intent of ORS 468B.345 to 468B.415 to establish a program to promote:

      (a) The prevention of oil spills especially on the large, navigable waters of the Columbia River, the Willamette River and the Oregon coast;

      (b) The prevention of oil spills along high hazard train routes;

      (c) Oil spill response preparedness, including the identification of actions and content required for an effective contingency plan;

      (d) A consistent west coast approach to oil spill prevention and response;

      (e) The establishment, coordination and duties of safety committees as provided in ORS 468B.415; and

      (f) To the maximum extent possible, coordination of state programs with the programs and regulations of the United States Coast Guard and adjacent states. [1991 c.651 §2; 2019 c.581 §3]

      (b) Cause or permit the operation of an offshore facility in the state; or

      (c) Cause or permit the operation of a covered vessel within the navigable waters of the state.

      (2) It is not a defense to an action brought for a violation of subsection (1) of this section that the person charged believed that a current contingency plan had been approved by the department.

      (3) A contingency plan shall be renewed at least once every five years.

      (4) This section shall not apply to the operation of a cargo or passenger vessel on Yaquina Bay or on the navigable waters of the state in the Pacific Ocean used by cargo or passenger vessels entering or leaving Yaquina Bay until January 1, 1998. [1991 c.651 §4; 1995 c.535 §2]

      (b) To the maximum extent practicable, be designed, in terms of personnel, materials and equipment, to:

      (A) Remove oil and minimize any damage to the environment resulting from a maximum probable spill; and

      (B) Remove oil and minimize any damage to the environment resulting from a worst case spill.

      (c) Consider the nature and number of facilities and marine terminals in a geographic area and the resulting ability of a facility to finance a plan and pay for department review.

      (d) Describe how the contingency plan relates to and is coordinated with the response plan developed by the Department of Environmental Quality under ORS 468B.495 and 468B.500 and any relevant contingency plan prepared by a cooperative, port, regional entity, the state or the federal government in the same area of the state covered by the plan.

      (e) Provide procedures for early detection of an oil spill and timely notification of appropriate federal, state and local authorities about an oil spill in accordance with applicable state and federal law.
