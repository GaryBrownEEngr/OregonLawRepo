GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      469.010 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Continued growth in demand for nonrenewable energy forms poses a serious and immediate, as well as future, problem. It is essential that future generations not be left a legacy of vanished or depleted resources, resulting in massive environmental, social and financial impact.

      (2) It is the goal of Oregon to promote the efficient use of energy resources and to develop permanently sustainable energy resources. The need exists for comprehensive state leadership in energy production, distribution and utilization. It is, therefore, the policy of Oregon:

      (a) That development and use of a diverse array of permanently sustainable energy resources be encouraged utilizing to the highest degree possible the private sector of our free enterprise system.

      (b) That through state government example and other effective communications, energy conservation and elimination of wasteful and uneconomical uses of energy and materials be promoted. This conservation must include, but not be limited to, resource recovery and materials recycling.

      (c) That the basic human needs of every citizen, present and future, shall be given priority in the allocation of energy resources, commensurate with perpetuation of a free and productive economy with special attention to the preservation and enhancement of environmental quality.

      (d) That state government assist every citizen and industry in adjusting to a diminished availability of energy.

      (e) That energy-efficient modes of transportation for people and goods shall be encouraged, while energy-inefficient modes of transportation shall be discouraged.

      (f) That cost-effectiveness be considered in state agency decision-making relating to energy sources, facilities or conservation, and that cost-effectiveness be considered in all agency decision-making relating to energy facilities.

      469.310 Policy. In the interests of the public health and the welfare of the people of this state, it is the declared public policy of this state that the siting, construction and operation of energy facilities shall be accomplished in a manner consistent with protection of the public health and safety and in compliance with the energy policy and air, water, solid waste, land use and other environmental protection policies of this state. It is, therefore, the purpose of ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619, 469.930 and 469.992 to exercise the jurisdiction of the State of Oregon to the maximum extent permitted by the United States Constitution and to establish in cooperation with the federal government a comprehensive system for the siting, monitoring and regulating of the location, construction and operation of all energy facilities in this state. It is furthermore the policy of this state, notwithstanding ORS 469.010 (2)(f) and the definition of cost-effective in ORS 469.020, that the need for new generating facilities, as defined in ORS 469.503, is sufficiently addressed by reliance on competition in the market rather than by consideration of cost-effectiveness and shall not be a matter requiring determination by the Energy Facility Siting Council in the siting of a generating facility, as defined in ORS 469.503. [Formerly 453.315; 1997 c.428 §1; 2003 c.186 §29]

Following the close of the record, the department shall prepare a draft final order for the council. If the applicant requests a contested case hearing, the council may grant the request if the applicant has shown good cause for a contested case hearing. If a request for a contested case hearing is granted, subsections (9) to (11) of this section do not apply, and the application shall be considered under the same contested case procedures used for a nonexpedited application for a site certificate.

      (9) The council shall make its decision based on the record and the draft final order prepared by the department. The council shall, within six months of the date that the application is deemed filed:

      (a) Grant the application;

      (b) Grant the application with conditions;

      (c) Deny the application; or

      (d) Return the application to the site certification process required by ORS 469.320.

      (10) If the application is granted, the council shall issue a site certificate pursuant to ORS 469.401 and 469.402. Notwithstanding subsection (6) of this section, the council may impose conditions based on standards adopted under ORS 469.501 (1)(b), (f) and (i) to (k), but may not deny an application based on those standards.

      (11) Judicial review of the approval or rejection of a site certificate by the council under this section shall be as provided in ORS 469.403. [2001 c.683 §15; 2011 c.298 §1]

 

      Note: 469.373 was added to and made a part of 469.300 to 469.563 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      469.375 Required findings for radioactive waste disposal facility certificate. The Energy Facility Siting Council shall not issue a site certificate for a waste disposal facility for uranium mine overburden or uranium mill tailings, mill wastes or mill by-product or for radioactive waste or radioactively contaminated containers or receptacles used in the transportation, storage, use or application of radioactive material, unless, accompanying its decision it finds:

      (1) The site is:

      (a) Suitable for disposal of such wastes, and the amount of the wastes, intended for disposal at the site;

      (b) Not located in or adjacent to:

      (A) An area determined to be potentially subject to river or creek erosion within the lifetime of the facility;

      (B) Within the 500-year floodplain of a river, taking into consideration the area determined to be potentially subject to river or creek erosion within the lifetime of the facility;

      (C) An active fault or an active fault zone;

      (D) An area of ancient, recent or active mass movement including land sliding, flow or creep;

      (E) An area subject to ocean erosion; or

      (F) An area having experienced volcanic activity within the last two million years.

      (2) There is no available disposal technology and no available alternative site for disposal of such wastes that would better protect the health, safety and welfare of the public and the environment;

      (3) The disposal of such wastes and the amount of the wastes, at the site will be compatible with the regulatory programs of federal government for disposal of such wastes;

      (4) The disposal of such wastes, and the amount of the wastes, at the site will be coordinated with the regulatory programs of adjacent states for disposal of such wastes;

      (5) That following closure of the site, there will be no release of radioactive materials or radiation from the waste;

      (6) That suitable deed restrictions have been placed on the site recognizing the hazard of the material; and

      (7) That, where federal funding for remedial actions is not available, a surety bond in the name of the state has been provided in an amount determined by the State Department of Energy to be sufficient to cover any costs of closing the site and monitoring it or providing for its security after closure and to secure performance of any site certificate conditions. The bond may be withdrawn when the council finds that:

      (a) The radioactive waste has been disposed of at a waste disposal facility for which a site certificate has been issued; and

      (b) A fee has been paid to the State of Oregon sufficient for monitoring the site after closure.

      (8) If any section, portion, clause or phrase of this section is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional the remaining sections, portions, clauses and phrases shall not be affected but shall remain in full force or effect, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable. [Formerly 459.625; 1979 c.283 §3; 1981 c.587 §3; 1985 c.4]

 

      469.378 Land use compatibility statement for energy facility. Notwithstanding ORS 197.180, when a state agency action or recommendation concerning an energy facility requires a land use compatibility statement prior to the action being completed, the state agency shall satisfy any applicable requirement of ORS 197.180 by conditioning the agency action or recommendation on a determination by either the Energy Facility Siting Council or the applicable city or county that the energy facility as affected by the state agency action satisfies, or will continue to satisfy, the applicable requirements of ORS 197.180. [2001 c.683 §17]

 

      Note: 469.378 was added to and made a part of 469.300 to 469.563 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      469.401 Energy facility site certificate; conditions; effect of issuance on state and local government agencies. (1) Upon approval, the site certificate or any amended site certificate with any conditions prescribed by the Energy Facility Siting Council shall be executed by the chairperson of the council and by the applicant. The certificate or amended certificate shall authorize the applicant to construct, operate and retire the facility subject to the conditions set forth in the site certificate or amended site certificate. The duration of the site certificate or amended site certificate shall be the life of the facility.

      (2) The site certificate or amended site certificate shall contain conditions for the protection of the public health and safety, for the time for completion of construction, and to ensure compliance with the standards, statutes and rules described in ORS 469.501 and 469.503. The site certificate or amended site certificate shall require both parties to abide by local ordinances and state law and the rules of the council in effect on the date the site certificate or amended site certificate is executed, except that upon a clear showing of a significant threat to the public health, safety or the environment that requires application of later-adopted laws or rules, the council may require compliance with such later-adopted laws or rules. For a permit addressed in the site certificate or amended site certificate, the site certificate or amended site certificate shall provide for facility compliance with applicable state and federal laws adopted in the future to the extent that such compliance is required under the respective state agency statutes and rules.

      (3) Subject to the conditions set forth in the site certificate or amended site certificate, any certificate or amended certificate signed by the chairperson of the council shall bind the state and all counties and cities and political subdivisions in this state as to the approval of the site and the construction and operation of the facility. After issuance of the site certificate or amended site certificate, any affected state agency, county, city and political subdivision shall, upon submission by the applicant of the proper applications and payment of the proper fees, but without hearings or other proceedings, promptly issue the permits, licenses and certificates addressed in the site certificate or amended site certificate, subject only to conditions set forth in the site certificate or amended site certificate. After the site certificate or amended site certificate is issued, the only issue to be decided in an administrative or judicial review of a state agency or local government permit for which compliance with governing law was considered and determined in the site certificate or amended site certificate proceeding shall be whether the permit is consistent with the terms of the site certificate or amended site certificate. Each state or local government agency that issues a permit, license or certificate shall continue to exercise enforcement authority over the permit, license or certificate.

      (4) Nothing in ORS chapter 469 shall be construed to preempt the jurisdiction of any state agency or local government over matters that are not included in and governed by the site certificate or amended site certificate. Such matters include but are not limited to employee health and safety, building code compliance, wage and hour or other labor regulations, local government fees and charges or other design or operational issues that do not relate to siting the facility. [1993 c.569 §11 (469.401 and 469.403 enacted in lieu of 469.400); 1995 c.505 §12; 1999 c.385 §2]

 

      469.402 Delegation of review of future action required by site certificate. If the Energy Facility Siting Council elects to impose conditions on a site certificate or an amended site certificate, that require subsequent review and approval of a future action, the council may delegate the future review and approval to the State Department of Energy if, in the council’s discretion, the delegation is warranted under the circumstances of the case. [1995 c.505 §27; 1999 c.385 §3]

 

      Note: 469.402 was added to and made a part of 469.300 to 469.563 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      469.403 Rehearing on approval or rejection of application for site certificate or amendment; appeal; judicial review vested in Supreme Court; stay of order. (1) Any party to a contested case proceeding may apply for rehearing within 30 days from the date the approval or rejection is served. The date of service shall be the date on which the Energy Facility Siting Council delivered or mailed its approval or rejection in accordance with ORS 183.470. The application for rehearing shall set forth specifically the ground upon which the application is based. No objection to the council’s approval or rejection of an application for a site certificate or a site certificate amendment shall be considered on rehearing without good cause shown unless the basis for the objection is urged with reasonable specificity before the council in the site certificate or amended site certificate process. Upon such application, the council shall have the power to grant or deny rehearing or to abrogate or modify its order without further hearing. Unless the council acts upon the application for rehearing within 30 days after the application is filed, the application shall be considered denied. The filing of an application for rehearing shall not, unless specifically ordered by the council, operate as a stay of the site certificate or amended site certificate for the facility.

      (2) Any party to a contested case proceeding on a site certificate or amended site certificate application may appeal the council’s approval or rejection of the site certificate or amended site certificate application. Issues on appeal shall be limited to those raised by the parties to the contested case proceeding before the council.

      (3) Jurisdiction for judicial review of the council’s approval or rejection of an application for a site certificate or amended site certificate is conferred upon the Supreme Court. Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition in the Supreme Court. The petition shall be filed within 60 days after the date of service of the council’s final order or within 30 days after the date the petition for rehearing is denied or deemed denied. Date of service shall be the date on which the council delivered or mailed its order in accordance with ORS 183.470.

      (4) The filing of a petition for judicial review may not stay the order, except that a party to the contested case may apply to the Supreme Court for a stay upon a showing that there is a colorable claim of error and that:

      (a) The petitioner will suffer irreparable injury; or

      (b) Construction of the energy facility will result in irreparable harm to resources protected by applicable council standards or applicable agency or local government standards.

      (5) If the Supreme Court grants a stay pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the court:

      (a) Shall require the petitioner requesting the stay to give an undertaking in the amount of $5,000.

      (b) May grant a stay in whole or in part.

      (c) May impose other reasonable conditions on the stay.

      (6) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 469.320 and this section, the review by the Supreme Court shall be the same as the review by the Court of Appeals described in ORS 183.482. The Supreme Court shall give priority on its docket to such a petition for review and shall render a decision within six months of the filing of the petition for review.

      (7) The following periods of delay shall be excluded from the six-month period within which the court must render a decision under subsection (6) of this section:

      (a) Any period of delay resulting from a motion properly before the court; or

      (b) Any reasonable period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court on the court’s own motion or at the request of one of the parties, if the court granted the continuance on the basis of findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the other parties in having a decision within six months.

      (8) No period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the Supreme Court under subsection (7)(b) of this section shall be excluded from the six-month period unless the court sets forth, in the record, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the other parties in having a decision within six months. The factors the court shall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under subsection (7)(b) of this section are:

      (a) Whether the failure to grant a continuance in the proceeding would be likely to make a continuation of the proceeding impossible or result in a miscarriage of justice; or

      (b) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of parties involved or the existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate consideration of the issues within the six-month period.

      (9) No continuance under subsection (7)(b) of this section shall be granted because of general congestion of the court calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by any member of the court or any party. [1993 c.569 §12 (469.401 and 469.403 enacted in lieu of 469.400); 1995 c.505 §13; 1999 c.385 §4; 2001 c.683 §12]

 

      469.405 Amendment of site certificate; judicial review; exemption; rules. (1) A site certificate may be amended with the approval of the Energy Facility Siting Council. The council may establish by rule the type of amendment that must be considered in a contested case proceeding. Judicial review of an amendment to a site certificate shall be as provided in ORS 469.403.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 34.020 or 197.825, or any other provision of law, the land use approval by an affected local government of a proposed amendment to a facility and the recommendation of the special advisory group of applicable substantive criteria shall be subject to judicial review only as provided in ORS 469.403. If the applicant elects to show compliance with the statewide planning goals by demonstrating that the facility has received local land use approval, the provisions of this section shall apply only to proposed projects for which the land use approval by the local government occurs after the date an application for amendment is submitted to the State Department of Energy.

      (3) An amendment to a site certificate is not required for a pipeline less than 16 inches in diameter and less than five miles in length that is proposed to be constructed to test or maintain an underground gas storage reservoir. If the proposed pipeline will connect to a council certified surface facility related to an underground gas storage reservoir or to a council certified gas pipeline, whether the proposed pipeline is to be located inside or outside the site of a council certified facility, the certificate holder must obtain, prior to construction, the approval of the department for the construction, operation and retirement of the proposed pipeline. The department shall approve such a proposed pipeline if the pipeline meets applicable council substantive standards. Notwithstanding ORS 469.503 (3), the department may not review the proposed pipeline for compliance with other state standards. Notwithstanding ORS 469.503 (4), or any council rule addressing compliance with land use standards, the department shall not review such a proposed pipeline for compliance with land use requirements. Notwithstanding ORS 469.401 (3), the approval by the department of such pipeline shall not bind any state or local agency. The council may adopt appropriate procedural rules for the department review. The department shall issue an order approving or rejecting the proposed pipeline. Judicial review of a department order under this section shall be as provided in ORS 469.403. [1995 c.505 §2; 1999 c.385 §5]

 

      Note: 469.405 was added to and made a part of 469.300 to 469.563 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      469.407 Amendment of application to increase capacity of facility. (1) A recipient may by amendment of its application for a site certificate or by amendment of its site certificate increase the capacity of the facility if the Energy Facility Siting Council finds that:

      (a) The facility will satisfy the conditions of the 500-megawatt exemption, unless modified by the council;

      (b) The enlarged facility does not exceed 500 megawatts and meets the applicable carbon dioxide standard provided for in ORS 469.503 (2) for any increase in capacity beyond the capacity of the 500-megawatt exemption; and

      (c) The enlarged facility meets all other applicable council standards.

      (2) A recipient is deemed to meet any applicable need standard and carbon dioxide emissions standard for the nominal generating capacity of the 500-megawatt exemption provided that the recipient satisfies the conditions of the 500-megawatt exemption, unless the council modifies the conditions.

      (3) As used in this section:

      (a) “Recipient” means any base load gas plant, as defined in ORS 469.503, determined by the council to have the lowest net monetized air emissions among the applicants participating in a contested case proceeding.

      (b) “500-megawatt exemption” means the council order in which a recipient was determined to have the lowest net monetized air emissions. [1997 c.428 §8]

 

      Note: 469.407 and 469.409 were added to and made a part of 469.300 to 469.563 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      469.409 Amendment of site certificate to demonstrate compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standard; binding arbitration to resolve disputes. Any site certificate holder that is required by its site certificate or by law to demonstrate need for the facility shall instead demonstrate compliance with the carbon dioxide emissions standard applicable to the type of facility subject to the site certificate before beginning construction. Such a demonstration shall be made as an amendment to the site certificate. Notwithstanding ORS 469.405 or any council rule, if the site certificate holder proceeds pursuant to ORS 469.503 (2)(c)(A) or (C), or both, the Energy Facility Siting Council shall not conduct a contested case hearing on such amendment and the council’s order shall not be subject to judicial review. Any dispute about the site certificate holder’s demonstration of compliance with the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard shall be settled through binding arbitration. [1997 c.428 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 469.407.

 

      469.410 Energy facility site certificate applications filed or under construction prior to July 2, 1975; conditions of site certificate; monitoring programs.

      (a) To abide by the conditions of all licenses, permits and certificates required by the State of Oregon or any subdivision in the state to operate the energy facility and issued prior to July 2, 1975; and

      (b) On and after July 2, 1975, to abide by the rules of the Director of the State Department of Energy adopted pursuant to ORS 469.040 (1)(d) and rules of the council adopted pursuant to ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619 and 469.930.

      (3) The council has continuing authority over the site for which the site certificate is issued and may inspect, or direct the State Department of Energy to inspect, or request another state agency or local government to inspect, the site at any time in order to ensure that the facility is being operated consistently with the terms and conditions of the site certificate and any applicable health or safety standards.

      (4) The council shall establish programs for monitoring the environmental and ecological effects of the operation and the decommissioning of energy facilities subject to site certificates issued prior to July 2, 1975, to ensure continued compliance with the terms and conditions of the site certificate and any applicable health or safety standards.

      (5) Site certificates executed by the Governor under ORS 469.400 (1991 Edition) prior to July 2, 1975, shall bind successor agencies created hereunder in accordance with the terms of such site certificates. Any holder of a site certificate issued prior to July 2, 1975, shall abide by the rules of the director adopted pursuant to ORS 469.040 (1)(d) and rules of the council adopted pursuant to ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619, 469.930 and 469.992. [1975 c.606 §24; 1983 c.740 §184; 1989 c.88 §5; 1993 c.569 §13; 1995 c.505 §15]

 

      469.420 [Formerly 453.405; 1977 c.813 §1; 1979 c.234 §1; 1981 c.792 §3; repealed by 1981 c.792 §4 (469.421 enacted in lieu of 469.420)]

 

      469.421 Fees; exemptions; assessment of certain utilities and suppliers; penalty. (1) Subject to the provisions of ORS 469.441, any person submitting a notice of intent, a request for exemption under ORS 469.320, a request for an expedited review under ORS 469.370, a request for an expedited review under ORS 469.373, a request for the State Department of Energy to approve a pipeline under ORS 469.405 (3), an application for a site certificate or a request to amend a site certificate shall pay all expenses incurred by the Energy Facility Siting Council and the department related to the review and decision of the council. Expenses under this subsection may include:

      (a) Legal expenses;

      (b) Expenses incurred in processing and evaluating the application;

      (c) Expenses incurred in issuing a final order or site certificate;

      (d) Expenses incurred in commissioning an independent study under ORS 469.360;

      (e) Compensation paid to a state agency, a tribe or a local government pursuant to a written contract or agreement relating to compensation as provided for in ORS 469.360; or

      (f) Expenses incurred by the council in making rule changes that are specifically required and related to the particular site certificate.

      (2) Every person submitting a notice of intent to file for a site certificate, a request for exemption or a request for expedited review shall pay the fee required under the fee schedule established under ORS 469.441 to the department prior to submitting the notice or request to the council. To the extent possible, the full cost of the evaluation shall be paid from the fee paid under this subsection. However, if costs of the evaluation exceed the fee, the person submitting the notice or request shall pay any excess costs shown in an itemized statement prepared by the council. In no event shall the council incur evaluation expenses in excess of 110 percent of the fee initially paid unless the council provides prior notification to the applicant and a detailed projected budget the council believes necessary to complete the project. If costs are less than the fee paid, the excess shall be refunded to the person submitting the notice or request.

      (3) Before submitting a site certificate application, the applicant shall request from the department an estimate of the costs expected to be incurred in processing the application. The department shall inform the applicant of that amount and require the applicant to make periodic payments of the costs pursuant to a cost reimbursement agreement. The cost reimbursement agreement shall provide for payment of 25 percent of the estimated costs when the applicant submits the application. If costs of the evaluation exceed the estimate, the applicant shall pay any excess costs shown in an itemized statement prepared by the council. In no event shall the council incur evaluation expenses in excess of 110 percent of the fee initially estimated unless the council provided prior notification to the applicant and a detailed projected budget the council believes is necessary to complete the project. If costs are less than the fee paid, the council shall refund the excess to the applicant.

      (4) Any person who is delinquent in the payment of fees under subsections (1) to (3) of this section shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (11) of this section.

      (5) Subject to the provisions of ORS 469.441, each holder of a certificate shall pay an annual fee, due every July 1 following issuance of a site certificate. For each fiscal year, upon approval of the department’s budget authorization by an odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly or as revised by the Emergency Board meeting in an interim period or by the Legislative Assembly meeting in special session or in an even-numbered year regular session, the Director of the State Department of Energy promptly shall enter an order establishing an annual fee based on the amount of revenues that the director estimates is needed to fund the cost of ensuring that the facility is being operated consistently with the terms and conditions of the site certificate, any order issued by the department under ORS 469.405 (3) and any applicable health or safety standards. In determining this cost, the director shall include both the actual direct cost to be incurred by the council and the department to ensure that the facility is being operated consistently with the terms and conditions of the site certificate, any order issued by the department under ORS 469.405 (3) and any applicable health or safety standards, and the general costs to be incurred by the council and the department to ensure that all certificated facilities are being operated consistently with the terms and conditions of the site certificates, any orders issued by the department under ORS 469.405 (3) and any applicable health or safety standards that cannot be allocated to an individual, licensed facility. Not more than 35 percent of the annual fee charged each facility shall be for the recovery of these general costs. The fees for direct costs shall reflect the size and complexity of the facility, the anticipated costs of ensuring compliance with site certificate conditions, the anticipated costs of conducting site inspections and compliance reviews as described in ORS 469.430, and the anticipated costs of compensating state agencies and local governments for participating in site inspection and compliance enforcement activities at the request of the council.

      (6) Each holder of a site certificate executed after July 1 of any fiscal year shall pay a fee for the remaining portion of the year. The amount of the fee shall be set at the cost of regulating the facility during the remaining portion of the year determined in the same manner as the annual fee.

      (7) When the actual costs of regulation incurred by the council and the department for the year, including that portion of the general regulation costs that have been allocated to a particular facility, are less than the annual fees for that facility, the unexpended balance shall be refunded to the site certificate holder. When the actual regulation costs incurred by the council and the department for the year, including that portion of the general regulation costs that have been allocated to a particular facility, are projected to exceed the annual fee for that facility, the director may issue an order revising the annual fee.

      (8)(a) In addition to any other fees required by law, each energy resource supplier shall pay to the department annually its share of an assessment to fund the programs and activities of the council and the department.

      (b) Prior to filing an agency request budget under ORS 291.208 for purposes related to the compilation and preparation of the Governor’s budget under ORS 291.216, the director shall determine the projected aggregate amount of revenue to be collected from energy resource suppliers under this subsection that will be necessary to fund the programs and activities of the council and the department for each fiscal year of the upcoming biennium. After making that determination, the director shall convene a public meeting with representatives of energy resource suppliers and other interested parties for the purpose of providing energy resource suppliers with a full accounting of:

      (A) The projected revenue needed to fund each department program or activity; and

      (B) The projected allocation of moneys derived from the assessment imposed under this subsection to each department program or activity.

      (c) Upon approval of the budget authorization of the council and the department by an odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly, the director shall promptly enter an order establishing the amount of revenues required to be derived from an assessment pursuant to this subsection in order to fund programs and activities that the council and the department are charged with administering and authorized to conduct under the laws of this state, including those enumerated in ORS 469.030, for the first fiscal year of the forthcoming biennium. On or before June 1 of each even-numbered year, the director shall enter an order establishing the amount of revenues required to be derived from an assessment pursuant to this subsection in order to fund the programs and activities that the council and the department are charged with administering and authorized to conduct under the laws of this state, including those enumerated in ORS 469.030, for the second fiscal year of the biennium.

      (b) The department shall maintain and cause other state agencies and counties to maintain time and billing records for the expenditure of any fees collected from an operator of a nuclear fueled thermal power plant under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (10) Reactors operated by a college, university or graduate center for research purposes and electric utilities not connected to the Northwest Power Grid are exempt from the fee requirements of subsections (5), (8) and (9) of this section.

      (11)(a) All fees assessed by the director against holders of site certificates for facilities that have an installed capacity of 500 megawatts or greater may be paid in several installments, the schedule for which shall be negotiated between the director and the site certificate holder.

      (b) Energy resource suppliers or applicants or holders of a site certificate who fail to pay a fee provided under subsections (1) to (9) of this section after it is due and payable shall pay, in addition to that fee, a penalty of two percent of the fee a month for the period that the fee is past due. Any payment made according to the terms of a schedule negotiated under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not be considered past due. The director may bring an action to collect an unpaid fee or penalty in the name of the State of Oregon in a court of competent jurisdiction. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the director if the director prevails in an action under this subsection. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action under this subsection if the court determines that the director had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

[1993 c.569 §22 (469.501, 469.503, 469.505 and 469.507 enacted in lieu of 469.500 and 469.510); 1995 c.505 §20; 1997 c.428 §3; 2001 c.134 §7; 2013 c.263 §1]

 

      469.503 Requirements for approval of energy facility site certificate; carbon dioxide emissions standard; offset funds; use of offset funds by qualifying organization; rules. In order to issue a site certificate, the Energy Facility Siting Council shall determine that the preponderance of the evidence on the record supports the following conclusions:

      (1) The facility complies with the applicable standards adopted by the council pursuant to ORS 469.501 or the overall public benefits of the facility outweigh any adverse effects on a resource or interest protected by the applicable standards the facility does not meet.

      (2) If the energy facility is a fossil-fueled power plant, the energy facility complies with any applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard adopted by the council or enacted by statute. Base load gas plants shall comply with the standard set forth in subsection (2)(a) of this section. Other fossil-fueled power plants shall comply with any applicable standard adopted by the council by rule pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this section. Subsections (2)(c) and (d) of this section prescribe the means by which an applicant may comply with the applicable standard.

      (a) The net carbon dioxide emissions rate of the proposed base load gas plant shall not exceed 0.70 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of net electric power output, with carbon dioxide emissions and net electric power output measured on a new and clean basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the council may by rule modify the carbon dioxide emissions standard for base load gas plants if the council finds that the most efficient stand-alone combined cycle, combustion turbine, natural gas-fired energy facility that is commercially demonstrated and operating in the United States has a net heat rate of less than 7,200 Btu per kilowatt hour higher heating value adjusted to ISO conditions. In modifying the carbon dioxide emission standard, the council shall determine the rate of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of net electric output of such energy facility, adjusted to ISO conditions, and reset the carbon dioxide emissions standard at 17 percent below this rate.

      (b) The council shall adopt carbon dioxide emissions standards for other types of fossil-fueled power plants. Such carbon dioxide emissions standards shall be promulgated by rule. In adopting or amending such carbon dioxide emissions standards, the council shall consider and balance at least the following principles, the findings on which shall be contained in the rulemaking record:

      (A) Promote facility fuel efficiency;

      (B) Promote efficiency in the resource mix;

      (C) Reduce net carbon dioxide emissions;

      (D) Promote cogeneration that reduces net carbon dioxide emissions;

      (E) Promote innovative technologies and creative approaches to mitigating, reducing or avoiding carbon dioxide emissions;

      (F) Minimize transaction costs;

      (G) Include an alternative process that separates decisions on the form and implementation of offsets from the final decision on granting a site certificate;

      (H) Allow either the applicant or third parties to implement offsets;

      (I) Be attainable and economically achievable for various types of power plants;

      (J) Promote public participation in the selection and review of offsets;

      (K) Promote prompt implementation of offset projects;

      (L) Provide for monitoring and evaluation of the performance of offsets; and

      (M) Promote reliability of the regional electric system.

      (c) The council shall determine whether the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard is met by first determining the gross carbon dioxide emissions that are reasonably likely to result from the operation of the proposed energy facility. Such determination shall be based on the proposed design of the energy facility. The council shall adopt site certificate conditions to ensure that the predicted carbon dioxide emissions are not exceeded on a new and clean basis. For any remaining emissions reduction necessary to meet the applicable standard, the applicant may elect to use any of subparagraphs (A) to (D) of this paragraph, or any combination thereof. The council shall determine the amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions reduction that is reasonably likely to result from the applicant’s offsets and whether the resulting net carbon dioxide emissions meet the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard. For purposes of determining the net carbon dioxide emissions, the council shall by rule establish the global warming potential of each greenhouse gas based on a generally accepted scientific method, and convert any greenhouse gas emissions to a carbon dioxide equivalent. Unless otherwise provided by the council by rule, the global warming potential of methane is 23 times that of carbon dioxide, and the global warming potential of nitrous oxide is 296 times that of carbon dioxide. If the council or a court on judicial review concludes that the applicant has not demonstrated compliance with the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard under subparagraphs (A), (B) or (D) of this paragraph, or any combination thereof, and the applicant has agreed to meet the requirements of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph for any deficiency, the council or a court shall find compliance based on such agreement.

      (A) The facility will sequentially produce electrical and thermal energy from the same fuel source, and the thermal energy will be used to displace another source of carbon dioxide emissions that would have otherwise continued to occur, in which case the council shall adopt site certificate conditions ensuring that the carbon dioxide emissions reduction will be achieved.

      (B) The applicant or a third party will implement particular offsets, in which case the council may adopt site certificate conditions ensuring that the proposed offsets are implemented but shall not require that predicted levels of avoidance, displacement or sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions be achieved. The council shall determine the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions reduction that is reasonably likely to result from each of the proposed offsets based on the criteria in sub-subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of this subparagraph. In making this determination, the council shall not allow credit for offsets that have already been allocated or awarded credit for greenhouse gas emissions reduction in another regulatory setting. In addition, the fact that an applicant or other parties involved with an offset may derive benefits from the offset other than the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not, by itself, a basis for withholding credit for an offset.

      (i) The degree of certainty that the predicted quantity of greenhouse gas emissions reduction will be achieved by the offset;

      (ii) The ability of the council to determine the actual quantity of greenhouse gas emissions reduction resulting from the offset, taking into consideration any proposed measurement, monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measure performance; and

      (iii) The extent to which the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions would occur in the absence of the offsets.

      (C) The applicant or a third party agrees to provide funds in an amount deemed sufficient to produce the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions necessary to meet the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard, in which case the funds shall be used as specified in paragraph (d) of this subsection. Unless modified by the council as provided below, the payment of 57 cents shall be deemed to result in a reduction of one ton of carbon dioxide emissions. The council shall determine the offset funds using the monetary offset rate and the level of emissions reduction required to meet the applicable standard. If a site certificate is approved based on this subparagraph, the council may not adjust the amount of such offset funds based on the actual performance of offsets. After three years from June 26, 1997, the council may by rule increase or decrease the monetary offset rate of 57 cents per ton of carbon dioxide emissions. Any change to the monetary offset rate shall be based on empirical evidence of the cost of offsets and the council’s finding that the standard will be economically achievable with the modified rate for natural gas-fired power plants. Following the initial three-year period, the council may increase or decrease the monetary offset rate no more than 50 percent in any two-year period.

      (D) Any other means that the council adopts by rule for demonstrating compliance with any applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard.

      (d) If the applicant elects to meet the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard in whole or in part under paragraph (c)(C) of this subsection, the applicant shall identify the qualified organization. The applicant may identify an organization that has applied for, but has not received, an exemption from federal income taxation, but the council may not find that the organization is a qualified organization unless the organization is exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as amended and in effect on December 31, 1996. The site certificate holder shall provide a bond or comparable security in a form reasonably acceptable to the council to ensure the payment of the offset funds and the amount required under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph. Such security shall be provided by the date specified in the site certificate, which shall be no later than the commencement of construction of the facility. The site certificate shall require that the offset funds be disbursed as specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, unless the council finds that no qualified organization exists, in which case the site certificate shall require that the offset funds be disbursed as specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.

      (A) The site certificate holder shall disburse the offset funds and any other funds required by sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph to the qualified organization as follows:

      (i) When the site certificate holder receives written notice from the qualified organization certifying that the qualified organization is contractually obligated to pay any funds to implement offsets using the offset funds, the site certificate holder shall make the requested amount available to the qualified organization unless the total of the amount requested and any amounts previously requested exceeds the offset funds, in which case only the remaining amount of the offset funds shall be made available. The qualified organization shall use at least 80 percent of the offset funds for contracts to implement offsets. The qualified organization shall assess offsets for their potential to qualify in, generate credits in or reduce obligations in other regulatory settings. The qualified organization may use up to 20 percent of the offset funds for monitoring, evaluation, administration and enforcement of contracts to implement offsets.

      (ii) At the request of the qualified organization and in addition to the offset funds, the site certificate holder shall pay the qualified organization an amount equal to 10 percent of the first $500,000 of the offset funds and 4.286 percent of any offset funds in excess of $500,000. This amount shall not be less than $50,000 unless a lesser amount is specified in the site certificate. This amount compensates the qualified organization for its costs of selecting offsets and contracting for the implementation of offsets.

      (iii) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a site certificate holder subject to this subparagraph shall have no obligation with regard to offsets, the offset funds or the funds required by sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph other than to make available to the qualified organization the total amount required under paragraph (c) of this subsection and sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph, nor shall any nonperformance, negligence or misconduct on the part of the qualified organization be a basis for revocation of the site certificate or any other enforcement action by the council with respect to the site certificate holder.

      (B) If the council finds there is no qualified organization, the site certificate holder shall select one or more offsets to be implemented pursuant to criteria established by the council. The site certificate holder shall give written notice of its selections to the council and to any person requesting notice. On petition by the State Department of Energy, or by any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the site certificate holder’s selection of offsets, or on the council’s own motion, the council may review such selection. The petition must be received by the council within 30 days of the date the notice of selection is placed in the United States mail, with first-class postage prepaid. The council shall approve the site certificate holder’s selection unless it finds that the selection is not consistent with criteria established by the council. The site certificate holder shall contract to implement the selected offsets within 18 months after commencing construction of the facility unless good cause is shown requiring additional time. The contracts shall obligate the expenditure of at least 85 percent of the offset funds for the implementation of offsets. No more than 15 percent of the offset funds may be spent on monitoring, evaluation and enforcement of the contract to implement the selected offsets. The council’s criteria for selection of offsets shall be based on the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b)(C) and (c)(B) of this subsection and may also consider the costs of particular types of offsets in relation to the expected benefits of such offsets. The council’s criteria shall not require the site certificate holder to select particular offsets, and shall allow the site certificate holder a reasonable range of choices in selecting offsets. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the site certificate holder’s financial liability for implementation, monitoring, evaluation and enforcement of offsets pursuant to this subsection shall be limited to the amount of any offset funds not already contractually obligated. Nonperformance, negligence or misconduct by the entity or entities implementing, monitoring or evaluating the selected offset shall not be a basis for revocation of the site certificate or any other enforcement action by the council with respect to the site certificate holder.

      (C) Every qualified organization that has received funds under this paragraph shall, at five-year intervals beginning on the date of receipt of such funds, provide the council with the information the council requests about the qualified organization’s performance. The council shall evaluate the information requested and, based on such information, shall make any recommendations to the Legislative Assembly that the council deems appropriate.

      (e) As used in this subsection:

      (A) “Adjusted to ISO conditions” means carbon dioxide emissions and net electric power output as determined at 59 degrees Fahrenheit, 14.7 pounds per square inch atmospheric pressure and 60 percent humidity.

      (iii) Has in effect articles of incorporation that require that offset funds received pursuant to this section are used for offsets that require that decisions on the use of the offset funds are made by a decision-making body composed of seven voting members of which three are appointed by the council, three are Oregon residents appointed by the Bullitt Foundation or an alternative environmental nonprofit organization named by the body, and one is appointed by the applicants for site certificates that are subject to paragraph (d) of this subsection and the holders of such site certificates, and that require nonvoting membership on the body for holders of site certificates that have provided funds not yet disbursed under paragraph (d)(A) of this subsection;

      (iv) Has made available on an annual basis, beginning after the first year of operation, a signed opinion of an independent certified public accountant stating that the qualified organization’s use of funds pursuant to this statute conforms with generally accepted accounting procedures except that the qualified organization shall have one year to conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the event of a nonconforming audit;

      (v) Has to the extent applicable, except for good cause, entered into contracts obligating at least 60 percent of the offset funds to implement offsets within two years after the commencement of construction of the facility; and

      (vi) Has to the extent applicable, except for good cause, complied with paragraph (d)(A)(i) of this subsection.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 469.504 for land use compliance and except for those statutes and rules for which the decision on compliance has been delegated by the federal government to a state agency other than the council, the facility complies with all other Oregon statutes and administrative rules identified in the project order, as amended, as applicable to the issuance of a site certificate for the proposed facility. If compliance with applicable Oregon statutes and administrative rules, other than those involving federally delegated programs, would result in conflicting conditions in the site certificate, the council may resolve the conflict consistent with the public interest. A resolution may not result in the waiver of any applicable state statute.

      (4) The facility complies with the statewide planning goals adopted by the Land Conservation and Development Commission. [1993 c.569 §23 (469.501, 469.503, 469.505 and 469.507 enacted in lieu of 469.500 and 469.510); 1995 c.505 §21; 1997 c.428 §4; 1999 c.365 §11; 2001 c.134 §10; 2003 c.186 §78; 2011 c.298 §2; 2013 c.263 §2]

 

      469.504 Facility compliance with statewide planning goals; exception; amendment of local plan and land use regulations; conflicts; technical assistance; rules. (1) A proposed facility shall be found in compliance with the statewide planning goals under ORS 469.503 (4) if:

      (a) The facility has received local land use approval under the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations of the affected local government; or

      (b) The Energy Facility Siting Council determines that:

      (A) The facility complies with applicable substantive criteria from the affected local government’s acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations that are required by the statewide planning goals and in effect on the date the application is submitted, and with any Land Conservation and Development Commission administrative rules and goals and any land use statutes that apply directly to the facility under ORS 197.646;

      (B) For an energy facility or a related or supporting facility that must be evaluated against the applicable substantive criteria pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, that the proposed facility does not comply with one or more of the applicable substantive criteria but does otherwise comply with the applicable statewide planning goals, or that an exception to any applicable statewide planning goal is justified under subsection (2) of this section; or

      (C) For a facility that the council elects to evaluate against the statewide planning goals pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, that the proposed facility complies with the applicable statewide planning goals or that an exception to any applicable statewide planning goal is justified under subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) The council may find goal compliance for a facility that does not otherwise comply with one or more statewide planning goals by taking an exception to the applicable goal. Notwithstanding the requirements of ORS 197.732, the statewide planning goal pertaining to the exception process or any rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission pertaining to an exception process goal, the council may take an exception to a goal if the council finds:

      (a) The land subject to the exception is physically developed to the extent that the land is no longer available for uses allowed by the applicable goal;

      (b) The land subject to the exception is irrevocably committed as described by the rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission to uses not allowed by the applicable goal because existing adjacent uses and other relevant factors make uses allowed by the applicable goal impracticable; or

      (c) The following standards are met:

      (A) Reasons justify why the state policy embodied in the applicable goal should not apply;

      (B) The significant environmental, economic, social and energy consequences anticipated as a result of the proposed facility have been identified and adverse impacts will be mitigated in accordance with rules of the council applicable to the siting of the proposed facility; and

      (C) The proposed facility is compatible with other adjacent uses or will be made compatible through measures designed to reduce adverse impacts.

      (3) If compliance with applicable substantive local criteria and applicable statutes and state administrative rules would result in conflicting conditions in the site certificate or amended site certificate, the council shall resolve the conflict consistent with the public interest. A resolution may not result in a waiver of any applicable state statute.

      (4) An applicant for a site certificate shall elect whether to demonstrate compliance with the statewide planning goals under subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section. The applicant shall make the election on or before the date specified by the council by rule.

      (5) Upon request by the State Department of Energy, the special advisory group established under ORS 469.480 shall recommend to the council, within the time stated in the request, the applicable substantive criteria under subsection (1)(b)(A) of this section. If the special advisory group does not recommend applicable substantive criteria within the time established in the department’s request, the council may either determine and apply the applicable substantive criteria under subsection (1)(b) of this section or determine compliance with the statewide planning goals under subsection (1)(b)(B) or (C) of this section. If the special advisory group recommends applicable substantive criteria for an energy facility described in ORS 469.300 or a related or supporting facility that does not pass through more than one local government jurisdiction or more than three zones in any one jurisdiction, the council shall apply the criteria recommended by the special advisory group. If the special advisory group recommends applicable substantive criteria for an energy facility as defined in ORS 469.300 (11)(a)(C) to (E) or a related or supporting facility that passes through more than one jurisdiction or more than three zones in any one jurisdiction, the council shall review the recommended criteria and determine whether to evaluate the proposed facility against the applicable substantive criteria recommended by the special advisory group, against the statewide planning goals or against a combination of the applicable substantive criteria and statewide planning goals. In making its determination, the council shall consult with the special advisory group and shall consider:

      (a) The number of jurisdictions and zones in question;

      (b) The degree to which the applicable substantive criteria reflect local government consideration of energy facilities in the planning process; and

      (c) The level of consistency of the applicable substantive criteria from the various zones and jurisdictions.

      (6) The council is not subject to ORS 197.180 and a state agency may not require an applicant for a site certificate to comply with any rules or programs adopted under ORS 197.180.

      (7) On or before its next periodic review, each affected local government shall amend its comprehensive plan and land use regulations as necessary to reflect the decision of the council pertaining to a site certificate or amended site certificate.

      (8) Notwithstanding ORS 34.020 or 197.825 or any other provision of law, the affected local government’s land use approval of a proposed facility under subsection (1)(a) of this section and the special advisory group’s recommendation of applicable substantive criteria under subsection (5) of this section shall be subject to judicial review only as provided in ORS 469.403. If the applicant elects to comply with subsection (1)(a) of this section, the provisions of this subsection shall apply only to proposed projects for which the land use approval of the local government occurs after the date a notice of intent or an application for expedited processing is submitted to the State Department of Energy.

      (9) The State Department of Energy, in cooperation with other state agencies, shall provide, to the extent possible, technical assistance and information about the siting process to local governments that request such assistance or that anticipate having a facility proposed in their jurisdiction. [1997 c.428 §5; 1999 c.385 §10; 2001 c.134 §11; 2003 c.186 §79; 2005 c.829 §12]

      469.505 Consultation with other agencies. (1) In making a determination regarding compliance with statutes, rules and ordinances administered by another agency or compliance with requirements of ORS 469.300 to 469.563 and 469.590 to 469.619 where another agency has special expertise, consultation with the other agency shall occur during the notice of intent and site certificate application process. Any permit application for which the permitting decision has been delegated by the federal government to a state agency other than the Energy Facility Siting Council shall be reviewed, whenever feasible, simultaneously with the council’s review of the site certificate application. Any hearings required on such permit applications shall be consolidated, whenever feasible, with hearings under ORS 469.300 to 469.563 and 469.590 to 469.619.

      (2) Before resolving any conflicting conditions in site certificates or amended site certificates under ORS 469.503 (3) and 469.504, the council shall notify and consult with the agencies and local governments responsible for administering the statutes, administrative rules or substantive local criteria that result in the conflicting conditions regarding potential conflict resolution. [1993 c.569 §24 (469.501, 469.503, 469.505 and 469.507 enacted in lieu of 469.500 and 469.510); 1997 c.428 §9; 1999 c.385 §11]

(Oregon Hanford Cleanup Board)

 

      469.566 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that Oregon is not assured that the United States Department of Energy will:

      (a) Consider the unique features of Oregon and the needs of the people of Oregon when assessing the Hanford Nuclear Reservation as a potentially suitable location for the long-term disposal of high-level radioactive waste; or

      (b) Ensure adequate opportunity for public participation in the assessment process.

      (2) Over the past 45 years, the United States has developed and produced nuclear weapons at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and during this period large quantities of radioactive hazardous and chemical wastes have accumulated at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, and the waste sites pose an immediate and serious long-term threat to the environment and to public health and safety.

      (3) Therefore, the Legislative Assembly declares that it is in the best interests of the State of Oregon to establish an Oregon Hanford Cleanup Board to serve as a focus for the State of Oregon in the development of a state policy to be presented to the federal government, to ensure a maximum of public participation in the assessment and cleanup process.

      (1) In order to solve the problem of high-level radioactive waste disposal, Congress established a process for selecting two sites for the safe, permanent and regionally equitable disposal of such waste.

      (2) The process of selecting three sites as final candidates, including the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the State of Washington, for a first high-level nuclear waste repository by the United States Department of Energy violated the intent and the mandate of Congress.

      (3) The United States Department of Energy has prematurely deferred consideration of numerous potential sites and disposal media that its own research indicates are more appropriate, safer and less expensive.

      (4) Placement of a repository at Hanford without methodical and independently verified scientific evaluation threatens the health and safety of the people and the environment of this state.

      (5) The selection process is flawed and not credible because it did not include independent experts in the selection of the sites and in the review of the selected sites, as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences.

      (6) By postponing indefinitely all site specific work for an eastern repository, the United States Department of Energy has not complied with the intent of Congress expressed in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, Public Law 97-425, and the fundamental compromise which enabled its enactment. [1987 c.13 §1; 2001 c.104 §211]

 

      Note: 469.584 and 469.585 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 469 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      469.585 Activities of state related to selection of high-level radioactive waste disposal site. In order to achieve complete compliance with federal law and protect the health, safety and welfare of the people of the State of Oregon, the Legislative Assembly, other statewide officials and state agencies shall use all legal means necessary to:

      (1) Suspend the preliminary site selection process for a high-level nuclear waste repository, including the process of site characterization, until there is compliance with the intent of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act;

      (2) Reverse the Secretary of Energy’s decision to postpone indefinitely all site specific work on locating and developing an eastern repository for high-level nuclear waste;

      (3) Insist that the United States Department of Energy’s site selection process, when resumed, considers all acceptable geologic media and results in safe, scientifically justified and regionally and geographically equitable high-level nuclear waste disposal;

      (4) Demand that federal budget actions fully and completely follow the intent of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act;

      (5) Continue to pursue alliances with other states and interested parties, particularly with Pacific Northwest Governors, legislatures and other parties, affected by the site selection process and transportation of high-level nuclear waste; and

      (6) Ensure that Oregon, because of its close geographic and geologic proximity to the proposed Hanford Nuclear Reservation site, be accorded the same status under federal law as a state in which a high-level nuclear repository is proposed to be located. [1987 c.13 §2; 2001 c.104 §212]

(Hanford Nuclear Reservation)

 

      469.586 Findings. The Legislative Assembly and the people of the State of Oregon find that:

      (1) The maintenance of healthy, unpolluted river systems, airsheds and land are essential to the economic vitality and well-being of the citizens of the State of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest.

      (2) Radioactive waste stored at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation is already leaking into and contaminating the water table and watershed of the Columbia River and radioactive materials and toxic compounds have been found in plants, animals and waters downstream from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and constitute a present and potential threat to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the State of Oregon.

      (3) The Hanford Nuclear Reservation is now one of the most radioactively contaminated sites in the world, according to government studies, and will require billions of dollars in costs for cleanup and the ongoing assessment of health effects.

      (4) In November 1980, the people of the State of Oregon, by direct vote in a statewide election, enacted a moratorium on the construction of nuclear power plants, and no nuclear power plants are presently operating in the State of Oregon.

      (5) In May 1987, the people of the State of Oregon, by direct vote in a statewide election, enacted Ballot Measure 1, opposing the disposal of highly radioactive spent fuel from commercial power plants at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.

      (6) In 1995, the Legislative Assembly resolved that Oregon should have all legal rights in matters affecting the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, including party status in the Hanford tri-party agreement that governs the cleanup of the reservation.

      (7) Throughout the administrations of Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush, the policy of the federal government banned the use of plutonium in commercial nuclear power plants due to the risk that the plutonium could be diverted to terrorists and to nations that have not renounced the use of nuclear weapons.

      (8) The federal government has announced that it will process plutonium from weapons with uranium to produce mixed oxide fuel for commercial nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities. The Hanford Nuclear Reservation, located on the Columbia River, is a primary candidate site being considered for the production facilities.

      (9) The production of mixed oxide fuel will result in enormous new quantities of radioactive and chemical wastes that will present significant additional disposal problems and unknown costs. [1997 c.617 §1]

 

      Note: 469.586 and 469.587 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 469 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      469.587 Position of State of Oregon related to operation of Hanford Nuclear Reservation. The Legislative Assembly and the people of the State of Oregon:

      (1) Declare that the State of Oregon is unalterably opposed to the use of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation for operations that create more contamination at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, divert resources from cleanup at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and make the Hanford Nuclear Reservation cleanup more difficult, such as the processing of plutonium to fuel nuclear power plants, reactors or any other facilities, and further declare that vitrification in a safe manner is the preferred means to dispose of excess plutonium, in order to protect human health and the environment.

      (2) Request that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Energy continue their previous policy of banning the use of plutonium to fuel commercial power plants and nuclear facilities.

      (3) Request that the federal government honor the federal government’s original mandate to implement and complete the cleanup and restoration of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. [1997 c.617 §2]

      (2) “Spent nuclear fuel” means nuclear fuel rods or assemblies which have been irradiated in a power reactor and subsequently removed from that reactor. [1981 c.1 §2]

 

      469.593 Findings. The people of this state find that if no permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste is provided by the federal government, the residents of the state may face the undue financial burden of paying for construction of a repository for such wastes. Therefore, the people of this state enact ORS 469.590 to 469.601. [1981 c.1 §1]

 

      469.594 Storage of high-level radioactive waste after expiration of license prohibited; continuing responsibility for storage; implementation agreements. (1) Notwithstanding the definition of a “waste disposal facility” under ORS 469.300, no high-level radioactive waste should be stored at the site of a nuclear-fueled thermal power plant after the expiration of the operating license issued to the nuclear power plant by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a person operating a nuclear power plant under a license issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall remain responsible for proper temporary storage of high-level radioactive materials at the site of the nuclear power plant after termination of a license and until such materials are removed from the site for permanent storage.

      (3) The State Department of Energy and the operators of nuclear-fueled thermal plants shall pursue agreements with the United States Department of Energy and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to fulfill the provisions of this section. [1985 c.434 §2; 1991 c.480 §11; 1993 c.569 §28; 1995 c.505 §24; 2001 c.134 §12]

 

      469.595 Condition to site certificate for nuclear-fueled thermal power plant. Before issuing a site certificate for a nuclear-fueled thermal power plant, the Energy Facility Siting Council must find that an adequate repository for the disposal of the high-level radioactive waste produced by the plant has been licensed to operate by the appropriate agency of the federal government. The repository must provide for the terminal disposition of such waste, with or without provision for retrieval for reprocessing. [1981 c.1 §3]

 

      469.597 Election procedure; elector approval required. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 469.370, if the Energy Facility Siting Council finds that the requirements of ORS 469.595 have been satisfied and proposes to issue a site certificate for a nuclear-fueled thermal power plant, the proposal shall be submitted to the electors of this state for their approval or rejection at the next available statewide general election. The procedures for submitting a proposal to the electors under this section shall conform, as nearly as possible to those for state measures, including but not limited to procedures for printing related material in the voters’ pamphlet.

      (2) A site certificate for a nuclear-fueled thermal power plant shall not be issued until the electors of this state have approved the issuance of the certificate at an election held pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. [1981 c.1 §§4,5]

 

      469.599 Public Utility Commission’s duty. The Public Utility Commission shall not authorize the issuance of stocks, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness to finance any nuclear-fueled thermal power plant pursuant to ORS 757.400 to 757.460 until the Energy Facility Siting Council has made the finding required under ORS 469.595.

NORTHWEST INTERSTATE COMPACT ON LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT

 

      469.930 Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management. The Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management is enacted into law by the State of Oregon and entered into with all other jurisdictions lawfully joining therein in a form as provided for as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

 

ARTICLE I

Policy and Purpose

      The party states recognize that low-level radioactive wastes are generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the states. It is further recognized that the protection of the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states in minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of such wastes and through the cooperation of the states in providing facilities that serve the region. It is the policy of the party states to undertake the necessary cooperation to protect the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and to provide for the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort among the party states so that the protection of the citizens of the states and the maintenance of the viability of the states’ economies will be enhanced while sharing the responsibilities of radioactive low-level waste management.

ARTICLE II

Definitions

      As used in this compact:

      (1) “Facility” means any site, location, structure or property used or to be used for the storage, treatment or disposal of low-level waste, excluding federal waste facilities.

      (2) “Low-level waste” means waste material which contains radioactive nuclides emitting primarily beta or gamma radiation, or both, in concentrations or quantities which exceed applicable federal or state standards for unrestricted release. Low-level waste does not include waste containing more than 10 nanocuries of transuranic contaminants per gram of material, nor spent reactor fuel, nor material classified as either high-level waste or waste which is unsuited for disposal by near-surface burial under any applicable federal regulations.

      (3) “Generator” means any person, partnership, association, corporation or any other entity whatsoever which, as a part of its activities, produces low-level radioactive waste.

      (4) “Host state” means a state in which a facility is located.

ARTICLE III

Regulatory Practices

      Each party state hereby agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state. Such practices shall include:

      (1) Maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state.

      (2) Periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities thereon.

      (3) Authorization of the containers in which such waste may be shipped and a requirement that generators use only that type of container authorized by the state.

      (4) Assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities and appropriate enforcement action is taken for violations.

      (5) After receiving notification from a host state that a generator within the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation standards, the party state will take appropriate action to assure that such violations do not recur. Such action may include inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by that generator.

      (6) Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this Article. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit any party state’s authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this Article.

ARTICLE IV

Regional Facilities

      (1) Facilities located in any party state, other than facilities established or maintained by individual low-level waste generators for the management of their own low-level waste, shall accept low-level waste generated in any party state if such waste has been packaged and transported according to applicable laws and regulations.

      (2) No facility located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of the region comprised of the party states, except as provided in Article V.

      (3) Until such time as paragraph (2) of this Article takes effect as provided in Article VI, facilities located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of any of the party states only if such waste is accompanied by a certificate of compliance issued by an official of the state in which such waste shipment originated. Such certificate shall be in such form as may be required by the host state and shall contain at least the following:

      (a) The generator’s name and address;

      (b) A description of the contents of the low-level waste container;

      (c) A statement that the low-level waste being shipped has been inspected by the official who issued the certificate or by an agent of the official or by a representative of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and found to have been packaged in compliance with applicable federal regulations and such additional requirements as may be imposed by the host state; and

      (d) A binding agreement by the state of origin to reimburse any party state for any liability or expense incurred as a result of an accidental release of such waste, during shipment or after such waste reaches the facility.

      (4) Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of any one party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis. Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in the region will be reached through a good faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received.

      (5) The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management. Therefore, in consideration of the State of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as such action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states.

      (6) Any host state may establish a schedule of fees and requirements related to its facility to assure that closure, perpetual care, and maintenance and contingency requirements are met, including adequate bonding.

ARTICLE V

Northwest Low-Level

Waste Compact Committee

      The governor of each party state shall designate one official of that state as the person responsible for administration of this compact. The officials so designated shall together comprise the Northwest low-level waste compact committee. The committee shall meet as required to consider matters arising under this compact. The parties shall inform the committee of existing regulations concerning low-level waste management in their states and shall afford all parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any proposed modifications in such regulations. Notwithstanding any provision of Article IV to the contrary, the committee may enter into arrangements with states, provinces, individual generators or regional compact entities outside the region comprised of the party states for access to facilities on such terms and conditions as the committee may deem appropriate. However, it shall require a two-thirds vote of all such members, including the affirmative vote of the member of any party state in which a facility affected by such arrangement is located, for the committee to enter into such arrangement.

ARTICLE VI

Eligible Parties and Effective Date

      (1) Each of the following states is eligible to become a party to this compact: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. As to any eligible party, this compact shall become effective upon enactment into law by that party, but it shall not become initially effective until enacted into law by two states. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing its approval.

      (2) After the compact has initially taken effect pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article any eligible party state may become a party to this compact by the execution of an executive order by the governor of the state. Any state which becomes a party in this manner shall cease to be a party upon the final adjournment of the next general or regular session of its legislature or July 1, 1983, whichever occurs first, unless the compact has by then been enacted as a statute by that state.

      (3) Paragraph (2) of Article IV of this compact shall take effect on July 1, 1983, if consent is given by Congress. As provided in Public Law 96-573, Congress may withdraw its consent to the compact after every five-year period.

ARTICLE VII

Severability

      If any provision of this compact, or its application to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, all other provisions of this compact, and the application of all of its provisions to all other persons and circumstances, shall remain valid; and to this end the provisions of this compact are severable.
