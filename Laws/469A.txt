     (5) An implementation plan filed under this section may include procedures that will be used by the electric company to determine whether the costs of constructing a facility that generates electricity from a renewable energy source, or the costs of acquiring bundled or unbundled renewable energy certificates, are consistent with the renewable portfolio standards of the commission relating to least-cost, least-risk planning for acquisition of resources. [2007 c.301 §11; 2016 c.28 §6]

 

COST LIMITATION

 

     469A.100 Limits on cost of compliance with renewable portfolio standard. (1) Electric utilities are not required to comply with a renewable portfolio standard during a compliance year to the extent that the incremental cost of compliance, the cost of unbundled renewable energy certificates and the cost of alternative compliance payments under ORS 469A.180 exceeds four percent of the electric utility’s annual revenue requirement for the compliance year.

     (2) For each electric company, the Public Utility Commission shall establish the annual revenue requirement for a compliance year no later than January 1 of the compliance year. For each consumer-owned utility, the governing body of the consumer-owned utility shall establish the annual revenue requirement for a compliance year.

     (3) The annual revenue requirement for an electric utility shall be calculated based only on the operations of the electric utility relating to electricity. The annual revenue requirement does not include any amount expended by the electric utility for energy efficiency programs for customers of the electric utility or for low income energy assistance, the incremental cost of compliance with a renewable portfolio standard, the cost of unbundled renewable energy certificates or the cost of alternative compliance payments under ORS 469A.180. The annual revenue requirement does include:

     (a) The operating expenses of the electric utility during the compliance year, including depreciation and taxes; and

     (b) For electric companies, an amount equal to the total rate base of the electric company for the compliance year multiplied by the rate of return established by the commission for debt and equity of the electric company.

     (4) For the purposes of this section, the incremental cost of compliance with a renewable portfolio standard is the difference between the levelized annual delivered cost of the qualifying electricity and the levelized annual delivered cost of an equivalent amount of reasonably available electricity that is not qualifying electricity. For the purpose of this subsection, the commission or the governing body of a consumer-owned utility shall use the net present value of delivered cost, including:

     (a) Capital, operating and maintenance costs of generating facilities;

     (b) Financing costs attributable to capital, operating and maintenance expenditures for generating facilities;

     (c) Transmission and substation costs;

     (d) Load following and ancillary services costs; and

     (e) Costs associated with using other assets, physical or financial, to integrate, firm or shape renewable energy sources on a firm annual basis to meet retail electricity needs.

     (5) For the purposes of this section, the governing body of a consumer-owned utility may include in the incremental cost of compliance with a renewable portfolio standard all expenses associated with research, development and demonstration projects related to the generation of qualifying electricity by the consumer-owned utility.

     (6) The commission shall establish limits on the incremental cost of compliance with the renewable portfolio standard for electricity service suppliers under ORS 469A.065 that are the equivalent of the cost limits applicable to the electric companies that serve the territories in which the electricity service supplier sells electricity to retail electricity consumers. If an electricity service supplier sells electricity in territories served by more than one electric company, the commission may provide for an aggregate cost limit based on the amount of electricity sold by the electricity service supplier in each territory. Pursuant to ORS 757.676, a consumer-owned utility may establish limits on the cost of compliance with the renewable portfolio standard for electricity service suppliers that sell electricity in the territory served by the consumer-owned utility. [2007 c.301 §12; 2016 c.28 §25]

     469A.180 Electric companies; electricity service suppliers. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall establish an alternative compliance rate for each compliance year for each electric company or electricity service supplier that is subject to a renewable portfolio standard. The rate shall be expressed in dollars per megawatt-hour.

     (2) The commission shall establish an alternative compliance rate based on the cost of qualifying electricity, contracts that the electric company or electricity service supplier has acquired for future delivery of qualifying electricity and the number of unbundled renewable energy certificates that the company or supplier anticipates using in the compliance year to meet the renewable portfolio standard applicable to the company or supplier. The commission shall also consider any determinations made under ORS 469A.170 in reviewing the compliance report made by the electric company or electricity service supplier for the previous compliance year. In establishing an alternative compliance rate, the commission shall set the rate to provide adequate incentive for the electric company or electricity service supplier to purchase or generate qualifying electricity in lieu of using alternative compliance payments to meet the renewable portfolio standard applicable to the company or supplier.

     (3) An electric company or electricity service supplier may elect to use, or may be required by the commission to use, alternative compliance payments to comply with the renewable portfolio standard applicable to the company or supplier. Any election by an electric company or electricity service supplier to use alternative compliance payments is subject to review by the commission under ORS 469A.170. An electric company or electricity service supplier may not be required to make alternative compliance payments that would result in the company or supplier exceeding the cost limitation established under ORS 469A.100.

     (4) The commission shall determine for each electric company the extent to which alternative compliance payments may be recovered in the rates of the company. Each electric company shall deposit any amounts recovered in the rates of the company for alternative compliance payments in a holding account established by the company. Amounts in the holding account shall accrue interest at the rate of return authorized by the commission for the electric company.

     (5) Amounts in holding accounts established under subsection (4) of this section may be expended by an electric company only for costs of acquiring new generating capacity from renewable energy sources, investments in efficiency upgrades to electricity generating facilities owned by the company and energy conservation programs within the company’s service area. The commission must approve expenditures by an electric company from a holding account established under subsection (4) of this section. Amounts that are collected from customers and spent by an electric company under this subsection may not be included in the company’s rate base.

     (6) The commission shall require electricity service suppliers to establish holding accounts and make payments to those accounts on a substantially similar basis as provided for electric companies. The commission must approve expenditures by an electricity service supplier from a holding account established under this subsection. The commission may approve expenditures only for energy conservation programs for customers of the electricity service supplier. [2007 c.301 §20]

 

     469A.185 Consumer-owned utilities. The governing body of a consumer-owned utility shall establish an alternative compliance rate for the utility. To the extent possible, the alternative compliance rate shall be determined by the governing body of the consumer-owned utility in a manner similar to that used by the Public Utility Commission in establishing alternative compliance rates under ORS 469A.180. Amounts collected as alternative compliance payments by a consumer-owned utility may be used for the purposes specified in ORS 469A.180 (5) and for the purpose of paying expenses associated with research, development and demonstration projects related to the generation of qualifying electricity by the utility. [2007 c.301 §21]

 

PENALTY
