The distillery retail outlet agent must sell the distilled liquor at the retail price set by the commission for the month of sale.

      (3) In addition to the information required by ORS 471.311 for licenses, an applicant for a wine self-distribution permit shall provide the commission with a copy of the license held by the applicant or with sufficient information to allow verification of the license by electronic means or other means acceptable to the commission. The applicant also shall provide the commission with any information required by the commission to establish that the license held by the applicant authorizes the manufacture of wine or cider.

      (4) A person holding a wine self-distribution permit is responsible for paying all taxes imposed under ORS chapter 473, and for complying with all reporting requirements imposed by ORS chapter 473, for all wine and cider sold and transported to retail licensees in this state. The commission may revoke, or refuse to issue, a wine self-distribution permit if the holder of a permit fails to pay taxes or make reports as required by ORS chapter 473.

      (5) A retail licensee may receive wine or cider from the holder of a wine self-distribution permit only if the licensee has received prior authorization from the commission. Prior authorization under this subsection must be made by an endorsement to the license for the premises where the wine or cider will be received. The commission may not charge or collect a fee for an endorsement under this subsection.

      (6)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a retail licensee that receives wine or cider from holders of wine self-distribution permits must make a monthly report to the commission, using a form prescribed by the commission, listing the amount of all wine or cider received from permit holders in the previous month, and the names of the permit holders from whom the wine or cider was received.

      (7) A manufacturer that is not licensed by the commission may sell and transport wine or cider directly to a retail licensee, and a retail licensee may receive wine or cider directly from a manufacturer that is not licensed by the commission, only if the manufacturer holds a wine self-distribution permit issued under this section.

      (8) The holder of a wine self-distribution permit consents to the jurisdiction of the commission and the courts of this state for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, ORS chapter 473 and any related laws or rules.

      (9) The holder of a wine self-distribution permit must post a bond or other security, as described in ORS 471.155.

      (2) The holder of a direct shipper permit that is a licensee of another state may deliver malt beverages under the permit only if that other state makes direct shipper permits, or the equivalent, available for the delivery of malt beverages by persons holding a license issued by the commission authorizing the manufacture or retail sale of malt beverages.

      (3)(a) A person may apply for a direct shipper permit by filing an application with the commission. The application must be made in such form as may be prescribed by the commission.

      (b) If the application is based on a license issued by this state, the person must include in the application the number of the license issued to the person.

      (c) If the application is based on a license issued by another state, the person must include in the application a true copy of the license issued to the person by the other state or include sufficient information to allow verification of the license by electronic means or other means acceptable to the commission.

      (d) If the application is based on a license issued by another state, or the application is by a nonprofit trade association described in subsection (1)(d) of this section, the person or association must pay a $50 registration fee and maintain a bond or other security described in ORS 471.155 in the minimum amount of $1,000.

      (4) Sales and shipments under a direct shipper permit:

      (a) May be made only to a person who is at least 21 years of age;

      (b) May be made only for personal use and not for the purpose of resale; and

      (c) May not exceed two cases, containing not more than nine liters per case, to any resident per month.

      (5) Sales and shipments under a direct shipper permit must be made directly to a resident of this state in containers that are conspicuously labeled with the words: “CONTAINS ALCOHOL: SIGNATURE OF PERSON AGE 21 YEARS OR OLDER REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY.”

      (6) A person holding a direct shipper permit must take all actions necessary to ensure that a carrier used by the permit holder does not deliver any malt beverages, wine or cider unless the carrier:

      (a) Obtains the signature of the recipient of the malt beverages, wine or cider upon delivery;

      (b) Verifies by inspecting government-issued photo identification that the recipient is at least 21 years of age; and

      (c) Determines that the recipient is not visibly intoxicated at the time of delivery.

      (7)(a) A person holding a direct shipper permit must report to the commission on a quarterly basis all shipments of malt beverages, wine or cider made to Oregon residents under the permit. The report must be made in a form prescribed by the commission.

      (c) A person holding a direct shipper permit consents to the jurisdiction of the commission and the courts of this state for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this section and any related laws or rules.

      (8)(a) A person holding a direct shipper permit must timely pay to the commission all taxes imposed under ORS chapter 473 on malt beverages, wine and cider sold and shipped under the permit. For the purpose of the privilege tax imposed under ORS chapter 473, all malt beverages, wine or cider sold and shipped pursuant to a direct shipper permit is sold in this state.

      (b) A person holding a direct shipper permit based on a license issued by another state must timely pay to the commission all taxes imposed under ORS chapter 473 on all malt beverages, wine or cider sold and shipped directly to Oregon residents under the permit. The permit holder, not the purchaser, is responsible for the tax.

      (9) A direct shipper permit must be renewed annually. If the person holds the permit based on an annual license issued by another state, the person may renew the permit by paying a $50 renewal fee and providing the commission with a true copy of a current license issued to the person by the other state or with sufficient information to allow verification of the license by electronic means or other means acceptable to the commission. If the person holds the permit based on an annual license issued by this state, the person may renew the permit at the same time that the person renews the license.

      (10) The commission may refuse to issue or may suspend or revoke a direct shipper permit if the permit holder fails to comply with the provisions of this section. A person may sell and ship malt beverages, wine or cider under a direct shipper permit only for as long as the person has the license issued by this state or another state that authorizes the person to hold a direct shipper permit. A direct shipper permit does not authorize the shipment of malt beverages by a permit holder described in subsection (1)(b) of this section or lacking authority as provided under subsection (2) of this section.

      (11) Any person who knowingly or negligently delivers malt beverages, wine or cider under the provisions of this section to a person under 21 years of age, or who knowingly or negligently delivers malt beverages, wine or cider under the provisions of this section to a visibly intoxicated person, violates ORS 471.410.

(1) Any person desiring a license or renewal of a license under this chapter shall make application to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission upon forms to be furnished by the commission showing the name and address of the applicant, location of the place of business that is to be operated under the license, and such other pertinent information as the commission may require. A license may not be granted or renewed until the applicant has complied with the provisions of this chapter and the rules of the commission.

      (2) The commission may reject any application that is not submitted in the form required by rule. The commission shall give applicants an opportunity to be heard if an application is rejected. A hearing under this subsection is not subject to the requirements for contested case proceedings under ORS chapter 183.

      (3) The commission shall charge an application fee, not to exceed $150, to process an application for the issuance of a new license under this chapter or a license following a change in ownership. The application fee applies only to an application for a class of license having an annual license fee. The application fee is nonrefundable, except that the commission shall refund the fee if the applicant completes, submits and maintains an application and the commission does not, on or before 75 days following receipt of the completed application, propose that the license be granted, granted with conditions or refused. The commission shall adopt rules to:

      (a) Establish application fees by class of license; and

      (b) Define a completed application for purposes of this subsection.

      (4) Subject to subsection (5) of this section, the commission shall assess a nonrefundable fee for processing a renewal application for any license authorized by this chapter only if the renewal application is received by the commission less than 20 days before expiration of the license. If the renewal application is received prior to expiration of the license but less than 20 days prior to expiration, the fee shall be 25 percent of the annual license fee. If a renewal application is received by the commission after expiration of the license but no more than 30 days after expiration, the fee shall be 40 percent of the annual license fee. This subsection does not apply to a certificate of approval, a brewery-public house license or any license that is issued for a period of less than 30 days.

      (5) The commission may waive the fee imposed under subsection (4) of this section if the commission finds that failure to submit a timely application was due to unforeseen circumstances or to a delay in processing the application by the local governing authority that is no fault of the licensee.

      (6) The license fee is nonrefundable and must be paid by each applicant upon the granting or committing of a license. Subject to ORS 471.155 and 473.065, the annual or daily license fee and the minimum bond required of each class of license under this chapter are as follows:

      471.313 Grounds for refusing to issue license or for issuing restricted license. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission may refuse to issue a license, or may issue a restricted license, to any applicant under the provisions of this chapter if the commission has reasonable ground to believe any of the following to be true:

      (1) That there are sufficient licensed premises in the locality set out in the application, or that the granting of a license in the locality set out in the application is not demanded by public interest or convenience. In determining whether there are sufficient licensed premises in the locality, the commission shall consider seasonal fluctuations in the population of the locality and shall ensure that there are adequate licensed premises to serve the needs of the locality during the peak seasons.

      (2) That the applicant has not furnished an acceptable bond as required by ORS 471.311 or is not maintaining the insurance or bond required by ORS 471.168.

      (3) That, except as allowed by ORS 471.392 to 471.400, any applicant to sell at retail for consumption on the premises has been financed or furnished with money or property by, or has any connection with, or is a manufacturer of, or wholesale dealer in, alcoholic liquor.

      (4) That the applicant:

      (a) Is in the habit of using alcoholic beverages, habit-forming drugs or controlled substances to excess.

      (b) Has made false statements to the commission.

      (c) Is incompetent or physically unable to carry on the management of the establishment proposed to be licensed.

      (d) Has been convicted of violating a general or local law of this state or another state, or of violating a federal law, if the conviction is substantially related to the fitness and ability of the applicant to lawfully carry out activities under the license.

      (e) Has maintained an insanitary establishment.

      (f) Is not of good repute and moral character.

      (g) Did not have a good record of compliance with the alcoholic liquor laws of this state and the rules of the commission when previously licensed.

      (5) That there is a history of serious and persistent problems involving disturbances, lewd or unlawful activities or noise either in the premises proposed to be licensed or involving patrons of the establishment in the immediate vicinity of the premises if the activities in the immediate vicinity of the premises are related to the sale or service of alcohol under the exercise of the license privilege. Behavior which is grounds for refusal of a license under this section, where so related to the sale or service of alcohol, includes, but is not limited to obtrusive or excessive noise, music or sound vibrations; public drunkenness; fights; altercations; harassment; unlawful drug sales; alcohol or related litter; trespassing on private property; and public urination. Histories from premises currently or previously operated by the applicant may be considered when reasonable inference may be made that similar activities will occur as to the premises proposed to be licensed. The applicant may overcome the history by showing that the problems are not serious or persistent or that the applicant demonstrates a willingness and ability to control adequately the premises proposed to be licensed and patrons’ behavior in the immediate vicinity of the premises which is related to the licensee’s sale or service of alcohol under the licensee’s exercise of the license privilege. [Formerly 471.295; 2001 c.785 §1; 2011 c.165 §1; 2013 c.149 §1; 2017 c.533 §11]

      (b) That any person licensed to sell at retail for consumption on the premises is acting as an agent of, or is a manufacturer or wholesaler of alcoholic liquors, or has borrowed money or property, or has accepted gratuities or rebates, or has obtained the use of equipment from any manufacturer or wholesaler of alcoholic liquor or any agent thereof.

      (c) That there is a history of serious and persistent problems involving disturbances, lewd or unlawful activities or noise either in the premises or involving patrons of the establishment in the immediate vicinity of the premises if the activities in the immediate vicinity of the premises are related to the sale or service of alcohol under the exercise of the license privilege. Behavior that is grounds for cancellation or suspension of a license under this section, where so related to the sale or service of alcohol, includes but is not limited to obtrusive or excessive noise, music or sound vibrations; public drunkenness; fights; altercations; harassment or unlawful drug sales; alcohol or related litter; trespassing on private property; and public urination. Mitigating factors include a showing by the licensee that the problems are not serious or persistent or that the licensee has demonstrated a willingness and ability to control adequately the licensed premises and patrons’ behavior in the immediate vicinity of the premises which is related to the licensee’s sale or service of alcohol under the licensee’s exercise of the license privilege.

      (d) That there is any other reason that, in the opinion of the commission, based on public convenience or necessity, warrants canceling or suspending such license.

      (2) Civil penalties under this section shall be imposed as provided in ORS 183.745. [Amended by 1953 c.107 §2; 1971 c.159 §4; 1979 c.744 §34; 1981 c.599 §1; 1989 c.785 §3; 1991 c.734 §40; 1995 c.301 §63; 1997 c.841 §6; 1999 c.351 §51; 2011 c.107 §1; 2017 c.533 §12]

      (c) The licensee fails to take immediate and effective action to prevent unlawful drug use or sales on the licensed premises.

      (2) In addition to any suspension imposed under this section, the commission may impose a civil penalty under the circumstances described in subsection (1) of this section not to exceed the maximum amount established under ORS 471.322 (2). Notwithstanding ORS 471.322 (1), the commission shall not allow payment of a civil penalty under this subsection in lieu of the suspension provided for in subsection (1) of this section. A civil penalty under this section shall be imposed in the manner provided by ORS 183.745.

(Sales of Alcoholic Beverages to Minors by Licensees)

 

      471.341 Mandatory clerk training course for employees of off-premises sales licensees; rules; fees; civil penalty. (1) An employee of an off-premises sales licensee who has been found by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to have sold alcoholic beverages to a minor, or to have failed to properly verify identification of a person who purchased alcoholic beverages, must attend a clerk training course approved by the commission as a condition of making sales of alcoholic beverages to members of the public under an off-premises sales license.

      (2) The commission shall by rule establish times for employees to complete a required clerk training course under this section. An employee required to complete a clerk training course under this section may continue to make sales of alcoholic beverages to members of the public until taking such training, but may not make any sales of alcoholic beverages after the expiration of the time allowed by commission rule if the employee has not completed the training before the expiration of that time.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the holder of an off-premises sales license may not allow an employee who has been found by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to have sold alcoholic beverages to a minor, or to have failed to properly verify identification of a person who purchased alcoholic beverages, to sell alcoholic beverages under the license unless the employee completes a clerk training course as required by this section.

      (4) The Oregon Liquor Control Commission, as part of the Alcohol Education Program established under ORS 471.541, shall approve all clerk training courses offered for the purpose of this section. The holder of an off-premises sales license may establish a clerk training course for employees of the licensee, but the course must be approved by the commission to meet the requirements of this section. Clerk training courses approved under this section must address at least the following topics:

      (a) The importance of not selling alcoholic beverages to minors and visibly intoxicated persons.

      (b) Guidelines for recognizing minors and visibly intoxicated persons.

      (c) Guidelines for checking and verifying identification, and for recognizing false or altered identification.

      (d) Recommended approaches for refusing sales of alcoholic beverages to minors and visibly intoxicated persons.

      (5) If an employee of an off-premises sales licensee is found to have sold alcoholic beverages to a minor, or to have failed to properly verify identification of a person who purchased alcoholic beverages, the commission shall notify the licensee that the employee must complete a clerk training course approved under this section and may not sell alcoholic beverages to members of the public after the time established by the commission unless the employee completes the training within the time allowed. If the off-premises sales licensee offers a clerk training course to new employees, and the employee has previously completed that course, the requirements of this section may be met by retaking the clerk training course if the course has been approved by the commission for the purposes of this section.

      (6) Upon completion of a clerk training course by an employee of an off-premises sales licensee pursuant to the requirements of this section, the off-premises sales licensee that employs the person must notify the commission in writing that the employee has successfully completed the training. The notification must include the name and address of the employee, the name of the clerk training course attended by the employee, and the date or dates on which the course was attended. The notification shall be kept by the commission in the licensee’s file.

      (7) The commission shall assess and collect a fee not to exceed $13 from each person required to attend a clerk training course under this section. Amounts collected under this section shall be used for the administrative expenses incurred by the commission in the performance of the commission’s duties under the Alcohol Education Program.

      (8) In addition to any other penalty provided for by law, the commission may impose a civil penalty against any employee of an off-premises sales licensee who sells alcoholic beverages to members of the public and who is prohibited from making those sales under this section. A civil penalty under this subsection may not exceed $500. Civil penalties under this subsection shall be imposed by the commission in the manner provided by ORS 183.745. [1999 c.1062 §§3,9; 2001 c.785 §15]

 

      471.342 Acquisition and use of age verification equipment in lieu of other penalty. Upon finding that a retail licensee, as defined in ORS 471.392, or an employee of a retail licensee has sold alcoholic beverages to a minor, or has failed to properly verify identification of a person who purchased alcoholic beverages, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission may allow the licensee, in lieu of a civil penalty or denial, suspension or cancellation of the license, to acquire and use equipment designed to prevent sales of alcoholic beverages to minors. [1999 c.1062 §5]

 

      471.344 Responsible vendor program; rules. (1) The Oregon Liquor Control Commission shall by rule establish a responsible vendor program. The program shall include a list of positive measures that a licensee must take to avoid sales of alcoholic beverages to minors. Any person holding a liquor license that authorizes the person to sell alcoholic beverages at retail may participate in the program.

      (2) If a licensee participates in the responsible vendor program and takes all measures specified by the program as necessary to prevent sales of alcoholic beverages to minors, the commission may not cancel the license of the licensee, or deny issuance of a license to the licensee, based on sales of alcoholic beverages to minors by employees of the licensee. [1999 c.1062 §7; 2011 c.102 §1]

      471.346 Uniform standards for minor decoy operations; rules. (1) The Oregon Liquor Control Commission shall by rule develop uniform standards for minor decoy operations used to investigate licensees and agents operating stores on behalf of the commission under ORS 471.750 for violations of the laws of this state prohibiting sales of alcoholic beverages to minors. Uniform standards established by the commission under this section apply to all investigations conducted by the commission that use minor decoys. The commission shall encourage all law enforcement agencies of this state to use the uniform standards established under this section for minor decoy operations conducted by the law enforcement agencies.

      (2) To the greatest extent possible, the uniform standards established by the commission under this section:

      (a) Shall be the same for minor decoy operations conducted by the commission and for minor decoy operations conducted by law enforcement agencies of this state; and

      (b) Shall provide for coordination between the commission and law enforcement agencies of this state in conducting minor decoy operations.

      (3) The uniform standards established by the commission under this section shall provide that minor decoy operations must be conducted on either a random or a targeted basis in cities with populations of 20,000 or more. Random minor decoy operations shall cover a range of retail outlets. Targeted minor decoy operations may be conducted for a single licensee or agent, but may be used only if there is a documented compliance problem with the specific licensee or agent that is the target of the operation. For the purpose of implementing standards for random minor decoy operations under this subsection, the commission shall by rule adopt a methodology that produces, to the greatest extent possible, an equal chance that any licensee or agent will be subject to a minor decoy operation.

      (4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the failure of the commission or of a law enforcement agency to follow uniform standards established by the commission under this section is not grounds for challenging any complaint, citation or conviction for violation of the laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors.

      (5) In determining whether to impose sanctions based on multiple violations of the laws of this state prohibiting sales of alcoholic beverages to minors, the commission may not consider any complaint filed against a licensee for selling alcoholic beverages to a minor, citation issued to a licensee for selling alcoholic beverages to a minor or conviction of a licensee for selling alcoholic beverages to a minor if the complaint, citation or conviction arose out of a minor decoy operation that was not conducted pursuant to the uniform standards established by the commission under this section.

      (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commission may not consider any sale of alcoholic beverages to a minor that results from a minor decoy operation that is not conducted in compliance with the standards established under this section for the purpose of imposing any civil penalty against a licensee, making a decision on the renewal, suspension or cancellation of a license issued under this chapter or otherwise sanctioning a licensee for the sale of alcoholic beverages to a minor.

      (7) The commission shall give notice of the uniform standards established under this section to all law enforcement agencies of this state that conduct minor decoy operations. [2001 c.791 §2]

      (a) Within 15 days after notification of the refusal, if the refusal is based on failure to complete the alcohol server education course and examination; or

      (2) The issuance, suspension or revocation of a permit under ORS 471.360 to 471.385 does not relieve a licensee from responsibility for any act of an employee on the licensee’s premises.

      471.473 Liquor store business loss compensation. (1) A person appointed to operate a store established by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission under ORS 471.750 qualifies for the payment of business loss compensation under this section if:

      (a) The system for selling containers of distilled liquor at retail in this state changes after the person assumes operation of the store; and

      (b) The system change results from a law that prohibits the commission from purchasing or selling distilled liquor.

      (2) The purpose of business loss compensation is to offset the actual or presumed sales reduction and actual or perceived devaluation of a liquor store business following a system change described in subsection (1) of this section. The commission shall pay a person qualifying under this section business loss compensation equal to four percent of the average annual gross distilled liquor sales made by the store during the five years that preceded the system change, whether or not the person was the store operator during the entire five-year period. If the store has operated less than five years prior to the system change, the commission shall pay compensation equal to four percent of the average annual gross distilled liquor sales made by the store prior to the system change.

      (3)(a) The commission shall pay any business loss compensation due under this section from the suspense account described in ORS 471.805. Except as otherwise required by federal or state law or by contract, the commission shall give the payment of business loss compensation priority over the payment of other debts from the suspense account.

      (b) Notwithstanding ORS 279A.250 to 279A.290 or the revolving fund balance limit established in ORS 471.805, if a change in the system for selling containers of distilled liquor at retail in this state results in business loss compensation being payable under this section, and the commission declares within five years after the system change that a warehouse established by the commission under ORS 471.750 or the inventory of the commission is surplus property, the net proceeds from sale of the warehouse or inventory remaining after deduction of sales costs shall be deposited to the suspense account described in ORS 471.805. All moneys deposited under this paragraph shall be kept in a subaccount within the suspense account that indicates the source of the moneys. Notwithstanding ORS 471.805, moneys deposited to the suspense account under this paragraph may not be transferred to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission Account if any business loss compensation is owed and remains unpaid. This paragraph does not restrict the source for paying business loss compensation from the suspense account or alter the priority of business loss compensation payment established in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (4) If a person that receives business loss compensation under this section brings any action against the commission for damages resulting from a change in the system for selling containers of distilled liquor at retail in this state, the business loss compensation received by the person as a result of that system change shall be an offset against any damages awarded the person in the action. This subsection does not create any new cause of action.

      (5) Business loss compensation received by a person under this section does not affect the claiming of any tax deduction by the person for depreciation of equipment, fixtures or other property improvements, but is ordinary business income of the person, taxable as provided by law. [2015 c.228 §2]

 

      471.475 Mixing, storing or serving of liquor without license. No person who owns, operates or conducts a private or public club or place and who is not in possession of a license issued by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission permitting the mixing, storing and serving of alcoholic liquor at said premises, and no agent, servant or employee of such person, for a financial consideration by way of a charge for service, membership fee, admission fee, initiation fee, club dues, contributions, or other fee or charge, shall serve or permit to be served, or use or permit to be used, any room, place, bar, glasses, mixers, locker, storage place, chairs, tables, cash registers, music devices, furniture, furnishings, equipment or facilities, for the mixing, storing, serving or drinking of alcoholic liquor.

 

      471.478 Sale of kegs of malt beverages; rules; penalty. On and after January 1, 1978:

      (1) The Oregon Liquor Control Commission by rule shall require the identification of kegs of malt beverages sold directly to consumers who are not licensees of the commission and the signing of a receipt therefor by the purchaser in order to allow the kegs to be traced if the contents are consumed in violation of the Liquor Control Act. The keg identification shall be in the form of a numbered label prescribed and supplied by the commission which identifies the seller and which is removable or obliterated when the keg is processed for refilling. The receipt shall be on a form prescribed and supplied by the commission and shall include the name and address of the purchaser; motor vehicle operator’s license number, if any; the automobile registration of the motor vehicle in which the keg was removed from the seller’s premises, if any; and such other identification as the commission by rule may require. The receipt shall contain a statement that must be signed by the purchaser that, under penalty of false swearing, the purchaser will not allow consumption of any malt beverage in the keg in violation of ORS 471.410. A copy of the receipt shall be given to the purchaser and the seller shall retain the original receipt for such period as the commission by rule may require.

      (2) Possession of a keg containing malt beverages which is not identified as required by subsection (1) of this section is a Class A misdemeanor.

      (3) A person who signs a receipt described in subsection (1) of this section in order to obtain a keg, knowing the receipt to be false, or who falsifies any information required on the receipt, is guilty of false swearing as prescribed by ORS 162.075.

      (4) As used in this section, “keg” means any brewery-sealed, individual container of malt beverage having a liquid capacity of more than seven gallons. [1977 c.551 §2; 1997 c.249 §173]

 

      471.480 Sale of liquor by certain employees 18 years of age or older; minimum age requirements. (1) Any employee 18 years of age or older of a person who holds an off-premises sales license from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission may sell any alcoholic liquor authorized by such license on the licensed premises.

      (2) Any employee 18 years of age or older of a person who holds a wholesale malt beverage and wine license from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission may assist the licensee in the delivery of any alcoholic liquor authorized by such license.

      (3) During any inspection of a licensed premises, the commission may require proof that a person performing work at the premises meets any applicable minimum age requirement created under this chapter or under commission rules. If the person does not provide the commission with acceptable proof of age upon request, the commission may require the person to immediately cease any activity that is subject to a minimum age requirement until the commission receives acceptable proof of age. If the activity is the sole lawful basis for the person to be present on the premises, the commission may require that the person leave the premises. This subsection does not apply to a person temporarily at the premises to make a service, maintenance or repair call, to make a delivery or for other purposes independent of the premises operations.

      (4) If a person performing work that is subject to a minimum age requirement has not provided proof of age requested by the commission under subsection (3) of this section, the commission may request that the licensee or a manager of the premises provide proof that the person meets any applicable minimum age requirement created under this chapter or under commission rules. Failure of the licensee or manager to respond to a request made under this subsection by providing acceptable proof of age for a person is prima facie evidence that the licensee has allowed the person to perform work at the licensed premises in violation of a minimum age requirement. [1971 c.490 §1; 1985 c.378 §2; 1999 c.351 §34; 2011 c.92 §1]

 

      471.482 Sale or service of liquor by employees 18 years of age or older generally; rules; minimum age requirements. (1) The holder of a license issued under this chapter may employ persons 18, 19 and 20 years of age who may take orders for, serve and sell alcoholic liquor in any part of the licensed premises when that activity is incidental to the serving of food except in those areas classified by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission as being prohibited to the use of minors. However, no person who is 18, 19 or 20 years of age shall be permitted to mix, pour or draw alcoholic liquor except when pouring is done as a service to the patron at the patron’s table or drawing is done in a portion of the premises not prohibited to minors.

      (2) A person who is 18, 19 or 20 years of age may enter areas classified by the commission as being prohibited to the use of minors only for the purpose of ordering and picking up alcoholic liquor for service in other parts of the premises. However, the person shall not remain in the areas longer than is necessary to perform those duties.

      (3) The commission by rule may permit access to prohibited areas by any minor for nonalcoholic liquor employment purposes as long as the minor does not remain longer than is necessary to perform the duties.

      (4) During any inspection of a licensed premises, the commission may require proof that a person performing work at the premises meets any applicable minimum age requirement created under this chapter or under commission rules. If the person does not provide the commission with acceptable proof of age upon request, the commission may require the person to immediately cease any activity that is subject to a minimum age requirement until the commission receives acceptable proof of age. If the activity is the sole lawful basis for the person to be present on the premises, the commission may require that the person leave the premises. This subsection does not apply to a person temporarily at the premises to make a service, maintenance or repair call, make a delivery or for other purposes independent of the premises operations.

      (5) If a person performing work that is subject to a minimum age requirement has not provided proof of age requested by the commission under subsection (4) of this section, the commission may request that the licensee or a manager of the premises provide proof that the person meets any applicable minimum age requirement created under this chapter or under commission rules. Failure of the licensee or manager to respond to a request made under this subsection by providing acceptable proof of age for a person is prima facie evidence that the licensee has allowed the person to perform work at the licensed premises in violation of a minimum age requirement. [1981 c.610 §2; 1993 c.128 §2; 1995 c.301 §70; 1999 c.351 §59; 2011 c.92 §2]

 

      471.485 Payment required on or before delivery of liquor. No wholesale licensee or agent or employee thereof shall sell or deliver, nor shall any retail licensee purchase or receive any malt beverages, cider or wine for currency on delivery, but such malt beverages, cider or wine shall be paid for prior to delivery thereof, by electronic fund transfer initiated on or before the date of delivery, or by valid check, order, negotiable instrument or voucher payable on the date of delivery. The wholesale licensee may accept cash at the time of delivery if such acceptance does not create or increase the licensee’s, or the agents’ or employees’ of the licensee, exposure to or risk of being victimized by criminal activity. [1971 c.694 §2; 1995 c.525 §1; 1999 c.351 §74]

 

      471.490 Delivery or acceptance of instrument drawn upon insufficient funds or not payable according to terms; use of credit. No retail licensee shall deliver any check, order, negotiable instrument or voucher in payment for malt beverages, cider or wine, knowing at the time of such delivery that the maker or drawer has not sufficient funds in the bank or depository to pay the instrument on presentation, nor shall any wholesale licensee accept any such instrument knowing that said instrument is not payable according to its terms, or that there are not sufficient funds to pay such instrument on presentation. Any extension or acceptance of credit under this section shall constitute a violation of ORS 471.398. [1971 c.694 §3; 1995 c.301 §85; 1999 c.351 §75]

 

      471.495 Report by wholesaler of instruments not paid on presentment required. Any wholesale licensee who receives a check, order, negotiable instrument or voucher in payment for malt beverages, cider or wine, who receives an instrument from a retail licensee which, upon presentation, is not paid by the party on whom it is drawn, shall report such fact forthwith to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. [1971 c.694 §4; 1999 c.351 §76]

 

      471.500 Application of ORS 471.485 to 471.495. The provisions of ORS 471.485, 471.490 and 471.495 shall not apply to any common carrier licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. [1971 c.694 §5; 1995 c.301 §41]

 

      471.501 Malt beverage container refunds. Nothing in this chapter prevents a brewery licensed under ORS 471.221 or a brewery-public house licensed under ORS 471.200 from establishing a refund value for malt beverage containers under the provisions of ORS 459A.705 that is in excess of five cents, or in excess of 10 cents as described in ORS 459A.705 (2), per container for the purpose of encouraging purchasers to return the containers directly to the brewery or brewery-public house. A refund value in excess of five cents, or in excess of 10 cents as described in ORS 459A.705 (2), per container may be paid under this section only to persons who are not licensed under this chapter and who return the containers directly to the brewery or brewery-public house.

      471.565 Liability for providing or serving alcoholic beverages to intoxicated person; notice of claim. (1) A patron or guest who voluntarily consumes alcoholic beverages served by a person licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, a person holding a permit issued by the commission or a social host does not have a cause of action, based on statute or common law, against the person serving the alcoholic beverages, even though the alcoholic beverages are served to the patron or guest while the patron or guest is visibly intoxicated. The provisions of this subsection apply only to claims for relief based on injury, death or damages caused by intoxication and do not apply to claims for relief based on injury, death or damages caused by negligent or intentional acts other than the service of alcoholic beverages to a visibly intoxicated patron or guest.

      (2) A person licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, person holding a permit issued by the commission or social host is not liable for damages caused by intoxicated patrons or guests unless the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that:

      (a) The licensee, permittee or social host served or provided alcoholic beverages to the patron or guest while the patron or guest was visibly intoxicated; and

      (b) The plaintiff did not substantially contribute to the intoxication of the patron or guest by:

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an action for damages caused by intoxicated patrons or guests off the premises of a person licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, a person holding a permit issued by the commission or a social host may be brought only if the person asserting the claim has given the licensee, permittee or social host the notice required by subsection (5) of this section within the following time periods:

      (a) If a claim is made for damages arising out of wrongful death, notice must be given within one year after the date of death, or within one year after the date that the person asserting the claim discovers or reasonably should have discovered the existence of a claim under this section, whichever is later.

      (b) If a claim is made for damages for injuries other than wrongful death, notice must be given within 180 days after the injury occurs, or within 180 days after the person asserting the claim discovers or reasonably should have discovered the existence of a claim under this section, whichever is later.

      (4) The time provided for the giving of notice under subsection (3) of this section does not include any period during which:

      (a) The claimant is under 18 years of age;

      (b) The claimant is unable to give notice by reason of the injury or by reason of being financially incapable, as defined in ORS 125.005, or is incapacitated, as defined in ORS 125.005; or

      (c) The claimant is unable to determine that the licensee, permittee or social host is liable because the patron or guest who caused the damages asserts a right against self-incrimination and cannot be compelled to reveal the identity of the licensee, permittee or social host, or cannot be compelled to reveal facts that would establish the liability of the licensee, permittee or social host.

      (5) A licensee, permittee or social host shall be considered to have been given notice for the purposes of this section if:

      (a) The licensee, permittee or social host is given formal notice in the manner specified in subsection (6) of this section;

      (b) The licensee, permittee or social host receives actual notice as described in subsection (7) of this section;

      (c) An action is commenced by or on behalf of the claimant within the period of time specified by subsections (3) and (4) of this section; or

      (d) Any payment on the claim is made to the claimant by or on behalf of the licensee, permittee or social host.

      (6) Formal notice of a claim subject to this section must be in writing, must be mailed to the licensee, permittee or social host, or personally served on the licensee, permittee or social host, and must contain all of the following:

      (a) A statement that a claim for damages is made against the licensee, permittee or social host.

      (b) A description of the time, place and circumstances giving rise to the claim, so far as known to the claimant.

      (c) The name of the claimant and mailing address for the claimant to which correspondence regarding the claim may be mailed.

      (7) For the purposes of this section, “actual notice” means any communication to a licensee, permittee or social host that gives the licensee, permittee or social host actual knowledge of the time, place and circumstances of the claim, if the communication is such that a reasonable person would conclude that a particular person intends to assert a claim against the licensee, permittee or social host.

Such officials shall notify the commission of any acts, practices or other conduct of any such licensee which may be subversive of the general welfare or contrary to the spirit of the Liquor Control Act and shall recommend such action on the part of the commission as will remove the evil.

 

      471.620 Property and places as common nuisances. Any room, house, building, boat, structure or place of any kind where alcoholic liquor is sold, manufactured, bartered or given away in violation of the law, or where persons are permitted to resort for the purpose of drinking alcoholic beverages in violation of the law, or any place where such beverages are kept for sale, barter or gift in violation of the law, and all liquor or property subject to confiscation under ORS 471.610 kept and used in such place is a common nuisance.

The Attorney General, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission or its administrators, or the district attorney of the county wherein a nuisance as defined in ORS 471.620 exists, or where it has existed but has temporarily ceased and there is good and sufficient cause to believe that it will be maintained in the future, may institute an action in the circuit court for such county in the name of the state to abate, and to temporarily and permanently enjoin, such nuisance. The court has the right to make temporary and final orders as in other injunction proceedings. The plaintiff shall not be required to give bond in such action. [Amended by 1979 c.284 §155]

 

      471.635 Issuance of restraining order. (1) After a suit is commenced under ORS 471.630, application for a temporary injunction may be made to the court, which shall grant a hearing thereon within 10 days.

The officer serving the order may enter such place and forthwith shall make and return to the court an inventory of the personal property and contents situated in and used in conducting or maintaining such nuisance. Any violation, of the order or mutilation or removal of the order so posted shall be a contempt of court, if the posted order contains a notice to that effect.

 

      471.645 Temporary injunction. If a temporary injunction is granted, the court may issue further restraining orders as described in ORS 471.635; and forthwith may issue an order closing such place against its use for any purpose until the final decision, or the court may allow such place to be occupied or used during the pendency of the injunction proceedings by requiring the defendants to furnish an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 or a bond with sufficient surety, to be approved by the court, in the penal sum of not less than $2,500, payable to the state. The bond or letter of credit shall be conditioned that alcoholic liquor will not be manufactured, possessed, sold, served, bartered, or given away, or furnished, or otherwise disposed of thereon or therein, or kept thereon or therein with the intent to sell, barter, serve, or give away, or otherwise dispose of alcoholic liquor contrary to law, and that the defendants will pay all fines, costs and damages assessed against them for any violation of such conditions.

If any condition of the bond or letter of credit is violated, the whole amount may be recovered as a penalty for the use of the county wherein the premises are situated. In any such suit process to nonresident defendants may be served by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county having jurisdiction of the injunction proceedings. Notice shall be published once each week for two consecutive weeks or for such time as the court, by order, may prescribe. [Amended by 1991 c.331 §70; 2003 c.576 §462]

 

      471.655 Owner may defend; evidence concerning nuisance. (1) The owner of any property closed or restrained, or to be closed or restrained, may appear at any time between the filing of the complaint and the trial and show cause why the court should cancel or refrain from issuing any judgment orders as against the owner. In order to obtain such relief, the owner must prove to the satisfaction of the court that the owner is the lawful owner of the property and, further, that with reasonable care and diligence the owner could not have known of the illegal use of the owner’s property.

      (2) Evidence of the general reputation of the premises upon which a nuisance is alleged to exist is admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving the existence of the nuisance, and of knowledge of, and of acquiescence and participation therein, on the part of persons charged with maintaining or assisting in the maintenance of a nuisance. [Amended by 2003 c.576 §463]

 

      471.657 Confiscation and forfeiture for violation of ORS 471.475. Upon conviction for violation of ORS 471.475, the premises upon which the violation has occurred shall be declared to be a common nuisance and subject to abatement proceedings as provided by ORS 471.605 to 471.655. Any person who knowingly suffers or permits such nuisance to exist or be kept or maintained in a private or public club or place of which the person is the owner, manager or lessor, may be a party defendant to such abatement proceedings. In any such case, upon conviction, all alcoholic liquor, whether purchased or acquired from any other source, and all property, including bars, glasses, mixers, lockers, chairs, tables, cash registers, music devices, gambling devices, and all facilities for the mixing, storing, serving or drinking of alcoholic liquor shall be declared to be a common nuisance and shall be subject to confiscation and forfeiture as provided for by ORS 471.610. No claim of ownership or of any right, title, or interest in or to any of the personal property enumerated in this section or ORS 471.475 shall be held valid unless claimant shows to the satisfaction of the court that claimant is in good faith the owner of the claim and had no knowledge that the personal property was used in violation of ORS 471.475.

      (3) If the person arrested is the owner of the vehicle or conveyance seized, it shall be returned to the owner upon execution by the owner of a good and valid bond, with sufficient sureties in a sum double the value of the property, approved by the court and conditioned to return the property to the custody of the sheriff at a time to be specified by the court.

      (4) If the person arrested is not the owner of the vehicle or conveyance seized, the sheriff shall make reasonable effort to determine the name and address of the owner.

      (6) The movant shall serve a copy of the motion upon the district attorney of the county in which the vehicle or conveyance is in custody. The court shall order the vehicle or conveyance returned to the movant, unless the court is satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that the movant knowingly consented to the unlawful use that resulted in the seizure. If the court does not order the return of the vehicle or conveyance, the movant shall obtain the return only as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

      (7) If the court orders the return of the vehicle or conveyance to the movant, the movant shall not be liable for any towing or storage costs incurred as a result of the seizure.

      (8) If the court does not order the return of the vehicle or conveyance under subsection (6) of this section, and the arrested person is convicted for any offense in connection with the seizure, the vehicle or conveyance shall be subject to forfeiture as provided in ORS 471.666. [Amended by 1973 c.836 §351; 1981 c.601 §2]

 

      471.665 [Amended by 1971 c.743 §374a; 1973 c.836 §352; 1977 c.745 §40; 1993 c.741 §66; repealed by 1997 c.592 §6 (471.666 enacted in lieu of 471.665)]

 

      471.666 Disposal of seized liquor and of vehicle or other conveyance. (1) The court, upon conviction of the person arrested under ORS 471.660, shall order the alcoholic liquor delivered to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, and shall, subject to the ownership rights of innocent third parties, order a sale at public auction by the sheriff of the county of the property seized. The sheriff, after deducting the expense of keeping the property and the cost of sale, shall pay all the liens, according to their priorities, which are established by intervention or otherwise at such hearing or in other proceedings brought for that purpose, and shall pay the balance of the proceeds into the general fund of the county. No claim of ownership or of any right, title or interest in or to such vehicle that is otherwise valid shall be held invalid unless the state shows to the satisfaction of the court, by clear and convincing evidence, that the claimant had knowledge that the vehicle was used or to be used in violation of law. All liens against property sold under this section shall be transferred from the property to the proceeds of the sale.

      (2) If no person claims the vehicle or conveyance, the taking of the same and the description thereof shall be advertised in some daily newspaper published in the city or county where taken, or if no daily newspaper is published in such city or county, in a newspaper having weekly circulation in the city or county, once a week for two weeks and by handbills posted in three public places near the place of seizure, and shall likewise notify by mail the legal owner, in the case of an automobile, if licensed by the State of Oregon, as shown by the name and address in the vehicle registration records of the Department of Transportation. If no claimant appears within 10 days after the last publication of the advertisement, the property shall be sold and the proceeds, after deducting the expenses and costs, shall be paid into the general fund of the county.

      471.680 Allegation and proof in prosecutions. In any prosecution for the sale of alcoholic liquor it is not necessary to prove the exact variety, or to mention the quantity of alcoholic liquor sold, except in the case where the variety or quantity is essential to establish the offense. As regards quantity it is sufficient to allege the sale of a quantity, the sale of which quantity is unlawful.

      (3) If the amount of revenues received from the taxes imposed by ORS 473.030 for the preceding month was reduced as a result of credits claimed under ORS 473.047, the commission shall compute the difference between the amounts paid or transferred as described in subsections (1)(b), (c) and (d) and (2) of this section and the amounts that would have been paid or transferred under subsections (1)(b), (c) and (d) and (2) of this section if no credits had been claimed.
