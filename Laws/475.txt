      (d) Past experience in the manufacture, delivery or dispensing of controlled substances and the existence in the applicant’s establishment of effective controls against diversion;

      (e) Furnishing by the applicant of false or fraudulent material in any application filed under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980;

      (f) Suspension or revocation of the applicant’s federal registration to manufacture, deliver or dispense controlled substances as authorized by federal law; or

      (g) Any other factors relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.

      (2) Registration under subsection (1) of this section does not entitle a registrant to manufacture, deliver or dispense controlled substances in Schedule I or II other than those specified in the registration.

      (3) Practitioners must be registered to conduct research with controlled substances in Schedules I through V if they are authorized to conduct research under the law of this state. The board need not require separate registration under ORS 475.095 and 475.125 to 475.185 for practitioners engaging in research with controlled substances in Schedules I through V where the registrant is already registered under ORS 475.095 and 475.125 to 475.185 in another capacity. Persons with valid registration from the Drug Enforcement Administration for research on controlled substances may conduct research within this state in compliance with other state law upon furnishing the board evidence of that federal registration, and are exempt from state prosecution for possession and distribution of controlled substances to the extent of the registration. Registration under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 does not exempt the registrant from compliance with any other relevant law of this state or the United States, unless such exemption is expressly provided under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980.

      (4) Notwithstanding this section, the manufacture, delivery or dispensing of any controlled substance excluded from any medical use by federal law is prohibited, except:

      (a) For research authorized under subsection (3) of this section and ORS 475.225; or

      (b) As otherwise provided by state or federal law.

      (5) Compliance by manufacturers and distributors with the provisions of the federal law respecting registration, excluding fees, entitles them to be registered under ORS 475.095 and 475.125 to 475.185. [1977 c.745 §9; 1979 c.777 §53; 1981 c.666 §5; 1995 c.440 §25; 2011 c.524 §24]

 

      475.140 [Repealed by 1957 c.587 §12]

 

      475.145 Revocation and suspension of registration. (1) A registration under ORS 475.135 to manufacture, deliver or dispense a controlled substance may be suspended or revoked by the State Board of Pharmacy upon a finding that:

      (a) The registrant has furnished false or fraudulent material information in any application filed under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980;

      (b) The registrant has been convicted of a felony under any state or federal law relating to any controlled substance;

      (c) The registrant has had the federal registration suspended or revoked to manufacture, deliver or dispense controlled substances;

      (d) The registrant has violated any rule of the board under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980;

      (e) The registrant has failed to maintain proper records or has failed to follow proper refill procedures; or

      (f) Continuance of registration would be inconsistent with the public interest under any factor stated in ORS 475.135.

      (2) The board may limit revocation or suspension of a registration to the particular controlled substance with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.

      (3) If the board suspends or revokes a registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at the time of suspension or the effective date of the revocation order may be placed under seal. No disposition may be made of substances under seal until the time for taking an appeal has elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded unless a court, upon application therefor, orders the sale of perishable substances and the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with the court. Upon a revocation order becoming final, all controlled substances may be forfeited to the state.

      (4) The board shall promptly notify the administration of all orders suspending or revoking registration and all forfeitures of controlled substances. [1977 c.745 §10; 1981 c.666 §6; 1995 c.440 §26]

 

      475.150 [Amended by 1959 c.411 §1; 1971 c.418 §14; repealed by 1977 c.745 §54]

 

      475.155 Order to show cause. (1) Before denying, suspending or revoking a registration, or refusing a renewal of registration, the State Board of Pharmacy shall serve upon the applicant or registrant an order to show cause why registration should not be denied, revoked or suspended, or why the renewal should not be refused. The order to show cause shall contain a statement of the basis therefor and shall call upon the applicant or registrant to appear before the board at a time and place not less than 30 days after the date of service of the order. These proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with ORS chapter 183 without regard to any criminal prosecution or other proceeding. Proceedings to refuse renewal of registration shall not abate the existing registration which shall remain in effect pending the outcome of the administrative hearing.

      (2) The board may suspend, without an order to show cause, any registration simultaneously with the institution of proceedings under ORS 475.145 or where renewal of registration is refused, if it finds that there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety which warrants this action. The suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of the proceedings, including judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the board or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. [1977 c.745 §11]

 

      475.160 [Repealed by 1977 c.745 §54]

 

      475.165 Records of registrants. Persons registered to manufacture, deliver or dispense controlled substances under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 shall keep records and maintain inventories in conformance with the recordkeeping and inventory requirements of federal law and with any additional rules the State Board of Pharmacy issues. [1977 c.745 §12; 1995 c.440 §27]

 

(Records)

 

      475.175 When order forms required. Controlled substances in Schedules I and II shall be distributed by a registrant to another registrant only pursuant to an order form.

Additional quantities of the controlled substances listed in Schedule III or IV may be authorized by a practitioner only through issuance of a new prescription.

      (3) Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner to an ultimate user, a controlled substance included in Schedule V that is a prescription drug may not be dispensed without a written, oral or electronically transmitted prescription of a practitioner. The prescription may not be filled or refilled more than six months after the date on which it was issued and a prescription authorized to be refilled may not be refilled more than five times. Additional quantities of the controlled substances listed in Schedule V may be authorized by a practitioner only through issuance of a new prescription.

      (4) A controlled substance may not be delivered or dispensed other than for a medical purpose.

      (5) Except in good faith and in the course of professional practice only, a practitioner or a pharmacist may not dispense controlled substances.

      (6) Any oral or electronically transmitted prescription authorized by statute or rule must be stored by electronic means or reduced promptly to writing and filed by the pharmacy.

      (7) Issuance, preparation, labeling, dispensing, recordkeeping and filing of prescriptions or medication orders must be in conformance with the requirements of the federal law and rules of the board.

      (c) Specify the prescribing practitioner’s telephone number for verbal confirmation, the time and date of transmission, the identity of the pharmacy intended to receive the transmission and all other information required for a prescription by federal or state law; and

      (d) Be traceable to the prescribing practitioner by an electronic signature or other secure method of validation.

      (3) An electronic transmission of a prescription drug order shall be stored by electronic means or reduced promptly to writing, filed by the pharmacy and retained in conformity with the requirements of ORS 475.165.

      (4) The dispensing pharmacist shall exercise professional judgment regarding the accuracy, validity and authenticity of an electronically transmitted prescription drug order.

      (7) A pharmacist, pharmacy or pharmacy department shall not provide any electronic equipment or apparatus to a practitioner or health care facility for the purpose of providing an incentive to the practitioner or health care facility to refer patients to a particular pharmacy or pharmacy department.

      (8) There shall be no additional charge to the patient because the prescription drug order was electronically transmitted.

      (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the electronic transmission of a prescription drug order when a written prescription is required under ORS 127.815, 137.473, 169.750 or 453.025. [2001 c.623 §2; 2003 c.102 §1; 2014 c.55 §2]

 

      Note: 475.188 was added to and made a part of 475.005 to 475.285 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      475.190 Exception to prescription requirement; rules. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 475.185, upon registration with the State Board of Pharmacy, a humane society or animal control agency may purchase, possess and, subject to subsection (4) of this section, administer sodium pentobarbital and sedative and analgesic medications to euthanize injured, sick, homeless or unwanted domestic pets and other animals.

      (2) The State Board of Pharmacy, after consultation with the Oregon State Veterinary Medical Examining Board, shall adopt rules according to ORS 183.325 to 183.410 establishing requirements for registration, renewal of registration and revocation or suspension of registration under subsection (1) of this section. Those rules shall include a provision that the State Board of Pharmacy will suspend or revoke the registration of any humane society or animal control agency that allows a person who is not certified under subsection (4) of this section to administer sodium pentobarbital and sedative and analgesic medications.

      (3) Any person who is registered under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 to deliver or dispense controlled substances may deliver or dispense sodium pentobarbital and sedative and analgesic medications to a humane society or animal control agency registered under subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

      (4) The Oregon State Veterinary Medical Examining Board, after consultation with the State Board of Pharmacy, shall adopt rules establishing requirements for certification of persons to administer sodium pentobarbital and sedative and analgesic medications.

A person may not administer sodium pentobarbital or sedative or analgesic medications unless the person is certified by the Oregon State Veterinary Medical Examining Board. [1983 c.342 §2; 1995 c.440 §28; 2019 c.126 §1]

 

      475.205 [1977 c.745 §24; repealed by 1981 c.666 §11]

 

(Miscellaneous)

 

      475.215 Cooperative arrangements. The State Board of Pharmacy shall cooperate with federal and other state agencies in discharging its responsibilities concerning traffic in controlled substances and in suppressing the abuse of controlled substances. To this end, it may:

      (1) Arrange for the exchange of information among governmental officials concerning the use and abuse of controlled substances; and

      (2) Cooperate in training programs concerning controlled substance law enforcement at local and state levels. [1977 c.745 §22]

 

      475.225 Education and research. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall carry out educational programs designed to prevent and deter misuse and abuse of controlled substances. In connection with these programs it may:

      (a) Promote better recognition of the problems of misuse and abuse of controlled substances within the regulated industry and among interested groups and organizations;

      (b) Assist the regulated industry and interested groups and organizations in contributing to the reduction of misuse and abuse of controlled substances;

      (c) Consult with interested groups and organizations to aid them in solving administrative and organizational problems;

      (d) Evaluate procedures, projects, techniques and controls conducted or proposed as part of educational programs on misuse or abuse of controlled substances;

      (e) Disseminate the results of research on misuse and abuse of controlled substances to promote a better public understanding of what problems exist and what can be done to combat them; and

      (f) Assist in the education and training of state and local law enforcement officials in their efforts to control misuse and abuse of controlled substances.

      (2) The authority shall encourage research on the medical use, misuse and abuse of controlled substances. In connection with the research, and in furtherance of the enforcement of ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980, it may:

      (a) Establish methods to assess accurately the physiological, psychological and social effects of controlled substances and identify their medical uses, relative hazard potential, and potential for abuse;

      (b) Make studies and undertake programs of research to:

      (A) Develop new or improved approaches, techniques, systems, equipment and devices to strengthen the enforcement of ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980;

(Enforcement)

 

      475.235 Burden of proof; status of analysis of controlled substance; notice of objection. (1) It is not necessary for the state to negate any exemption or exception in ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 in any complaint, information, indictment or other pleading or in any trial, hearing or other proceeding under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980. The burden of proof of any exemption or exception is upon the person claiming it.

      (2) In the absence of proof that a person is the duly authorized holder of an appropriate registration or order form issued under ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980, the person is presumed not to be the holder of the registration or form. The burden of proof is upon the person to rebut the presumption.

      (3)(a) When a controlled substance is at issue in a criminal proceeding before a grand jury, at a preliminary hearing, in a proceeding on a district attorney’s information or for purposes of an early disposition program, it is prima facie evidence of the identity of the controlled substance if:

      (A) A sample of the controlled substance is tested using a presumptive test for controlled substances;

      (B) The test is conducted by a law enforcement officer trained to use the test or by a forensic scientist; and

      (C) The test is positive for the particular controlled substance.

      (b) When the identity of a controlled substance is established using a presumptive test for purposes of a criminal proceeding before a grand jury, a preliminary hearing, a proceeding on a district attorney’s information or an early disposition program, the defendant, upon notice to the district attorney, may request that the controlled substance be sent to a state police forensic laboratory for analysis.

      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in all prosecutions in which an analysis of a controlled substance or sample was conducted, a certified copy of the analytical report signed by the director of a state police forensic laboratory or the analyst or forensic scientist conducting the analysis shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the results of the analytical findings unless the defendant has provided notice of an objection in accordance with subsection (5) of this section.

      (5) If the defendant intends to object at trial to the admission of a certified copy of an analytical report as provided in subsection (4) of this section, not less than 15 days prior to trial the defendant shall file written notice of the objection with the court and serve a copy on the district attorney.

      (6) As used in this section:

      (a) “Analyst” means a person employed by the Department of State Police to conduct analysis in forensic laboratories established by the department under ORS 181A.150.

      (b) “Presumptive test” includes, but is not limited to, chemical tests using Marquis reagent, Duquenois-Levine reagent, Scott reagent system or modified Chen’s reagent. [1977 c.745 §23; 1989 c.194 §1; 1995 c.440 §6; 1997 c.346 §1; 2001 c.870 §14; 2003 c.538 §1; 2007 c.636 §§1,2; 2009 c.610 §8]

 

      475.245 Conditional discharge. (1)(a) Whenever a person is charged with an offense listed in subsection (5) of this section, the court, with the consent of the district attorney and the person, may defer further proceedings and place the person on probation. The terms of the probation shall be defined by a probation agreement.

      (b) A probation agreement carries the understanding that if the defendant fulfills the terms of the agreement, the criminal charges filed against the defendant will be dismissed with prejudice.

      (c) The agreement must contain a waiver of the following rights of the defendant with respect to each criminal charge:

      (A) The right to a speedy trial and trial by jury;

      (B) The right to present evidence on the defendant’s behalf;

      (C) The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against the defendant;

      (D) The right to contest evidence presented against the defendant, including the right to object to hearsay evidence; and

      (E) The right to appeal from a judgment of conviction resulting from an adjudication of guilt entered under subsection (2) of this section, unless the appeal is based on an allegation that the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed by law or constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

      (d) The agreement must include a requirement that the defendant pay any restitution owed to the victim as determined by the court, and any fees for court-appointed counsel ordered by the court under ORS 135.050.

      (e) The agreement may not contain a requirement that the defendant enter a plea of guilty or no contest on any charge in the accusatory instrument.

      (f) Entering into a probation agreement does not constitute an admission of guilt and is not sufficient to warrant a finding or adjudication of guilt by a court.

      (g) Police reports or other documents associated with the criminal charges in a court file other than the probation agreement may not be admitted into evidence, and do not establish a factual basis for finding the defendant guilty, unless the court resumes criminal proceedings and enters an adjudication of guilt under subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) Upon violation of a term or condition of the probation agreement, the court may resume the criminal proceedings and may find the defendant guilty of the offenses in the accusatory instrument in accordance with the waiver of rights in the probation agreement. The defendant may not contest the sufficiency of the evidence establishing the defendant’s guilt of the offenses in the accusatory instrument.

      (3) Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the probation agreement, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime. There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with respect to any person.

      (4) In the event that the period of probation under this section expires, but the terms and conditions of the probation agreement have not been fulfilled and no probation violation proceeding was initiated prior to the expiration of the period of probation, the court may not discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. The court shall instead issue an order requiring the person to appear and to show cause why the court should not enter an adjudication of guilt as described in subsection (2) of this section due to the failure of the person to fulfill the terms and conditions of the probation agreement prior to expiration of the period of probation. At the hearing on the order to show cause, after considering any evidence or argument from the district attorney and the person, the court may:

      (a) Order a new period of probation to allow the person to fulfill the terms and conditions of the probation agreement; or

      (b) Enter an adjudication of guilt as described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (5) This section applies to the following offenses:

      (a) Possession of a controlled substance under ORS 475.752 (3), 475.814, 475.824, 475.834, 475.854, 475.874, 475.884 or 475.894;

      (b) Unlawfully possessing a prescription drug under ORS 689.527 (6);

      (c) Unlawfully possessing marijuana plants, usable marijuana, cannabinoid products, cannabinoid concentrates or cannabinoid extracts as described in ORS 475B.337 or 475B.341, if the offense is a misdemeanor or felony;

      (d) Endangering the welfare of a minor under ORS 163.575 (1)(b);

      (e) Frequenting a place where controlled substances are used under ORS 167.222; and

      (f) A property offense that is motivated by a dependence on a controlled substance or a marijuana item as defined in ORS 475B.015. [1977 c.745 §21; 1995 c.440 §30; 1999 c.799 §1; 2001 c.834 §§6,10; 2005 c.706 §26; 2005 c.708 §§56,57; 2011 c.524 §2; 2013 c.75 §1; 2015 c.125 §1; 2016 c.24 §58; 2017 c.21 §23; 2019 c.445 §1]

 

      475.255 Status of penalties. Any penalty imposed for violation of ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any civil or administrative penalty or sanction otherwise authorized by law. [1977 c.745 §18; 1995 c.440 §31]

 

      475.265 When prosecution barred. If a violation of ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 is a violation of a federal law or the law of another state, a conviction or acquittal under federal law or the law of another state for the same act is a bar to prosecution in this state. [1977 c.745 §19; 1995 c.440 §32]

 

(Interpretation; Title)

 

      475.275 Uniformity of interpretation. ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 shall be so applied and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of ORS 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.752 to 475.980 among those states which enact similar laws.
