This subsection does not apply to a person temporarily at the premises to make a service, maintenance or repair call or for other purposes independent of the premises operations.

      (3) If a person performing work has not provided proof of age requested by the commission under subsection (2) of this section, the commission may request that the licensee provide proof that the person is 21 years of age or older.
