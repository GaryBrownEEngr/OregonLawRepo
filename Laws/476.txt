Prior to adoption of any such exemption, the State Fire Marshal may request from the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training consideration of and recommendations regarding the exemption. The exemption may extend for a two-year period, and may be renewed from time to time, but may be canceled by the State Fire Marshal following 30 days’ written notice if the State Fire Marshal finds that the governmental subdivision’s regulations or enforcement thereof are not reasonably sufficient. The governmental subdivision shall furnish a copy of such regulations to the State Fire Marshal and shall file with the State Fire Marshal any amendment thereto within 30 days before the effective date of such amendment.

      (4) If any owner of zone 1 land fails or neglects to file a fire protection plan, or to comply with the standard of protection approved by the county governing body, the governing body shall provide for forest protection pursuant to ORS 476.320.

      (5) Nothing contained in ORS 476.310 to 476.340 shall prevent interested property owners in any nonzoned territory from petitioning the governing body and State Board of Forestry to hold a hearing on the matter of zoning the territory if a majority of the landowners within the territory file such petition.

      (a) Requires permission for starting a campfire in a manner otherwise lawful.

      (b) Relieves a person starting a fire from responsibility for providing adequate protection to prevent injury or damage to the property of another.

      (c) Relieves a person who has obtained permission to start a fire, or the agent of the person, from legal liability for property damage resulting from the fire.

      (d) Permits an act within a city or regional air quality control authority area that otherwise is unlawful pursuant to an ordinance of the city or rule, regulation or order of the regional authority.

      476.770 Determination of cigarette variety ignition propensity; reduced ignition propensity standard; listing; cigarette design; rules. (1) For each variety of cigarette sold or proposed for sale in this state, the State Fire Marshal shall determine whether that variety of cigarette has reduced ignition propensity.

      (2) Any cigarette variety certified by a manufacturer under ORS 476.780 shall be determined to have reduced ignition propensity.

      (3) Except as provided in this section, ignition propensity testing certified, conducted or accepted by a manufacturer or the State Fire Marshal must be performed using ASTM International specification E2187-04, Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes. The ignition propensity testing must be conducted on 10 layers of filter paper. Forty replicate tests shall constitute a complete test trial for each cigarette variety tested. The fire safety performance standard described in subsection (6) of this section applies only to a completed test trial.

      (4) The State Fire Marshal may adopt an ignition propensity testing method developed by ASTM International as a modification or replacement of the method designated by subsection (3) of this section if the State Fire Marshal, by rule, deems the modified or replacement method acceptable for determining cigarette fire safety. However, the State Fire Marshal may not adopt a modified or replacement method that in repeated testing results in a change in the percentage of cigarettes exhibiting full-length burns from the percentage produced on the same variety of cigarettes by use of the ASTM E2187-04 method or that otherwise affects the ability of the cigarette to meet the fire safety performance standard described in subsection (6) of this section.

      (5) If the State Fire Marshal determines that ignition propensity testing cannot be performed on a cigarette using a method described in subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the manufacturer may propose an alternative testing method and an alternative fire safety performance standard for the variety. If the State Fire Marshal approves the alternative testing method and determines that the alternative fire safety performance standard is equivalent to the fire safety performance standard described in subsection (6) of this section, the manufacturer may use the alternative testing method and the alternative fire safety performance standard for the purpose of certifying the variety of cigarette under ORS 476.780. Except as provided under the approved alternative testing method and the alternative fire safety performance standard, a cigarette variety described in this subsection remains subject to ORS 476.755 to 476.790 and 476.995.

      (6) For a cigarette variety to be declared to have reduced ignition propensity, no more than 25 percent of the cigarettes in a complete test trial conducted in accordance with an ignition propensity testing method described in this section shall exhibit full-length burns.

      (7) The State Fire Marshal shall issue, keep current and make available to the public a list of the cigarette varieties the State Fire Marshal has determined to have reduced ignition propensity.

      (8) A cigarette listed in a certification under ORS 476.780 that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the fire safety performance standard described in subsection (6) of this section must have at least two nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. If the bands are not positioned on the cigarette by design, at least one complete band must be at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. If the bands are positioned on the cigarette by design, the cigarette must have at least two bands that are entirely located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and:

      (a) If the cigarette is filtered, that are located at least 10 millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column; or

      (b) If the cigarette is nonfiltered, that are located at least 10 millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column. [2007 c.34 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 476.755.

 

      476.775 Laboratories; ignition propensity testing. (1) A laboratory that conducts ignition propensity testing for purposes of ORS 476.770 must have a quality control and assurance program. The program shall be designed to ensure the testing repeatability value for all test trials used to certify a cigarette variety. The repeatability value of ignition propensity testing may not be greater than 0.19.

      (2) Ignition propensity testing used in a manufacturer certification submitted under ORS 476.780 must be conducted in a laboratory that has been accredited under:

      (a) The ISO/IEC 17025 standard of the International Organization for Standardization, as amended and in effect on April 17, 2007; or

      (b) A standard recognized in State Fire Marshal rules as comparable to prevailing international accreditation standards. [2007 c.34 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 476.755.

 

      476.780 Cigarette variety certification by manufacturer; retesting; record retention; unfavorable determination by State Fire Marshal. (1) A manufacturer shall submit a written certification attesting that each variety of cigarette listed in the certification has been subjected to ignition propensity testing described in ORS 476.770 and meets the fire safety performance standard described in ORS 476.770 (6).

      (2) The certification shall provide the following information for each variety of cigarette listed:

      (a) The brand name shown on the cigarette packaging.

      (b) The style, such as light or ultralight.

      (c) The length in millimeters.

      (d) The circumference in millimeters.

      (e) The flavor, such as menthol or chocolate, if applicable.

      (f) Whether the cigarette is filtered or nonfiltered.

      (g) A packaging description, such as soft pack or box.

      (h) A description of the packaging marking approved by the State Fire Marshal under ORS 476.785.

      (i) The name, address and telephone number of the laboratory conducting the ignition propensity testing, if other than the laboratory of the manufacturer.

      (j) The date of the ignition propensity testing.

      (3) The certification of a cigarette variety is valid for three years from the date of receipt by the State Fire Marshal.

      (4) If the manufacturer certifies a cigarette variety and later makes any change that is likely to alter the cigarette variety’s compliance with the fire safety performance standard described in ORS 476.770 (6), before distributing the changed cigarette variety in this state the manufacturer shall retest the ignition propensity of that variety. Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, a manufacturer may not sell a cigarette variety described in this subsection unless that variety continues to meet the fire safety performance standard described in ORS 476.770 (6).

      (5) A manufacturer shall retain copies of all ignition propensity test data for cigarette varieties listed in the certification, including any retesting performed under subsection (4) of this section. The manufacturer shall retain the test data for not less than three years. The manufacturer shall provide copies of the test data upon request to the State Fire Marshal and to the Attorney General. Failure of a manufacturer to provide copies of ignition propensity test data requested by the State Fire Marshal or the Attorney General creates a rebuttable presumption that a cigarette variety does not meet the fire safety performance standard described in ORS 476.770 (6).

      (6) The State Fire Marshal may determine that a cigarette variety certified under this section does not have reduced ignition propensity only if:

      (a) The test data provided to the State Fire Marshal by the manufacturer demonstrate that the cigarette variety does not meet the fire safety performance standard described in ORS 476.770 (6); or

      (b) The State Fire Marshal conducts ignition propensity testing on the cigarette variety and the test results demonstrate that the cigarette variety does not meet the fire safety performance standard described in ORS 476.770 (6).

      (7) Ignition propensity testing by the State Fire Marshal under subsection (6) of this section shall be conducted in accordance with the testing requirements applicable to manufacturers by a laboratory meeting the requirements described under ORS 476.775.

      (8) Upon a determination by the State Fire Marshal under subsection (6) of this section, the State Fire Marshal may seek the remedies described in ORS 476.765. [2007 c.34 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 476.755.

 

      476.785 Cigarette packaging markings. (1) A manufacturer shall place a single type of marking on all packaging for cigarettes of the manufacturer sold in this state to indicate that cigarettes of the manufacturer sold in this state meet the fire safety performance standard established in ORS 476.770 (6).

      (2) A manufacturer shall submit to the State Fire Marshal a proposal for marking cigarette packaging. The proposed marking must be in an eight-point font or larger and consist of one of the following:

      (a) Modification of the universal product code to indicate a visible mark printed at or around the universal product code. The mark may consist of alphanumeric or symbolic characters permanently printed, stamped, engraved or embossed in conjunction with the universal product code.

      (b) A visible combination of alphanumeric or symbolic characters permanently stamped, engraved or embossed upon the packaging or cellophane wrapping.

      (c) Printed, stamped, engraved or embossed text indicating that the cigarettes meet the fire safety performance standard established in ORS 476.770 (6).

      (3) The State Fire Marshal shall approve or disapprove the proposal for packaging marking. In determining whether to approve or disapprove a proposal for packaging marking, the State Fire Marshal:

      (a) Shall give preference to packaging marking that is consistent with the packaging marking in use and approved for that cigarette variety in the State of New York; and

      (b) Shall approve packaging marking that bears the letters “FSC.”

      (4) A proposal for packaging marking is approved unless the State Fire Marshal disapproves the proposal on or before the 10th day after receipt. The approved packaging marking may be used for the cigarette variety upon receipt by the State Fire Marshal of the manufacturer certification for that variety under ORS 476.780.

      (5) A manufacturer may not modify the approved packaging marking unless the modification has been submitted to and approved by the State Fire Marshal. [2007 c.34 §8]

      476.790 Providing copies of cigarette certification and illustration of packaging markings. (1) A manufacturer selling cigarettes to a wholesale dealer in this state shall provide the wholesale dealer with a copy of the certification for those cigarettes submitted to the State Fire Marshal under ORS 476.780. The manufacturer shall also provide the wholesale dealer with copies of an illustration of the packaging marking required under ORS 476.785. The manufacturer shall supply copies of the illustration to the wholesale dealer in sufficient number to allow one copy for each retail dealer receiving the cigarettes from the wholesale dealer.

      (2) A wholesale dealer shall provide a copy of the illustration described in subsection (1) of this section to each retail dealer that receives cigarettes of the manufacturer from the wholesale dealer. A wholesale dealer is not required to provide a retail dealer of the cigarettes of a manufacturer with more than one copy of the illustration for that manufacturer. [2007 c.34 §9]

      (a) Cartoon characters, figurines or action figures;

[2009 c.6 §2]

      (4) The State Fire Marshal shall impose civil penalties under this section as provided in ORS 183.745.
