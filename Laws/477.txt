      477.017 Legislative findings, policy and purpose. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The forestland-urban interface situation in Oregon is a result of both past and present conditions and that, given projected trends, the forestland-urban interface situation will continue to grow.

      (b) Urban and suburban structures, real property and natural resources are subject to increased risks of catastrophic damage by forestland-urban interface fire events.

      (c) There is greater complexity in forestland-urban interface fire protection than in either resource land fire protection or urban structural fire protection.

      (d) In dealing with the forestland-urban interface situation, major and long term solutions will involve local actions and efforts by property owners.

      (e) One solution or set of solutions will not fit all situations or areas of the state.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that:

      (a) In order to ensure the protection of human life, the safety of citizens and fire service personnel and the highest possible level of livability in Oregon, it is necessary to provide a complete and coordinated fire protection system within the forestland-urban interface in Oregon.

      (b) All forestland-urban interface property owners have a basic responsibility to share in this complete and coordinated protection system by providing efforts against fire.

      (c) Public and property owner education and awareness is critical to forestland-urban interface solutions and must occur at multiple levels.

      (d) In administration of ORS 477.015 to 477.061, it is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that property owners who will be affected by ORS 477.015 to 477.061 will be:

      (A) Involved in the processes of development of administrative rules pursuant to ORS 477.015 to 477.061; and

      (B) Notified of the outcomes of classification pursuant to ORS 477.015 to 477.057.

      (3) The purpose of ORS 477.015 to 477.061 is to:

      (a) Provide a forestland-urban interface fire protection system in Oregon that minimizes cost and risk while maximizing effectiveness and efficiency for protection of the values at risk from fire.

      (b) Promote and encourage property owner efforts to minimize and mitigate fire hazards and risks within the forestland-urban interface.

      (c) Promote and encourage the involvement and interaction of all levels of government and the private sector that have a direct or indirect interest and role in the forestland-urban interface situation over the long term. [1997 c.429 §§4,5,7; 2007 c.30 §1]

      477.023 Fire protection system; integration with existing laws; cooperative agreements. (1) The forestland-urban interface in Oregon represents a unique fire protection situation that requires that unique and special measures be taken to ensure adequate public safety and protection of property, development and natural resources. Therefore, it is declared to be the public policy of the State of Oregon to encourage and provide a complete and coordinated forestland-urban interface fire protection system.

      (2)(a) It is recognized that forestland-urban interface areas are already subject to other laws and to regulations of other agencies. It is the intent of ORS 477.015 to 477.061 to integrate with and not replace those other laws and regulations.

      (b) In the event of an apparent conflict between the obligations imposed by ORS 477.015 to 477.061 and by other laws or regulations for which the forester is responsible and has jurisdiction, the forester shall resolve the conflict within the scope of the forester’s authority.

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, the obligations imposed by ORS 477.015 to 477.061 do not supersede or replace federal law or regulation, other state law or rules, or more restrictive local government ordinance or code.

      (d) In the event of an apparent conflict between the obligations imposed by ORS 477.015 to 477.061 and a more restrictive local government ordinance or code, the State Forester may enter into a cooperative agreement with the governing body of a local government, the terms of which provide that ORS 477.015 to 477.061 supersede the local government ordinance or code in specified cases.

      (e) In the event of an apparent conflict between the obligations imposed by ORS 477.015 to 477.061 and the declaration, bylaws, rules or regulations of a homeowners association, the State Forester may enter into a cooperative agreement with the homeowners association that allows the declaration, bylaws, rules or regulations of the homeowners association to supersede ORS 477.015 to 477.061 in specified cases. The term of a cooperative agreement entered into under this paragraph may not exceed five years.

      (f) When a real property lot includes one or more structures that have multiple owners, the State Forester may enter into a cooperative agreement with one or more of the owners, or a person designated as the representative of the owners, for the purposes of matters related to ORS 477.015 to 477.061. The term of a cooperative agreement entered into under this paragraph may not exceed five years.

      (g) Compliance with the obligations imposed by ORS 477.015 to 477.061 does not relieve the owner of land of the requirements of other laws or regulations that might apply to the land in question.

      (3) To encourage development of a complete and coordinated forestland-urban interface fire protection system, it is declared to be in the public interest that the State Board of Forestry and the State Forester take a lead role in statewide coordination of the forestland-urban interface situation with other state and federal agencies, local governments and private sector interests that are concerned with fire protection in the forestland-urban interface.

      477.025 Classification of lands to reflect different protection problems. The Legislative Assembly recognizes that the forestland-urban interface in Oregon varies by condition, situation, fire hazard and risk, that different forestland-urban interface fire protection problems exist across the state because of this variability, that these different problems necessitate varied fire prevention and protection practices and that, in order to give recognition to such differences and their effect on the accomplishment of the public policy stated in ORS 477.023, certain classifications of the forestland-urban interface within the State of Oregon are established by ORS 477.027 to 477.057. [1997 c.429 §9]

 

      477.026 [1953 c.372 §4; 1965 c.253 §59; renumbered 477.225]

 

      477.027 Rules for classification of lands. By administrative rule, the State Board of Forestry shall establish criteria by which the forestland-urban interface shall be identified and classified. The criteria shall recognize differences across the state in fire hazard, fire risk and structural characteristics within the forestland-urban interface. The criteria shall include not less than three nor more than five classes of forestland-urban interface. [1997 c.429 §10; 2007 c.30 §3]

      477.028 [1953 c.372 §5; 1957 c.83 §6; 1959 c.363 §3; 1963 c.107 §1; repealed by 1965 c.253 §153]

 

      477.029 Local land classification committee; members; officers; terms; rules. (1) Pursuant to a request by the State Forester, the governing body of a county containing forestland-urban interface may establish a county forestland-urban interface classification committee of five persons, of whom one shall be appointed by the State Forester, one by the State Fire Marshal and three by the governing body. Of the members appointed by the governing body, one must be an owner of land within the forestland-urban interface who permanently resides on the land. Each appointing authority shall file with the State Forester the name of its appointee or appointees, and the persons so named shall constitute the committee for the county. Unless otherwise provided for by the appointing authority, members of the committee shall serve a term of four years and may be reappointed to any number of terms. Each member of the committee at all times is subject to replacement by the appointing authority, effective upon the filing with the State Forester by that authority of written notice of the name of the new appointee.

      (2) The committee shall elect from among its members a chair and a secretary and may elect other officers as it finds advisable. The committee shall adopt rules governing its organization and proceedings and the performance of its duties, and shall keep written minutes of all its meetings. A quorum of the county forestland-urban interface classification committee for official actions is three members, and a quorum of a committee established pursuant to subsection (4)(a) of this section is four members.

      (3) The governing body of the county may provide for the committee and its employees such accommodations and supplies and such county funds not otherwise appropriated as the governing body finds necessary for the proper performance of the committee’s functions. The members of the committee shall receive no compensation for their services, but the governing body may reimburse them for their actual and necessary travel and other expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. By written agreement between the State Forester and the governing body, the State Forestry Department may provide the functions or be responsible for part or all of the expenses referred to in this subsection.

      (4) In the interest of efficiency, by written agreement between the State Forester and the governing body, if a forestland classification committee is established and active within a county pursuant to ORS 526.305 to 526.340, the members of that committee may also serve on the county forestland-urban interface classification committee established by subsection (1) of this section. In the event that this agreement is made, the State Forester and the governing body shall ensure that either:

      (a) A State Fire Marshal appointee and an owner of land within the forestland-urban interface who permanently resides on the land are added to the county forestland classification committee to bring the total number of committee members to seven; or

      (b) The State Fire Marshal approves of the current membership of the county forestland classification committee and the committee includes an owner of land within the forestland-urban interface who permanently resides on the land. [1997 c.429 §11; 2007 c.30 §4]

 

      477.030 [1953 c.372 §6; 1959 c.363 §4; 1965 c.253 §60; 1965 c.312 §1; renumbered 477.230]

 

      477.031 Duties of committee. (1) A county forestland-urban interface classification committee established under ORS 477.029 shall periodically identify all land to be designated as forestland-urban interface within the county based on the criteria developed pursuant to ORS 477.027.

      (2) The committee shall assign all forestland-urban interface forestland identified under subsection (1) of this section to one of the forestland-urban interface classes developed pursuant to ORS 477.027.

      (3) Before making final designations and classifications under this section, the committee shall adopt proposed designations and classifications. The committee shall publish notice of the proposed designations and classifications once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, to be posted in three public places within the county, and to be mailed to the owners of land that is affected by the proposed designations and classifications. The notice shall state the time and place for hearing or receiving objections, remonstrances or suggestions as to the proposed designations and classifications and the place where maps of the proposed designations and classifications may be inspected.

      477.052 Hearings on proposed classifications. (1) The county forestland-urban interface classification committee shall hold a public hearing at the time and place stated in the notice published under ORS 477.031 (3), or at such other time and place to which the hearing may be adjourned, to receive from any interested persons objections, remonstrances or suggestions relating to the proposed designations and classifications. Following the hearing the committee may make such changes in the proposed designations and classifications as it finds to be proper, hold additional hearings as it finds necessary, and thereafter shall make final designations and classifications.

      (2) All final action by the committee in designating and classifying forestland-urban interface shall be by formal written order, which must include a statement of findings of fact on the basis of which the order is made, and must include a list of all land designated and classified. The committee shall prepare one or more maps showing the final designations and classifications made. The original of the order shall be filed with the county clerk of the county. The order need not meet the requirements of ORS 205.232 to be filed and recorded. A copy of the order certified by the secretary of the committee shall be sent to the State Forester.

      (3) Copies of the order, lists of land and maps required by this section shall be maintained in designated offices of the forester where they shall be made available for public inspection. [1997 c.429 §14; 2007 c.30 §6]

      477.057 State Forester to classify land if county fails to act. (1) The State Forester may designate and classify forestland-urban interface, consistent with and as described in ORS 477.031 to 477.054, if a designation and classification of forestland-urban interface is not made by the county forestland-urban interface classification committee within a county in which such land is situated because:

      (a) The governing body of the county fails to establish a county forestland-urban interface committee within two years after the State Forester makes a request under ORS 477.029 (1);

      (b) The committee fails to make a designation and classification within five years after being appointed, or the committee fails to make a designation and classification within five years of the last designation and classification made by the committee; or

      (c) The committee fails to make a designation and classification in a manner consistent with ORS 477.031 to 477.054.

      (2) Designation and classification by the State Forester has the same force and effect as though made by a committee for that county. However, designations and classifications made by the State Forester cease to be effective if replaced by designations and classifications made pursuant to ORS 477.052 by the appropriate committee. [1997 c.429 §16; 2007 c.30 §8]

 

      477.058 [1965 c.253 §49 (enacted in lieu of 477.148); 1967 c.429 §58; renumbered 477.130]

 

      477.059 Obligation of landowner to comply with standards; rules; certification by landowner; penalty for failure to comply. (1)(a) The State Board of Forestry shall by rule establish minimum standards for minimizing or mitigating:

      (A) Fire hazards or risks on land within a forestland-urban interface due to the presence of structures or the arrangement or accumulation of vegetative fuels; and

      (B) Other fire hazards or risks or combinations of fire hazards or risks.

      (b) In adopting rules under this subsection, the board shall take into account the variability of the forestland-urban interface in different parts of the state.

      (c) An owner of land within a forestland-urban interface must comply with the minimum standards applicable to the land.

      (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, but no more frequently than once every five years, the State Forester shall provide written notice of the applicable minimum standards established under this section to each owner of land within a forestland-urban interface, unless the owner requests a copy more frequently.

      (b) The board need not give notice under paragraph (a) of this subsection to an owner of land if the owner is a member of a homeowners association by reason of owning the land and the State Forester has entered into a cooperative agreement with the homeowners association pursuant to ORS 477.023 (2)(e) that provides for notice to owners through the association.

      (3) An owner of land within a forestland-urban interface must certify in writing to the State Forester that the owner has complied with the applicable minimum standards established under this section not later than two years after the order designating the land as being within the forestland-urban interface is filed with the county clerk under ORS 477.052 (2). If a subsequent order is filed that changes the classification of the land, the owner of the land must make a supplemental certification in writing to the State Forester that reflects the measures that the owner has taken to comply with the applicable minimum standards established under this section for the new classification not later than six months after the new order is filed.

      (4) The State Forester shall accept certifications made to the forester under subsection (3) of this section. Any owner of land whose written certification has been accepted by the State Forester under this subsection is not liable for the costs of suppressing a fire under subsection (6) of this section, unless the State Forester subsequently determines that the owner of land has provided a false certification.

      (5) The State Board of Forestry may require periodic renewal of a certification accepted by the State Forester under subsection (4) of this section, and may require supplemental certifications from the owner of land that reflect the measures that the owner has taken to comply with the applicable minimum standards established under this section. An owner of land is responsible for maintaining the land described by the certification in compliance with the applicable minimum standards established under this section.

      (6) The owner of land designated to be within a forestland-urban interface is liable to the State Forester for the costs of suppressing a fire that occurs on that land, as described in subsection (7) of this section, if:

      (a) The owner has failed to meet the applicable minimum standards established under this section;

      (b) The fire originates on the owner’s land;

      (c) The ignition or spread of the fire is directly related to the owner’s failure to meet the applicable minimum standards established under this section; and

      (d) The fire requires action by the forester pursuant to ORS 477.066 (2).

      (7) The liability of an owner of land under subsection (6) of this section may not exceed $100,000. The State Forester may not seek recovery under subsection (6) of this section for any portion of the costs of suppressing a fire that are the ordinary costs of the regular personnel and equipment of the forest protection district in which the land is located. This subsection does not limit the liability of the owner under ORS 477.120. [1997 c.429 §17; 2007 c.30 §9]

 

      477.060 Considerations in determining cost of protection; special or additional costs. (1) In determining the annual cost of protection pursuant to ORS 477.230, the forester may consider and include the special or additional cost of fire protection for property owners within a forestland-urban interface classification, including the special or unique costs of assessment processing and administration.

      (2) The forester shall identify special or additional costs identified by subsection (1) of this section in the budget required by ORS 477.230 to 477.300. These special or additional costs are in addition to the annual cost of ORS 477.230 (1) and may not exceed $25 annually for each real property lot. Only those owners of land within a forestland-urban interface classification in a forest protection district shall bear the special or additional cost of fire protection within the forestland-urban interface in a manner consistent with rules promulgated by the State Board of Forestry. [1997 c.429 §18; 2001 c.361 §1; 2007 c.30 §10]

 

      477.061 Short title. ORS 477.015 to 477.061 shall be known as the Oregon Forestland-Urban Interface Fire Protection Act. [1997 c.429 §2; 2007 c.30 §11]

 

HAZARD ABATEMENT

 

      477.062 Inadequately protected forestland declared nuisance; notice to protect; work at expense of owner; collection of amount expended. (1) All forestland that by reason of its lack of adequate fire protection endangers life, forest resources or property is declared to be a public nuisance.

      (2) Whenever the forester learns thereof, the forester may direct the owner or operator of such forestland to take proper steps for its protection and advise the owner or operator of means to that end. In case of refusal or neglect by either to take precautions against fire required by law or when so directed by the forester in writing, within such time as is specified in the writing, then the forester may have such work done as the forester considers necessary for the protection of life, forest resources or property, without the necessity of court action.

      (3) The cost of work under subsection (2) of this section and the expense of any patrol rendered necessary by the want of adequate protection of such forestland shall be recoverable from the offender by an action prosecuted in the name of the state.

      (4) All moneys collected under this section shall be paid into the State Treasury, credited to the State Forestry Department Account and expended as other moneys in that account are expended. [Formerly 477.032; 1965 c.253 §50; 1997 c.274 §2]

 

FIRE ABATEMENT

 

      477.064 Uncontrolled fire declared nuisance. Any fire on any forestland in Oregon burning uncontrolled or without proper action being taken to prevent its spread, notwithstanding its origin, is declared a public nuisance by reason of its menace to life, forest resources or property. The spread of fire in forestland across an ownership boundary is prima facie evidence of fire burning uncontrolled. [Formerly 477.034; 1997 c.274 §3]

 

      477.066 Duty of owner and operator to abate fire; abatement by authorities. (1) Each owner and operator of forestland on which a fire exists or from which it may have spread, notwithstanding the origin or subsequent spread thereof, shall immediately proceed to control and extinguish such fire when its existence comes to the knowledge of the owner or operator, without awaiting instructions from the forester, and shall continue until the fire is extinguished.

      (2) If the forester determines the fire is either burning uncontrolled or the owner or operator does not then have readily and immediately available personnel and equipment to control or extinguish the fire, the forester, or any forest protective association or agency under contract or agreement with the State Board of Forestry for the protection of forestland against fire, and within whose protection area the fire exists, shall summarily abate the nuisance thus constituted by controlling and extinguishing the fire.

      (3) An owner may request in writing that the forester employ alternate fire prevention and suppression strategies or techniques on the owner’s forestland. The forester may employ some or all of the requested strategies or techniques when, in the judgment of the forester, conditions warrant the use of the alternate strategies or techniques. [Formerly 477.036; 1961 c.603 §7; 1965 c.253 §51; 1967 c.429 §1; 1983 c.22 §2; 1999 c.355 §3]

 

      477.067 Notice of fire. For the purpose of ORS 477.066, notification to the owner or operator of the forestland, is considered sufficient notification to the owner of the existence of a fire. [Formerly 477.042 and then 477.071]

 

      477.068 Liability for cost of abatement; interest; lien; foreclosure; attorney fees. (1) In case an owner or operator fails to perform the duty required by ORS 477.066, or is willful, malicious or negligent in the origin or subsequent spread of the fire, the actual cost incurred by the forester or a forest protective association or agency in controlling or extinguishing the fire shall be paid by the owner or operator within 90 days after the date on which the first written demand for payment of the actual cost is mailed by the State Forester to the owner or operator. If the actual cost is not paid within such 90-day period, such amount shall bear interest at 10 percent per year from the date on which the first written demand for the payment of the actual costs was mailed by the State Forester and the actual cost together with such interest may be recovered from such owner or operator by an action prosecuted in the name of the State of Oregon, or such forest protective association or agency, or both.

      (2) An itemized statement of the actual cost incurred by the forester or association or agency, or both, certified to by the forester, shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the actual cost in any proceeding authorized by this section.

      (3) The actual cost in cases covered by ORS 477.066 shall constitute a general lien upon the real and personal property of such owner or operator. A written notice of the lien, containing a description of the property and a statement of the actual cost, shall be certified under oath by the forester or any warden and filed in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the lands and personal property are situated within 12 months after the calendar year within which the fire originated, and may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for labor and material. In any proceeding to foreclose a lien created under this subsection, recovery for the plaintiff shall include, in addition to the amount of the actual cost, interest on such amount at the rate of 10 percent per year from the date of the filing of the written notice of the lien.

      (4) Upon request of the forester, the district attorney for the district in which the lands and personal property are situated or the Attorney General shall prosecute such action or foreclose the lien in the name of the State of Oregon or such forest protective association or agency, or both. Liens provided for in this section shall cease to exist unless suit for foreclosure is instituted within 12 months from the date of filing under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) In any action under subsection (1) of this section to recover actual cost and in any proceeding to foreclose any lien created by subsection (3) of this section, the court shall award, in addition to costs and disbursements, reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal to the prevailing party. [Formerly 477.038; 1955 c.218 §1; 1959 c.363 §6; 1961 c.603 §8; 1965 c.253 §53; 1965 c.428 §§11,12; 1973 c.66 §1; 1981 c.897 §54; 1983 c.22 §3; 1983 c.27 §1; 1997 c.206 §1]

 

      477.069 Negligence in origin and in failure to control fire may be united in one complaint. Notwithstanding any other law, in any action authorized by ORS 477.068 to collect the costs incurred, the plaintiff may unite in the same complaint causes of action based upon any or all of the grounds therein mentioned.

(1) If the forester determines that any forestland inside or within one-eighth of one mile of a forest protection district is particularly exposed to fire danger, by proclamation the forester may designate such forestland as an extra fire hazard and may restrict the use of such forestland.

      (2) The proclamation shall designate the area to which and the period during which the restrictions apply, and require that the area be subject to use only upon the condition that entrants comply with all the restrictions for the area.

      (3) The proclamation shall designate the type of closure as:

      (a) Regulated closure;

      (b) Permit closure; or

      (c) Absolute closure.

      (4) For the purpose of consistency and coordination between all affected agencies in the administration of forestland restrictions, a plan shall be developed by the forester, in cooperation with federal, state and local governmental agencies, landowners and organizations affected by the restrictions. The primary objective of the plan is uniformity of regulations regardless of land ownership. The plan must recognize variation in fire danger and must specify levels of closure by unique but easily recognizable geographic boundaries. [Formerly 477.156; 1967 c.429 §45; 1989 c.615 §3; 1997 c.274 §14]

 

      477.540 Notice of proclamation; suspension or termination; reinstatement.

Each published notice shall describe the area, type, restrictions and effective date of closure, and the manner in which permits may be secured if the area is subject to a permit closure.

      (2) The proclamation shall remain in force until the time designated therein expires or until the forester finds that the restricted use is no longer requisite and by order suspends or terminates it. A reinstatement of a closure after a suspension does not require the notices described in subsection (1) of this section. [Formerly 477.160; 1967 c.429 §46; 1969 c.204 §5; 1997 c.274 §15; 1999 c.355 §15]

 

      477.545 Restricted uses during closure.

      (2) Permit closures make the area subject to entry only through permit issued by the forester. The permit shall contain requirements which in the judgment of the forester are necessary to prevent danger to life, forest resources or property. The forester may, during periods of fire hazard conditions, refuse, suspend, revoke or restrict such permits.

      (3) Absolute closures restrict the areas to all forms of use and shall be designated only during periods of extreme fire hazard conditions endangering life, forest resources or property. [Formerly 477.158; 1967 c.429 §47; 1969 c.204 §6; 1997 c.274 §16]

 

      477.550 Violation of restrictions; access for fire fighting permitted. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, it is unlawful to enter any restricted area except in compliance with ORS 477.535 and 477.545, or to violate any of the requirements or restrictions under such sections.

      (2) Nothing in this section applies to an owner’s right of entry upon the land of the owner or prohibits free access to any area by anyone for the sole purpose of preventing or extinguishing fires. [Formerly 477.162; 1967 c.429 §48]

      (2) In order to maintain the reserve base of the fund at $22.5 million, the Emergency Fire Cost Committee may request and the State Treasurer may approve transfers to the fund in accordance with ORS 293.205 to 293.225, if the moneys in this fund fall below the reserve base, whether or not there are sufficient moneys in the fund to pay the obligations of the fund. Repayment of any such transfers shall be made from moneys paid into the fund pursuant to ORS 321.015 (2), 477.277 and 477.880 and from such other moneys as may be credited to the fund therefor.

      (3) If the committee determines that the moneys in the fund exceed:

      (a) The reserve base, and that no repayment obligations are outstanding from transfers made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, then the Department of Revenue shall reduce the taxes described in ORS 321.015 (2) by 50 percent for the following calendar year and the surcharge for each improved lot or parcel described in ORS 477.277 and the assessments described in ORS 477.880 shall be reduced by 50 percent for the following fiscal year.

      (b) $30 million, and that no repayment obligations are outstanding from transfers made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, then the Department of Revenue may not collect the taxes described in ORS 321.015 (2) for the following calendar year and the surcharge for each improved lot or parcel described in ORS 477.277 and the assessments described in ORS 477.880 may not be collected until the calendar year or fiscal year following the determination of the committee that the unencumbered balance in the fund is less than or equal to $22.5 million.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the funds referred to in subsection (2) of this section are inadequate to cover repayment of transfers from the State Treasurer or from other sources, the State Forester shall increase the following taxes, assessments and charges in an amount adequate to ensure repayment of the transfers, and any interest accrued thereon, allowing for contingencies in valuation, assessment and collection:

      (A) The harvest tax referred to in ORS 321.015 (2).

Any such increases shall be computed on or before January 1 of each year, and shall be based upon revenues received during the previous four quarters. Any such increases shall be made in the appropriate calendar or fiscal year following that in which the requested transfers from the State Treasurer or from other sources are made.

The insurance may be obtained through negotiation or competitive bids, whichever is in the best interest of the state, its contractors and cooperators.

      (4) The Oregon Forest Land Protection Fund may not be charged for payment of more than one-half of any premium for the insurance. [1969 c.524 §10; 1985 c.158 §2; 1989 c.91 §1; 1989 c.769 §11; 1991 c.639 §7; 2005 c.802 §15]

      (b) The moneys expended on fire suppression;

      (c) The balance remaining from the biennial appropriation; and

      (d) Any matters arising out of the fire season that may require attention or warrant future consideration by the board or the Legislative Assembly.
