      (2) The governing body of a city or district shall also adopt a list of fire safety systems that may be financed with loans made under ORS 478.845 to 478.875. [1995 c.725 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 478.840.

 

      478.865 Loan contract; repayment plan; terms and conditions. (1) Any loan contract providing for a loan of moneys to a borrower by a city or district shall include a plan for repayment by the borrower of moneys borrowed plus interest. The repayment plan:

      Note: See note under 478.840.

 

      478.880 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) The best interest of the state is served by providing financial incentives for the installation of fire safety systems in multifamily housing.

      (2) The design and nature of multifamily housing creates a higher fire risk than the risk to single family housing and exposes tenants to fire risks that are not within the control of the tenants.

      (3) The presence of fire safety systems helps to defray costs for fire district equipment and equipment maintenance.

      (4) Although the state building code allows local jurisdictions to require the installation of fire safety systems in new construction on a cost-neutral basis, there is no equivalent program for retrofitting or remodeling existing multifamily structures.

      (5) A fire safety incentive program serves the purpose of providing financial incentive for the installation of fire safety systems in existing multifamily housing. [2001 c.614 §1]

 

      Note: 478.880 and 478.885 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 478 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      478.885 Payment or repayment for cost of fire safety system installation in multifamily housing. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “District” means a rural fire protection district organized pursuant to ORS chapter 478.

      (b) “Fire safety system” means a device or series of devices that protects structures from damage or destruction by fire, protects people from injury by fire or minimizes the effects of fire. “Fire safety system” includes, but is not limited to, automatic fire sprinkler systems.

      (c) “Multifamily housing” means a structure established primarily to provide residential spaces and that provides more than one living unit. “Multifamily housing” does not include nursing homes, adult foster homes, hospitals, motels or hotels, dormitories or state institutions.

      (d) “Owner” includes a purchaser under a recorded instrument of sale.

      (2) A district may, by ordinance, establish a program that pays or repays to landlords part of the costs of installing fire safety systems in multifamily housing existing within the district on the effective date of the ordinance. Except as provided in this subsection, the district may establish the parameters of the program. A payment or repayment rate under the program may not exceed 50 percent of the cost of installing the fire safety system. The payment or repayment amount available for a property may not exceed the total amount paid during the preceding 10 years for all property taxes on the property, less any payment or repayment amount already provided for fire safety system installation on the property. The program must provide for the owner of the multifamily housing to apply on a form approved by the district. The program must include a uniform process for the evaluation of an application submitted by the owner of the multifamily housing. The uniform process must provide for a public hearing to determine whether the property qualifies for payment or repayment by the district. [2001 c.614 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 478.880.

 

FIRE PREVENTION CODE; FIRE PERMITS

 

      478.910 Adoption of fire prevention code. A district board may, in accordance with ORS 198.510 to 198.600, adopt a fire prevention code. [Amended by 1969 c.667 §54; 1971 c.268 §19]

 

      478.920 Scope of fire prevention code. The fire prevention code may provide reasonable regulations relating to:

      (1) Prevention and suppression of fires.

      (2) Mobile fire apparatus means of approach to buildings and structures.

      (3) Providing fire-fighting water supplies and fire detection and suppression apparatus adequate for the protection of buildings and structures.

      (4) Storage and use of combustibles and explosives.

      (5) Construction, maintenance and regulation of fire escapes.

      (6) Means and adequacy of exit in case of fires and the regulation and maintenance of fire and life safety features in factories, asylums, hospitals, churches, schools, halls, theaters, amphitheaters, all buildings, except private residences, which are occupied for sleeping purposes, and all other places where large numbers of persons work, live or congregate from time to time for any purpose.

      (7) Requiring the issuance of permits by the fire chief of the district before burning trash or waste materials.

      (8) Providing for the inspection of premises by officers designated by the board of directors, and requiring the removal of fire hazards found on premises at such inspections. [Amended by 1969 c.667 §55; 1977 c.292 §1]

 

      478.924 Approval of code by city or county required. The provisions of a fire prevention code adopted by a district after October 4, 1977, shall not apply within any city or county within the district unless the governing body of the city or county approves the fire code by resolution. [1977 c.292 §5]

 

      478.927 Building permit review for fire prevention code. A district adopting a fire prevention code shall provide plan review at the agency of the city or county responsible for the issuance of building permits for the orderly administration of that portion of the fire prevention code that requires approval prior to the issuance of building permits. [1977 c.292 §4]

 

      478.930 Violation of code; failure to remove hazards; burning waste without permit prohibited. When a district has adopted a fire prevention code as provided in ORS 478.910:

      (1) No person shall violate the provisions of the code or fail to remove hazards found on inspection within the time set by the inspecting officer, after written notice to either the owner or occupant of the premises.

      (2) No person shall burn waste materials or trash in an unguarded manner without a permit, when a permit is required by the district code or this chapter. [Amended by 1969 c.667 §56]

 

      478.940 Copies of code to be filed with State Fire Marshal and posted at fire stations. Copies of the fire prevention code shall be filed with the State Fire Marshal’s office and a copy shall be posted at each fire station within the district.

 

      478.960 Burning of certain materials permitted only with permission of fire chief; damage or injury; burning schedules and restrictions. (1) No one, within the boundaries of a district, shall cause or permit to be initiated or maintained on one’s own property, or cause to be initiated or maintained on the property of another, any open burning of commercial waste, demolition material, domestic waste, industrial waste, land clearing debris or field burning without first securing permission from the fire chief of the district and complying with the direction of the fire chief. A deputy of a fire chief has the power to perform any act or duty of the fire chief under this section.

      (2) The fire chief shall prescribe conditions upon which permission is granted and which are necessary to be observed in setting the fire and preventing it from spreading and endangering life or property or endangering the air resources of this state. The Environmental Quality Commission shall notify the State Fire Marshal of the type of and time for burning to be allowed on each day under schedules adopted pursuant to ORS 468A.570 and ORS 468A.595. The State Fire Marshal shall cause all fire chiefs and their deputies in the affected area to be notified of the type and time for burning to be allowed on each day with updating messages each day as required. A fire chief or deputy shall grant permission only in accordance with the schedule of the Environmental Quality Commission but may reduce hours to be allowed for burning if necessary to prevent danger to life or property from fire. The State Fire Marshal may refuse, revoke or postpone permission when necessary in the judgment of the State Fire Marshal to prevent danger to life or property from fire, notwithstanding any determination by the fire chief.

      (3) Nothing in this section relieves a person starting a fire from responsibility for providing adequate protection to prevent injury or damage to the person or property of another. If such burning results in the escape of fire and injury or damage to the person or property of another, such escape and damage or injury constitutes prima facie evidence that the burning was not safe.

      (4) Within a district, no person shall, during the fire season declared under ORS 477.505, operate any equipment in forest harvesting or agricultural operations powered by an internal combustion engine on or within one-eighth of one mile of forestland unless each piece of equipment is provided with a fire extinguisher of sufficient size and capacity and with such other tools and fire-fighting equipment as may be reasonably required by the fire chief of the district. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to machinery regulated by ORS chapter 477.

      (5) No person shall dispose of any building or building wreckage within a district by fire without having first secured permission therefor from the fire chief. No person shall refuse to comply with any reasonable requirements of the fire chief as to the safeguarding of such fire from spreading.

      (6) This section is not intended to limit the authority of a district to adopt a fire prevention code as provided in ORS 478.910 to 478.940 or to issue permits when the burning is done by mechanical burners fired by liquefied petroleum gas.

      (7) The fire chief shall maintain records of all permits and the conditions thereof, if any, that are issued for field burning under this section and shall submit at such times, as the Environmental Quality Commission shall require such records or summaries thereof to the commission. The Environmental Quality Commission shall provide forms for the reports required under this subsection.

      (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:

      (a) A permit is required for field burning authorized pursuant to ORS 468A.550 to 468A.620 and 468A.992.

      (b) For a permit for the propane flaming of mint stubble, the fire chief may only prescribe conditions necessary to prevent the spread of fire or to prevent endangering life or property and may refuse, revoke or postpone permission to conduct the propane flaming only when necessary to prevent danger to life or property from fire. [1955 c.469 §§1,2; 1959 c.363 §16; 1967 c.420 §1; 1967 c.438 §1; 1969 c.613 §3; 1969 c.667 §57; 1971 c.563 §9; 1973 c.832 §7b; 1975 c.635 §4; 1979 c.321 §1; 1989 c.615 §2; 1991 c.920 §22; 1997 c.274 §40; 1997 c.473 §6; 2009 c.790 §2]

 

      478.965 Recovery by district of costs of suppressing unlawful fire; attorney fees. (1) If the fire-fighting apparatus or personnel, or either of a district, are required to respond and be used actively or on a standby basis in connection with the extinguishment or control of a fire that has been started or allowed to spread in willful violation of ORS 478.960 (1) to (5), the person responsible therefor shall be liable to the district furnishing such apparatus or personnel, or both, for the actual costs incurred by the district in controlling, extinguishing or patrolling the fire. Such costs may be recovered in an action prosecuted in the name of the district. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the district if the district prevails in an action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the district had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

      (2) An itemized statement of the actual costs incurred by the district, certified under oath by the treasurer of the district, shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of such costs in the action authorized by this section. [1967 c.420 §6; 1969 c.667 §58; 1981 c.897 §55; 1995 c.696 §24]

 

DISTRICT IDENTIFICATION NAMES

 

      478.970 Purpose of district identification names. The purpose of ORS 478.970 to 478.982 is to establish an identification name for each district to be used for statistical purposes by the State Fire Marshal and in the process of insurance rating. ORS 478.970 to 478.982 do not alter or add to the corporate title or identification of a district organized or established by law. [1953 c.164 §1; 1969 c.667 §59; 2001 c.426 §2]

 

      478.972 Application by district to State Fire Marshal for identification name. (1) When a district is organized the first board shall notify the State Fire Marshal in writing of the identification name for the district.

      (2) Except as provided in this subsection, upon receipt of a written notice from the board, the State Fire Marshal shall immediately assign the district the identification name. The fire marshal shall notify the board in writing if the name conflicts with the name of another fire district in this state.

      (3) The district board shall notify the fire marshal as provided in subsection (1) of this section within 30 days after the act that completes the organization or establishment of the district. [1953 c.164 §2; 1969 c.667 §60; 2001 c.426 §3]

 

      478.974 [1953 c.164 §3; 1969 c.667 §61; repealed by 2001 c.426 §6]

 

      478.976 [1953 c.164 §4; repealed by 2001 c.426 §6]

 

      478.978 [1953 c.164 §5; 1969 c.667 §62; repealed by 2001 c.426 §6]
