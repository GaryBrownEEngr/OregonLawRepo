A filing is not required with respect to any such building or structure in any area exempted by order of the State Fire Marshal pursuant to ORS 476.030. Approval of the plans or sketches by the director is considered approval by the State Fire Marshal and satisfies any statutory provision requiring approval by the State Fire Marshal.

      (3) A declaration of the value of the proposed construction or alteration and the appropriate fee required under ORS 455.210 must accompany the plan or sketch. However, the determination of value or valuation shall be made by the director.

      (4) The director shall be furnished with not fewer than two accurate copies of the plan or sketch and details for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with applicable fire prevention and protection statutes and regulations.

One copy of the plan or sketch shall be retained by the director and one copy shall be returned to the applicant. No building or structure referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall be erected or constructed without approval by the director if the building or structure requires approval by the State Fire Marshal. After such approval or issuance of the required permit, construction or alteration must comply with the plan or sketch in all respects unless modified by subsequent permit or order of the director.

      (5) The approval of a plan or sketch may not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any statute or regulation or the applicable ordinances and regulations of any governmental subdivision of the state. The approval of a plan or sketch may not be construed as an approval for noncompliance with fire marshal regulations. Any condition upon approval or disapproval is an order subject to appeal as other orders are appealable.

      (6) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (2) and (4) of this section, the State Fire Marshal may, by rule, require an additional copy of a plan or sketch for local government use and may specify that plans or sketches submitted for review be drawn clearly and to scale.

The program for inspection under a master permit shall be delegated separately from the general electrical program authorization. The department may authorize the city or county to administer and enforce the provisions of this section and ORS 479.540 and 479.560 if it finds that the city or county can comply with the minimum standards and meet the qualifications for inspections, permit applications and other matters to assure adequate administration and enforcement of electrical inspection programs.

This subsection does not require a city or county to assume full responsibility for enforcement, inspection and administration of the electrical safety laws if the only enforcement performed by the city or county involves manufactured dwelling electrical utility connections.

      (3) The department, subject to ORS chapter 183, shall revoke any authority of a city or county to carry on inspections, enforcement or administration of electrical installations and electrical products under ORS 455.148 or 455.150 if the department determines that the city or county fails to comply with standards adopted by the board or otherwise is not effectively carrying out duties assumed by the city or county under this section.
