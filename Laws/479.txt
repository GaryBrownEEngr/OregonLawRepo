A filing is not required with respect to any such building or structure in any area exempted by order of the State Fire Marshal pursuant to ORS 476.030. Approval of the plans or sketches by the director is considered approval by the State Fire Marshal and satisfies any statutory provision requiring approval by the State Fire Marshal.

      (3) A declaration of the value of the proposed construction or alteration and the appropriate fee required under ORS 455.210 must accompany the plan or sketch. However, the determination of value or valuation shall be made by the director.

      (4) The director shall be furnished with not fewer than two accurate copies of the plan or sketch and details for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with applicable fire prevention and protection statutes and regulations.

After such approval or issuance of the required permit, construction or alteration must comply with the plan or sketch in all respects unless modified by subsequent permit or order of the director.

      (5) The approval of a plan or sketch may not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any statute or regulation or the applicable ordinances and regulations of any governmental subdivision of the state. The approval of a plan or sketch may not be construed as an approval for noncompliance with fire marshal regulations. Any condition upon approval or disapproval is an order subject to appeal as other orders are appealable.

      (6) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (2) and (4) of this section, the State Fire Marshal may, by rule, require an additional copy of a plan or sketch for local government use and may specify that plans or sketches submitted for review be drawn clearly and to scale.

      (3) If the Electrical and Elevator Board determines that a decision by the Chief Electrical Inspector is a major code interpretation, then the inspector shall distribute the decision in writing to all public and private electrical inspection authorities in the state. The decision shall be distributed within 60 days after the board’s determination, and there shall be no charge for the distribution of the decision. As used in this subsection, a “major code interpretation” means a code interpretation decision that affects or may affect more than one job site or more than one inspection jurisdiction.

      (5) Unless the department determines that the electrical product or electrical installation presents an immediate fire or life safety hazard, a person may operate an electrical product or electrical installation that is the subject of an appeal under this section until the appeal process is complete. If the department determines that an immediate fire or life safety hazard exists and the product or installation may not be operated during appeal, the department shall provide the person with a written report detailing the problems found by the department. If a determination is made under this subsection that products described in ORS 479.540 (11) may not be operated during appeal, that determination may be appealed immediately under the procedure established in subsection (2) of this section without first completing any appeal procedure established by a city or county.

      (2) The Electrical and Elevator Board and director may approve an ordinance under subsection (1) of this section only if electrical installations within the municipality’s jurisdiction are of a unique character beyond the education or experience of a general supervising electrician licensed under ORS 479.630 (2), and the ordinance applies only to such installations.

      (3) The director, after obtaining the opinion of the board, shall revoke approval of an ordinance upon a finding that in issuing its general supervising electrician’s license, a municipality has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against electricians from outside the municipality.

The program for inspection under a master permit shall be delegated separately from the general electrical program authorization. The department may authorize the city or county to administer and enforce the provisions of this section and ORS 479.540 and 479.560 if it finds that the city or county can comply with the minimum standards and meet the qualifications for inspections, permit applications and other matters to assure adequate administration and enforcement of electrical inspection programs. The department may authorize the city or county to administer and enforce ORS 479.510 to 479.945 and 479.995 if the department finds that the city or county:

      (A) Can comply with minimum standards adopted by the Electrical and Elevator Board by rule for inspections, permit applications and other matters to assure adequate administration and enforcement of ORS 479.510 to 479.945 and 479.995.

This subsection does not require a city or county to assume full responsibility for enforcement, inspection and administration of the electrical safety laws if the only enforcement performed by the city or county involves manufactured dwelling electrical utility connections.

      (3) The department, subject to ORS chapter 183, shall revoke any authority of a city or county to carry on inspections, enforcement or administration of electrical installations and electrical products under ORS 455.148 or 455.150 if the department determines that the city or county fails to comply with standards adopted by the board or otherwise is not effectively carrying out duties assumed by the city or county under this section.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a city or county may not contract with competing electrical contractors to provide permit inspection of electrical installations.

      (b) A city or county may contract with competing electrical contractors to provide permit inspection of electrical installations on a temporary basis by a supervising electrician if:

      (A) Emergency circumstances exist; and

      (B) The city or county has requested that the department perform permit inspections and the department is unable to respond in a timely manner.

      (c) Nothing in this subsection prohibits a city or county from contracting with another city or county to perform permit inspections of electrical installations by a supervising electrician.

      (5) A city or county that performs electrical installation inspections shall perform license enforcement inspections as a part of routine installation inspections. [1981 c.815 §37; 1987 c.575 §1; 1991 c.368 §3; 1991 c.373 §1; 1991 c.439 §1; 1993 c.451 §3; 2001 c.573 §20]
