REGULATION OF GASOLINE DISPENSING

 

      480.310 Definitions for ORS 480.315 to 480.385. As used in ORS 480.315 to 480.385:

      (1) “Class 1 flammable liquids” means liquids with a flash point below 25 degrees Fahrenheit, closed cup tester.

      (2) “Nonretail facility” means an unattended facility where Class 1 flammable liquids are dispensed through a card or key activated fuel dispensing device to nonretail customers. [Amended by 1991 c.863 §48]

 

      480.315 Policy. The Legislative Assembly declares that, except as provided in ORS 480.345 to 480.385, it is in the public interest to maintain a prohibition on the self-service dispensing of Class 1 flammable liquids at retail. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) The dispensing of Class 1 flammable liquids by dispensers properly trained in appropriate safety procedures reduces fire hazards directly associated with the dispensing of Class 1 flammable liquids;

      (2) Appropriate safety standards often are unenforceable at retail self-service stations in other states because cashiers are often unable to maintain a clear view of and give undivided attention to the dispensing of Class 1 flammable liquids by customers;

      (3) Higher liability insurance rates charged to retail self-service stations reflect the dangers posed to customers when they leave their vehicles to dispense Class 1 flammable liquids, such as the increased risk of crime and the increased risk of personal injury resulting from slipping on slick surfaces;

      (4) The dangers of crime and slick surfaces described in subsection (3) of this section are enhanced because Oregon’s weather is uniquely adverse, causing wet pavement and reduced visibility;

      (5) The dangers described in subsection (3) of this section are heightened when the customer is a senior citizen or has a disability, especially if the customer uses a mobility aid, such as a wheelchair, walker, cane or crutches;

      (6) Attempts by other states to require the providing of aid to senior citizens and persons with disabilities in the self-service dispensing of Class 1 flammable liquids at retail have failed, and therefore, senior citizens and persons with disabilities must pay the higher costs of full service;

      (7) Exposure to toxic fumes represents a health hazard to customers dispensing Class 1 flammable liquids;

      (8) The hazard described in subsection (7) of this section is heightened when the customer is pregnant;

      (9) The exposure to Class 1 flammable liquids through dispensing should, in general, be limited to as few individuals as possible, such as gasoline station owners and their employees or other trained and certified dispensers;

      (10) The typical practice of charging significantly higher prices for full-service fuel dispensing in states where self-service is permitted at retail:

      (a) Discriminates against customers with lower incomes, who are under greater economic pressure to subject themselves to the inconvenience and hazards of self-service;

      (b) Discriminates against customers who are elderly or have disabilities who are unable to serve themselves and so must pay the significantly higher prices; and

      (c) Increases self-service dispensing and thereby decreases maintenance checks by attendants, which results in neglect of maintenance, endangering both the customer and other motorists and resulting in unnecessary and costly repairs;

      (11) The increased use of self-service at retail in other states has contributed to diminishing the availability of automotive repair facilities at gasoline stations;

      (12) Self-service dispensing at retail in other states does not provide a sustained reduction in fuel prices charged to customers;

      (13) A general prohibition of self-service dispensing of Class 1 flammable liquids by the general public promotes public welfare by providing increased safety and convenience without causing economic harm to the public in general;

      (14) Self-service dispensing at retail contributes to unemployment, particularly among young people;

      (15) Self-service dispensing at retail presents a health hazard and unreasonable discomfort to persons with disabilities, elderly persons, small children and those susceptible to respiratory diseases;

      (16) The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, Public Law 101-336, requires that equal access be provided to persons with disabilities at retail gasoline stations; and

      (17) Small children left unattended when customers leave to make payment at retail self-service stations creates a dangerous situation. [1991 c.863 §49a; 1999 c.59 §160; 2007 c.70 §276]

 

      480.320 Use of coin-operated pumps and dispensing of gasoline by self-service declared hazardous. The installation and use of coin-operated dispensing devices for Class 1 flammable liquids and the dispensing of Class 1 flammable liquids by self-service, are declared hazardous. [Amended by 1959 c.73 §1]

 

      480.330 Operation of gasoline dispensing device by public prohibited; aviation fuel exception. An owner, operator or employee of a filling station, service station, garage or other dispensary where Class 1 flammable liquids, except aviation fuels, are dispensed at retail may not permit any person other than the owner, operator or employee to use or manipulate any pump, hose, pipe or other device for dispensing the liquids into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle or other retail container. [Amended by 2001 c.285 §1]

 

      480.340 Coin-operated or self-service gasoline pumps prohibited; automatic shut-off devices regulated; aviation fuel exception. An owner, operator or employee of a filling station, service station, garage or other dispensary where Class 1 flammable liquids, except aviation fuels, are dispensed at retail may not install or use or permit the use of:

      (1) A coin-operated or self-service dispensing device for the liquids.

      (2) A device that permits the dispensing of the liquids when the hand of the operator of the discharge nozzle is removed from the control lever, except one equipped with an automatic nozzle of a type that has been approved by the State Fire Marshal and that has a latch-open device as an integral part of the assembly, capable of shutting off the flow of the liquids reliably when the tank is filled or when the nozzle falls or slips from the filling neck of the tank. A person may not use an automatic nozzle to dispense the liquids unless the owner, operator or employee is in the immediate vicinity of the tank being filled. [Amended by 1959 c.73 §2; 2001 c.285 §2]

The installer shall certify on a form provided by the State Fire Marshal that all of the new installations are duly and properly reported. The State Fire Marshal may require that the notification include the location and description of the installation and the name of the user. All fees due and payable must accompany the notification. The replacement of empty containers or receptacles with other containers constructed in accordance with United States Department of Transportation specifications is not a new installation or change in the original installation that requires notification to the State Fire Marshal or necessitates further inspection of the installation. The State Fire Marshal shall collect from the installer an installation fee of $50 for each tank installed or for all tanks at the installation if the total combined capacity is 200 gallons or less. The State Fire Marshal or deputies of the fire marshal or assistants shall inspect a reasonable number of the installations and maintain a record of the inspections in the office of the State Fire Marshal.

      (2) In addition to any installation or inspection fee, the State Fire Marshal may charge a plan review fee, not to exceed $100, for any liquefied petroleum gas container and receptacle plan review required under a uniform fire code prescribed by the State Fire Marshal by rule.

      (3) After the initial installation, liquefied petroleum gas containers may be inspected once every 10 years except when changes have been made in the original installation. An installer making changes must notify the State Fire Marshal of the changes in the same manner provided in this section for new installations. The State Fire Marshal shall collect from the owner a fee of $50 for the inspection of each container. The manner of inspection, requirement of corrections, satisfaction of requirements and collection of fees due and payable must conform with the provisions of ORS 480.410 to 480.460 for new installations. Upon request of the State Fire Marshal, LP gas installation licensees shall furnish a list of the locations of 10-year old installations that they service.

      (4) If, upon inspection of any tank, the new installation does not comply with the requirements of the State Fire Marshal, the State Fire Marshal shall instruct the installer as to what corrections are necessary for compliance with the State Fire Marshal’s requirements. The installer of the new installation shall, within the time set by the State Fire Marshal, not to exceed 60 days after notification, notify the State Fire Marshal that the new installation complies with the requirements of the fire marshal. If the installer fails to notify the State Fire Marshal, or the State Fire Marshal has reason to believe that the corrections have not been made, the State Fire Marshal shall reinspect the new installation and shall collect from the installer an additional fee of $125. The user, not the installer, shall pay the additional fee resulting from actions of the user that require correction to achieve compliance with the requirements of the State Fire Marshal.

      (5) A person who receives notice from the State Fire Marshal must correct any improper installation within the time set by the State Fire Marshal, not to exceed 60 days after receipt of the notice.

      (6) If the fees provided for in this section are due and payable and are not paid within 30 days after service of written notice by the State Fire Marshal therefor, or if the installer fails to notify the State Fire Marshal by the last day of the month succeeding the month a new installation is made or a change is made requiring an inspection, the fees are delinquent and a penalty equal to the greater of 10 percent of the fee amount or $30, is imposed for the delinquency. The State Fire Marshal shall collect all fees and penalties in the name of the State of Oregon in the same manner that other debts are collected.

      (7) The provisions of this section do not apply to liquefied petroleum gas installations if made entirely within the jurisdiction of a governmental subdivision granted the exemption provided by ORS 476.030 (3) and written evidence of the licensing of the installation by the approved authority is submitted to the State Fire Marshal. The provisions of this section do not apply to LP gas installations made in manufactured dwellings that are constructed or altered in accordance with applicable rules of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The provisions of this section do not apply to LP gas installations in a recreational vehicle as defined in ORS 174.101. [Amended by 1953 c.228 §4; 1957 c.712 §8; part renumbered 480.460; 1967 c.417 §31; 1973 c.832 §17; 1987 c.346 §4; 1987 c.414 §159a; 1993 c.18 §124; 1993 c.185 §33; 1995 c.79 §294; 1995 c.305 §1; 1999 c.558 §3; 2003 c.652 §5; 2009 c.790 §§9,10; 2019 c.422 §38]
