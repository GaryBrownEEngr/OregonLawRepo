In establishing the preference system, the commission shall consider giving additional preference points to persons who have been issued a resident annual pioneer combination license pursuant to ORS 497.132.

      (18) May sell advertising in State Department of Fish and Wildlife publications, including annual hunting and angling regulation publications.

      (20) Shall, after consultation with the State Department of Agriculture, adopt rules prohibiting the use of the World Wide Web, other Internet protocols or broadcast or closed circuit media to remotely control a weapon for the purpose of hunting any game bird, wildlife, game mammal or other mammal. The rules may exempt the State Department of Fish and Wildlife or agents of the department from the prohibition.

      (21) May adopt rules establishing a schedule of civil penalties, not to exceed $6,500 per violation, for violations of provisions of the wildlife laws or rules adopted by the commission under the wildlife laws.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the wildlife laws, during the period beginning January 1, 1996, and ending January 2, 2022, the following provisions apply with regard to the issuance and use of landowner preference tags referred to in ORS 496.146 (4):

      (1) Landowner preference tags shall be issued for the hunting of deer, elk or antelope.

      (2) Landowner preference tags may be used only for hunting on the landowner’s property.

      (4) Landowner preference tags for the hunting of antelope are not transferable and may not be used for the taking of buck antelope.

      (5) Each landowner preference tag for the hunting of deer may be used to take two antlerless animals before, during or after the hunting season for which the tags are valid for the purpose of alleviating damage that is presently occurring to the landowner’s property, in accordance with such rules as the State Fish and Wildlife Commission may adopt.

      (6) Landowner preference tags for the hunting of deer or elk may be transferred to a person of the landowner’s choosing as follows:

      (7)(a) As specified pursuant to a formula determined by the commission by rule, the number of landowner preference tags issued for mule deer must be based upon the management, research and habitat needs set forth in the wildlife management plan for mule deer.

      (b) If the population of mule deer in a wildlife management unit is greater than the goal specified in the wildlife management plan for mule deer, a landowner who is issued a landowner preference tag is eligible, pursuant to criteria established by rule of the commission, for the number of tags that corresponds to the number of acres that landowner has registered with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife for participation in the program.

      (c) The commission may specify by rule a formula for determining the number of landowner preference tags that are available for controlled hunts for mule deer in a wildlife management unit in which the population of mule deer is less than the goal specified for that wildlife management unit in the wildlife management plan for mule deer.

      (8) Landowners shall pay the applicable fee under the fee schedule in section 2 of this 2015 Act [497.061] to register for participation in the program.

      (9) A landowner shall pay the applicable fee under the fee schedule in section 2 of this 2015 Act to modify the landowner’s tag distribution. [1995 c.460 §2; 2001 c.227 §1; 2009 c.349 §1; 2009 c.832 §2a; 2013 c.363 §1; 2015 c.779 §10]

      (1) Addresses damage caused by elk on privately owned lands in Oregon.

      (2) Provides landowner damage tags only for areas where elk are currently causing damage, where there has been a history of elk damage coupled with actions to alleviate elk damage or where the department has designated the area as an elk deemphasis area.

      (3) Limits the use of damage tags to taking antlerless elk.

      (4) Limits the use of damage tags to taking elk on property owned, leased or rented by the landowner complaining of elk damage or on property owned, leased or rented by a business entity that includes the landowner as a principal partner or shareholder.

      (5) Allows exchange of unused general season elk tags or controlled hunt elk tags for landowner damage tags.

      (6) Does not impose a limit on the number of total damage tags available for each landowner, except that no more than five damage tags may be valid at any one time.

      (7) Does not impose a minimum acreage requirement for landowner participation.

      (8) Allows landowners to register for participation in the program at any time prior to the issuance of damage tags.

      (9) Establishes a $30 fee for landowners to register for participation in the program.

      (10) Establishes a $15 fee for landowners to modify the landowner’s damage tag distribution.

      (11) Authorizes department biologists to sell and exchange damage tags.

      (12) Authorizes department biologists to establish the period of validity for damage tags through negotiation with landowners.

      (13) Requires landowners to record the number of elk taken and, within 10 days after the end of a designated hunt period, to report to the local department biologist the number of elk taken. [2013 c.363 §3]

      Sec. 5. Sections 3 and 4 of this 2013 Act are repealed on January 2, 2020. [2013 c.363 §5]

 

      496.150 [Repealed by 1973 c.723 §130]

 

      496.151 Allocation of nonresident tags for outfitters and guides. Notwithstanding any other provision of the wildlife laws, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission by rule shall establish a system for allocating hunting permits that are limited by maximum number for the taking of deer and elk by nonresident hunters so that a number equal to one-half of the number of those permits issued to nonresident hunters in the previous year are made available to the holders of registrations issued pursuant to ORS chapter 704, and who are certified pursuant to ORS 704.060, for the use of the clients of those registration holders. Such a system shall include but not be limited to:

      (1) Provisions to prevent misuse of the permits by the registrant or by employees of the registrant.

      (2) Provisions for revocation and refusal to issue all or any portion of the permits based upon a commission finding of an emergency situation or biological needs. [1997 c.342 §2; 2003 c.644 §5]

 

      496.154 Limitation on authority to condemn certain farm use property. (1) The State Fish and Wildlife Commission shall not commence any proceeding to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire any real property, or interest therein, that was devoted to farm use on January 1, 1974, unless the commission first obtains approval therefor from the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, or from the Emergency Board if the Legislative Assembly is not then in session. Upon a change in the use of such land from farm use, the commission may acquire such property, and interests therein, by exercise of the power of eminent domain without first obtaining legislative approval therefor. As used in this section, “farm use” has the meaning for that term provided in ORS 215.203.

      (2) The commission shall not commence any proceeding as provided in subsection (1) of this section unless the commission has obtained approval of its intended use of such property from the local governmental agencies having land use planning authority over such lands. [1973 c.723 §13a; 1975 c.788 §1]

 

      496.155 [Amended by 1967 c.454 §86; repealed by 1973 c.723 §130]

 

      496.156 Expenditure priority for anadromous fish management. (1) In carrying out duties, functions and powers regarding the propagation of anadromous fish prescribed in the wildlife laws and the commercial fishing laws, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission shall give high priority to expenditures for propagation assistance by means of transportation of upstream and downstream migrants in those areas where dams and other such obstacles present a passage problem to juvenile or adult salmon.

      (2) For the purposes of this section, “transportation” means any method of helping anadromous fish to pass dams and other obstacles so as to reduce the mortality associated with passage.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section prevents the cooperation of the commission with the federal government in programs financed pursuant to ORS 506.405. [1977 c.653 §2]

 

      496.160 [Amended by 1971 c.658 §2; repealed by 1973 c.723 §130]

 

      496.162 Establishing seasons, amounts and manner of taking wildlife; rules. (1) After investigation of the supply and condition of wildlife, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission, at appropriate times each year, shall by rule:

      (a) Prescribe the times, places and manner in which wildlife may be taken by angling, hunting, trapping or other method and the amounts of each of those wildlife species that may be taken and possessed.

      (b) Prescribe such other restrictions or procedures regarding the angling, taking, hunting, trapping or possessing of wildlife as the commission determines will carry out the provisions of wildlife laws.

      (2) In carrying out the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the power of the commission includes, but is not limited to:

      (a) Prescribing the amount of each wildlife species that may be taken and possessed in terms of sex, size and other physical characteristics.

      (b) Prescribing such regular and special time periods and areas closed to the angling, taking, hunting and trapping of any wildlife species when the commission determines such action is necessary to protect the supply of such wildlife.

      (c) Prescribing regular and special time periods and areas open to the angling, taking, hunting and trapping of any wildlife species, and establishing procedures for regulating the number of persons eligible to participate in such angling, taking, hunting or trapping, when the commission determines such action is necessary to maintain properly the supply of wildlife, alleviate damage to other resources, or to provide a safe and orderly recreational opportunity.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, except as provided in ORS 498.146 or during those times and at those places prescribed by the commission for the hunting of elk, the commission shall not prescribe limitations on the times, places or amounts for the taking of predatory animals. As used in this subsection, “predatory animal” has the meaning for that term provided in ORS 610.002.

      (4) In carrying out the provisions of this section, before prescribing the numbers of deer and elk to be taken, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The supply and condition of deer and elk herds;

      (b) The availability of forage for deer, elk and domestic livestock on public and private range and forest lands;

      (c) The recreational opportunities derived from deer and elk populations; and

      (d) The effects of deer and elk herds on public and private range and forest lands. [1973 c.723 §14; 1975 c.791 §1; 1981 c.218 §1; 2003 c.656 §3]

 

      496.164 Cooperation with public and private agencies for fish and wildlife management; technical information and policy recommendations; use of recommendations by state agencies. The State Fish and Wildlife Commission and the State Department of Fish and Wildlife may advise, consult and cooperate with other agencies of this state and political subdivisions, other states or the federal government and private landowners with respect to fish and wildlife management. The commission and the department shall provide such information, recommendations or advice in writing if requested by another state or federal agency to do so. Technical advice and information shall be based on the best available scientific information. Policy or implementation recommendations provided in administrative rulemaking proceedings shall be based on consideration of all the goals of wildlife management in ORS 496.012, in addition to applicable scientific information. State agencies, boards or commissions receiving policy or implementation recommendations shall consider such recommendations in the context of their respective statutory responsibilities, and shall take into account the extent to which such recommendations are substantiated with the best available scientific information and based on consideration of all of the goals of wildlife management in ORS 496.012. [1993 c.659 §11]

      496.167 Department recompensable assistance to agencies; tracking and statements. (1) Subject to rules prescribed by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission, in rendering recompensable assistance to an agency, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall:

      (a) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, and before July 1, 2019, track and prepare statements reporting the number of hours spent by department personnel performing recompensable assistance for any executive department agency, including an hourly rate that would be charged, based on the class of department personnel performing the services. The department shall send statements to the agency receiving services, but may not charge for services. This paragraph does not prohibit the department from charging another state agency for services pursuant to an interagency agreement that is in effect between the department and the other agency at any time during the period beginning July 1, 2015, and ending July 1, 2021.

      (b) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, track and prepare statements reporting the number of hours spent by department personnel performing recompensable assistance for any executive department agency, including an hourly rate that would be charged, based on the class of department personnel performing the services.

      (2)(a) The charges for which statements are prepared and, after July 1, 2019, billed include, but are not limited to, costs of providing professional, investigatory, administrative and clerical services and capital outlay.

      (b) An executive department agency may not submit an invoice to a private entity, a member of the public or an applicant for a state-issued permit for services performed by the department, unless the invoice is authorized by a statute, rule or interagency agreement executed:

      (A) Prior to June 25, 2015; or

      (B) Following consultation with persons representative of those private entities, members of the public or permit applicants that are subject to invoicing under this paragraph.

      (3) As used in this section:

      (a) “Agency” means any department, board, commission, agency or officer of the executive department.

      (b) “Executive department” has the meaning given that term in ORS 174.112.

      (c) “Recompensable assistance” means assistance rendered by the department as part of advancing fee-funded programs administered by an agency. [2015 c.566 §1]

 

      Note: 496.167 and 496.168 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 496 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      496.168 Estimated expenses for recompensable assistance; invoices. The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall estimate in advance the expenses that the department will incur during a biennium under ORS 496.167, and shall render to executive department agencies and other entities described in ORS 496.167 an invoice for their share of such expenses for periods within the biennium and in sufficient amounts to provide reasonable cash operating requirements for the department within the biennial period. Each agency or other entity described in ORS 496.167 shall pay to the credit of the department such invoice as an administrative expense from funds or appropriations available to the invoiced agency or entity in the same manner as other claims against the state are paid. If the estimated expenses for the agency or other entity described in ORS 496.167 are more or less than actual expenses for the period covered by the invoice, the difference shall be reflected in the next following estimate of expenses. [2015 c.566 §2]

 

      Note: 496.168 becomes operative July 1, 2019. See section 3, chapter 566, Oregon Laws 2015.

 

      Note: Section 5, chapter 566, Oregon Laws 2015, provides:

      Sec. 5. On or before January 1, 2017, and after July 1, 2018, but on or before January 1, 2019, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall report to the Legislative Assembly in the manner prescribed in ORS 192.245. The report shall include all of the following:

      (1) A list of the types of permits and state agencies that utilize the department’s services and for which invoicing will be allowed under section 2 of this 2015 Act [496.168].

      (2) A list of all statutes and rules in effect on the date of the report that are applicable to the permit review process engaged in by the department.

      (3) A list of all statutes in effect on the date of the report that require or justify participation by the department in permitting processes and an explanation of how those statutes contribute to the protection of the fish and wildlife of this state.

      (4) A discussion of any additional options for cost recovery available to the department, including but not limited to interagency agreements that allow other agency personnel to apply department standards, modification of statutes applicable to the department or interagency agreements that could reduce the department’s involvement in permit review and application of standards and requirements, without negatively impacting protections for fish and wildlife.

      (5) An explanation of the costs associated with permitting, including identifying the costs associated with technical review separately from costs associated with public benefits of the permitting process and the public involvement in the permitting process. [2015 c.566 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 496.167.

 

      496.169 Citizen involvement for wildlife management on private lands. The Legislative Assembly finds, in the interest of all Oregonians, a necessity to improve Oregon’s resource access and wildlife habitat through the further involvement of its citizens, through voluntary partnership between the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and landowners to manage wildlife on private lands and through support by additional financial revenues.

THREATENED OR ENDANGERED WILDLIFE SPECIES

 

      496.171 Definitions for ORS 496.171 to 496.182; applicability date. Notwithstanding ORS 496.004, with respect to state agency actions taken under ORS 496.171 to 496.182 after July 17, 1995, as used in ORS 496.171 to 496.182:

      (1) “Conservation” means the use of methods and procedures necessary to bring a species to the point at which the measures provided under ORS 496.171 to 496.182 are no longer necessary. Such methods and procedures include, but are not limited to, activities associated with scientific resource management such as research, census taking, law enforcement, habitat acquisition and maintenance, propagation and transplantation.

      (2) “Native” means indigenous to Oregon, not introduced.

      (3) “Species” means any group or population of wildlife that interbreeds and is substantially reproductively isolated.

      (4) “Verifiable” means scientific information reviewed by a scientific peer review panel of outside experts who do not otherwise have a vested interest in the process. [1995 c.590 §2]

 

      496.172 Commission management authority for threatened or endangered species; rules. In carrying out the provisions of the wildlife laws with regard to the management of wildlife that is a threatened species or an endangered species, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission:

      (1) Shall conduct investigations of wildlife species native to this state and shall determine whether any such species is a threatened species or an endangered species.

      (2) By rule, shall establish and publish, and from time to time may revise, a list of wildlife species that are threatened species or endangered species. Listed threatened species or endangered species shall be protected as provided in ORS 496.182.

      (3) Shall work cooperatively with state agencies that have land management authority or regulatory authority to determine their roles within their statutory obligations in the conservation of endangered species, as described in ORS 496.182 (8).

      (4) By rule, shall establish a system of permits for scientific taking of threatened species and endangered species and shall establish a system of state permits for incidental taking of state-designated threatened species and endangered species not listed by the federal government under such terms and conditions as the commission determines will minimize the impact on the species taken. An incidental taking permit or statement issued by a federal agency for a species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended, shall be recognized by the state as a waiver of any state protection measures or requirements otherwise applicable to the actions allowed under the federal permit.

      (5) Shall cooperate with the State Department of Agriculture in carrying out the provisions of ORS 564.105.

      (6) Shall adopt administrative rules to carry out the provisions of ORS 496.171 to 496.182 and 498.026. [1987 c.686 §3; 1995 c.590 §3]

 

      496.175 [Amended by 1971 c.658 §4; repealed by 1973 c.723 §130]

 

      496.176 Listing species; procedure; matters to be considered; periodic review. (1) The lists of threatened species or endangered species established pursuant to ORS 496.172 (2) shall include:

      (a) Those species of wildlife listed as of May 15, 1987, as a threatened species or an endangered species pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended; and

      (b) Those species determined as of May 15, 1987, by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission to be threatened species or endangered species.

      (2) The commission, by rule, may add or remove any wildlife species from either list, or change the status of any species on the lists, upon a determination that the species is or is not a threatened species or an endangered species.

      (3) A determination that a species is a threatened species or an endangered species shall be based on documented and verifiable scientific information about the species’ biological status. To list a species as a threatened species or an endangered species under ORS 496.004 and 496.171 to 496.182, the commission shall determine that the natural reproductive potential of the species is in danger of failure due to limited population numbers, disease, predation or other natural or human actions affecting its continued existence and, to the extent possible, assess the relative impact of human actions. In addition, the commission shall determine that one or more of the following factors exists:

      (a) That most populations are undergoing imminent or active deterioration of their range or primary habitat;

      (b) That overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educational purposes is occurring or is likely to occur; or

      (c) That existing state or federal programs or regulations are inadequate to protect the species or its habitat.

      (4) Determinations required by subsection (3) of this section shall be made by the commission on the basis of verifiable scientific and other data after consultation with federal agencies, other interested state agencies, private landowners, affected cities, affected counties, affected local service districts as defined in ORS 174.116, other states having a common interest in the species and interested persons and organizations.

      (5)(a) Any person may petition the commission to, by rule, add, remove or change the status of a species on the list.

      (b) A petition shall clearly indicate the action sought and shall include documented scientific information about the species’ biological status to justify the requested action.

      (c) Within 90 days of receipt of a petition, the commission shall respond in writing to the petitioner indicating whether the petition presents substantial scientific information to warrant the action requested.

      (d) If the petition is found to present such information, the commission shall commence rulemaking.

      (e) A final determination by the commission concerning the action requested in a petition shall be provided within one year from the date of receipt of the petition, with the option for an additional 12-month extension of time to complete the listing if the commission determines that limited information or other appropriate considerations require the extension.

      (f) If the petition is denied, the petitioner may seek judicial review as provided in ORS 183.484.

      (6) The commission may determine not to list a species as a threatened species or an endangered species in any of the following cases:

      (a) If the species has been listed pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended.

      (b) If the species is currently on the list as a sensitive species, or is a candidate species or has been petitioned for listing pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended.

      (c) If the species has been determined, pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended, to not qualify as a threatened species or an endangered species.

      (7)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (5) of this section, the commission shall take emergency action to add a species to the list of threatened species or endangered species if it determines there is a significant threat to the continued existence of the species within the state.

      (b) The commission shall publish notice of such addition in the Secretary of State’s bulletin and shall mail notice to affected or interested persons whose names are included on the commission’s mailing list for such purposes.

      (c) Such emergency addition shall take effect immediately upon publication in the Secretary of State’s bulletin and shall remain valid for a period no longer than one year, unless during the period the commission completes rulemaking procedures as provided in subsection (5) of this section.

      (8) The commission shall periodically review the status of all threatened species and endangered species listed under ORS 496.171 to 496.192. Each species shall be reviewed at least once every five years to determine whether verifiable scientific information exists to justify its reclassification or removal from the list, according to the criteria listed under subsections (3) and (4) of this section. If a determination is made to reclassify a species or remove it from the list, the commission, within 90 days, shall commence rulemaking to change the status of the species.

      (9) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commission:

      (a) May decide not to list a species that otherwise qualifies as a threatened or endangered species within this state if the commission determines that the species is secure outside this state or the species is not of cultural, scientific or commercial significance to the people of this state.

      (b) May not include Branta canadensis leucopareia, commonly known as the Aleutian Canada goose, on the lists of threatened species or endangered species. [1987 c.686 §4; 1995 c.590 §4; 2005 c.402 §1; 2011 c.319 §20; 2012 c.40 §1]

 

      496.180 [Amended by 1971 c.658 §5; repealed by 1973 c.723 §130]

 

      496.182 Protection and conservation programs; mitigation of adverse impact on local economies; compliance by state agencies; rules. (1) The burden of protecting and recovering threatened species or endangered species can be a significant cost to the citizens of this state and it is therefore the policy of this state to minimize duplication and overlap between state and federal laws dealing with threatened species or endangered species. To this end, nothing in this section is intended to prevent the adoption of cooperative state or federal programs when such programs provide protection for listed species without significant impact on the primary uses of state lands.

      (2)(a) At the time the State Fish and Wildlife Commission adds a species to the list of threatened species or endangered species under ORS 496.172, the commission shall establish by rule quantifiable and measurable guidelines that it considers necessary to ensure the survival of individual members of the species. These guidelines may include take avoidance and protecting resource sites such as spawning beds, nest sites, nesting colonies or other sites critical to the survival of individual members of the species.

      (b) The commission shall work with private landowners, affected cities, affected counties and affected local service districts, as defined in ORS 174.116, to mitigate the adverse impact on local economies when the commission adds a species to the list of threatened species or endangered species pursuant to ORS 496.172.

      (3) For threatened species listed under ORS 496.172 and in the absence of an approved endangered species management plan described in subsection (8) of this section for an endangered species, if a state agency determines that a proposed action on land it owns or leases, or for which it holds a recorded easement, has the potential to violate the guidelines established under subsection (2) of this section, it shall notify the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. Within 90 days of such notice, the department shall recommend reasonable and prudent alternatives, if any, to the proposed action which are consistent with the guidelines.

      (4) If a state agency fails to adopt the recommendations made under subsection (3) of this section, it shall, after consultation with the department, demonstrate that:

      (a) The potential public benefits of the proposed action outweigh the potential harm from failure to adopt the recommendations; and

      (b) Reasonable mitigation and enhancement measures shall be taken, to the extent practicable, to minimize the adverse impact of the action on the affected species.

      (5) When an action under this section is initiated by a person other than a state agency, the agency shall provide final approval or denial of the proposed action within 120 days of receipt of a written request for final determination.

      (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to lands acquired through foreclosures of loans made pursuant to programs of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

      (7) State land owning or managing agencies shall set priorities for establishing endangered species management plans required by subsection (8) of this section after consultation with the commission on the level of biological threat and, in consideration of available funds, the immediacy and seriousness of the threat to any listed species.

      (8)(a)(A) Within four months of the listing of an endangered species, the commission, in consultation and cooperation with the state land owning or managing agency, shall determine if state land can play a role in the conservation of endangered species. The commission and the land owning or managing agency shall consider species biology and geography of the land base to determine if the species or its habitat is found on state land. If the species or its habitat is not found on state land, the commission shall determine that state land has no role to play in the conservation of the species.

      (B) If the species or its habitat is found on state land, the land owning or managing agency, in consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall determine the role its state land shall serve in the conservation of the endangered species. This role may include, but is not limited to conservation, contribution toward conservation or take avoidance. To carry out its consulting role under this subsection, the department shall provide state agencies with an assessment of the conservation needs of the endangered species. In making this determination, the land owning or managing agency shall balance the statutory requirements, rules and policies applicable to the agency’s programs, the social and economic impacts that conservation would have on the state, the conservation needs of the species, the purpose of the land and the roles of other ownership categories. The agency shall balance these factors consistent with the commission’s rules related to the biological aspects of species management and the statutory obligations of the land owning or managing agency, including the statutory purpose of the land.

      (C) After determining the role its state land shall serve in conservation of the species, the land owning or managing agency, in consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and consistent with the commission’s rules related to endangered species management plans, shall develop and approve an endangered species management plan within 18 months from the date the species is first listed as endangered. Endangered species management plans shall be based on the statutes, rules and policies applicable to the agency’s programs and shall take into account any social or economic impacts that the plan may have on the state. The land owning or managing agency shall submit the plan to the commission for review and approval as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph.

      (D) The commission shall review the endangered species management plan approved by the land owning or managing agency under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph to determine whether the plan achieves the role defined for the land under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. Based on the biology of the endangered species the commission may modify the endangered species management plan if necessary to be consistent with the role the land owning or managing agency has defined for the land under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and shall approve the plan as submitted or modified within 24 months from the date the species is listed as endangered.

      (b) For state agencies other than land owning or managing agencies, the commission, in consultation and cooperation with the agency, shall determine whether the agency can serve a role in the conservation of endangered species. If the commission determines that the agency has a role to play in conservation of the endangered species, the agency shall determine what role it shall serve in conservation of the endangered species. The agency shall make this determination as provided in the commission’s rules related to the biological aspects of species management and in a manner consistent with the agency’s statutory obligations.

WILDLIFE LAW VIOLATOR COMPACT

 

      496.750 Wildlife Law Violator Compact. The Wildlife Violator Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with all other states legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE I

FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY AND PURPOSE

      (a) The party states find that:

      (1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.

      (2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.

      (3) The preservation, protection, management and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational and economic aspects of these natural resources.

      (4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management and restoration laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap or possess wildlife.

      (5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.

      (6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.

      (7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person’s home state:

      (i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or

      (ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or

      (iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.

      (8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to insure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person’s way after receiving the citation, could return to the person’s home state and disregard the person’s duty under the terms of the citation.

      (9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person’s home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person’s way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.

      (10) The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.

      (11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.

      (b) It is the policy of the party states to:

      (1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.

      (2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state.

      (3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator’s way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator’s home state is party to this compact.

      (4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.

      (5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.

      (6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.

      (7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.

      (8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.

      (c) The purpose of this compact is to:

      (1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this Article in a uniform and orderly manner.

      (2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person’s right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.
