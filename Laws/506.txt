The fee shall apply toward any applicable permit fees resulting from an order of the board in favor of the requesting applicant.

      (2) The board shall review a denial as a contested case under ORS chapter 183. Orders issued by the board are not subject to review by the commission, but may be appealed as provided in ORS 183.482.

      (5) The board may adopt such rules as it determines necessary to carry out its duties, functions and powers under this section.

      (6) Once the commission determines that a commercial harvest of a developmental fishery can be sustained, it may remove that fishery from the developmental fisheries list, and may, by rule, establish a restricted participation system or a restricted vessel permit system for that fishery.
