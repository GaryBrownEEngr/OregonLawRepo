SALMON HATCHERY PERMITS

 

      508.700 Permits for salmon hatcheries; fees. (1) The State Fish and Wildlife Commission may issue a permit, subject to such restrictions and regulations as the commission deems desirable, to any person to construct and operate a hatchery for:

      (a) Chinook salmon, also known as Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; or

      (b) Chum salmon, also known as Oncorhynchus keta or dog salmon; or

      (c) Silver salmon, also known as Oncorhynchus kisutch or coho salmon; or

      (d) Pink salmon, also known as Oncorhynchus gorbuscha or humpback salmon.

      (2) The application for a permit to construct and operate a chum salmon, chinook salmon, silver salmon, or pink salmon hatchery shall include an application fee of $3,000. [1971 c.203 §1; 1973 c.356 §1; 1979 c.556 §1; 2009 c.832 §26]

 

      508.705 Hearing for permits. (1) Prior to issuance of any permit by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission, a public hearing shall be held. Notice of the hearing shall be published at least once and at least 10 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the counties in which the hearing is to be held, or if no such newspaper is published in that county or counties, then such a newspaper in an adjoining county.

      (2) The hearing shall be conducted by either the commission or a representative designated by the commission. [1971 c.203 §2; 1975 c.253 §31]

 

      508.710 Grounds for denial of permit. No permit shall be issued:

      (1) Which may tend to deplete any natural run of anadromous fish or any population of resident game fish.

      (2) Which may result in waste or deterioration of fish.

      (3) If the proposed operation is to be located on the same stream or river or tributary thereof on which a state or federal fish culture facility is established or is planned to be established.

      (4) If the proposed operation is not consistent with sound resource management and is not in close proximity to the ocean.

      (5) If the State Fish and Wildlife Commission determines the applicant does not have the financial capability to successfully construct and operate the hatchery or may not properly conduct the operation authorized under the permit. [1971 c.203 §3]

 

      508.715 Conditions of permits. Any permit granted by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission pursuant to ORS 508.700 to 508.745 shall contain at least the following conditions:

      (1) All propagated fish released into state waters shall be marked annually at no less than the level of marking of the same species of fish by hatcheries operated by the commission for the purpose of determining contributions to ocean fisheries.

      (2) All propagated coho and chinook salmon released into state waters shall be marked annually, consistent with subsection (8) of this section, at a minimum level necessary to determine the proportion of straying of hatchery coho and chinook salmon into the spawning beds of natural and hatchery produced native stocks of salmon. However, the commission shall not require private hatcheries to meet marking standards that the commission would not apply to its own operations in similar circumstances.

      (3) Prior to release into state waters, the fish must be subject to examination by a qualified fish pathologist approved by the commission to determine that they are not diseased or infected with any disease which in the opinion of the commission may be detrimental to the state fishery resources. Cost of such examination shall be paid by the permittee. No fish shall be released without written approval from the commission. The commission may require diseased fish to be destroyed. The commission shall not suffer civil or criminal liability for any fish destroyed under this section.

      (4) The permittee may be authorized by the commission to divert all fish returning to the stream to an inspection area, the location of such area to be approved by the commission, to examine all fish for the purpose of identifying propagated fish.

      (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapters 509 and 511, the permittee shall have the right to take for commercial purposes, only those fish the commission determines were propagated by the permittee, and the commission’s decision is final.

      (6) It shall be unlawful for the permittee to select stocks of fish or to genetically alter the life history or habits of propagated fish in a way the State Department of Fish and Wildlife determines is inconsistent with the provisions of ORS 496.012 or 506.109.

      (7) It shall be unlawful for the permittee to conduct any activity not authorized by the permit or fail to conduct activities required by the permit without approval of the commission after public hearings.

      (8) The permittee shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the commission as a result of the operation of the private hatchery. [1971 c.203 §5; 1979 c.556 §5; 1985 c.529 §1; 1989 c.817 §1]

 

      508.718 Program for protecting natural runs and genetic diversity of anadromous fish stocks; rules; findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that protecting the natural runs and genetic diversity of anadromous fish is essential to the long-term health of Oregon’s natural resources and sport and commercial fisheries.

      (2) Not later than January 1, 1990, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall:

      (a) Develop and implement monitoring programs, consistent with ORS 508.715 (8) at a minimum level necessary to determine the proportion of straying of hatchery fish into the spawning beds of natural and hatchery produced native stocks of salmon.

      (b) Utilizing the best available scientific evidence, adopt rules, after public hearing, that determine the proportion of straying that by indicator stock is likely to cause deterioration of the genetic diversity and habitat necessary to maintain long-term species viability or that causes a deterioration of natural or native stocks of salmon.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly further finds that private hatcheries are a significant part of Oregon’s salmon resource and that the Legislative Assembly relies on the State Fish and Wildlife Commission to monitor and regulate private hatcheries in a way that will optimize their long-term contribution to Oregon’s salmon resource in conformity with the findings under subsection (1) of this section. [1989 c.817 §5; 1995 c.79 §295]

 

      508.720 Altering terms of permits; findings; hearing; restoration of fish population. (1) If the State Fish and Wildlife Commission finds that the operation described in the permit is not in the best public interest, it shall alter the conditions of the permit to mitigate such adverse effects or may cause an orderly termination of the operation under the permit. Proceedings to cause such alteration or termination shall be conducted in accordance with ORS chapter 183. An orderly termination shall not exceed a four-year period and shall culminate in the revocation of the permit in its entirety. During this period the permittee may continue to examine and take specified propagated chum salmon, chinook salmon, silver salmon or pink salmon according to the provisions of the permit but may not release additional fish.

      (2) If the commission finds the operation has caused deterioration of the natural run of anadromous fish or any population of resident game fish in the waters covered by the permit, it may require the permittee to return the fish populations to the same condition that existed prior to issuance of the permit. If the permittee fails to take appropriate action, the commission shall take such action and the permittee shall bear any cost incurred by the commission. [1971 c.203 §6; 1973 c.356 §2; 1975 c.253 §32; 1979 c.556 §2; 1989 c.817 §2]

      (2) In carrying out the provisions of ORS 496.162 or 506.129, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission shall not consider evidence of or argument regarding the prospect of adverse economic impact on the activities of hatcheries for which permits have been issued unless the commission determines that it is necessary in order to comply with the policies set forth in ORS 496.012 or 506.109. [1971 c.203 §4; 1979 c.335 §1]

 

      508.730 Disposal of salmon products. After first ensuring that all natural and artificial fish production needs of the State Department of Fish and Wildlife have been met, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission may provide at a reasonable fee chum salmon, chinook salmon, silver salmon or pink salmon, or the sexual products therefrom, for the needs of any person granted a permit by the commission pursuant to ORS 508.700 to 508.745 in the following order of priority:

      (1) The needs of the salmon and trout enhancement program.

      (2) The needs of fish propagation facilities operated under contract or agreement with other state or federal agencies, local governments, special districts and nonprofit organizations.

      (3) The needs of all federal and other fish propagation facilities located on the Columbia River and its tributaries. [1971 c.203 §7; 1973 c.356 §3; 1979 c.556 §3; 1981 c.317 §9; 1995 c.469 §5]

 

      508.735 Application of chapter to taking and sale of salmon.

      508.737 Policy for marketing of salmon products. It is the policy of the State of Oregon that all holders of permits issued pursuant to ORS 508.700 to 508.745 are encouraged to market salmon products obtained pursuant to permit activities in such manner as to promote the development and growth of locally based industries and to provide the maximum benefit to the economy of this state. [1979 c.556 §7]

 

      508.740 Authority under ORS 508.700 to 508.745. (1) Nothing in ORS 508.700 to 508.745 is intended to give the permittee any equity in any of the waters or fish of the state.

      (2) Nothing in ORS 508.700 to 508.745 shall imply an intent to permit commercial fishing in any rivers south of the mouth of the Columbia River except as provided in ORS 508.715 (5). [1971 c.203 §§9,10; 1989 c.817 §3]

 

      508.745 Disposition of moneys received under ORS 508.700 to 508.745. All moneys received by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission under ORS 508.700 to 508.745 except those under ORS 508.735 shall be paid over to the State Treasurer to be held in a suspense account established under ORS 293.445. After the payment of costs of administration incurred by the commission in carrying out the provisions of ORS 508.700 to 508.745, that portion of the balance of the moneys in this suspense account as of the end of each fiscal year shall be deposited to the General Fund for general governmental purposes.

(1) Notwithstanding ORS 508.880, an individual who holds valid commercial fishing permits required by or issued pursuant to the laws of the states of Washington or California to take pink shrimp may land pink shrimp in this state that were taken in the ocean pink shrimp fishery without the permit required by ORS 508.880 if the vessel possesses a single delivery license referred to in ORS 508.285. However, a single delivery license may be used to land pink shrimp only once in a 12-month period as established by rule of the State Fish and Wildlife Director.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section shall apply to a vessel registered under the laws of another state only while laws or administrative rules are operative in that state that contain, in substance or effect, provisions similar to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section. [1979 c.613 §14; 1987 c.912 §9; 1995 c.602 §22; 1999 c.164 §5]

 

      508.886 Limitation on number of permits; eligibility. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, until the number of vessel permits required by ORS 508.880 reaches 235:

      (1) For calendar year 1987, those persons who delivered pink shrimp by use of a single delivery license referred to in ORS 508.285 during calendar year 1986 are eligible to obtain a permit.

      (2) For calendar year 1988, those persons who deliver pink shrimp from their own boats by use of a single delivery license referred to in ORS 508.285 during calendar year 1987 are eligible to obtain a permit, giving priority in the order of the date of delivery. [1987 c.912 §11]

 

      508.889 Issuance of permits limited. Except as provided in ORS 508.904, no new vessel permits shall be issued. [1979 c.613 §15; 1989 c.940 §12; 1995 c.602 §23]

 

      508.892 Renewal of permit; rules. (1) An individual who obtained the permit required by ORS 508.880 for a particular calendar year is eligible to obtain renewal of the permit in a subsequent calendar year upon application and payment of the fees therefor and upon obtaining the annual boat license referred to in ORS 508.285. The permit must be applied for, and the boat license obtained, not later than December 31 of each year or such date as may be established by rule of the State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

      (2) An individual who permanently loses the services of a vessel through capsizing, sinking, fire, collision or other catastrophic accident shall remain eligible to obtain a vessel permit for a replacement vessel for two years from the date of loss. [1979 c.613 §16; 1981 c.365 §6; 1985 c.453 §1; 1987 c.912 §8; 1995 c.602 §24; 1999 c.165 §1; 2007 c.768 §9]

 

      508.895 Considerations in determining eligibility for permit. In making determinations regarding renewal of the permits required by ORS 508.880, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Commercial Fishery Permit Board may consider as evidence of permit qualifications or requirements department records and such receipts, accounts, contracts and other business records of private parties as the department or the board considers reliable evidence of the qualifications or requirements in question. [1979 c.613 §17; 1989 c.940 §13]

 

      508.898 Permit revocation procedure. The Commercial Fishery Permit Board may revoke and refuse subsequent issuance of a permit required by ORS 508.880 in the manner provided in ORS 508.485 (1) and 508.490. [1979 c.613 §18; 2013 c.164 §5]

 

      508.901 Fee; application form; rules. (1) The annual fee for the vessel permit required by ORS 508.880 is:

      (a) $200 for resident applicants.

      (b) $250 for nonresident applicants.

      (2) Applications shall be in such form and contain such information as the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, by rule, may prescribe. [1979 c.613 §19; 1981 c.43 §2; 1987 c.912 §7; 1991 c.701 §15; 2009 c.832 §39; 2011 c.613 §8; 2015 c.779 §39]

 

      508.904 Lottery system for permit issuance. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, if the number of permits renewed under ORS 508.892 falls below 150, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall issue permits by lottery systems for vessels that do not meet such requirements, first among those individuals who landed pink shrimp pursuant to a single delivery license referred to in ORS 508.285, and then among all other individuals making application therefor. However, the number of permits issued pursuant to any such lottery system may not increase the total number of permits issued beyond 150.

      (2) The department shall consider a permit transferred to, purchased by or otherwise held by the federal government as a permit renewed under ORS 508.892. A permit transferred to, purchased by or otherwise held by the federal government is a permit under the limit of 150 permits established by this section. [1979 c.613 §20; 1981 c.365 §7; 1987 c.912 §6; 1989 c.940 §15; 1995 c.602 §25; 2001 c.235 §2]

 

      508.907 Permit transfer restrictions; fee. (1) The vessel permit required by ORS 508.880 is transferable:

      (a) To a replacement vessel of the permit holder. A replacement is any vessel that is purchased for any reason to replace a vessel previously owned by and licensed to the permit holder;

      (b) To the purchaser of the vessel when the vessel is sold; or

      (c) To a replacement vessel owned by an individual other than the permit holder. However, any transfer of a permit away from a vessel without the written consent of each person holding a security interest in such vessel is void.

      (2) A permit may be transferred to a vessel of greater length only if that vessel is within 5 feet in overall length of the vessel from which the permit is being transferred. This provision does not apply if the permit is being transferred from one vessel owned by an individual to another vessel not exceeding 80 feet in length that is owned by the same individual.

      (3) A permit may not be transferred to another vessel more than once in a 12-month period. However, the Commercial Fishery Permit Board may waive the waiting period if the board finds that strict adherence to the waiting period would create undue hardship for the individual seeking transfer of the permit.

      (4) A fee of $100 shall be charged for each transfer of a vessel permit under this section. [1979 c.613 §21; 1981 c.365 §8; 1995 c.602 §26; 1999 c.165 §2; 2009 c.832 §40]

 

      508.908 Limits on authority of Commercial Fishery Permit Board to prohibit transfer of valid pink shrimp vessel permits. The Commercial Fishery Permit Board may not prohibit the transfer under ORS 508.907 of a valid ocean pink shrimp vessel permit on the basis that:

      (1) The vessel for which the permit was issued did not participate in the ocean pink shrimp fishery for three or more preceding consecutive years to annually land at least 5,000 pounds of shrimp in Oregon, California or Washington; or

      (2) The holder of the permit did not obtain an exemption from the catch requirement. [1999 c.165 §4]

 

      Note: 508.908 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 508 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      508.910 Review of permit denial; fee; rules; limitation on transfer of certain permits. (1) An individual whose application for renewal of the permit required by ORS 508.880 is denied by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife may make written request to the Commercial Fishery Permit Board for review of the denial. The review provided in this subsection is in lieu of any such review by the department or the State Fish and Wildlife Commission. The request shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the board considers appropriate. The request shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $125. Such fee shall apply toward the permit fee of successful applicants.

      (2) In accordance with any applicable provision of ORS chapter 183, the board shall review denials of applications for renewal of permits. Orders issued by the board are not subject to review by the commission, but may be appealed as provided in ORS 183.480 to 183.540. The board may waive requirements for renewal of permits if the board finds that the individual fails to meet the requirements as the result of illness, accident or other circumstances beyond the individual’s control.

      (3) In accordance with any applicable provision of ORS chapter 183, the board may promulgate such rules as it considers necessary to carry out its duties, functions and powers.

      (4) The board may delegate to the department its authority to waive requirements for renewal of permits. [1979 c.613 §22; 1981 c.365 §9; 1989 c.940 §14; 1995 c.602 §27; 1999 c.165 §3; 2009 c.832 §41]

 

      508.913 Issuance of permits for vessels engaged in groundfish fishery; permit transfer restriction. (1) The Commercial Fishery Permit Board is authorized to receive applications and issue ocean pink shrimp vessel permits for 1982 to trawl vessel owners for those vessels that did not qualify for or receive an ocean pink shrimp permit in 1980, if the board finds that the vessel has been actively engaged in Oregon’s groundfish fishing since January 1, 1974, or entered that fishery subsequent to January 1, 1974, but prior to July 1, 1979, and has continued to be actively engaged in that Oregon fishery.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, without the prior approval of the Commercial Fishery Permit Board, an ocean pink shrimp vessel permit acquired pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may not be transferred to another vessel until the vessel for which the permit was issued has been used in the ocean pink shrimp fishery for two or more calendar years. [1981 c.365 §22]

 

      508.915 Negotiations to establish reciprocal agreements pertaining to pink shrimp. The State Fish and Wildlife Director shall work with the appropriate authorities in the states of California and Washington to negotiate reciprocal agreements that would allow vessels registered under the laws of those states to land pink shrimp in Oregon to the same extent that vessels registered in Oregon may land pink shrimp in California or Washington. [1999 c.164 §6]

 

      Note: 508.915 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 508 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      508.920 [1979 c.613 §10; 1983 c.419 §3; 1987 c.374 §3; 1995 c.484 §8; renumbered 508.755 in 1995]

 

(Ocean Dungeness Crab Fishery)

 

      508.921 Findings; rules. The Legislative Assembly finds that the Oregon ocean Dungeness crab fishery is overcapitalized. This overcapitalization has led to economic destabilization of the ocean Dungeness crab industry and the coastal communities relying on the crab harvest and can cause excessive harvesting pressure on Oregon’s ocean Dungeness crab resources. Since the state legislatures of Washington and California have enacted programs restricting participation in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery, the possibility of increased effort in Oregon coastal waters by displaced vessels is increased. Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, in order to promote the economic well-being of the Oregon ocean Dungeness crab industry and the coastal communities relying on the harvest, to protect the livelihood of participants in the Oregon ocean Dungeness crab fishery who have historically and continuously participated in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery and to prevent a concentration of fishing effort, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission by rule shall establish a system for restricting participation in the Oregon ocean Dungeness crab fishery. [1995 c.484 §2]

 

      508.926 Vessel permit required to engage in fishery; purchase of crab by dealer from individual without permit prohibited. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, it is unlawful for an individual to operate a vessel in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery without first obtaining a vessel permit issued pursuant to ORS 508.931 or 508.941.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, it is unlawful for a wholesaler, canner or buyer to buy or receive ocean Dungeness crab taken in the ocean fishery from a vessel for which the permit required by subsection (1) of this section has not been issued.

      (3) The permit required by subsection (1) of this section is in addition to and not in lieu of the boat license required by ORS 508.260. [1995 c.484 §3]

 

      508.931 Eligibility for permit. (1) The system established under ORS 508.921 shall provide initial eligibility for vessels to participate in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery seasons established by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission, beginning on December 1, 1995, with a transferable ocean Dungeness crab permit only if:

      (a) The vessel for which application is made was continuously licensed pursuant to ORS 508.260 for the calendar years 1991 through 1994, and was used in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery to lawfully land into Oregon ports at least 500 pounds of ocean Dungeness crab in each of two crab fishing seasons between December 1, 1988, and December 31, 1994;

      (b) The vessel for which application is made was under construction between December 1, 1988, and August 14, 1991, for the purpose of ocean Dungeness crab fishing in waters of this state, and the vessel lawfully landed into Oregon ports at least 500 pounds of ocean Dungeness crab in each of two crab fishing seasons between December 1, 1988, and December 31, 1994, and was licensed as an Oregon vessel from the date of completion;

      (c) The vessel for which application is made was used in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery to lawfully land into Oregon ports at least 500 pounds of ocean Dungeness crab in each of two crab fishing seasons between December 1, 1991, and December 31, 1994, and is owned by a person who, prior to December 31, 1994, sold a vessel that was used prior to sale in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery to lawfully land into Oregon ports at least 500 pounds of ocean Dungeness crab in each of two crab fishing seasons between December 1, 1988, and December 31, 1994, and who, as a condition of the sale, retained the sold vessel’s commercial fishing rights to fish for ocean Dungeness crab in the ocean waters of Oregon;

      (d) The vessel for which application is made was continuously licensed pursuant to ORS 508.260 for the calendar years 1991 through 1994, was used in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery to lawfully land into Oregon ports at least 10,000 pounds of ocean Dungeness crab in one crab fishing season between December 1, 1988, and December 31, 1994, and the owner of the vessel on December 31, 1994, demonstrates possession of one or more vessel licenses described in ORS 508.260 in each of 10 separate years during the period December 1, 1980, to December 31, 1994; or

      (e) The vessel for which application is made was licensed pursuant to ORS 508.260 during 1994, is 26 feet or less in length and was used in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery to lawfully land into Oregon ports at least 100 pounds of ocean Dungeness crab in at least one crab fishing season between December 1, 1988, and December 31, 1994.

      (2) As used in this section:

      (a) “Crab fishing season” is the time period from December 1 of one year through August 14 of the next year.

      (b) “Owner” includes any ownership interest in a vessel, including interests arising from partnership or corporation. [1995 c.484 §4]

 

      508.934 Permit revocation procedure. The Commercial Fishery Permit Board may revoke and refuse subsequent issuance of a vessel permit required by ORS 508.926 in the manner provided in ORS 508.485 (1) and 508.490. [2014 c.1 §2]

 

      Note: 508.934 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 508 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      508.936 Permit transfer restrictions; rules; fee. (1) The system established under ORS 508.921 shall include provisions to make the vessel ocean Dungeness crab permit required by ORS 508.926 transferable:

      (a) To another vessel; or

      (b) To the purchaser of the vessel when the vessel is sold.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the vessel to which a permit is transferred may not be:

      (a) More than 10 feet longer than the vessel from which the permit is transferred; or

      (b) More than 99 feet in length.

      (3) A permit that is transferred to a vessel that is more than 10 feet shorter than the vessel for which the permit was held on January 1, 2013, may subsequently be transferred to a vessel of a length equal to or less than the length of the vessel for which the permit was held on January 1, 2013.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a permit issued to a vessel:

      (a) Under ORS 508.931 (1)(e) shall be transferred only to a vessel that is 26 feet or less in length.

      (b) May not be transferred to a vessel that is more than 10 feet longer than the vessel for which the permit was held on January 1, 2006. However, the Commercial Fishery Permit Board may waive the length restriction in this paragraph if the board finds that strict adherence to the length restriction would create undue hardship, as that term is defined by rule by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission, for the individual seeking transfer of the permit.

      (5) Transfer of a permit under this section is subject to the approval of the State Department of Fish and Wildlife according to such rules as the State Fish and Wildlife Commission may adopt. Any transfer of a permit from a vessel without the written consent of each person holding a security interest in the vessel is void.

      (6) For purposes of this section, the length of a vessel shall be determined by the manufacturer’s specification of overall length, United States Coast Guard documentation stating overall length or a survey of overall length by a certified marine surveyor, as the State Fish and Wildlife Commission by rule shall establish.

      (7) A fee of $100 shall be charged for each transfer of a vessel permit under this section. [1995 c.484 §5; 2005 c.629 §3; 2009 c.832 §42; 2014 c.1 §5]

 

      508.941 Review of eligibility determinations; reciprocity with other states; fee. (1) The system established under ORS 508.921 shall include any other provisions for participation that the State Fish and Wildlife Commission considers appropriate.

      (2) Any determination by the commission regarding the eligibility of a vessel to participate in the ocean Dungeness crab commercial fishery or to transfer participation rights is subject to review by the Commercial Fishery Permit Board, in accordance with ORS chapter 183. The board may waive the eligibility requirements contained in ORS 508.931 if the board finds that the individual fails to meet the requirements as the result of illness, fire, sinking, accident or other circumstances beyond the individual’s control. In making a determination of eligibility under this section, the board shall consider the applicant’s history of participation in the Oregon ocean Dungeness crab fishery. If a vessel for which application is made is owned by a person who has served in the Armed Forces of the United States and the person establishes that a service-related disability prevented the person from lawfully landing crab in two seasons during the prescribed time period, there is a rebuttable presumption in favor of issuing an illness waiver for one of the two seasons of lawfully landing crab in Oregon required under ORS 508.931 so as to require the landing of crab in only one season during the prescribed time period. The rebuttable presumption created by this subsection may be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence that the service-related disability of the person did not prevent the person from lawfully landing crab in two seasons during the prescribed time period. Orders issued by the board are not subject to review by the commission, but may be appealed as provided in ORS 183.480 to 183.540.

      (3) A commercial fishing vessel that holds a valid Washington or California permit to fish for ocean Dungeness crab shall be eligible to participate in the Oregon ocean Dungeness crab fishery provided there is reciprocal statutory authority in Washington or California that provides for equal access for vessels holding Oregon ocean Dungeness crab permits to Washington or California coastal waters and Washington waters of the Columbia River. If such reciprocal statutory authority exists, a vessel licensed by Washington or California is eligible to participate in accordance with rules that establish reciprocal border agreements that recognize traditional fishing patterns.

      (4) The annual fee to participate in the ocean Dungeness crab fishery is:

      (a) $200 for resident applicants.

      (b) $250 for nonresident applicants. [1995 c.484 §6; 1997 c.837 §9; 2009 c.832 §43; 2011 c.613 §9; 2015 c.779 §40]

 

      508.943 Requirements related to removal of crab pots; exemptions; permits for removal; rules. (1) As used in this section, “crab fishing season” has the meaning given that term in ORS 508.931.

      (2) A person may not leave a crab pot used as part of the ocean Dungeness crab fishery in the waters of this state more than 15 days after the closure of the crab fishing season.

      (3) The State Fish and Wildlife Commission may issue permits to persons for the removal of crab pots left in violation of subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) Regardless of whether the person who removes the crab pot originally set the crab pot; and

      (b) If the permit holder also holds a boat license issued pursuant to ORS 508.260.

      (4) By rule the commission:

      (a) Shall establish provisions related to the disposition of the crab pots by the permit holder who removes the crab pots.

      (b) May restrict the removal of crab pots to specific geographic areas.

      (5) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife may exempt certain owners of crab pots from the requirements of subsection (2) of this section. If the department exempts certain owners under this subsection, the department must notify the holders of permits issued under subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) The provisions of ORS 98.005, 98.015, 98.025 and 98.302 to 98.436 do not apply to crab pots removed under the provisions of this section. [2013 c.142 §2]

 

(Black and Blue Rockfish and Nearshore Fishery)

 

      508.945 Vessel permit required; rules; purchase of black or blue rockfish or nearshore fish from individual without permit prohibited; exemptions. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws and except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a person may not operate a vessel for:

      (a) Landing black rockfish or blue rockfish in a fishery without a black rockfish and blue rockfish vessel permit issued under ORS 508.947; or

      (b) Landing nearshore fish in a fishery without a black rockfish and blue rockfish vessel permit with a nearshore fish endorsement issued under ORS 508.947.

      (2)(a) The State Fish and Wildlife Commission may prescribe by rule the type of fishing gear that a vessel required to have a permit under this section shall use to land black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish.

      (b) The commission may not prescribe a rule under this subsection that allows a vessel to use:

      (A) Diving gear.

      (B) Pots, unless a vessel was issued a pot endorsement in the Interim Nearshore Fisheries Plan through the Developmental Fisheries Program enacted by the commission.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, a wholesaler, canner or buyer may not buy or receive black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish taken in a fishery from a vessel for which the permit required by this section has not been issued, unless the black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish were taken pursuant to subsection (4)(a), (b) or (c) of this section.

      (4) A person may operate a vessel without a permit required by this section if the person:

      (a) For only one landing per day, lands no more than 15 pounds of black rockfish, blue rockfish, nearshore fish or a combination of black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish and if the black rockfish, blue rockfish and nearshore fish:

      (A) Make up 25 percent or less of the total poundage of the landing; and

      (B) Are landed with fishing gear that is legal to use in the fishery in which the black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish are landed;

      (b) Operates a vessel in the ocean troll salmon fishery pursuant to ORS 508.801 to 508.825 and the person lands black rockfish, blue rockfish or a combination of black rockfish and blue rockfish in the same landing in which the person lands a salmon under the permit required by ORS 508.801 to 508.825. The black rockfish or blue rockfish landed under this paragraph must be landed dead. A person who lands black rockfish and blue rockfish under this paragraph may land up to the greater of:

      (A) 30 black rockfish or 30 blue rockfish per landing or a combination of 30 black rockfish and blue rockfish per landing; or

      (B) 100 pounds of black rockfish, blue rockfish or a combination of black rockfish and blue rockfish per landing;

      (c) Operates a vessel in the west coast groundfish trawl fishery pursuant to federal regulations and lands no more than 1,000 pounds of black rockfish, blue rockfish or a combination of black rockfish and blue rockfish per calendar year and if the black rockfish and blue rockfish:

      (A) Make up 25 percent or less of the total poundage of each landing; and

      (B) Are landed dead; or

      (d) Is a nonprofit aquarium or has contracted with a nonprofit aquarium to land black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish for the purpose of displaying or conducting research on the black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish.

      (5) Notwithstanding the amounts set forth in subsection (4)(b) of this section, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission may change the amounts of black rockfish, blue rockfish or the combination of black rockfish and blue rockfish allowed to be landed under subsection (4)(b) of this section by rule based on an assessment of the resource. [2003 c.809 §2]

 

      508.947 Eligibility for permit; renewal; rules. (1) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife may issue a black rockfish and blue rockfish vessel permit to an owner of a vessel that landed a minimum of 750 pounds of nontrawl caught black rockfish, blue rockfish or nearshore fish in any one calendar year between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2001, or in the six-month period between January 1, 2001, and July 1, 2001, for delivery to a fish processor licensed pursuant to ORS 508.025.

      (2) The department may issue a black rockfish and blue rockfish vessel permit with a nearshore fish endorsement to an owner of a vessel that was issued a permit under the Interim Nearshore Fisheries Plan through the Developmental Fisheries Program.

      (3) The department may renew a black rockfish and blue rockfish vessel permit or a black rockfish and blue rockfish vessel permit with a nearshore fish endorsement if the vessel made a minimum of five commercial fish landings during the calendar year prior to the request for renewal for delivery to a fish processor licensed pursuant to ORS 508.025.

      (4) Permits issued under this section expire on December 31 of each year or on such date as may be specified by department rule. An owner of a vessel with a permit must submit a renewal application to the department by January 1 of each year or by such date as may be specified by department rule. If the owner of a vessel with a permit does not timely submit a renewal application, the department shall, not more than 30 days after the application was due, send to the owner by certified letter a notice of the failure to submit the renewal application.
