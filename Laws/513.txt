      513.020 Control and regulation of means of handling fish and fish products. In order that all fish or parts thereof suitable for human consumption may be conserved and used for that purpose, and to provide sanitary methods and prevent waste in the use, sale, packing, preserving, manufacturing, processing or other handling of fish or fish products, other than salmon, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission may control and regulate fishing boats, barges, lighters or tenders, receptacles or vehicles containing fish or fishing gear, fish reduction plants or plants where fish products are manufactured, in so far as may be necessary to insure the taking, catching, delivery of fish, canning, packing, preserving, reduction of and manufacture of fish products or by-products in a wholesome and sanitary manner, and to prevent deterioration or waste of any fish.

 

      513.030 Inspection of means of handling fish and fish products. Any member, assistant or employee of the State Fish and Wildlife Commission, or duly authorized officer of the state, may enter any canning, packing, preserving or reduction plant or place of business where fish or other fish products are packed, preserved, manufactured, bought or sold, or board and inspect any fishing boat, barge, lighter or tender, receptacle or vehicle, containing fish, for the purpose of examining any fish or fish products and to ascertain the amount of fish received, or kind and amount of fish products packed or manufactured and the number and size of containers or cans for fish products purchased, received, used or on hand.

 

      513.040 Control and regulation of amount and kind of fish commercially handled; sardine processing. The State Fish and Wildlife Commission may:

      (1) Control, regulate and establish, by order, the proportion or percentage of sardines, pilchards, herring or other species of fish other than salmon, to be used for reduction purposes or the manufacture of fish flour, fish meal, fish scrap, fertilizer or oil, and may further, through such order, specifically name or prescribe the particular species of fish which may be used for reduction purposes, food for animals or other purposes.

      (2) Exercise full jurisdiction and control over the processing, packing or preserving of sardines, and prescribe and specify the process to be used in the canning of such fishes in order to assure a quality product and prevent the use of certain substitute oils resulting in inferior grades.
