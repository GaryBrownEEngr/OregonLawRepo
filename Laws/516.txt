      (8) Collect a library of literature describing the geology and mineral deposits, metallic and nonmetallic, of Oregon.

      (9) Make qualitative examinations of rocks, mineral samples and specimens.

      (10) Study minerals and ores, additional uses for the state’s minerals, and explore the possibilities for using improved treatment, processes, mining methods and reclamation techniques for regulated mines and abandoned mined lands.

      (11) Establish in the department or in cooperation with universities and other organizations a repository for drill cores and samples considered by the department to be of long term use in developing information.
