GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      517.005 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Mining contributes to the economy and well-being of the people of Oregon. Mining creates high-paying jobs in parts of this state that, due to a lack of infrastructure and development, are less likely to be capable of diversifying beyond a regional economy based on natural resources. Mining creates secondary industries in the surrounding region and attracts numerous providers of goods and services. Mining also generates significant tax revenues for local governments and provides support for civic and educational projects in local communities.

      (2) The mining of minerals is a natural resource use.

      (3) In eastern Oregon, including Lake, Harney, Malheur, Baker and Grant Counties, diversifying the types of natural resource uses that contribute to local economies enables those economies to better withstand temporary economic declines that affect specific natural resource uses. In the same way that a diversified economy is good for a large metropolitan area, a diversified natural resource economy is good for eastern Oregon.

      (4) Technological advances in the mining industry, coupled with reclamation efforts, have greatly reduced the environmental impacts of mining operations. The size and scope of modern operations is such that the operations do not cause interference with other natural resource uses, particularly in an area as vast as eastern Oregon.

      (5) Mining operations should be encouraged and supported in eastern Oregon as a means for residents and communities to improve their economies and well-being. [2015 c.826 §1]

 

      Note: 517.005 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 517 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

MINING CLAIMS

 

(Veins or Lodes)

 

      517.010 Location of mining claims upon veins or lodes. (1) Any person, a citizen of the United States, or one who has declared an intention to become such, who discovers a vein or lode of mineral-bearing rock in place upon the unappropriated public domain of the United States within this state, may locate a claim upon such vein or lode by posting thereon a notice of such discovery and location. The notice shall contain:

      (a) The name of the lode or claim.

      (b) The names of the locators.

      (c) The date of the location.

      (d) The number of linear feet claimed along the vein or lode each way from the point of discovery, with the width on each side of the lode or vein.

      (e) The general course or strike of the vein or lode as nearly as may be, with reference to some natural object or permanent monument in the vicinity, and by defining the boundaries upon the surface of each claim so that the same may be readily traced.

      (2)(a) Such boundaries shall be marked within 30 days after posting of such notice by four substantial posts, projecting not less than three feet above the surface of the ground, and made of wood measuring not less than one and one-half inch by one and one-half inch, or by substantial mounds of stone, or earth and stone, at least two feet in height, one such post or mound of rock at each corner of such claims.

      (b) During the course of normal maintenance of the claim location posts or monuments, any post that requires replacement and is not constructed of naturally occurring materials shall be replaced by posts that are made of wood measuring not less than one and one-half inch by one and one-half inch on a side and that project not less than three feet above the surface of the ground.

      (3) At such time as any lode mining claim is declared invalid by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management or is otherwise dropped by the last claim holder of record without transfer through lease or sale to another person, all claim location posts not made of natural materials shall be removed from the public domain of the United States and at the same time any post made of natural materials shall be removed or dismantled. [Amended by 1991 c.215 §1]

 

      517.020 [Repealed by 1971 c.228 §1]

 

      517.030 Recording copy of location notice; fee. The locator shall, within 60 days from the posting of the location notices by the locator upon the lode or claim, record with the clerk of the county where the claim is situated, who shall be the custodian of mining records and miners’ liens, a copy of the notice posted by the locator upon the lode or claim and shall pay the clerk a fee for such recording as provided in ORS 205.320, which sum the clerk shall immediately pay over to the treasurer of the county and shall take a receipt therefor, as in case of other county funds coming into the possession of such officer. The clerk shall immediately record the location notice. [Amended by 1971 c.228 §2; 1971 c.621 §33; 1973 c.598 §4; 1975 c.607 §36; 1979 c.833 §31; 1991 c.230 §25; 1999 c.654 §28]

 

      517.040 Abandoned claims. Abandoned claims are unappropriated mineral lands, and titles thereto shall be obtained as specified in ORS 517.010 and 517.030, without reference to any work previously done thereon.

 

(Placer Deposits)

 

      517.042 “Legal subdivision” defined for ORS 517.042 to 517.052. As used in ORS 517.042 to 517.052, unless the context requires otherwise, “legal subdivision” means a subdivision of a state survey or of a United States survey which has been extended over the geographic area to be described. [1961 c.525 §1]

 

      517.044 Location of claims upon placer deposits; posting notice. Any individual, a citizen of the United States, or one who has declared an intention to become such, who discovers a placer deposit of minerals upon the unappropriated public domain of the United States within this state, which minerals are subject to location under the mineral and mining laws of the United States, may locate a placer claim thereon by posting in a conspicuous place thereon a notice of such discovery and location. The notice shall contain:

      (1) The name of the claim.

      (2) The name of the individual or individuals locating the claim.

      (3) The date of the location of the claim.

      (4) The number of feet or acres claimed, together with a description, either by legal subdivisions, if practicable, or if not, then by reference to some natural object or permanent monument in the vicinity of the claim, which will identify the claim located. [1961 c.525 §2]

 

      517.046 Marking boundaries of claim or locating by legal subdivisions. (1) Unless the claim for placer deposit referred to in ORS 517.044 is located by legal subdivisions, the surface boundaries of the claim must be marked so that the same may be readily traced. Such boundaries shall be marked within 30 days after the posting of the notice described in ORS 517.044 by substantial posts or other monuments of the same size, materials and dimensions as in the case of quartz claims. The boundaries of the claim shall be marked at each corner or angle, and, when any side or end of the claim extends for more than 1,320 feet without a corner or angle, then at intervals of not less than 1,320 feet along such side or end.

      (2) Where the claim for placer deposit referred to in ORS 517.044 is taken by legal subdivisions, no other reference in the notice of claim required to be posted and filed under the provisions of ORS 517.042 to 517.052 than to the legal subdivisions shall be required and the boundaries of a claim so located and described need not be staked or monumented. The description by legal subdivisions in the notice required to be filed under ORS 517.052 shall be deemed the equivalent of marking the surface boundaries of the claim. [1961 c.525 §3]

 

      517.048 [1961 c.525 §4; repealed by 1971 c.228 §1]

 

      517.050 [Renumbered as part of 517.065]

 

      517.052 Recording copy of location notice; fee. The individual locating a placer deposit shall, within 60 days from the posting of the location notice upon the claim, record with the clerk of the county where the claim is situated, a copy of the notice posted by the individual upon the claim. The fee for recording such location notice shall be the fee provided for in ORS 205.320. The clerk shall immediately record the location notice. [1961 c.525 §5; 1971 c.228 §3; 1991 c.230 §26; 1999 c.654 §29]

 

(General Provisions)

 

      517.060 Correcting defective notice of location. If at any time an individual who has located a mining claim within the meaning of ORS 517.010 or 517.044, or the assigns of the individual, apprehends that the original notice of location of the mining claim was defective, erroneous, or that the requirements of the law had not been complied with before the filing of the notice, such locator or assigns may post and record in the manner now provided by law, an amended notice of the location which shall relate back to the date of the original location. However, the posting and recording of the amended notice of location shall not interfere with the existing rights of others at the time of posting the amended notice. [Amended by 1961 c.525 §7; 1991 c.230 §27]

 

      517.065 Effect of noncompliance with law in locating claim. (1) Subject to ORS 517.060, all locations or attempted locations of quartz mining claims subsequent to December 31, 1898, that do not comply with ORS 517.010 and 517.030 are void.

      517.070 Certain locations subject to prior rights. Any location of any mining claim made upon any natural stream, or contiguous or near to any placer mine, or upon or below the dump of any placer mine, shall be subject to the prior right of all mines in operation prior to the making of such location, to discharge debris, gravel, earth, and slickens which were or may be discharged at the time of making such subsequent location.

 

      517.080 Mining claims as realty. All mining claims, whether quartz or placer, are real estate. The owner of the possessory right thereto has a legal estate therein within the meaning of ORS 105.005.

 

      517.090 Application to claims of law governing transfers and mortgages of realty. All conveyances of mining claims or of interests therein, either quartz or placer, whether patented or unpatented, are subject to the provisions governing transfers and mortgages of other realty as to execution, recordation, foreclosure, execution sale and redemption. However, such redemption by the judgment debtor must take place within 60 days from date of confirmation, or such right is lost. [Amended by 2003 c.14 §339]

 

      517.100 Sums payable on redemption of claim; interest. In case of redemption from sale under judgment, the redemptioner shall pay such sums as are now required by law for redemption under execution sale, and such additional sum as may have been expended upon the property so redeemed by the purchaser under execution, or the assigns of the purchaser, in order to keep alive the possessory right thereto after the execution sale, not exceeding $100 for each claim, with 10 percent interest thereon from date of such expenditures. [Amended by 2003 c.576 §466]

 

      517.110 Grubstaking contracts. All contracts of mining copartnership, commonly known as “grubstaking,” shall be in writing, and recorded with the clerk of the county wherein the locations thereunder are made. Unless contracts of mining copartnership contain the names of the parties thereto and the duration thereof, the contracts are void. [Amended by 1991 c.230 §28]

MINING USING MOTORIZED EQUIPMENT IN BEDS AND BANKS OF RIVERS

 

      517.140 Legislative findings; mining using motorized equipment in beds and banks of rivers. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Prospecting, small scale mining and recreational mining are part of the unique heritage of the State of Oregon.

      (2) Prospecting, small scale mining and recreational mining provide economic benefits to the State of Oregon and local communities and support tourism, small businesses and recreational opportunities, all of which are economic drivers in Oregon’s rural communities.

      (3) Exploration of potential mine sites is necessary to discover the minerals that underlie the surface and inherently involves natural resource disturbance.

      (4) Mining that uses motorized equipment in the beds and banks of the rivers of Oregon can pose significant risks to Oregon’s natural resources, including fish and other wildlife, riparian areas, water quality, the investments of this state in habitat enhancement and areas of cultural significance to Indian tribes.

      (5) Between 2007 and 2013, mining that uses motorized equipment in the beds and banks of the rivers of Oregon increased significantly, raising concerns about the cumulative environmental impacts.

      (6) The regulatory system related to mining that uses motorized equipment in the beds and banks of the rivers of Oregon should be efficient and structured to best protect environmental values. [2013 c.783 §1]

 

      Note: 517.140 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 517 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

EXTINGUISHING DORMANT MINERAL INTEREST

 

      517.170 Policy. It is in the interest of the State of Oregon to provide a mechanism for the removal of dormant encumbrances on property which prevent a landowner from using or developing that property in a manner which contributes to the economy and increases the state’s tax base. [1983 c.421 §1]

 

      517.180 Procedure for extinguishing dormant mineral interest. (1) An owner of land in which another person holds a mineral interest, may extinguish the holder’s interest by publishing notice and submitting an affidavit of publication for recording as described in subsections (4) to (9) of this section, unless:

      (a) Within the last 30 years, the holder of the mineral interest has submitted a statement of claim for recording in the manner set out in subsection (3) of this section; or

      (b) The holder of the mineral interest acquired the mineral interest within the previous 30 years.

      (2) For the purposes of this section:

      (a) “Mineral interest” includes any interest that is created by an instrument transferring, either by grant, assignment, reservation or otherwise, an interest of any kind in coal, oil, gas or other minerals and geothermal resources, except an interest vested in the United States, the State of Oregon or a political subdivision of the State of Oregon. A mineral interest does not include an interest in sand or gravel.

      (b) “Owner of land” includes a vested fee simple owner or a contract purchaser.

      (3) The statement of claim referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be submitted for recording in the office of the clerk of the county in which the land affected by the mineral interest is located and shall contain:

      (a) The name and address of the holder of the mineral interest as that name is shown in the instrument that created the original mineral interest; and

      (b) The name and address of the current holder of the mineral interest.

      (4) To extinguish the mineral interest held by another person, and acquire ownership of that interest, the owner of the land shall publish notice of the lapse of the mineral interest at least once each week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the lands affected by the mineral interest are located. If the address of the mineral interest holder is known or can be determined by due diligence, the notice shall also be mailed by the owner of the land to the holder of the mineral interest before the first publication.

      (5) The notice required in subsection (4) of this section shall include:

      (a) The name of the holder of the mineral interest, as shown of record;

      (b) A reference to the instrument creating the original mineral interest, including where it is recorded;

      (c) A description of the lands affected by the mineral interest;

      (d) The name and address of the person giving the notice;

      (e) The date of first publication of the notice; and

      (f) A statement that the holder of the mineral interest must submit a statement of claim to the county clerk within 60 days after the date of the last publication or the mineral interest of the holder may be extinguished.

      (6) A copy of the notice and an affidavit of publication of the notice, as described in subsection (7) of this section, shall be submitted to the county clerk within 15 days after the date of the last publication of the notice in the office of the clerk of the county where the lands affected by the mineral interest are located.

      (7) The affidavit of publication shall contain either:

      (a) A statement that a copy of the notice was mailed to the holder of the mineral interest and the address to which it was mailed; or

      (b) If no copy of the notice was mailed, a detailed description, including dates, of the efforts made to determine with due diligence the address of the holder of the mineral interest.

      (8) If the owner of the land affected by the mineral interest gives notice as required in subsection (4) of this section and submits a copy of the notice and the affidavit of publication for recording as required by subsection (6) of this section, the mineral interest of the holder shall be extinguished and become the property of the owner of the lands, unless the holder of the mineral interest submits a statement of claim to the county clerk within 60 days after the date of the last publication of the notice.

      (9) Upon receipt, the clerk of the county shall record a statement of claim or a notice and affidavit of publication of notice in the Mineral and Mining Record. When possible, the clerk shall also indicate by marginal notation on the instrument creating the original mineral interest the recording of the statement of claim or notice and affidavit of publication of notice. The clerk of the county shall record a statement of claim by cross-referencing in the Mineral and Mining Record the name of the current holder of the mineral interest and the name of the original holder of the mineral interest as set out in the statement of claim.

      (10) The provisions of this section may not be waived at any time. [1983 c.421 §2; 1997 c.819 §10; 1999 c.654 §31]

If the delinquent co-owner can be found in any other county, then the notice shall be served by the sheriff of that county. If the delinquent co-owner cannot be found within the state, or if at the time of giving the notice the delinquent co-owner is without the state, service of the notice shall be made by publication thereof in the weekly newspaper published in the county nearest to where the mine is situated. If there are two or more papers published in the county at the same distance from the mine, the co-owner giving notice may elect in which paper the notice shall be published. If no weekly newspaper is published within the county, service of the notice shall be made by publication in any other weekly newspaper within the state published nearest the mine. The notice shall be published at least once a week for a period of 90 days after the first publication.

 

      517.260 Notice; return and proof of service. If the notice is served by any sheriff as provided in ORS 517.250, the sheriff shall make return by filing the notice with the return showing service with the county recorder, or if there is none, with the county clerk, for the county within which the mine is situated. If personal service cannot be had as provided in ORS 517.250, proof of service shall be made by filing with the county recorder, or if there is none, with the county clerk of the county in which the mine is situated, the notice as published, attached to an affidavit made by the printer, foreman, or publisher of the newspaper, to the effect that it is of general circulation throughout the county, is published weekly, and that the notice was published at least once a week in that newspaper for a period of not less than 90 days after the first publication of the notice.

 

      517.270 Vesting of interest of delinquent co-owner. If at the expiration of 90 days from the date of personal service of the notice upon the delinquent co-owner or from the date of the last publication of the notice, the delinquent co-owner has not paid the proportion of the delinquent co-owner to the co-owners who performed or caused to be performed the assessment work, the title to the interest of the delinquent co-owner in the mine shall be immediately vested in the co-owners who performed or caused to be performed the assessment work.

 

      517.280 Certificate of ownership; issuance. The co-owners who performed the assessment work may file with the county clerk of the county where the mine is situated, their affidavits that the payment has not been made. Upon the filing of such affidavits, the clerk shall record the notice, proof of service and affidavits in the Mineral and Mining Record. The clerk shall then and there issue to the co-owners who performed or caused to be performed the assessment work, a certificate to the effect that the clerk has recorded the notice, proof of service and affidavits of nonpayment, and that the co-owners who performed or caused to be performed the assessment work have become and are the owners of all the right, title and interest of the delinquent co-owner or co-owners of the property. [Amended by 1991 c.230 §30; 1999 c.654 §34]

 

      517.290 Fee for certificate. The certificate described in ORS 517.280 shall not be issued until the co-owners entitled to it pay to the clerk a fee as set by ORS 205.320. [Amended by 1971 c.621 §35; 1975 c.607 §38; 1979 c.833 §33; 1991 c.230 §31]

 

      517.300 Effect of certificate; certified copy of certificate, notice and return admissible as evidence. (1) A certificate issued as provided in ORS 517.280 shall be equivalent to a deed from a delinquent co-owner of all the interest of the delinquent co-owner in and to all mines described in the notice, and shall convey the interest of the delinquent co-owner in the premises to the co-owner or co-owners who performed or caused to be performed the assessment work. The certificate may be introduced in evidence in any cause where ownership of the property may become material. When so introduced, it shall have the same force and effect as would a duly executed and delivered deed from the delinquent co-owner.

      (2) A certified copy of the certificate, and of the notice and return, when made and certified to by the county clerk, shall be admissible in evidence in any trial where it is material to establish proof of service of the notice or ownership of the property.

 

      517.310 Recording and indexing certificate; fee; effect. The certificate given by the county clerk shall be recorded in the office of the officer issuing it, upon payment of the fee established under ORS 205.320.

      Note: 517.753 was added to and made a part of 517.702 to 517.989 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      517.755 Mining operations affecting more than five acres. Notwithstanding the yard and acre limitations of ORS 517.750 (16), as soon as any mining operation begun after July 1, 1975, affects more than five acres of land the provisions of ORS 517.702 to 517.989 apply to the mining operation. [1975 c.724 §1a; 1979 c.435 §3; 1985 c.292 §3; 1985 c.565 §80; 1989 c.347 §13; 1999 c.353 §7; 2007 c.318 §15; 2017 c.736 §13]

 

      Note: 517.755 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 517 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      517.760 Policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (a) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to recognize the important and essential contribution that the extraction of minerals makes to the economic well-being of the state and the nation and to prevent unacceptable adverse impacts to environmental, scenic, recreational, social, archaeological and historic resources of the state that may result from mining operations, while permitting operations that comply with the provisions set forth in ORS 517.702 to 517.951.

      (b) Proper reclamation of surface-mined lands is necessary to prevent undesirable land and water conditions that would be detrimental to the general welfare, health, safety and property rights of the citizens of this state.

      (c) Surface mining takes place in diverse areas where the geologic, topographic, climatic, biological and social conditions are significantly different and that reclamation operations and the specifications therefor must vary accordingly.

      (d) It is not practical to extract minerals required by our society without disturbing the surface of the earth and producing waste materials and that the very character of many types of surface mining operations precludes complete restoration of the affected lands to their original condition.

      (e) Reclamation of surface-mined lands as provided by ORS 517.702 to 517.951 will allow the mining of valuable minerals in a manner designed for the protection and subsequent beneficial use of the mined and reclaimed lands.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly, therefore, declares that the purposes of ORS 517.702 to 517.951 are:

      (a) To provide that the usefulness, productivity and scenic values of all lands and water resources affected by surface mining operations within this state shall receive the greatest practical degree of protection and reclamation necessary for their intended subsequent use.

      (b) To provide for cooperation between private and governmental entities in carrying out the purposes of ORS 517.702 to 517.951 and reclamation of abandoned mined lands that may pose a hazard to public health, safety or the environment. [1971 c.719 §1; 1985 c.292 §4; 1993 c.342 §1]

 

      517.770 Exemptions from reclamation requirements. (1) The following mining operations are exempt from the reclamation requirements set forth in ORS 517.702 to 517.989:

      (a) Lands within the surfaces and contours of surface mines in existence on July 1, 1972, or vertical extensions of those surfaces and contours, provided that the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries issued a certificate of exemption to the mining operation on or before October 31, 2000.

      (b) Lands within the surfaces and contours of surface mines in existence on July 1, 1972, or vertical extensions of those surfaces and contours, provided that:

      (A) The surface mining operations at the site were allowed under a comparable certificate of exemption that was issued by a county and current on the date of repeal of a county zoning law or ordinance described in ORS 517.780 (1); and

      (B) The landowner or operator applies for and receives a certificate of exemption from the department. An application for a certificate of exemption must be filed with the department within 90 days after the date the county’s repeal of a zoning law or ordinance becomes effective. If the department does not approve or disapprove the application within 90 days after the date the application is filed with the department, the application will be deemed to be approved.

      (c) Lands within the surfaces and contours of surface mining operations that are owned or operated by a person that, on July 1, 1972, was a party to a surface mining contract that was valid on January 1, 1971, provided that the department issued a certificate of exemption to the mining operation on or before September 20, 1985.

      (2) A certificate of exemption terminates if the landowner or operator does not renew the certificate annually. [1971 c.719 §15; 1973 c.709 §1; 1975 c.724 §2; 1985 c.292 §5; 1987 c.260 §2; 1987 c.361 §§1,1a; 1999 c.492 §1; 2009 c.270 §1]

 

      517.775 Permit fee for certain landowners and operators; erosion stabilization at mining operations exempt from reclamation. Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 517.770:

      (1) Any landowner or operator conducting surface mining on July 1, 1972, shall pay the permit fee as provided in ORS 517.800; and

      (2) The State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall require the landowner or operator to complete erosion stabilization upon completion of mining at a mining operation exempt from reclamation under ORS 517.770. [1971 c.719 §17; 1979 c.435 §4; 1985 c.292 §17; 1987 c.260 §3; 1987 c.361 §2; 1999 c.492 §2; 2009 c.270 §2]

 

      517.780 Effect on county zoning laws or ordinances; rules; certain operations exempt. (1)(a) The provisions of ORS 517.702 to 517.989 and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder do not supersede any county zoning laws or ordinances in effect on July 1, 1972. However, if the county zoning laws or ordinances are repealed on or after July 1, 1972, the provisions of ORS 517.702 to 517.989 and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder are controlling. The governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries may adopt rules and regulations with respect to matters covered by county zoning laws and ordinances in effect on July 1, 1972.

      (b) If the county zoning laws or ordinances specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection are repealed by a county:

      (A) The department may allow a surface mining operation that previously operated under a valid county operating permit and reclamation plan to continue to operate for a period not to exceed one year if the landowner or operator applies for an operating permit under ORS 517.790 within 60 days after the date the county’s repeal of the zoning laws or ordinances becomes effective, pays all applicable fees to the department and submits a bond or security to the department as required by ORS 517.810. Pending issuance of an operating permit and approval of a reclamation plan by the department, the county permit is deemed to remain in effect and is enforceable by the department.

      (B) The department, in issuing a permit and approving a reclamation plan for a surface mining operation that previously operated under a valid county operating permit as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, may incorporate any provisions from the county operating permit into the permit issued by the department and the reclamation plan approved by the department if the department determines that the provisions provide adequate protection of the public health, safety and welfare and the environment.

      (C) The department may issue a certificate of exemption from reclamation requirements as described in ORS 517.770 (1)(b).

      (2) City or county operated surface mining operations that sell less than 5,000 cubic yards of minerals within a period of 12 consecutive calendar months are exempt from the state mining permit requirements of ORS 517.702 to 517.989 if the city or county adopts an ordinance that includes a general reclamation scheme establishing the means and methods of achieving reclamation for city or county operated surface mining sites exempted from the state permit requirements by this subsection. [1971 c.719 §16; 1975 c.724 §3; 1977 c.524 §1; 1979 c.435 §1; 1983 c.20 §1; 1985 c.292 §6; 1987 c.361 §9; 2003 c.14 §340; 2007 c.318 §6; 2009 c.270 §3]

 

      517.785 [1983 c.20 §3; 1985 c.292 §7; 1987 c.361 §8; repealed by 2007 c.318 §28]

 

      517.790 Operating permit required for surface mining on certain lands; application for permit; proposed reclamation plans; waiver of requirement for preparation and approval of reclamation plan; refusal to issue operating permit; provisional operating permit. (1) A landowner or operator may not allow or engage in surface mining on land not surface mined on July 1, 1972, without holding a valid operating permit from the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries for the surface mining operation. A separate permit is required for each separate surface mining operation. A person seeking an operating permit from the department shall submit an application on a form provided by the department that contains the following information:

      (a) The name and address of the landowner and the operator and the names and addresses of any persons designated by them as their agents for the service of process.

      (b) The materials for which the operation is to be conducted.

      (a) The operation is conducted as part of the on-site construction of a building, public works project or other physical improvement of the subject property;

      (b) The operation is reasonably necessary for such construction; and

      (c) The proposed improvements are authorized by the local jurisdiction with land use authority.

      (3) The department may not issue an operating permit to an operator other than the owner or owners of the surface and mineral interests of the lands included within the surface mining area unless the operator:

      (a) Has written approval from the owner or owners of all surface and mineral interests of the lands included within the surface mining area; and

      (b) Maintains a legal interest in the lands that is sufficient to ensure that the operator has the authority to operate and reclaim the lands as provided in the operating permit and reclamation plan.

      (4) The department may refuse to issue an operating permit to a person who has not, in the determination of the department, substantially complied with the conditions of an operating permit or reclamation plan, the provisions of this chapter or the rules adopted by the department to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

      (5) The department shall issue a provisional operating permit to an applicant that has not obtained all required federal, state and local permits and approvals for the proposed mining operation, provided:

      (a) The applicant has complied with this chapter and the rules adopted by the department to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and

      (b) The permit:

      (A) Does not become effective until the applicant obtains all required permits and approvals; and

[1997 c.184 §1]

 

      Note: 517.795 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 517 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      517.797 Memorandum of agreement with Department of State Lands regarding permitting. (1) As used in this section, “surface mining” has the meaning given that term in ORS 517.750 and “waters of this state” has the meaning given that term in ORS 196.800.

      (2) The Department of State Lands and the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries may enter into a memorandum of agreement concerning surface mining as described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) The memorandum described in subsection (2) of this section may assign sole responsibility for permitting to the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries when the surface mining would otherwise be under the permitting jurisdiction of both the Department of State Lands and the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries because:

      (a) Part of the surface mining is located within the beds or banks of any waters of this state; and

      (b) Part of the surface mining is located upland from the beds or banks of any waters of this state.

      (4) Prior to any permitting pursuant to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall consult with the Department of State Lands regarding any conditions necessary to protect the waters of this state. [2011 c.406 §1]

 

      Note: 517.797 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 517 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      517.800 Fees; rules; annual report. (1)(a) Except for an application for a mining operation submitted under ORS 517.910 to 517.989, each applicant for an operating permit under ORS 517.702 to 517.989 shall pay to the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries a fee established by the State Geologist in an amount not to exceed $1,750.

      (b) If an application for a new permit or an amendment to an existing permit requires extraordinary department resources because of concerns about slope stability or proximity to waters of the state or other environmentally sensitive areas, the applicant shall pay to the department an additional fee in an amount determined by the State Geologist to be adequate to cover the additional costs for staff and other related expenses. The State Geologist shall consult with the applicant when determining the amount of the fee.

      (2) Annually, each holder of an operating permit shall pay to the department a base fee of $850, plus $0.0095 per ton of aggregate or mineral ore extracted during the previous 12-month period.

      (3) If a reclamation plan is changed, the operator may be assessed for staff time and other related costs an amount not to exceed $1,750 in addition to the annual renewal fee. This subsection does not apply to a mining operation that is subject to the fee established by ORS 517.973 (2)(a).

      (4) If, at operator request, the department responds to requests for information required by a local government in making a land use planning decision on behalf of the operator for a specific site, the State Geologist may require the operator to pay the department a fee for staff time and related costs. The department shall notify the operator in advance of the estimated costs of providing the information, and the actual amount assessed shall not exceed the estimate provided by the department.

      (5) The State Geologist may require the operator of a site to pay to the department a special inspection fee in an amount not to exceed $500 for an inspection conducted under the following circumstances:

      (a) Investigation of surface mining operations conducted without the operating permit required under ORS 517.790; or

      (b) Investigation of surface mining operations conducted outside the area authorized in an operating permit.

      (6) Upon request of an applicant or operator, the department shall provide an itemized list and documentation of expenses used to determine a fee under subsection (1)(b), (3) or (4) of this section.

      (7) Notwithstanding the per ton fee established in subsection (2) of this section, the governing board of the department may lower to zero or raise the per ton fee up to $0.0095 if necessary to provide financial certainty to the department or to reflect actual expenses of the department in administering ORS 517.702 to 517.951.

      (8) All fees collected by the department under this section shall be deposited in the Mined Land Regulation and Reclamation Program Subaccount within the Geology and Mineral Industries Account. The department shall prepare and submit to the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries an annual report on the financial status of the Mined Land Regulation and Reclamation Program Subaccount.

      (9) The governing board of the department:

      517.820 Extensions of time for submission of proposed reclamation plans; time limit for reclamation completion; consultation with cooperating agencies. (1) Upon good cause shown, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries may grant reasonable extensions of time for the completion by the landowner or operator and the submission to the department of a proposed reclamation plan required by ORS 517.790. Each reclamation plan submitted to the department must provide that all reclamation activities shall be completed within three years after the termination of mineral extraction from the surface mining operation conducted within each separate area for which an operating permit is requested. Each such reclamation plan shall be approved by the department if it adequately provides for the reclamation of surface-mined lands.

      (2) Prior to approving a proposed reclamation plan, the department shall consult with all other cooperating agencies and appropriate local planning authorities. [1971 c.719 §5; 1977 c.59 §2; 2007 c.318 §17; 2017 c.736 §4]

 

      517.825 Mining aggregate on high-value farmland; requirements; rules. (1) As used in this section, “significant aggregate resource” means the average minimum depth of aggregate, determined by rule of the Land Conservation and Development Commission, that is required for a local government to find that the aggregate resource is significant pursuant to a statewide land use planning goal that protects natural resources and conserves scenic, historic and open space resources.

      (2) When the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries issues an operating permit under ORS 517.790 for mining aggregate on high-value farmland composed predominantly of Class I and Class II soils in the Willamette Valley, the department shall require:

      (a) An operator or owner to excavate substantially all of the significant aggregate resource within the operating permit boundary, not including any buffer, setback and sloping areas:

      (A) To the extent that the removal of the significant aggregate resource can be done in a manner that is consistent with operating permit conditions imposed by the department; and

      (B) Subject to limitations imposed by other federal, state or local regulatory requirements.

      (b) An applicant to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that the operator or owner has the mechanical ability to comply with paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) Performance of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection before approving final reclamation and closure of the mining operation, unless:

      (A) The operator or owner defaults as described in ORS 517.860; or

      (B) Performance is not required due to changed conditions or new information that justify a permit modification under ORS 517.831.

      (3) The acceptance by the department of a plan to mine in compliance with subsection (2)(a) of this section does not establish a depth standard for purposes of land use permits or authorizations.

      (4) The time limitations imposed on the department under ORS 517.830 do not apply to an application for an operating permit, or the transfer of a permit under ORS 517.833, that is subject to this section.

      (5) This section does not require the operator or owner to provide bond or security to excavate to the permitted depth. [2013 c.706 §3]

 

      517.830 Operating permit approval process; appeal from denial of plan; consolidated application process. (1) Upon receipt of an application for an operating permit, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall:

      (a) Inspect the operating site described in the application;

      (b) Provide notice to the local jurisdiction and an opportunity for the local jurisdiction to, within 30 days after the date of the notice, request that the department delay a decision on an operating permit and reclamation plan as provided in subsection (4) of this section; and

      (c) If the application is not subject to the consolidated application process under ORS 517.952 to 517.989, provide notice to each federal and state permitting agency, as defined in ORS 517.952, and each cooperating agency and provide an opportunity for the agencies to, within 30 days after the date of the notice, respond in writing to the department identifying reasonably expected adverse effects of the proposed mining operation on land, air, water or wildlife resources.

      (2) Within 90 days after the date that the application and the required permit fee are received, the department shall issue the operating permit applied for or, if it considers the application incomplete, return the application to the applicant for correction of the deficiencies indicated by the department. An operating permit that is not subject to ORS 517.952 to 517.989 shall contain reasonable conditions designed to avoid or minimize an adverse effect identified by an agency pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section, provided:

      (a) A permit issued by a federal, state or local permitting agency approving the mining operation does not include provisions to mitigate the adverse effect; and

      (b) The land use decision issued by the local government approving the mining operation does not include provisions to mitigate the adverse effect.

      (3) Failure by the department to act upon the reclamation plan submitted with an application for an operating permit within the 90-day period referred to in subsection (2) of this section is not a denial by the department of the operating permit applied for. The department, pending final approval of a reclamation plan, may issue a provisional permit subject to reasonable limitations that may be prescribed by the department and conditioned upon the applicant’s compliance with the bond and security requirements established by ORS 517.810.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if an application involves an aggregate site that requires a permit issued pursuant to ORS 215.427 or 227.178, and if the local jurisdiction requests that the application not be decided until the local jurisdiction has taken final action, the department shall make a final decision on the operating permit and reclamation plan no later than 165 days after the date a complete land use application is submitted to the local jurisdiction, unless the applicant agrees to allow additional time under ORS 215.427, 215.429, 227.178 or 227.179. If a plan amendment is required as part of issuance of a permit, the provisions of paragraph (b) of this subsection apply. The department may not approve an operating permit and reclamation plan if the land use application is denied.

      (b) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if an application involves an aggregate site that requires amendment to a comprehensive plan, as defined in ORS 197.015, and if the local jurisdiction requests that the application not be decided until the local jurisdiction has taken final action on the plan amendment, the department may not make a final decision on the operating permit and reclamation plan until the local jurisdiction has taken final action on the plan amendment. The department shall make its final decision within 45 days of the date that the local jurisdiction has taken final action on the plan amendment. The department may not approve an operating permit and reclamation plan if the plan amendment is denied.

      (5) Conditions and requirements imposed on an operating permit and reclamation plan, and modifications thereto, issued subsequent to issuance of a local jurisdiction permit shall be compatible with the requirements and conditions of the local government permit, unless more stringent requirements are necessary to comply with the provisions of ORS 517.750 to 517.901.

      (6)(a) If a local jurisdiction does not request that the department delay a decision on an operating permit and reclamation plan as provided in subsections (1)(b) and (4) of this section, the department shall, prior to issuing the operating permit, give the local jurisdiction notice and an opportunity to provide comments and the following information about the proposed operating permit and reclamation plan:

      (A) Information about any applicable local land use regulations;

      (B) Whether the site described in the proposed operating permit and reclamation plan is included on a local government inventory required by any open spaces, scenic and historic areas and natural resources land use planning goal;

      (C) A statement that an application has or has not been filed for local approval; and

      (D) Any other information that the local jurisdiction considers pertinent in its review of the application.

      (b) A local jurisdiction shall respond to a notice provided under paragraph (a) of this subsection within 35 days after the date of the notice.

      (7) If the department refuses to approve a submitted reclamation plan, it shall notify the applicant, in writing, of its reasons for the refusal to approve the reclamation plan, including additional requirements as may be prescribed by the department for inclusion in the reclamation plan. Within 60 days after the receipt of the notice, the applicant shall comply with the additional requirements prescribed by the department for the reclamation plan or file with the department a notice of appeal from the decision of the department with respect to the reclamation plan. If a notice of appeal is filed with the department by the applicant, the department may issue a provisional permit to the applicant.

      (8) If an application is submitted as part of the consolidated application process under ORS 517.952 to 517.989, review of the application and approval or denial of the application shall be in accordance with ORS 517.952 to 517.989. However, the review and approval or denial shall take into consideration all policy considerations for issuing a permit under ORS 517.702 to 517.989. [1971 c.719 §6; 1975 c.724 §5; 1985 c.292 §10; 1991 c.243 §2; 1991 c.735 §29; 1999 c.353 §5; 1999 c.492 §4; 1999 c.533 §13; 2001 c.104 §226; 2007 c.318 §8; 2015 c.492 §1; 2017 c.736 §5]

      517.860 Effect of failure to comply with operating permit or reclamation plan; department may perform work and assess costs against bond or security. (1) If, from inspections conducted pursuant to ORS 517.850 or from any other source, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries determines that the operator has not complied with or is not complying with the operating permit, the reclamation plan, the provisions of this chapter or the rules of the department, the department may issue either or both of the following to the operator:

      (a) Written notice of the violation. The notice shall specifically outline the deficiencies.

      (b) A compliance order. The order may specify a date by which the operator shall rectify any deficiencies. The department may extend the period if delays occasioned for causes beyond the operator’s control necessitate more time, but only when the operator is, in the opinion of the department, making a reasonable effort to comply with the order.

      (2) The department may recover against the bond or alternative form of financial security and reclaim the area affected by surface mining if the department determines that an operator:

      (a) Has failed to comply with a department order issued under subsection (1) of this section;

      (4) If the landowner has given security as provided in ORS 517.810 (3) and the operator is in default as specified in subsection (2) of this section, the landowner shall be held responsible for complying with the reclamation plan of the operator. The department shall furnish written notice of the default to the landowner and require the landowner to complete the reclamation as specified in the operator’s reclamation plan acceptable to the department. If the landowner has not commenced action to rectify the deficiencies within 30 days after receiving notice, or if the landowner fails to diligently pursue reclamation in conformance with the plan, the department may demand payment of the amount of the bond or other security from the surety or other holder and otherwise proceed as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

      (5) The department, in performing reclamation of surface-mined land, shall pursue a goal for reclamation designed to:

      (a) Remove hazards;

      (b) Protect from drainage problems and from pollution;

      (c) Meet local land use requirements for reclamation; and

      (d) Comply with all federal and state laws.

      (6) The department may delay, for a reasonable time not to exceed one year, all or part of any reclamation activities if the department determines that it is likely that:

      (a) Marketable mineral reserves exist at the permitted site; and

      (b) A new operator will seek an operating permit for the site and assume all reclamation responsibilities. [1971 c.719 §10; 1975 c.724 §6; 1977 c.59 §3; 1983 c.497 §2; 1985 c.291 §3; 1997 c.183 §1; 1999 c.353 §6; 1999 c.492 §5; 2007 c.318 §11]

 

      517.862 Revocation, termination or refusal to renew operating permit. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries may not revoke, terminate or refuse to renew an operating permit if marketable reserves exist at the permitted site and if there is a significant potential for continued mining opportunities given reasonably foreseeable economic conditions.

      (2) The department may revoke, terminate or refuse to renew an operating permit if the operator:

      (a) Requests termination, provided that all reclamation requirements in the operating permit and reclamation plan have been satisfied;

      (b) Fails to pay a fee as required by ORS 517.800 within 60 days of the due date;

      (c) Fails to provide or maintain a bond or security as required by ORS 517.810;

      (d) Fails to comply with an order issued under ORS 517.860; or

      (e) Fails to comply with a suspension order issued under ORS 517.880.

      (3) If an operating permit is revoked, terminated or not renewed, the operator may not perform any actions at the permitted site, except that the operator may, after receiving written approval from the department:

      (a) Perform actions at the permitted site that are necessary to comply with reclamation requirements in the operating permit or reclamation plan, including but not limited to removal of mining-related stockpiles;

[1991 c.735 §24]

 

      517.987 Reclamation bond or security; annual assessment of cost of reclamation; lien; release of security; post-reclamation security. (1) At the time of submitting a consolidated application under ORS 517.971, the applicant shall estimate the total cost of reclamation consistent with the standards imposed under ORS 517.702 to 517.989. Using the reclamation estimate and a credible accident analysis as a guide, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall make an initial determination as to the amount of the reclamation bond necessary to protect human health and the environment. The department shall distribute a bond proposal to all permitting and cooperating agencies. The amount of the bond that the department may require to cover the actual cost of reclamation shall not be limited.

      (2) The reclamation bond or alternative security acceptable to the department shall be posted before the start of mining operations. The bond shall be issued by a bonding company licensed to operate in Oregon. A mining operation may not satisfy the requirements for a bond through self-insurance.

      (3) The department shall assess annually the overall cost of reclamation. If changes in the operation or modifications to a permit cause the cost of reclamation to exceed the amount of the reclamation bond currently held by the state, the operator shall post an additional bond for the difference. All reclamation calculations shall be approved by the department. Incremental surety increases shall be provided for, with the level of surety being consistent with the degree and forms of surface disturbance anticipated within a time period specified by the department. When the actual surface area to be disturbed approaches the level expected by the department, the operator shall notify the department sufficiently in advance of reaching the acreage limit specified to allow for a review of surety requirements and posting of additional surety by the operator prior to exceeding the acreage limit set by the department.

      (4) If reclamation costs will exceed the posted bond and the operator does not increase the bond amount, the department and other permitting agencies shall suspend all permits until the operator posts the additional bond security.

      (5) The department may seek a lien against the assets of the operator to cover the cost of reclamation if the bond posted is insufficient. The amount of the lien shall be the amount of the costs incurred by the department to complete reclamation. All current operating permits of the operator shall be suspended and the department shall deny immediately all pending applications of the operator to conduct mining operations.

      (6)(a) The operator shall submit to the department a written request for the release of its reclamation bond. If the operator has conducted concurrent reclamation, the operator shall submit an application for bond reduction which estimates the percentage of reclamation done to date and the corresponding percentage of reclamation funds that the operator believes should be returned. A bond release or reduction request shall state in unambiguous terms all measures taken to reclaim the site and any problem or potential problems that may inhibit reclamation in accordance with permit requirements.

      (b) The department shall distribute the request to each permitting or cooperating agency, to members of the public who participated in the consolidated application under ORS 517.952 to 517.989, and to any person who requests notification. In addition, the department shall publish a notice as provided in ORS 517.959 announcing receipt of a request for bond release or bond reduction.

      (c) No sooner than 60 days after distributing the request and providing notice of the receipt of the request, the department shall conduct an informal public hearing to determine whether to allow the bond release or bond reduction.

      (7) The department may require security or an annuity for post-reclamation monitoring and care to be paid before the final bond release. The security or annuity shall be sufficient to cover long-term site care and monitoring needs. The department shall determine the amount of the proposed security or annuity and distribute a proposal to all permitting and cooperating agencies. [1991 c.735 §24a; 2007 c.318 §27]

 

      517.988 Permit conditions by State Department of Fish and Wildlife; violations of State Department of Fish and Wildlife conditions. (1) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall develop conditions for the protection of fish and wildlife resources that shall be included in any permit issued by the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries under the process established under ORS 517.952 to 517.989.

      (2) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall have the right of ingress and egress to and from a mine operating under a permit that includes conditions imposed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, doing no unnecessary injury to the property of the mine operator, to determine whether the operator is complying with such conditions. If the State Department of Fish and Wildlife determines that a violation has occurred, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall inform the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries of the violation and the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall cooperate with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to take appropriate enforcement action. [1991 c.735 §24b; 2013 c.371 §23]
