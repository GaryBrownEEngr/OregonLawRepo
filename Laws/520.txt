SPACING UNITS

 

      520.210 Establishment of spacing units for pool or field; purpose; scope; effect. (1) When necessary to prevent waste of oil or gas, to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells or to protect correlative rights, the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall establish spacing units for a pool or field. Spacing units when established shall be of uniform size and shape for the entire pool or field, except that when found to be necessary for any of the above purposes the board is authorized to divide any pool or field into zones and establish spacing units for each zone, which units may differ in size and shape from those established in any other zone. The board may not establish spacing units for injection wells, withdrawal wells or monitoring wells drilled for the purpose of storing gas or other gaseous substances, or wells drilled for the underground disposal of fluids.

      (2) The size and shape of spacing units shall be such as will result in efficient and economical development of the pool or field as a whole and the size thereof may not be smaller than the maximum area that can be efficiently drained by one well.

      (3) An order establishing spacing units for a pool or field shall specify the size and shape of each unit and the location of each permitted well thereon in accordance with a reasonably uniform spacing plan. If an owner finds that a well drilled at the prescribed location would not produce in paying quantities or that surface conditions would substantially add to the burden or hazard of drilling such well, then the owner may apply to the department for permission to drill a well at a location other than that prescribed by such spacing order. The department shall notify adjacent mineral owners of such application and any such owner may request a hearing by the board to consider the application. If no request for a hearing is made in writing within 20 days, the department may issue an order approving the drilling site. Any order by the board or department under this section shall include in the order suitable provisions to prevent the production from the spacing unit of more than its just and equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool.

      (4) An order establishing spacing units for a pool or field shall cover all lands determined or believed to be underlaid by such pool or field and may be modified by the board from time to time to include additional areas determined to be underlaid by such pool or field. When necessary to prevent waste of oil or gas, to protect correlative rights or to provide for more efficient drainage, an order establishing spacing units in a pool or field may be modified by the board to increase the size of spacing units for future wells in a pool or field or any zone thereof or to permit the drilling of additional wells on a reasonably uniform plan in such pool, field or zone. [Formerly 520.065; 1981 c.146 §4; 2007 c.672 §18]

 

      520.220 Integrating interests or tracts within spacing unit. (1) When two or more separately owned tracts are embraced within a spacing unit or when there are separately owned interests in all or a part of such spacing unit, then the interested persons may integrate their tracts or interests for the development and operation of the spacing unit.

      (2) In the absence of voluntary integration, the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, upon the application of any interested person, shall make an order integrating all tracts or interests in the spacing unit for the development and operation thereof and for the sharing of production therefrom. The board, as a part of the order establishing one or more spacing units, may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the royalty interests in the units shall, in the absence of voluntary agreement, be deemed to be integrated without the necessity of a subsequent order integrating royalty interests. Each such integration order shall be upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable. [Formerly 520.075]

 

UNIT OPERATIONS

 

      520.230 Approved agreement for cooperative or unit development of pool not to be construed as violating certain regulatory laws. (1) An agreement for the unit or cooperative development and operation of a field or pool in connection with the conduct of repressuring or pressure maintenance operations, cycling or recycling operations, including the extraction and separation of liquid hydrocarbons from natural gas in connection therewith, or any other method of operation, including water floods, is authorized and may be performed and shall not be held or construed to violate ORS 59.005 to 59.505, 59.710 to 59.830, 59.991 and 59.995 or any of the statutes of this state relative to trusts, monopolies or contracts and combinations in restraint of trade, if such agreement is approved by the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries as being in the public interest, for the protection of correlative rights and reasonably necessary to increase ultimate recovery or prevent waste of oil or gas. The failure to submit such an agreement to the board for approval does not, for that reason, imply or constitute evidence that the agreement or operations conducted pursuant thereto violate ORS 59.005 to 59.505, 59.710 to 59.830, 59.991 and 59.995 or any statute of this state now or hereafter in effect relating to trusts and monopolies.

      (2) An agreement for the unit or cooperative development or operation of a field, pool or part thereof may be submitted to the board for approval as being in the public interest or reasonably necessary to prevent waste or protect correlative rights. Approval by the board constitutes a complete defense to any proceeding charging violation of ORS 59.005 to 59.505, 59.710 to 59.830, 59.991 and 59.995 or of any statute of this state now or hereafter in effect relating to trusts and monopolies on account thereof or on account of operations conducted pursuant thereto. The failure to submit such an agreement to the board for approval does not, for that reason, imply or constitute evidence that the agreement or operations conducted pursuant thereto violate ORS 59.005 to 59.505, 59.710 to 59.830, 59.991 and 59.995 or any statute of this state now or hereafter in effect relating to trusts and monopolies. [Formerly 520.085; subsection (2) enacted as 1961 c.671 §13; 1963 c.69 §1]

 

      520.240 Voluntary unitization of operations by lessees of tidal or submersible lands; Department of State Lands’ function. (1) For the purpose of properly conserving the natural resources of any single oil or gas pool or field, lessees under ORS 274.705 to 274.860 and their representatives may unite with each other jointly or separately, or jointly or separately with others owning or operating lands not belonging to the state, in collectively adopting and operating under a cooperative or unit plan of development or operation of the pool or field, whenever it is determined by the Department of State Lands to be necessary or advisable in the public interest.

      (2) The Department of State Lands may, with the consent of the holders of the leases involved, establish, alter, change and revoke any drilling and production requirements of such leases, and make such regulations with reference to such leases, with like consent on the part of the lessees, in connection with the institution and operation of any such cooperative or unit plan, as the Department of State Lands deems necessary or proper to secure the proper protection of the interests of the state. [1961 c.619 §33]

 

      520.260 Hearing to determine need for unitization of operations; required findings; order. (1) The governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries upon its own motion may, and upon the application of any interested person shall, hold a hearing to consider the need for the operation as a unit of one or more pools or parts thereof in a field.

      (2) The board shall make an order providing for the unit operation of a pool or part thereof if it finds that:

      (a) Unit operation is reasonably necessary to effectively carry on pressure control, pressure maintenance or repressuring operations, cycling operations, water flooding operations, injection operations, or any combination thereof, or any other method of recovery designed to substantially increase the ultimate recovery of oil from the pool or pools; and

      (b) The value of the estimated additional recovery of oil or gas exceeds the estimated additional cost incident to conducting unit operations. [1961 c.671 §2; 2007 c.672 §19]

 

      520.270 Plan for unit operations. An order issued pursuant to ORS 520.260 shall be upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable, and shall prescribe a plan for unit operations that includes the following:

      (1) A description of the pool or pools or parts thereof to be so operated.

      (2) A statement of the nature of the operations contemplated.

      (3) An allocation to the separately owned tracts in the unit area of all the oil and gas that is produced from the unit area and is saved, being the production that is not used in the conduct of operations on the unit area or not unavoidably lost.

      (4) A provision for the credits and charges to be made in the adjustment among the owners in the unit area for their respective investments in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials and equipment contributed to the unit operations.

      (5) A provision stating how the costs of unit operations, including capital investments, shall be determined and charged to the separately owned tracts and how these costs shall be paid, including a provision stating when, how and by whom the unit production allocated to an owner who does not pay the share of the cost of unit operations charged to such owner, or the interest of such owner, may be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of such costs.

      (6) A provision, if necessary, for carrying or otherwise financing any person who elects to be carried or otherwise financed, allowing a reasonable interest charge for such service payable out of that person’s share of the production.

      (7) A provision for the supervision and conduct of the unit operations, in respect to which each person shall have a vote with a value corresponding to the percentage of the costs of unit operations chargeable against the interest of that person.

      (8) The time when the unit operations shall commence, and the manner in which, and the circumstances under which, the unit operations shall terminate.

      (9) Additional provisions that are found appropriate for carrying on the unit operations, and for the protection of correlative rights. [1961 c.671 §3]

 

      520.280 Allocation of production under plan; ownership. (1) The allocation described in ORS 520.270 (3) shall be in accord with the agreement, if any, of the interested parties. If there is no such agreement, the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries shall determine the relative value, from evidence introduced at the hearing, of the separately owned tracts in the unit area, exclusive of physical equipment, for development of oil and gas by unit operations. The production allocated to each tract shall be the proportion that the relative value of each tract so determined bears to the relative value of all tracts in the unit area.

      (2) That portion of the unit production allocated to any tract, and the proceeds from the sale thereof, are the property and income of the several persons to whom, or to whose credit, they are allocated or payable under the order providing for unit operations. [1961 c.671 §§4,10]

 

      520.290 When unitization order to become effective; supplemental hearings. (1) No order of the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries providing for unit operations is effective until:

      (a) The plan for unit operations prescribed by the board under ORS 520.270 has been approved in writing by (A) those owners who, under the board’s order, will be required to pay at least 75 percent of the costs of the unit operation, and (B) those persons who, at the time of the order of the board, owned of record legal title to 75 percent of royalty and overriding royalty payable with respect to oil and gas produced from the pool or part thereof over the entire unit area; and

      (b) The board has made a finding, either in the order providing for unit operations or in a supplemental order, that the plan for unit operations has been so approved.

      (2) If the plan for unit operations has not been approved pursuant to subsection (1) of this section at the time the order providing for unit operations is made, the board shall upon application and notice hold such supplemental hearings as are required to determine if and when the plan for unit operations has been approved. If the persons owning the percentage of interest in the unit area required by subsection (1) of this section do not approve the plan for unit operations within a period of six months after the date on which the order providing for unit operations is made, the order is ineffective and shall be revoked by the board unless the board, for good cause shown, extends the time for approval. [1961 c.671 §5]

 

      520.300 Amending unitization order. An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order made by the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order providing for unit operations. However:

      (1) If the amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the approval of the amendment by the royalty owners is not required.

      (2) The order of amendment may not change the percentage for the allocation of:

      (a) Oil and gas as established for any separately owned tract by the original order, except with the consent of all persons owning oil and gas rights in the tract; or

      (b) Cost as established for any separately owned tract by the original order, except with the consent of all owners in the tract. [1961 c.671 §6; 2007 c.672 §20]

 

      520.310 Unitization of area including area previously unitized; partial unitization of pool. (1) The governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries by order may provide for the unit operation of a pool or pools or parts thereof that embrace a unit area established by a previous order of the board. The order, in providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first treat as a single tract the unit area previously established, and the portion of the unit production so allocated thereto shall then be allocated among the separately owned tracts included in the previously established unit area in the same proportions as those specified in the previous order.

      (2) An order may provide for unit operations on less than the whole of a pool where the unit area is of such size and shape as may reasonably be required for that purpose, and the conduct thereof will have no adverse effect upon other portions of the pool. [1961 c.671 §§7,8; 2007 c.672 §21]

 

      520.320 Unitization order does not terminate prior agreements or affect oil and gas rights; acquisition of property during unit operations. (1) No division order or other contract relating to the sale or purchase of production from a separately owned tract may be terminated by the order providing for unit operations, but remains in force and applies to oil and gas allocated to that tract until terminated in accordance with the provisions thereof.

      (2) Except to the extent that the parties affected so agree, no order providing for unit operations results in a transfer of all or any part of the title of any person to the oil and gas rights in any tract in the unit area.

      (3) All property, whether real or personal, that may be acquired in the conduct of unit operations under ORS 520.260 to 520.330 and 520.230 (2) shall be acquired for the account of the owners within the unit area, and is the property of such owners in the proportion that the expenses of unit operations are charged. [1961 c.671 §§11,12]

 

      520.330 Effect of operations in unit area. All operations, including but not limited to the commencement, drilling or operation of a well, upon any portion of the unit area, are considered for all purposes the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit area by the several owners thereof. The portion of the unit production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit area, when produced, is considered for all purposes to have been actually produced from that tract by a well drilled thereon. Operations conducted pursuant to an order of the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries providing for unit operations constitute a fulfillment of all the express or implied obligations of each lease or contract covering lands in the unit area to the extent that compliance with such obligations cannot be had because of the order of the board. [1961 c.671 §9; 2007 c.672 §22]

 

UNDERGROUND RESERVOIRS

 

      520.340 Legislative findings. The underground storage of natural gas in Oregon is found by the Legislative Assembly to be in the public interest in that the establishment of underground reservoirs of natural gas will help insure the continued, uninterrupted availability of natural gas supplies to residential, commercial and industrial consumers in Oregon during periods of peak demand and during interruptions in the normal flow of natural gas supplies. [1977 c.296 §5]

 

      520.350 Property rights in underground reservoirs for natural gas storage. (1) All natural gas in an underground reservoir utilized for underground storage, whether acquired by eminent domain or otherwise, shall at all times be the property of the natural gas company utilizing said underground storage, its heirs, successors, or assigns. In no event shall such gas be subject to the rights of the owner of the surface of the land under which said underground reservoir lies or of the owner of any mineral interest therein or of any person other than said natural gas company, its heirs, successors and assigns to release, produce, take, reduce to possessions, or otherwise interfere with or exercise any control thereof.

      (2) Any right of condemnation granted for the purposes of ORS 520.340, 772.610 to 772.625 and this section shall be without prejudice to the rights of the owner of the condemned lands or of the rights and interest therein to drill or bore through the underground reservoir in such a manner as shall protect the underground reservoir against pollution and against the escape of natural gas in a manner which complies with the orders and rules of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. Such condemnation shall be without prejudice to the owners of such lands or other rights or interests therein as to all other uses thereof. The additional costs of complying with rules or orders to protect the underground shall be paid by the condemnor. [1977 c.296 §6]

 

      520.990 [Repealed by 1953 c.667 §21]

 

PENALTIES

 

      520.991 Penalties. Subject to ORS 153.022, violation of any provision of this chapter, any rule adopted by the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries under this chapter or any order issued by the board or the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries under this chapter is a Class B misdemeanor.
