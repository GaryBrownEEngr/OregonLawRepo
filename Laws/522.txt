UNITIZATION OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE AREA

 

      522.405 Unitization; development of unit agreement; rules. (1) When two or more separately owned tracts of land are within an area under which a reservoir is located or reasonably believed to be located, or when there are separately owned interests in all or part of such an area, the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, upon its own motion may or upon the application of an interested person or state or local governmental governing body, special district or agency, shall review the need for unitization of the area. The board by rule or order may require the development of a unit agreement for the geothermal resource area if it finds:

      (a) Unitized management, operation and development of the geothermal resources in a reservoir is necessary to increase the ultimate recovery of the resources;

      (b) The application of unitized methods of operation will prevent waste and aid efficient production and utilization of the resource; or

      (c) Unitization and the unitized method of operation are in the public interest and reasonably necessary to protect the correlative rights of owners.

      (2) When the board requires the development of a unit agreement under this section, it shall encourage the development of a voluntary agreement between the affected parties. In the absence of a voluntary agreement, the board shall itself develop or cause to be developed a unit agreement that satisfies the provisions of ORS 273.775, 308A.050 to 308A.128, 522.005, 522.015, 522.405 to 522.545, 522.815 and 522.990. In adopting a rule or entering an order for a unit agreement, the board shall consider any plant dedicated area agreement in effect and shall not contravene or interfere with that agreement unless it finds that a term or condition of that agreement violates the policies stated in ORS 522.015. The board shall require the development of the resource in accordance with a proposed unit agreement if it finds that the agreement conforms with the provisions of ORS 273.775, 308A.050 to 308A.128, 522.005, 522.015, 522.405 to 522.545, 522.815 and 522.990.

      (3) The development of a unit agreement under subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be conducted as a rulemaking proceeding in accordance with ORS chapter 183 unless an interested party requests that it be conducted as a contested case in accordance with ORS chapter 183. In either event, notice shall be given in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183.

      (4) As used in this section, “plant dedicated area agreement” means a contractual relationship in geothermal energy development between a geothermal resource owner and a customer which makes a specific surface area and related resource base available exclusively to that customer.

      522.415 Unit operation plan. A voluntary or board-sponsored unit agreement developed in response to a rule adopted or an order issued under ORS 522.405 shall provide a unit operation plan that includes:

      (1) A description of the geothermal reservoir and the overlaying land to be operated as a unit.

      (2) A statement of the nature of the operations contemplated.

      (3) A provision for credits and charges to be made in the adjustment among the owners in a unit area for their respective investments in geothermal wells, prospect wells, machinery, materials and equipment used in the unit operation.

      (4) The division of interest or a formula for apportionment of unit production among the separately owned tracts within the unit area which reasonably permits a person or state or local governing body, special district or agency otherwise entitled to share in or benefit by production from a tract to receive an equitable and reasonable share of the unit production or other benefit. An equitable and reasonable share of unit production is measured by the proportion the value of the separately owned tract for geothermal resources recovery bears to the value of the unit for that purpose, taking acreage into account.

      (5) Provisions which state how the costs will be paid, how unit production is to be measured and when, how and by whom unit production is to be allocated. The provision shall provide that unit production due to an owner who does not pay that owner’s share of the cost of unit operation or that owner’s interest may be sold and the proceeds applied to the cost.

      (6) A provision, if necessary, for making financing available to any person or state or local governing body, special district or agency that wishes to obtain financing. The provision shall allow a reasonable interest charge for the service payable out of that respective share of production.

      (7) A provision for the supervision and conduct of the unit operation. Each person or state or local governing body, special district or agency shall have a vote on the provision with a weight corresponding to the percentage of the cost of unit operation chargeable against that respective interest.

      (8) The time when the unit operation shall begin and the manner and circumstances under which the unit operation shall terminate.

      (9) Provisions, if necessary, for the protection of preexisting water users within the unit area and for administration of future water development from the reservoir covered by the unit agreement. [1981 c.588 §9]

      522.495 Presumptions regarding conduct of operation. Any operation on any portion of the unit area, including, but not limited to, the drilling or operation of a well, is considered for all purposes the conduct of the same operation on the whole unit area. The portion of unit production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit area is considered for all purposes to actually have been produced from a well drilled upon that tract. An operation conducted pursuant to a board rule adopted or order issued under ORS 522.405 constitutes a fulfillment of all express or implied obligations under each lease or contract covering lands in the unit area. [1981 c. 588 §17]

 

      522.505 Unauthorized operation in unit area prohibited; exemption. (1) The operation of a geothermal well in a unit area by anyone other than by a person or state or local governing body, special district or agency acting under the unit’s authority shall be unlawful. That operation is prohibited from the effective date of the board rule or order creating the unit and prescribing the unitization plan or the unit agreement, except in the manner and to the extent provided in the unitization plan or agreement.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 273.775, 308A.050 to 308A.128, 522.005, 522.015, 522.405 to 522.545, 522.815 and 522.990 shall not affect the ability of a ground water user to exercise a water right that existed before the initiation of a unit agreement. [1981 c.588 §18; 1999 c.314 §76]
