FOREST TREE SEEDLINGS

 

      526.231 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Nonindustrial private forests make a vital contribution to Oregon by providing jobs, products, an expanded tax base and other social and economic benefits.

      (2) Providing a source of forest tree seedlings to owners of nonindustrial private forests is essential to securing the benefits described in subsection (1) of this section. [2005 c.541 §1]

 

      Note: 526.231, 526.233 and 526.237 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 526 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      526.233 Application of antitrust laws. The Legislative Assembly intends that ORS 526.237 and the amendments to ORS 526.235 by section 4, chapter 541, Oregon Laws 2005, authorize the displacement of competition in the forest tree seedling industry to a limited degree. The regulatory program of the State Forester described in ORS 526.237 is intended to grant immunity from state and federal antitrust laws to a cooperative and its members that enter into an agreement with the forester or the State Board of Forestry for the members to produce nonindustrial private forest tree seedlings for the forester and the board. The activities that any person performs in compliance with ORS 526.237 may not be considered in restraint of trade, a conspiracy or combination or any other unlawful activity in violation of ORS 646.705 to 646.805 or federal antitrust laws. [2005 c.541 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 526.231.

 

      526.235 State forest nursery; securing seedlings; sale of seedlings and stock; disposition of sales receipts. (1) A state forest nursery may be operated by the forester and the State Board of Forestry to provide forest tree seedlings for the reforestation of forestland. The nursery program may provide for the growth, care and maintenance of nursery stock and for the sale of such stock to private, state and other public owners of forestland.

      (2) The forester and the board may use means in addition to, or instead of, operating a state forest nursery under subsection (1) of this section to secure forest tree seedlings and may sell those forest tree seedlings to private, state and other public owners of forestland. The means of securing forest tree seedlings may include, but need not be limited to:

      (a) Contracting with private nurseries to grow forest tree seedlings;

FOREST HEALTH AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES

 

(Federal Forest Management)

 

      526.271 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) The State Forestry Department is well-positioned, due to experience in managing Oregon forests and its understanding of science-based, active forest management, to facilitate state government participation in forest management on federal lands located within the state.

      (2) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife has expertise with fish and wildlife habitat and the Department of Environmental Quality has expertise with water quality. Both departments have an important role to play in the management of federal forests located within the state.

      (3) A collaborative relationship between the State Forestry Department, the federal government, other agencies of the executive department, as defined in ORS 174.112, interested persons and nongovernmental organizations may restore the health, diversity and resilience of federal forests by increasing the information shared and by providing a variety of perspectives on site-specific and landscape-level determinations.

      (4) In cooperation with the State Forestry Department and the federal government, many communities in wildfire-prone areas have completed a community wildfire protection plan that identifies priority areas for hazardous fuel removal from federal lands.

      (5) The federal government has provided opportunities for agencies of the executive department, as defined in ORS 174.112, to become involved, to a greater extent, in the management of federal lands. [2005 c.772 §1]

 

      Note: 526.271, 526.274, 526.277 and 526.280 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 526 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      526.274 Authority to participate in federal forest management. In furtherance of the policy established in ORS 526.271, the State Board of Forestry, in consultation with the Governor, may:

      (1) In conformance with federal law, including Public Law 108-7, direct the State Forester to facilitate the development of stewardship contracts utilizing private contractors and, when appropriate, to seek and enter into a stewardship contract agreement with federal agencies to carry out forest management activities on federal lands. The State Forester may, under the stewardship contract agreements:

      (a) Perform road and trail maintenance;

      (b) Set prescribed fires to improve forest health, composition, structure and condition;

      (c) Manage vegetation;

      (d) Perform watershed restoration and maintenance;

      (e) Restore wildlife habitat;

      (f) Control exotic weeds and species; and

      (g) Perform other activities related to stewardship.

      (2) Create a forum for interagency cooperation and collaborative public involvement regarding federal forest management issues that may include, at the discretion of the board, the appointment of advisory committees, the use of existing advisory committees and procedures for holding public hearings.

      (3) Provide guidelines for the State Forestry Department and State Forester to follow that contain directions regarding the management of federal lands and that specify the goals and objectives of the board regarding the management of federal lands.

      (4) Participate, to the extent allowed by federal law, in the development of federal forest policies and the forest management planning processes of federal agencies.

      (5) Provide guidelines for the department to follow in implementing this section.

      (6) Coordinate with Oregon State University, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Oregon Forest Resources Institute, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Business Development Department, the State Department of Energy and other agencies of the executive department, as defined in ORS 174.112, to assist the State Forestry Department in carrying out the provisions of this section. [2005 c.772 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 526.271.

 

(Forest Health)

 

      526.277 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Forestlands in federal, state and private ownership comprise some of the most important environmental, economic and recreational resources in the State of Oregon. However, federal lands, and to a lesser extent state and private lands, are increasingly jeopardized by the risk of drought-induced mortality, severe insect and disease outbreaks and catastrophic wildfires.

      (2) Enhancing forest health, wildlife habitat and other ecological values and reducing the risk of severe insect and disease outbreaks and catastrophic wildfires through forest management are of interest to the residents of this state. Federal and state funds have not proved sufficient to carry out the management activities necessary to achieve these goals on federal lands, and it is unlikely that the funds will be available on a continuous basis.

      (3) The development of new market-based solutions to reduce the risk of severe insect and disease outbreaks and catastrophic wildfires may reduce the requirement for public funding. The development of biomass markets, including energy markets, that use woody biomass unsuitable for lumber, pulp and paper products as a primary source of raw material may assist in the creation of a sustainable, market-based model for restoring complexity and structure to Oregon’s forests.

      (4) A biomass-based industry may provide a renewable source of energy, reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution from wildfires, improve fish and wildlife habitat, create jobs and provide economic benefits to rural communities. Through the collection and conversion of woody biomass, ancillary benefits may be realized through the improvement in forest health, the protection of infrastructure and the stabilization of soils within critical watersheds.

      (5) The collection and conversion of woody biomass diminishes fuel loads and is an ecologically and economically sustainable practice where the reintroduction of fire is not appropriate.

      (6) The policy of this state is to support efforts to build, and place in service, biomass-fueled energy production facilities that utilize biomass collected from forests or derived from other sources such as agricultural crop residue when:

      (a) The facilities utilize sustainable supplies of biomass from cost-effective sources;

      (b) The use of woody biomass for energy maintains or enhances the biological productivity of the land, taking into consideration transportation costs, existing forest conditions, management objectives, vegetation growth rates and the need to sustain water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; and

      (c) The set of forest values to be sustained, in addition to wood and biomass for energy, is considered. Forest values include forest products, water, wildlife and recreation. [2005 c.772 §3; 2011 c.276 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 526.271.

 

      526.280 Responsibilities of State Forester; woody biomass utilization; report. In furtherance of the policy established in ORS 526.277, the State Forester shall:

      (1) Establish a policy of active and inclusive communication with the federal government, public bodies as defined in ORS 174.109, residents of Oregon and interested parties regarding the utilization of woody biomass produced through forest health restoration. The State Forester shall actively utilize the statutory provisions of the National Forest Management Act of 1976, the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 that allow the state to participate in federal policy development in a manner that expresses the policy established in ORS 526.277.

      (2) Promote public involvement in the identification of the areas of interface between urban lands and forestlands that pose the highest potential to threaten lives and private property.

      (3) Solicit public comment on the location of biomass-based energy projects and conversion facilities.

      (4) Promote public understanding, through education and outreach, of forest conditions, forest management options, the potential benefits and potential consequences of woody biomass utilization, the quality and quantity of woody biomass on federal lands and the potential for woody biomass utilization to assist in reducing wildfire risk and in enhancing forest health, diversity and resilience. The State Forestry Department may coordinate with the State Department of Energy, the Oregon Business Development Department, Oregon State University, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Environmental Quality and other entities in any education and outreach performed pursuant to this subsection.

      (5) Assess the types of woody biomass available and serve as an information resource for persons seeking to utilize woody biomass for energy development. Notwithstanding ORS 192.345, reports on any assessment of woody biomass conducted by the State Forester shall be made available for public inspection.

      (6) Promote public understanding that woody biomass utilization may be an effective tool for restoration of forest health and for economic development in rural communities.

      (7) Develop and apply, with advice from the forestry program at Oregon State University, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Environmental Quality and other sources, the best available scientific knowledge and technologies pertaining to forest and wildlife habitat restoration and woody biomass utilization when developing rules under ORS 527.630.

      (8) Seek opportunities to provide a source of woody biomass from federal, tribal, state and private forests.

      (9) Periodically prepare a report utilizing, to the greatest extent practicable, data collected from state and federal sources that specify the effect of woody biomass collection and conversion on the plant and wildlife resources and on the air and water quality of this state. The report shall identify any changes that the State Forester determines are necessary to encourage woody biomass collection and conversion and to avoid negative effects on the environment from woody biomass collection and conversion. The State Forester shall submit the report to the Governor and to an appropriate legislative interim committee with jurisdiction over forestry issues. [2005 c.772 §4; 2011 c.276 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 526.271.

 

      526.285 Contracts for providing woody biomass from state-managed forestlands. Notwithstanding ORS 530.059, the State Forester may enter into contracts under ORS 530.050 to provide a supply of woody biomass from forestlands managed by the State Forestry Department as needed to facilitate the development of projects, including but not limited to bioenergy projects. The department shall ensure that the provisions of contracts described in this section comply with applicable state forestland management plans. A contract described in this section is a sale of timber for purposes of the public contracting exemption described in ORS 279A.025 (2)(L). [2011 c.276 §2]

      (1) “Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project” means the pilot program established by Clackamas County under section 3 of this 2015 Act for forestry products grown on nonforest land within the county to be commercially produced and marketed through a forestry products cooperative.

      (2) “Dealer” means a person or agent of a person, other than a cooperative, that purchases or contracts to purchase forestry products through the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project.

      (3) “Forestland” means land for which the highest and best use is the growing of forestry products.

      (4) “Forestry products”:

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, means products from harvested timber.

      (b) Does not mean products from short rotation fiber grown under agricultural conditions as described in ORS 321.267 (3) or 321.824 (3), western juniper or products from harvested western juniper.

      (5) “Nonforest lands” means lands other than forestland.

      (6) “Party” means Clackamas County or a Clackamas County employee or a producer or dealer that carries out activities or engages in transactions regarding the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project.

      (7) “Producer” means a possessor of land on which trees are grown for harvesting as forestry products. [2015 c.733 §1]

      Sec. 2. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that because of the logistical challenges associated with the utilization of individual trees on nonforest lands, and because of the benefits from gains in commercial production and marketing of forestry products that may result from coordinating the activities of producers and buyers, it is in the public interest to establish cooperatives to coordinate the tracking, removal and sale of trees and to set prices to accomplish increased utilization.

      (2) It is the intent of sections 1 to 7 of this 2015 Act to displace competition through a regulatory system for the commercial production and marketing of forestry products on nonforest land under a Clackamas County program, referred to in sections 1 to 7 of this 2015 Act as the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project, to a limited degree and for the period specified in subsection (7) of this section. The regulatory system is intended to grant immunity from federal and state antitrust laws to the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project parties for the limited purposes of allowing the parties to bargain collectively and to arrive at a negotiated price for forestry products produced on nonforest land within Clackamas County.

      (3) The activities of any party that comply with the regulatory system described in sections 1 to 7 of this 2015 Act and State Forester rules for carrying out the regulatory system and the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project may not be considered to be in restraint of trade, a conspiracy or combination or any other unlawful activity in violation of any provision of ORS 646.705 to 646.826 or federal antitrust laws.

      (4) The State Forester shall actively supervise the conduct of a party in negotiating tentative prices for forestry products bought and sold as part of the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project. The State Forester shall actively supervise, and establish procedures and guidelines for, the negotiations between the parties and shall review the tentative prices established by those negotiations. The State Forester must set the prices for forestry products bought and sold as part of the project by formal action before the prices may be implemented. In setting the prices for the forestry products, the State Forester may give consideration to the tentative prices for those forestry products negotiated between the parties. The State Forester must make any adjustments to previously set prices for forestry products by formal action before the adjustments may be implemented.

      (5) The State Forester may compel the parties to take whatever action the State Forester considers necessary to:

      (a) Ensure that the parties are engaging in conduct that is authorized under sections 1 to 7 of this 2015 Act;

      (b) Ensure that the policies of this state are being fulfilled under the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project; and

      (c) Prevent conduct by any of the parties that is not authorized by the regulatory system administered by the State Forester or conduct that, in the opinion of the State Forester, does not advance the interests of this state in carrying out the regulatory system for the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project.

      (6) The State Forester may take any actions the State Forester deems appropriate to resolve disputes between the parties that involve or arise out of the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project, including but not limited to referring the dispute for mediation, arbitration or hearing.

      (7) Except as provided in section 7 of this 2015 Act, for the period prior to July 1, 2019, the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project shall displace competition regarding the commercial production and marketing of forestry products on nonforest land in those areas of the county where the project is in effect.

      (8) The State Forester may designate employees of the State Forestry Department to carry out the responsibility of actively supervising the conduct of the parties, including serving as intermediaries between parties or prospective parties.

      (9) The State Forester may adopt rules to carry out the State Forester’s authority under sections 1 to 7 of this 2015 Act. The department and the county shall enter into a memorandum of understanding for the county to reimburse the department for the actual costs to the department of providing services for the benefit of the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project. Moneys paid by the county as reimbursement shall be deposited in the State Forestry Department Account established under ORS 526.060. [2015 c.733 §2]

      Sec. 3. (1) Clackamas County shall establish the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project as a pilot program. In addition to promoting economic development within Clackamas County, the purpose of the project shall be to develop a program model for use by counties in this state that wish to promote economic development by using cooperatives to provide for the commercial production and marketing of forestry products from nonforest lands. Subject to section 2 of this 2015 Act, Clackamas County may do the following to carry out the pilot program:

      (a) Subject to section 4 of this 2015 Act, negotiate and enter into an agreement with persons, cities or other governmental entities willing to commercially produce forestry products as members of the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project. The agreement must specify the number, type and location of trees covered by the agreement. The State Forester may impose additional requirements for the contents of agreements described in this paragraph.

      (b) Negotiate with one or more producers and dealers to establish the price for the forestry products sold through the cooperative. The dealers may negotiate the price for the forestry products through a committee that sets forth the views of the dealers and votes on any issues being negotiated as authorized by this section, including the price for forestry products. However, a person that is both a producer and a dealer may not participate in negotiations under this section.

      (2) A tree that is covered by an agreement under subsection (1)(a) of this section must be marked for identification purposes as required by the county.

      (3) An agreement under subsection (1)(a) of this section may not be used to alter the supply of buildable land within an urban growth boundary.

      (4) If the land on which a tree subject to the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project is located is sold, the tree shall continue to be a tree subject to the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project unless:

      (a) The new owner of the land removes the tree from the project; or

      (b) The county project coordinator determines that the tree is not being maintained as required by the project. [2015 c.733 §3]

      Sec. 4. (1) The Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project shall operate:

      (a) In all areas of Clackamas County that are outside of city limits;

      (b) On residential or commercial properties, or properties owned by nonprofit entities, located in a city that elects to allow the project within the city limits; and

      (c) On lands owned by any governmental entity that elects to participate in the project.

      (2) An election by a city or other governmental entity to allow or participate in the project must be by formal action of the governing body for the city or other governmental entity.

      (3) Clackamas County may undertake efforts to inform cities and other governmental entities about the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project and the opportunities for the cities and governmental entities to elect to allow or participate in the project. The State Forester shall undertake to encourage cities and governmental entities located within urban growth boundaries to allow or participate in the project.

      (4) The State Forester, county and a city may work jointly to adopt components of the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project within city limits. A city electing to allow the project may specify how the project is to be administered within the city limits, including but not limited to specifications regarding land use zoning requirements, maintenance requirements and the issuance of tree removal permits for harvesting of trees enrolled in the program. Any specifications regarding how the project is to be administered within a city must be set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the county and the city. A memorandum of understanding described in this subsection may not take effect unless reviewed and approved by the State Forester. This subsection does not authorize a city to regulate the project on lands owned by a governmental entity described in subsection (1)(c) of this section that are located inside city limits.

      (5) If a change in city limits causes a property that is participating in the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project to become located inside city limits, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the property may continue to participate in the project under the terms of the agreement described in section 3 (1)(a) of this 2015 Act for that property and the terms of any annexation agreement between the city and the owner of that property.

      (6) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (7) this section, a local government may not enforce an ordinance to require or prohibit the removal of a tree that is subject to the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project. This subsection does not prohibit a local government from:

      (a) Enforcing a county ordinance approved by the State Forester for regulating trees subject to the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project or regulating land on which a tree that is subject to the project is located;

      (b) Enforcing a county ordinance adopted to implement comprehensive plan policies developed to address statewide land use goals;

      (c) Enforcing a local ordinance regulating a tree that is removed from the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project;

      (e) Acting or requiring action to remedy or mitigate a hazardous condition in a tree that presents an imminent threat of serious harm to persons or property.

      (7) Subsection (6) of this section does not prevent the application of a local ordinance to require or prohibit the removal of a tree if the tree becomes subject to the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project more than five years after the tree is planted.

      (8) This section does not require a county project coordinator or the State Forester to consent to the inclusion or continued inclusion of a tree in the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project. [2015 c.733 §4]

      Sec. 5. The county program model that Clackamas County develops through the Clackamas Forestry Product Cooperative Project must include, but need not be limited to:
