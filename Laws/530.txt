ACQUISITION, MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF STATE FORESTS

 

      530.010 State Board of Forestry authorized to acquire lands; limitations; lands designated as state forests. (1) The State Board of Forestry, referred to in this chapter as the board, in the name of the State of Oregon, may acquire, by purchase, donation, devise or exchange from any public, quasi-public or private owner, lands which by reason of their location, topographical, geological or physical characteristics are chiefly valuable for the production of forest crops, watershed protection and development, erosion control, grazing, recreation or forest administrative purposes.

      (2) The board shall not acquire any land without prior approval, duly made and entered, of the county court or board of county commissioners of the county in which the lands are situated.

      (3) Lands acquired under the provisions of this section shall be designated as state forests. [Amended by 1953 c.43 §2; 1967 c.396 §1]

 

      530.020 Title to acquired lands; encumbrances; Attorney General approval of title; cure of defects; recording. Title to all lands acquired by the State Board of Forestry under ORS 530.010 shall be free and clear of all encumbrances except easements of rights of way and reservations or exceptions of gas, oil, coal, mineral and timber rights, unless the board determines other encumbrances will not unduly limit the management of the lands consistent with ORS 530.010 to 530.170. All titles shall be approved by the Attorney General before conveyance is accepted. However, the Attorney General may approve title to lands proposed to be acquired from counties under the provisions of ORS 530.030 or proposed to be acquired by donation or devise when, in the opinion of the Attorney General, existing defects of title are of formal nature and may be cured by suit to quiet title. In case of acquisition of lands with defective title, the Attorney General may institute suit to quiet title to such lands, and all costs in connection therewith shall be a proper charge against the funds of the board. All deeds, abstracts, title insurance policies, and other evidences of title to lands acquired under ORS 530.010 to 530.040 shall be deposited with the Secretary of State. All deeds shall promptly be recorded in the county in which the lands are situated. [Amended by 1955 c.421 §1; 2009 c.831 §9]

 

      530.025 Interests in acquired lands; management of lands; sales. For acquisitions made by the State Board of Forestry on or after July 28, 2009:

      (1) The board may hold and manage lands alone or in cooperation with other entities, including but not limited to community forest authorities under ORS 530.600 to 530.628.

      (2) The board may acquire lands or partial interest in lands, including but not limited to conservation easements.

      (3) Subject to any covenants under ORS 530.130 or 530.147, the board may sell lands or partial interest in lands, including but not limited to conservation easements, to other parties if the board determines that the other parties are better situated to manage the lands for the long term. [2009 c.831 §2]

 

      Note: 530.025 was added to and made a part of 530.010 to 530.170 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      530.030 Conveyance of county lands to state; consideration; adjustment of delinquent fire patrol liens; contracts concerning removal of timber and disposition of proceeds from sale thereof. (1) The county court or board of county commissioners of any county may convey to the state for state forests any lands heretofore or hereafter acquired by such county through foreclosure of tax liens, or otherwise, that are within the classification of lands authorized to be acquired under ORS 530.010, if the State Board of Forestry deems such lands necessary or desirable for acquisition, in consideration of the payment to such county of the percentage of revenue derived from such lands as provided in ORS 530.110. In connection with any such conveyance, the State Board of Forestry shall have authority to make equitable adjustments with any county of accrued delinquent fire patrol liens on lands heretofore or hereafter acquired by such county by foreclosure of tax liens.

      (2) As to such lands acquired by the State Board of Forestry with title to the timber remaining in the county for a designated period of time, the State Forester may enter into contracts with the county to supervise the removal and sale of such timber, and under such contracts the gross proceeds of the sale thereof shall be disposed of as follows:

      (a) Ten percent of such gross proceeds shall be paid into the State Treasury and credited to the State Forestry Department Account and shall be used exclusively for the purposes and under the limitations set out in ORS 530.110 (1)(a).

      (b) A percentage of such gross proceeds shall be accepted by the State Forester, pursuant to written contract with the county authority, as compensation for the supervision and management of county-owned timber. The moneys so derived shall be paid into the State Treasury and credited to the State Forestry Department Account and shall be used exclusively for the supervision and management of state forests acquired pursuant to ORS 530.010. [Amended by 1953 c.65 §5; 1957 c.83 §13; 1965 c.423 §1; 2007 c.71 §171]

 

      530.040 Exchange of forestland or timber; reservations; hearing; approval of title; status of lands received. (1) It is desirable that lands acquired under the provisions of ORS 530.010 shall be consolidated in areas wherever possible through exchanges of land. It is recognized that the management of state forests will be more economically feasible through such consolidation.

      (2) In order to accomplish the objectives of subsection (1) of this section, the State Board of Forestry may exchange any land acquired under the provisions of ORS 530.010, or may exchange the timber on such land, for land of approximately equal aggregate value, situated in the same county, when such exchange is in furtherance of the purposes of ORS 530.010. However, the State Board of Forestry may exchange land or timber situated in one county or counties for land situated in another county or counties if such exchange is first approved by the county court or board of county commissioners of each county involved. Either party to any such exchange may make reservations of easements, rights of use and other interests and rights. Under the authority granted in this section, the State Board of Forestry may provide or receive, in addition to land to be exchanged, a monetary consideration where necessary to make the values comply with this subsection.

      (3) Before making any such exchange, the State Board of Forestry shall hold a hearing thereon at the courthouse of the county in which such lands are situated and shall give notice of the time and place thereof by publication in two successive issues of a newspaper of general circulation published in such county. The notice shall contain a description of the lands to be given and to be received in the proposed exchange. However, no such exchange shall be made until the title to the lands to be received has been approved by the Attorney General.

      (4) All lands received in exchange shall have the same status and be subject to the same provisions of law as the lands given in exchange therefor. [Amended by 1955 c.421 §2; 1959 c.103 §1; 1967 c.396 §2; 2007 c.71 §172]

 

      530.050 Management of lands acquired; powers of forester; rules. Under the authority and direction of the State Board of Forestry except as otherwise provided for the sale of forest products, the State Forester shall manage the lands acquired pursuant to ORS 530.010 to 530.040 so as to secure the greatest permanent value of those lands to the state, and to that end may:

      (1) Protect the lands from fire, disease and insect pests, cooperate with the counties and with persons owning lands within the state in the protection of the lands and enter into all agreements necessary or convenient for the protection of the lands.

      (2) Sell forest products from the lands, and execute mining leases and contracts as provided for in ORS 273.551.

      (3) Enter into and administer contracts for the sale of timber from lands owned or managed by the State Board of Forestry and the State Forestry Department.

      (4) Enter into and administer contracts for activities necessary or convenient for the sale of timber under subsection (3) of this section, either separately from or in conjunction with contracts for the sale of timber, including but not limited to activities such as timber harvesting and sorting, transporting, gravel pit development or operation, and road construction, maintenance or improvement.

      (5) Permit the use of the lands for other purposes, including but not limited to forage and browse for domestic livestock, fish and wildlife environment, landscape effect, protection against floods and erosion, recreation, and protection of water supplies when, in the opinion of the board, the use is not detrimental to the best interest of the state.

      (6) Grant easements, permits and licenses over, through and across the lands. The State Forester may require and collect reasonable fees or charges relating to the location and establishment of easements, permits and licenses granted by the state over the lands. The fees and charges collected shall be used exclusively for the expenses of locating and establishing the easements, permits and licenses under this subsection and shall be placed in the State Forestry Department Account.

      (7) Require and collect fees or charges for the use of state forest roads. The fees or charges collected shall be used exclusively for purposes of maintenance and improvements of the roads and shall be placed in the State Forestry Department Account.

      (8) Reforest the lands and cooperate with the counties, and with persons owning timberlands within the state, in the reforestation, and make all agreements necessary or convenient for the reforestation.

      (9) Require such undertakings as in the opinion of the board are necessary or convenient to secure performance of any contract entered into under the terms of this section or ORS 273.551.

      (10) Sell rock, sand, gravel, pumice and other such materials from the lands. The sale may be negotiated without bidding, provided the appraised value of the materials does not exceed $2,500.

      (11) Enter into agreements, each for not more than 10 years duration, for the production of minor forest products.

      (12) Establish a forestry carbon offset program to market, register, transfer or sell forestry carbon offsets. In establishing the program, the forester may:

      (a) Execute any contracts or agreements necessary to create opportunities for the creation of forestry carbon offsets; and

      (b) Negotiate prices that are at, or greater than, fair market value for the transfer or sale of forestry carbon offsets.

      (13) Do all things and make all rules, not inconsistent with law, necessary or convenient for the management, protection, utilization and conservation of the lands. [Amended by 1953 c.65 §5; 1955 c.421 §3; 1957 c.228 §1; 1959 c.141 §1; 1963 c.475 §1; 1965 c.128 §1; 1967 c.396 §3; 1983 c.759 §9; 2001 c.752 §8; 2005 c.103 §37; 2015 c.447 §1]

 

      530.053 Holiday recreational use; armed forces personnel and veterans. If, under ORS 530.050, the State Forester permits the use of lands acquired pursuant to ORS 530.010 to 530.040 for recreation, the State Forester shall authorize the recreational use of the lands without charge to the following persons, upon showing of proper identification and any documentation issued by the State Parks and Recreation Department that is issued to serve as proof of eligibility to use a state park, individual campsite or day use fee area without charge under ORS 390.124 (2)(c)(D):

      (1) Disabled veterans; and

      (2) Persons on leave from military active duty status on Memorial Day, Independence Day or Veterans Day. [2017 c.729 §2]

 

      Note: 530.053 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 530 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      530.055 Leasing lands acquired. Except as limited in this section but subject to separate sale of forest products under ORS 530.059, lands acquired under ORS 530.010 to 530.040 may be leased by the State Forester to any person when approved by the State Board of Forestry and for purposes deemed by the board to be more in the public interest than the purposes for which the land was acquired. [1965 c.128 §3]

 

      530.059 Procedure for sales of forest products; surety deposit required of bidder. (1) Before offering any forest products for sale under authority of ORS 530.050 or 530.500, the State Forester shall cause the forest products to be appraised. Should the appraised value of the forest products be in excess of $25,000, the State Forester shall not sell the same to a private person, firm or corporation, except after giving notice of the sale as required by this section, and affording an opportunity for competitive bidding either by public auction or through sealed bids, or a combination of both; provided, however, that such notice and opportunity for competitive bidding will not be required for sales in connection with:

      (a) Experimental or research projects in the field of forestland management or forest product utilization.

      (b) The removal, injury or destruction of forest products necessitated by any grant of easement or right of way, or necessitated by a permit or license to use a right of way, including trees which may endanger the use of such easement or way.

      (c) The removal of forest products with an appraised value of less than $100,000 that, as a result of an act of nature or other unforeseen circumstance:

      (A) Pose a threat to the health of the forests, waterways or forest road infrastructures; or

      (B) Will lose value as a result of potential theft.

      (d) The removal of forest products with an appraised value of less than $100,000 to facilitate the development, placement or maintenance of forest road infrastructures.

      (2) The State Forester shall give the notice required by subsection (1) of this section by mail to all persons requesting such notice and in such other media of communication as the State Forester may deem advisable. The State Forester shall maintain a mailing list with the names and addresses of persons who have requested to receive State Forestry Department notices of timber sales. The notice shall describe the forest products to be sold and the land on which such products are situated, state the minimum price at which the same may be sold, and contain a brief statement of the terms of the sale. As a provision of each sale, the State Forester shall reserve the right to accept or reject any or all bids.

      (3) Prior to or at the time the State Forester receives bids, each bidder shall furnish the State Forester with a certified check, cashier’s check, money order, surety bond, cash deposit, assignment of surety, irrevocable letters of credit or other securities as determined acceptable by the State Forester in an amount designated by the State Forester. The amount designated by the State Forester may not exceed 10 percent of the minimum price of the forest products to be sold or $500,000, whichever is less. The State Forester shall retain the amounts furnished by the successful bidder as a credit toward payment of the purchase price of the forest products sold. The State Forester shall return the amounts furnished by an unsuccessful bidder after determination of the successful bid. Any checks, bonds or orders furnished under this subsection shall be made payable to the State of Oregon.

      (4) If the provisions of this section have been complied with, and no satisfactory bid has been received, or the bidder fails to complete the purchase, the State Forester may, at any time, during a period of six months after the advertised date of sale, sell the forest products in such manner as the forester deems appropriate, but the sale price shall not be less than the minimum terms offered in the notice of sale or the highest bid received, whichever is the larger amount. [1959 c.141 §4; 1963 c.475 §2; 1967 c.396 §4; 1975 c.185 §7; 1983 c.759 §10; 1987 c.324 §1; 1995 c.375 §3; 1997 c.285 §1; 2014 c.47 §3]

 

      530.060 [Repealed by 1957 c.229 §1]

 

      530.061 Surety deposit required of successful purchaser. The State Forester may require the successful purchaser at a forest products sale to provide a surety bond, cash deposit, assignment of surety, irrevocable letters of credit or other securities as determined acceptable by the State Forester for the purpose of securing performance by the purchaser. The required amount of a bond, deposit, assignment, letter of credit or other security may not be more than $500,000. Claims by any person against the bond, deposit, assignment, letter of credit or other security shall be made to the State Forester for determination. If the claim is disputed, the State Forester may request settlement of the claim through compromise or mediation or require that the claim be litigated. Unless there is a claim awaiting determination, the State Forester shall return any unexpended amount from the bond, deposit, assignment, letter of credit or other security no later than 180 days after the earlier of the completion of operations under the sales contract or the termination date in the sales contract. [2014 c.47 §2]

 

      530.065 Modifying timber sale contracts. (1) During the period of a timber sale contract made under ORS 530.059, either party may propose to change or modify the terms of the contract if unforeseen circumstances develop. As used in this subsection, “unforeseen circumstances” means acts of nature or other unforeseen circumstances or conditions that:

      (a) Affect the nature or scope of the work to be performed or volume to be harvested under the terms of the sale contract made by the State Forester; or

      (b) Require additional work or harvest in an area adjacent to a timber sale made by the State Forester.

      (2) The State Forester is hereby authorized to change or modify the terms or conditions of the contract in the event of unforeseen circumstances requiring such change or modification under subsection (1) of this section only when:

      (a) Such change or modification is in the best interest of the State of Oregon; and

      (b) The purchaser of the timber sale agrees that the proposed change or modification will maintain an equitable contractual relationship between the parties. [1965 c.128 §2; 1983 c.759 §11; 1997 c.285 §2]

 

      530.070 [Repealed by 1957 c.229 §1]

 

      530.075 Validation of state acquisition of county land; purposes for which land may be used; disposition of revenue. (1) Notwithstanding ORS chapter 275 or any other law, deeds of conveyance or other instruments transferring county forests, public parks or recreational areas, from a county to the State of Oregon, either acting by and through or for the use and benefit of the State Board of Forestry, are validated and shall be conclusive evidence of the transfer of such lands from the county to the state.

      (2) The State Board of Forestry shall use, manage and develop such lands for the purposes designated in ORS 275.320 if such lands are suitable for such purposes; otherwise, the lands shall be used for the purposes stated in ORS 530.010 and any revenue derived from the sale of forest products from such lands shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of ORS 530.110 (2). In other instances where the county received title to the land from a grantor with the provision that the land be used for particular purposes, this section shall not be construed to obviate such purposes. [1963 c.475 §3]

      530.110 Distribution of revenues from lands acquired under ORS 530.010 to 530.040. (1) All revenues derived from lands acquired without cost to the state, or acquired from counties pursuant to ORS 530.030, shall be paid into the State Treasury and credited to the State Forestry Department Account and shall be used in accordance with the following distribution:

      (a) Fifteen percent shall be credited to the State Forests Protection Subaccount of the State Forestry Department Account until the amount in such subaccount reaches $475,000. Thereafter, the revenues shall be disposed of as stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, unless needed to maintain the $475,000 level. All moneys in the State Forests Protection Subaccount are continuously appropriated to the State Forester who may use such money under the following priorities:

      (A) First, in addition to or in lieu of other moneys available, to pay the cost of protection, as determined under ORS 477.270, for lands acquired under ORS 530.010 to 530.040.

      (B) Second, to provide moneys needed for activities authorized by subsection (3) of this section.

      (C) From remaining moneys, to pay costs incurred in the suppression of fire originating on or spreading from an operation area, as defined in ORS 477.001, on state-owned forestland acquired under ORS 530.010 to 530.040. The State Forester shall make payments with approval of the State Board of Forestry for such fire suppression costs, except that no payments shall be made for such costs or portion thereof when other parties are responsible under law or contracts for the payment of such costs.

      (b) Seventy-five percent of all such revenues remaining after the percentage disposed of as stated in paragraph (a) of this subsection, shall be disposed of as provided in ORS 530.115.

      (c) Twenty-five percent of all such revenues remaining after the percentage disposed of as stated in paragraph (a) of this subsection, shall be used for the purposes set out in subsection (3) of this section.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 530.147 and 530.280, all revenues from lands other than lands designated in subsection (1) of this section, acquired under ORS 530.010 to 530.040, shall be paid into the State Treasury and credited to the State Forestry Department Account and shall be used in accordance with the following distribution:

      (a) Until each legal subdivision of the lands has been credited with an amount equal to the purchase price thereof, the revenues shall reimburse the State Forestry Department Account. If sufficient revenue to reimburse the State Forestry Department Account is not generated from the purchased parcels within five years from the date of acquisition, the State Forester, with the consent of the affected county, shall deduct all or portions of the unreimbursed purchase costs from the revenue distributed to that county in accordance with ORS 530.115 (1). After the State Forestry Department Account has been reimbursed for the purchase price of the lands, the revenue from the lands shall be distributed according to the formula specified in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this subsection.

      (b) As used in paragraph (a) of this subsection, “administrative expenses” means a classification of expenses incurred by the State Forester in performing functions referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection as a whole, rather than expenses incurred in performing any specific function that is a part of the whole; and it means expenditures recognized as operating costs of a current or past period, including refund of overpayments in the sale of forest products, and capital expenditures for buildings, furniture, fixtures or equipment.

      (3) After the end of each six-month period the State Forester shall submit to the Department of State Lands a statement of capital asset account balances as of the end of that period for buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment held by the State Forester in performing functions referred to in subsection (2)(a) of this section and in which the Common School Fund has a vested interest, showing the amount of that interest.

(1) To accomplish its purposes, a community forest authority created under ORS 530.606 may issue revenue bonds or other revenue obligations payable from the revenues derived from the repayment of loans to nonprofit corporations whose purpose is to own and operate community forestlands. The issuance of revenue bonds or other revenue obligations is governed by the provisions of this section and is not subject to the prior approval of the electors of the municipality that created the authority.

      (2) An authority may issue and sell revenue bonds or other revenue obligations payable as to principal and interest only out of the fund or funds established under this section or other assets of the authority that are pledged by the board of directors to secure the revenue bonds or other revenue obligations.

      (3) A revenue bond or other revenue obligation issued against a fund or funds established under this section is a valid claim of the holder only as against the fund or funds, the proportion or amount of the revenues pledged to the fund or funds and the other assets pledged, assigned or encumbered by the authority to secure the revenue bond or other revenue obligation. Each revenue bond or other revenue obligation must state on its face that:

      (a) The bond or obligation is payable from a special fund or funds and name the fund or funds and the resolution that established the fund or funds; or

      (b) That the bond or obligation is payable from other assets and identify those other assets and the resolution pledging, assigning or encumbering them.

      (7) The board by resolution may provide for the issuance of funding and refunding revenue bonds or other revenue obligations in order to take up and refund a series, or portion of a series, of outstanding revenue bonds or other revenue obligations at a time determined by the board. Refunding revenue bonds or other revenue obligations may be sold or exchanged at a price that the board determines is in the best interest of the authority.

      (8) A revenue bond or other revenue obligation issued pursuant to this section is a legal security that may be used by any insured institution or trust company, as those terms are defined in ORS 706.008, for deposit with the State Treasurer or a county treasurer or city treasurer, as security for deposits in lieu of a surety bond under a law relating to deposits of public moneys and constitutes legal investments for public bodies, trustees and other fiduciaries, banks, savings and loan associations, and insurance companies. All revenue bonds and obligations and all coupons appertaining thereto shall be negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the law of this state. [2005 c.500 §8]
