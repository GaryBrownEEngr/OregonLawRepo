WATER RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

 

      536.220 Policy on water resources generally; integrated state water resources strategy. (1) The Legislative Assembly recognizes and declares that:

      (a) The maintenance of the present level of the economic and general welfare of the people of this state and the future growth and development of this state for the increased economic and general welfare of the people thereof are in large part dependent upon a proper utilization and control of the water resources of this state, and such use and control is therefore a matter of greatest concern and highest priority.

      (b) A proper utilization and control of the water resources of this state can be achieved only through a coordinated, integrated state water resources policy, through plans and programs for the development of such water resources and through other activities designed to encourage, promote and secure the maximum beneficial use and control of such water resources, all carried out by a single state agency.

      (c) The economic and general welfare of the people of this state have been seriously impaired and are in danger of further impairment by the exercise of some single-purpose power or influence over the water resources of this state or portions thereof by each of a large number of public authorities, and by an equally large number of legislative declarations by statute of single-purpose policies with regard to such water resources, resulting in friction and duplication of activity among such public authorities, in confusion as to what is primary and what is secondary beneficial use or control of such water resources and in a consequent failure to utilize and control such water resources for multiple purposes for the maximum beneficial use and control possible and necessary.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly, therefore, finds that:

      (a) It is in the interest of the public welfare that a coordinated, integrated state water resources policy be formulated and means provided for its enforcement, that plans and programs for the development and enlargement of the water resources of this state be devised and promoted and that other activities designed to encourage, promote and secure the maximum beneficial use and control of such water resources and the development of additional water supplies be carried out by a single state agency that, in carrying out its functions, shall give proper and adequate consideration to the multiple aspects of the beneficial use and control of such water resources with an impartiality of interest except that designed to best protect and promote the public welfare generally.

      (b) The state water resources policy shall be consistent with the goal set forth in ORS 468B.155.

      (3)(a) The Water Resources Department shall develop an integrated state water resources strategy to implement the state water resources policy specified in subsection (2) of this section. The department shall design the strategy to meet Oregon’s in-stream and out-of-stream water needs.

      (b) The Water Resources Department shall work in close cooperation with the Department of Environmental Quality and the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to develop the integrated state water resources strategy in consultation with other state, local and federal agencies, with other states, with Indian tribes, with stakeholders and with the public.

      (c) The Water Resources Department, in close cooperation with the Department of Environmental Quality and the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall develop data on an ongoing basis to forecast Oregon’s in-stream and out-of-stream water needs, including but not limited to in-stream, underground water, human consumption and water supply needs, for the purpose of developing and updating the integrated state water resources strategy.

      (d) The integrated state water resources strategy shall describe the following:

      (A) Oregon’s in-stream and out-of-stream water needs, including but not limited to ecosystem services, water quality and water supply needs.

      (B) Objectives of the strategy.

      (C) Actions that are designed to achieve the objectives of the strategy.

      (D) Plans related to the challenges presented by climate change.

      (E) Provisions to ensure communication and partnership with key stakeholders.

      (F) Specific functions and roles to be played by state agencies, including but not limited to the State Department of Agriculture, the State Forestry Department, the Department of Human Services, the Oregon Business Development Department, the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, the State Parks and Recreation Department, the Department of State Lands and other relevant state agencies.

      (G) Public policy options and recommendations.

      (H) Relevant strategy factors, including but not limited to population growth and land use change.

      (I) Recommendations of the Water Resources Department regarding the continuous monitoring of climate change effects on Oregon’s water supply and regarding water user actions that are necessary to address climate change.

      (e)(A) The Water Resources Commission shall give the Environmental Quality Commission, the State Department of Agriculture and the State Department of Fish and Wildlife notice of the integrated state water resources strategy prior to adoption of the strategy. The strategy shall take effect upon adoption by the Water Resources Commission.

      (B) The Water Resources Commission shall review and update the integrated state water resources strategy every five years. The Water Resources Commission shall give notice to the Environmental Quality Commission, the State Department of Agriculture and the State Department of Fish and Wildlife prior to adopting any revisions of the strategy. Revisions of the strategy shall take effect upon the Water Resources Commission’s adoption of the revised strategy by reference in rule.

      (4) This section does not limit the authority granted the Environmental Quality Commission or the Department of Environmental Quality under ORS chapter 468B. [1955 c.707 §1; 1989 c.833 §53; 2009 c.907 §44; 2013 c.1 §76]

      536.295 Conditions for consideration of application for use not classified in basin program; rules. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS 536.300 or 536.340, the Water Resources Commission may allow the Water Resources Department to consider an application to appropriate water for a use not classified in the applicable basin program if the use:

      (a) Will be of short duration during each year;

      (b) Will be for a continuous period of no longer than five years;

      (c) Is largely nonconsumptive in nature and not likely to be regulated for other water rights;

      (d) Is necessary to ensure public health, welfare and safety;

      (e) Is necessary to avoid extreme hardship;

      (f) Will provide a public benefit such as riparian or watershed improvement; or

      (g) Is of an unusual nature not likely to recur in the basin, and unlikely to have been within the uses considered by the commission in classifying the uses presently allowed in the applicable basin program including but not limited to:

      (A) Exploratory thermal drilling;

      (B) Heat exchange;

      (C) Maintaining water levels in a sewage lagoon; or

      (D) Facilitating the watering of livestock away from a river or stream.

      (2) A permit granted on or before January 1, 1993, for a quasi-municipal use of water shall be considered a permit for a classified use under ORS 536.340 if at the time the application was submitted or the permit was granted, the basin program identified municipal use as a classified use.

      (3) The commission by rule may determine the specific uses permitted within a classified use.

      (4) In making the determination under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall evaluate whether the proposed use is consistent with the general policies established in the applicable basin program.

      (5) The Water Resources Department shall process and evaluate an application allowed by the commission under subsections (1) to (4) of this section in the same manner as any other water right application, including determining whether the proposed use would result in injury to an existing water right. [1989 c.9 §1; 1993 c.591 §1; 1999 c.703 §1]

 

      536.300 Formulation of state water resources program; public hearing in affected river basin. (1) The Water Resources Commission shall proceed as rapidly as possible to study: Existing water resources of this state; means and methods of conserving and augmenting such water resources; existing and contemplated needs and uses of water for domestic, municipal, irrigation, power development, industrial, mining, recreation, wildlife, and fish life uses and for pollution abatement, all of which are declared to be beneficial uses, and all other related subjects, including drainage, reclamation, floodplains and reservoir sites.

      (2) Based upon said studies and after an opportunity to be heard has been given to all other state agencies which may be concerned, the commission shall progressively formulate an integrated, coordinated program for the use and control of all the water resources of this state and issue statements thereof.

      (3) The commission may adopt or amend a basin program only after holding at least one public hearing in the affected river basin. After the commission itself conducts one public hearing in the affected river basin, the commission may delegate to the Water Resources Director the authority to conduct additional public hearings in the affected river basin. [1955 c.707 §10(1), (2); 1965 c.355 §2; 1985 c.673 §14]

 

      536.310 Purposes and policies to be considered in formulating state water resources program. In formulating the water resources program under ORS 536.300 (2), the Water Resources Commission shall take into consideration the purposes and declarations enumerated in ORS 536.220 and also the following additional declarations of policy:

      (1) Existing rights, established duties of water, and relative priorities concerning the use of the waters of this state and the laws governing the same are to be protected and preserved subject to the principle that all of the waters within this state belong to the public for use by the people for beneficial purposes without waste;

      (2) It is in the public interest that integration and coordination of uses of water and augmentation of existing supplies for all beneficial purposes be achieved for the maximum economic development thereof for the benefit of the state as a whole;

      (3) That adequate and safe supplies be preserved and protected for human consumption, while conserving maximum supplies for other beneficial uses;

      (4) Multiple-purpose impoundment structures are to be preferred over single-purpose structures; upstream impoundments are to be preferred over downstream impoundments. The fishery resource of this state is an important economic and recreational asset. In the planning and construction of impoundment structures and milldams and other artificial obstructions, due regard shall be given to means and methods for its protection;

      (5) Competitive exploitation of water resources of this state for single-purpose uses is to be discouraged when other feasible uses are in the general public interest;

      (6) In considering the benefits to be derived from drainage, consideration shall also be given to possible harmful effects upon ground water supplies and protection of wildlife;

      (7) The maintenance of minimum perennial streamflows sufficient to support aquatic life, to minimize pollution and to maintain recreation values shall be fostered and encouraged if existing rights and priorities under existing laws will permit;

      (8) Watershed development policies shall be favored, whenever possible, for the preservation of balanced multiple uses, and project construction and planning with those ends in view shall be encouraged;

      (9) Due regard shall be given in the planning and development of water recreation facilities to safeguard against pollution;

      (10) It is of paramount importance in all cooperative programs that the principle of the sovereignty of this state over all the waters within the state be protected and preserved, and such cooperation by the commission shall be designed so as to reinforce and strengthen state control;

      (11) Local development of watershed conservation, when consistent with sound engineering and economic principles, is to be promoted and encouraged;

      (12) When proposed uses of water are in mutually exclusive conflict or when available supplies of water are insufficient for all who desire to use them, preference shall be given to human consumption purposes over all other uses and for livestock consumption, over any other use, and thereafter other beneficial purposes in such order as may be in the public interest consistent with the principles of chapter 707, Oregon Laws 1955, under the existing circumstances; and

      (13) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when available supplies of water are insufficient in the South Umpqua River to provide for both the needs of human consumption pursuant to a municipal water right and the maintenance of previously established minimum streamflows, preference shall be given to the municipal needs if the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance restricting use of the water so obtained to direct human consumption uses. [1955 c.707 §10(3); 1979 c.170 §1; 1987 c.546 §1]

      536.340 Classification of water as to highest and best use and quantity of use; enforcement of laws concerning loss of water rights; prescribing preferences for future uses. (1) Subject at all times to existing rights and priorities to use waters of this state, the Water Resources Commission:

      (a) May, by a water resources statement referred to in ORS 536.300 (2), classify and reclassify the lakes, streams, underground reservoirs or other sources of water supply in this state as to the highest and best use and quantities of use thereof for the future in aid of an integrated and balanced program for the benefit of the state as a whole. The commission may so classify and reclassify portions of any such sources of water supply separately. Classification or reclassification of sources of water supply as provided in this subsection has the effect of restricting the use and quantities of use thereof to the uses and quantities of uses specified in the classification or reclassification, and no other uses or quantities of uses except as approved by the commission under ORS 536.370 to 536.390 or as accepted by the commission under ORS 536.295. Restrictions on use and quantities of use of a source of water supply resulting from a classification or reclassification under this subsection shall apply to the use of all waters of this state affected by the classification or reclassification, and shall apply to uses listed in ORS 537.545 that are initiated after the classification or reclassification that imposes the restriction.

      (b) Shall diligently enforce laws concerning cancellation, release and discharge of excessive unused claims to waters of this state to the end that such excessive and unused amounts may be made available for appropriation and beneficial use by the public.

      (c) May, by a water resources statement referred to in ORS 536.300 (2) and subject to the preferential uses named in ORS 536.310 (12), prescribe preferences for the future for particular uses and quantities of uses of the waters of any lake, stream or other source of water supply in this state in aid of the highest and best beneficial use and quantities of use thereof. In prescribing such preferences the commission shall give effect and due regard to the natural characteristics of such sources of water supply, the adjacent topography, the economy of such sources of water supply, the economy of the affected area, seasonal requirements of various users of such waters, the type of proposed use as between consumptive and nonconsumptive uses and other pertinent data.

      (2) In classifying or reclassifying a source of water supply or prescribing preferences for the future uses of a source of water supply under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall:

      (a) Comply with the requirements set forth in the Water Resources Department coordination program developed pursuant to ORS 197.180; and

      (b) Cause notice of the hearing held under ORS 536.300 (3) to be published in a newspaper of general circulation once each week for two successive weeks in each county:

      (A) In which waters affected by the action of the commission under subsection (1) of this section are located; or

      (B) That is located within the basin under consideration.

      (3) Before beginning any action under subsection (2) of this section that would limit new ground water uses that are exempt under ORS 537.545 from the requirement to obtain a water right, the commission shall:

      (a) Review the proposed action to determine whether the proposal is consistent with ORS 537.780;

      (b) Provide an opportunity for review by:

      (A) Any member of the Legislative Assembly who represents a district where the proposed action would apply; and

      (B) Any interim committee of the Legislative Assembly responsible for water-related issues; and

      (c) Receive and consider a recommendation on the proposal from the ground water advisory committee appointed under ORS 536.090. [1955 c.707 §10(6); 1963 c.414 §1; 1989 c.9 §2; 1989 c.833 §54; 1997 c.510 §1; 2011 c.52 §1]

 

      536.350 Delivery of water resources statement to certain public bodies; effect. The Water Resources Commission shall deliver a copy of each water resources statement referred to in ORS 536.300 (2) to each state agency or public corporation of this state which may be concerned with or which may carry on activities likely to affect the use or control of the water resources of this state. Each state agency or public corporation of this state which receives a copy of a water resources statement shall give to the commission a receipt for the water resources statement. A copy of any such statement duly certified by the Water Resources Director to be a full, true and correct copy shall be received in evidence in any court in the state and if the certificate recites that a copy of the statement was delivered to a particular state agency or public corporation of this state, it shall be presumed that the same was actually delivered as stated in the certificate. [1955 c.707 §10(7); 1985 c.673 §16]

 

      536.360 State agencies and public corporations to conform to statement of state water resources policy. In the exercise of any power, duty or privilege affecting the water resources of this state, every state agency or public corporation of this state shall give due regard to the statements of the Water Resources Commission and shall conform thereto.

      536.600 [1993 c.765 §104; renumbered 541.345 in 1995]

 

EMERGENCY WATER SHORTAGE POWERS

 

      536.700 “Drainage basin” defined. As used in ORS 536.700 to 536.780, “drainage basin” means one of the 18 Oregon drainage basins identified by the Water Resources Department as shown on maps published by that department dated January 1976. [1977 c.541 §3]

 

      536.710 Policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that an emergency may exist when a severe, continuing drought results in a lack of water resources, thereby threatening the availability of essential services and jeopardizing the peace, health, safety and welfare of the people of Oregon.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds it necessary in the event of an emergency described in subsection (1) of this section, to promote water conservation and to provide an orderly procedure to assure equitable curtailment, adjustment, allocation or regulation in the domestic, municipal and industrial use of water resources where more than one user is dependent upon a single source of supply. [1977 c.541 §1]

 

      536.720 Declaration of state authority; Governor’s power to order water conservation or curtailment plan. (1) Because municipal and other political subdivision boundaries do not conform with the geographic boundaries of the 18 major drainage basins, or associated subbasins in the state, and because problems caused by a severe continuing drought may exceed local ability to control, the Legislative Assembly declares that water resource conservation in time of severe, continuing drought requires the exercise of state authority.

      (2)(a) After a declaration that a severe, continuing drought exists, or is likely to exist, the Governor may order individual state agencies and political subdivisions within any drainage basin or subbasin to implement, within a time certain following the declaration, a water conservation or curtailment plan or both, approved under ORS 536.780.

      (b) Each state agency and political subdivision ordered to implement a water conservation or curtailment plan shall file with the Water Resources Commission such periodic reports regarding implementation of the plans as the commission or the Governor may require.

      (3) Orders provided for in subsection (2) of this section and curtailments, adjustments, allocations and regulations ordered pursuant thereto shall be designed insofar as practicable not to discriminate within any class of consumers.

      (4) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that curtailments, adjustments, allocations and regulations ordered pursuant to subsection (2) of this section be continued only so long as a declaration by the Governor of the existence of severe, continuing drought is in effect.

      (5) The Governor may direct individual state agencies and political subdivisions of this state to seek enforcement of all orders and regulations issued pursuant to ORS 536.780 and subsection (2) of this section. [1977 c.541 §2; 1985 c.673 §20; 1989 c.87 §7]

 

      536.730 Effect of emergency powers on vested water rights. Except as provided in ORS 536.740 and 536.750, nothing in ORS 536.700 to 536.780 is intended to permit the Governor or the Water Resources Commission to hinder the ability of any holder of a vested water right to obtain and use legally assured benefits of that right. [1977 c.541 §4; 1989 c.87 §8]

 

      536.740 Governor’s authority to declare drought. Upon finding that a need exists for statewide coordination of water resource conservation measures by municipal and other political subdivisions of this state in order to minimize problems caused by a severe shortage of water, the Governor may declare that a severe, continuing drought exists or is likely to exist. [1989 c.87 §2]

 

      536.750 Powers of commission after declaration of drought; rules. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapters 536 to 543A, after a declaration that a severe, continuing drought exists, the Water Resources Commission may:

      (a) Issue without first conducting a hearing under ORS 537.170, a temporary permit for an emergency use of water;

      (b) Allow a temporary change in use, place of use or point of diversion of water without complying with the notice and waiting requirements under ORS 540.520;

      (c) Notwithstanding the priority of water rights, grant preference of use to rights for human consumption or stock watering use;

      (d) Waive the notice requirements under ORS 537.753 and the report required under ORS 537.762;

      (e) Allow a temporary exchange of water without giving notice as required under ORS 540.535; and

      (f) Utilize an expedited notice and waiting requirement established by rule for the substitution of a supplemental ground water right for a primary water right under drought conditions in place of the notice and waiting requirement provided in ORS 540.524.

      (2) The commission by rule may establish procedures for carrying out the provisions of this section and a schedule of fees that must accompany a request under subsection (1) of this section. [1989 c.87 §3; 1999 c.873 §20; 2001 c.788 §1]

 

      536.760 Cessation of actions taken under ORS 536.750. Any action taken under ORS 536.750 may be carried out only during the period of severe, continuing drought. After the drought, any water use undertaken under ORS 536.750 must cease or comply with the applicable provisions of ORS 537.110 to 537.252, 537.505 to 537.795 and 537.992 or 540.520 and 540.530. [1989 c.87 §4]

 

      536.770 Purchase of option or agreement for use of water permit or right during declared drought; application; fee. (1) The Water Resources Commission or a local government, public corporation or water right holder may purchase an option or enter an agreement to use an existing permit or water right during the time in which a severe, continuing drought is declared to exist.

      (2) A local government, public corporation or water right holder proposing to purchase an option or enter an agreement under this section shall submit to the commission an application accompanied by the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(a).

      (3) After approval of the application by the commission, the option or agreement user:

      (a) Is not required to construct any diversion or appropriation facilities or works;

      (b) May use the water acquired under the option or agreement on property or for a use different than allowed in the permit or water right transferred under the option or agreement, if the water is used to replace water not available to the local government, public corporation or water right holder because of the drought; and

      (c) May begin use at any time after approval by the commission so long as the total use by the water right or permit holder and the option or agreement user is within the rate, volume and seasonal limits of the permit or water right. [1989 c.87 §5; 1993 c.349 §1; 1997 c.587 §3; 2001 c.788 §2]

 

      536.780 Water conservation or curtailment plan; contents; review; effect of failure to file or implement. (1) The Water Resources Commission, upon a finding that a severe or continuing drought is likely to occur, may order individual state agencies and political subdivisions within any drainage basin or subbasin to develop and file with the commission, within 30 days following the order, a water conservation or curtailment plan or both. The commission may allow the state agencies and political subdivisions more than 30 days following the order to file the plan depending on the urgency for the plan.

      (2)(a) The water conservation plan shall specify efforts to be made:

      (A) To reduce usage of water resources for nonessential public purposes;

      (B) To undertake activities consistent with law designed to promote conservation, prevention of waste, salvage and reuse of water resources; and

      (C) To establish programs consistent with law designed to promote conservation, prevention of waste, salvage and reuse of water resources.

      (b) When a state agency or political subdivision files a water conservation plan with the Water Resources Commission, the commission shall review the plan and approve it if the commission finds that the plan satisfactorily promotes uniformity in water conservation practices and the coordination of usage regulation, taking into account local conditions.

      (3)(a) The water curtailment plan, in order to provide water necessary for human and livestock consumption during a severe and continuing drought, shall specify efforts to be made:

      (A) To curtail, adjust or allocate the supply of water resources for domestic, municipal and industrial use; and

      (B) To regulate the times and manner in which water resources are consumed.

      (b) When a state agency or political subdivision files a water curtailment plan with the Water Resources Commission, the commission shall review the plan and approve it if the commission finds that the plan satisfactorily promotes uniformity in water curtailment practices and the coordination of usage regulation, taking into account local conditions.

      (4) If a state agency or political subdivision fails to file a water conservation or curtailment plan when so ordered, or if the commission does not approve a filed plan, the commission may develop appropriate plans. [1989 c.87 §6]
