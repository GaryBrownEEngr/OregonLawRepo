[1985 c.310 §2; 1989 c.587 §2]

 

      537.143 Limited license to use or store surface or ground water or to use stored water; rules. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 537.130, the Water Resources Commission may establish by rule a procedure to allow a person to obtain a limited license to use or store ground water not otherwise exempt under ORS 537.545, to use or store surface water, to use stored water or to use stored water for purposes for which the stored water is authorized and in accordance with a contract with a local, state or federal government after the person complies with the notice provisions set forth in ORS 537.144. Uses eligible for a limited license shall be for a short-term or fixed duration and may include but are not limited to road construction and maintenance, general construction and forestland or rangeland management. Except as provided in subsections (4) to (6) and (9) of this section, the use of water for a purpose specifically prohibited by a basin program or for irrigation is not eligible for a limited license.

      (2) The use of water under a limited license under subsection (1) of this section shall not have priority over any water right exercised according to a permit or certificate and shall be subordinate to all other authorized uses that rely upon the same source. The Water Resources Department may revoke the right to use of water acquired under a limited license pursuant to subsection (1) of this section at any time if the use causes injury to:

      (a) Any other water right; or

      (b) A minimum perennial streamflow.

      (3) Except as provided in subsections (4), (5) and (11) of this section, the licensee shall give notice to the Water Resources Department at least 15 days in advance of using the water under the limited license and shall maintain a record of use. The record shall include but need not be limited to an estimate of the amount of water used, the period of use and the categories of beneficial use to which the water is applied. During the period of the limited license, the record of use shall be available for review by the department upon request.

      (4) The Water Resources Director may issue a limited license in conjunction with an enforcement order to address an illegal water use, including irrigation use or a use specifically prohibited by a basin program. The director may issue a limited license for such a use upon a finding that:

      (a) The person did not knowingly violate state laws regarding a water use permit;

      (b) The immediate termination of the illegal use would cause serious and undue hardship to the water user that could be ameliorated by providing a period of time in which to achieve compliance with the law; and

      (c) The continued use under a limited license outweighs the public benefits of termination, including deterrence of illegal uses and protection of the water source.

      (5) An enforcement order issued under subsection (4) of this section shall specify an amount of time in which the person using water illegally shall bring such use into compliance. The duration of the limited license shall not exceed the duration of time allowed in the enforcement order to achieve compliance. A licensee using water under a limited license issued in conjunction with an enforcement order need not provide the department with advance notice of water use, but shall comply with the other requirements of this section.

      (6) The director may issue a limited license for irrigation if the sole purpose of the use is:

      (a) To provide water necessary to establish a crop for which no further irrigation will be required after the crop is established;

      (b) To mitigate the impacts of drought when additional water is needed beyond a prescribed irrigation season in order to avoid irreparable damage to the user’s crop; or

      (c) Under a limited license issued pursuant to subsection (9) of this section.

      (7) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit any person from obtaining a water right certificate under ORS 537.250 or 537.630 for any use for which a limited license is obtained under this section.

      (8) Except as provided in subsection (10) of this section, the department may not issue a limited license for the same use for more than five consecutive years.

      (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the use of water under the limited license is for the use of stored water consistent with the purposes for which the stored water is authorized and the use of water is authorized by a contract between the user and a local, state or federal government:

      (a) The limited license may be issued for a period of up to one year; and

      (b) The limited license shall be revoked if the contract between the user and the local, state or federal government is terminated for any reason.

      (10) At the end of the one-year limited license period in subsection (9) of this section, the user may reapply for a limited license under ORS 537.144 provided that there is an authorized contract between the user and a local, state or federal government.

      (11) The director may issue a limited license authorizing immediate use of water if the director finds that an emergency exists and the water is needed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Notwithstanding subsection (8) of this section, the director may issue a limited license for such a use for a period of 60 days. [1989 c.933 §2; 1993 c.595 §1; 1995 c.274 §8; 1997 c.38 §1; 1997 c.366 §1]

      (2) If the request submitted under subsection (1) of this section is to use stored water for purposes for which the stored water is authorized and pursuant to a contract between the user and a local, state or federal government:

      (a) The person also shall submit:

      (A) A copy of the contract;

      (B) A map indicating the point of diversion and the place of use; and

      (C) Any other information required by the Water Resources Commission that is necessary to evaluate the request as established by statute and the rules of the commission.

      (b) Upon the filing of the request under this subsection, the department shall determine whether the request contains the information listed under paragraph (a) of this subsection and is complete and not defective, including the payment of any fee required by the commission. If the department determines that the request is incomplete or defective or that all fees have not been paid, the department shall return all fees and the request. If the department determines that a request contains the information listed under paragraph (a) of this subsection and is complete and not defective, the department shall proceed with the review of the request and issuance of the limited license if the use complies with the requirements of ORS 537.143.

      (3) The notification required under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall be accompanied by the fee established by rule by the Water Resources Commission.

      (4) The department shall notify the person whether the department grants the limited license.

      (5) A request for the right to use stored water under a limited license as described in subsection (2) of this section may be made concurrently with an application for a permit to appropriate water under ORS 537.140. [1989 c.933 §3; 1995 c.274 §11; 1997 c.366 §2]

 

      537.145 Notice of filing of application to appropriate water for hydroelectric purposes. (1) If an application is made for a permit to appropriate water for hydroelectric purposes, the Water Resources Department shall give written notice of the filing of the application to the owner of any land that is:

      (a) Adjacent to any portion of the stream in which the quantity of water will be decreased by the project; or

      (b) Adjacent to the site of the proposed hydroelectric project.

      (2) The department shall also publish notice of the application once each week for at least two successive weeks and for such further time, if any, as the department shall determine, in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the project covered by the application is located. [1985 c.569 §22; 1995 c.416 §8; 2011 c.52 §3]

 

      537.147 Permit to use stored water; fee. (1) Notwithstanding the process for applying for a water right permit established in ORS 537.150 to 537.230, a person may, pursuant to this section, apply to the Water Resources Department for a water right permit to use stored water. A person applying under this section for a water right permit to use stored water shall submit:

      (a) A fee, in the amount required by ORS 536.050 for applications to appropriate stored water.

      (b) A completed application for a secondary permit, in a form determined by the department, that contains the information required of applications under ORS 537.140 and 537.400 (1).

      (c) Evidence that the proposed use of the stored water is one of the authorized uses under the water right permit, certificate or decree that allows the storage of water.

      (2) If an applicant provides, to the satisfaction of the department, the fee and the information required by subsection (1) of this section, the department may, after public notice and a 30-day opportunity to submit comments on the application, issue a water right permit upon determining that no public interest issues as identified in ORS 537.170 (8) have been raised through the comments submitted.

      (3) If the department determines that public interest issues have been identified, then the department shall treat the application under this section as an application under ORS 537.150 and perform the public interest review required by ORS 537.153 (2).

      (4) At a minimum, a water right permit issued by the department for use of stored water under this section shall be conditioned to require:

      (a) Fish screens and by-pass devices and fish passage as may be required by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife; and

      (b) A measuring device at each point of diversion authorized under the water right permit.

      (5) Within 10 days of issuing a water right permit under this section, the department shall provide notice of the permit issuance in the weekly notice published by the department and to persons who have submitted comments pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. [2005 c.37 §2]

 

      537.150 Filing of application; determination of completeness; initial review; preliminary determination; notice; public comments; fees.

If the department determines that the application is incomplete or defective or that not all fees have been paid, the department shall return the fees paid and the application.

      (2) Upon determining that an application contains the information listed under ORS 537.140 (1) and is complete and not defective, the department shall indorse on the application the date upon which the application was received at the department, which shall be the priority date for any water right issued in response to the application. All applications that comply with the provisions of law shall be recorded in a suitable book kept for that purpose.

      (3) If an application is complete and not defective, the department shall determine whether the proposed use is prohibited by ORS chapter 538. If the proposed use is prohibited by ORS chapter 538, the department shall reject the application and return all fees to the applicant with an explanation of the statutory prohibition.

      (4) If the proposed use is not prohibited by ORS chapter 538, the department shall undertake an initial review of the application and make a preliminary determination of:

      (a) Whether the proposed use is restricted or limited by statute or rule;

      (b) The extent to which water is available from the proposed source during the times and in the amounts requested; and

      (c) Any other issue the department identifies as a result of the initial review that may preclude approval of or restrict the proposed use.

      (5) Upon completion of the initial review and no later than 30 days after determining an application to be complete and not defective as described in subsection (1) of this section, the department shall notify the applicant of its preliminary determinations and allow the applicant 14 days from the date of mailing within which to notify the department to stop processing the application or to proceed with the application. If the applicant notifies the department to stop processing the application, the department shall return the application and all fees paid in excess of $260.

(1) Within 60 days after the Water Resources Department proceeds with the application under ORS 537.150 (5), the department shall complete application review and issue a proposed final order approving or denying the application or approving the application with modifications or conditions. The department may request the applicant to provide additional information needed to complete the review. If the department requests additional information, the request shall be specific and shall be sent to the applicant by registered mail. The department shall specify a date by which the information must be returned, which shall be not less than 10 days after the department mails the request to the applicant. If the department does not receive the information or a request for a time extension under ORS 537.175 by the date specified in the request, the department may reject the application and may refund fees in accordance with ORS 536.050 (4)(a). The time period specified by the department in a request for additional information shall allow the department to comply with the 60-day time limit established by this subsection.

      (2) In reviewing the application under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall presume that a proposed use will not impair or be detrimental to the public interest if the proposed use is allowed in the applicable basin program established pursuant to ORS 536.300 and 536.340 or given a preference under ORS 536.310 (12), if water is available, if the proposed use will not injure other water rights and if the proposed use complies with rules of the Water Resources Commission. This shall be a rebuttable presumption and may be overcome by a preponderance of evidence that either:

      (a) One or more of the criteria for establishing the presumption are not satisfied; or

      (b) The proposed use will impair or be detrimental to the public interest as demonstrated in comments, in a protest under subsection (6) of this section or in a finding of the department that shows:

      (A) The specific public interest under ORS 537.170 (8) that would be impaired or detrimentally affected; and

      (B) Specifically how the identified public interest would be impaired or detrimentally affected.

      (3) The proposed final order shall cite findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall include but need not be limited to:

      (a) Confirmation or modification of the preliminary determinations made in the initial review;

      (b) A brief statement that explains the criteria considered relevant to the decision, including the applicable basin program and the compatibility of the proposed use with applicable land use plans;

      (c) An assessment of water availability and the amount of water necessary for the proposed use;

      (d) An assessment of whether the proposed use would result in injury to existing water rights;

      (e) An assessment of whether the proposed use would impair or be detrimental to the public interest as provided in ORS 537.170;

      (f) A draft permit, including any proposed conditions, or a recommendation to deny the application;

      (g) Whether the rebuttable presumption that the proposed use will not impair or be detrimental to the public interest has been established; and

      (h) The date by which protests to the proposed final order must be received by the department.

      (4) The department shall mail copies of the proposed final order to the applicant and to persons who have requested copies and paid the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(p). The department also shall publish notice of the proposed final order by publication in the weekly notice published by the department.

      (5) Any person who supports a proposed final order may request standing for purposes of participating in any contested case proceeding on the proposed final order or for judicial review of a final order. A request for standing shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by the fee established under ORS 536.050 (1)(n).

      (6) Any person may submit a protest against a proposed final order. A protest shall be in writing and shall include:

      (a) The name, address and telephone number of the protestant;

      (b) A description of the protestant’s interest in the proposed final order and, if the protestant claims to represent the public interest, a precise statement of the public interest represented;

      (c) A detailed description of how the action proposed in the proposed final order would impair or be detrimental to the protestant’s interest;

      (d) A detailed description of how the proposed final order is in error or deficient and how to correct the alleged error or deficiency;

      (e) Any citation of legal authority supporting the protest, if known; and

      (f) The protest fee required under ORS 536.050.

      (7) Requests for standing and protests on the proposed final order shall be submitted within 45 days after publication of the notice of the proposed final order in the weekly notice published by the department. Any person who asks to receive a copy of the department’s final order shall submit to the department the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(p), unless the person has previously requested copies and paid the required fee under ORS 537.150 (7), the person is a protestant and has paid the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(j) or the person has standing and has paid the fee under ORS 536.050 (1)(n).

      (8) Within 60 days after the close of the period for receiving protests, the Water Resources Director shall:

      (a) Issue a final order as provided under ORS 537.170 (6); or

      (b) Schedule a contested case hearing if a protest has been submitted and if:

      (A) Upon review of the issues, the director finds that there are significant disputes related to the proposed use of water; or

      (B) Within 30 days after the close of the period for submitting protests, the applicant requests a contested case hearing. [1995 c.416 §11; 1997 c.446 §2; 1997 c.587 §5; 2007 c.188 §2; 2009 c.819 §§7,14; 2013 c.644 §5]

 

      Note: 537.153, 537.173 and 537.175 were added to and made a part of 537.145 to 537.240 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      537.160 Approval for beneficial use; agreement authorizing use of ditch for waste or seepage water. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, and of ORS 537.170 and 537.190, the Water Resources Department shall approve all applications made in proper form which contemplate the application of water to a beneficial use, unless the proposed use conflicts with existing rights.

      (2) The department may not approve an application for a permit to appropriate waste or seepage water, which is to be carried through an existing ditch or canal not owned wholly by the applicant until the applicant files with the department an agreement between the applicant and the owner of the ditch or canal, authorizing its use by the applicant to carry the water.

      (3) The department shall reject every application for a permit to appropriate water to develop hydroelectric power if the department finds that the proposed project does not comply with the standards set forth in ORS 543.017 or rules adopted by the Water Resources Commission under ORS 543.017. [Amended by 1985 c.569 §18; 1985 c.673 §197; 1995 c.416 §12]

 

      537.170 Contested case hearing on application; final order; appeal. (1) Within 45 days after the Water Resources Director schedules a contested case hearing under ORS 537.153 (8), the Water Resources Department shall hold the contested case hearing. The issues to be considered in the contested case hearing shall be limited to issues identified by the administrative law judge.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 183 pertaining to contested case proceedings, the parties to any contested case hearing initiated under this section shall be limited to:

      (a) The applicant;

      (b) Any person who timely filed a protest; and

      (c) Any person who timely filed a request for standing under ORS 537.153 (5) and who requests to intervene in the contested case hearing prior to the start of the proceeding.

      (3) The contested case proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183 except:

      (a) As provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section; and

      (b) An interlocutory appeal under ORS 183.480 (3) shall not be allowed.

      (4) If applicable, an application to appropriate water for the generation of electricity submitted under ORS 537.140 shall be included in the consolidated review and hearings process under ORS 543.255.

      (5) Each person submitting a protest or a request for standing shall raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably available arguments supporting the person’s position by the close of the protest period. Failure to raise a reasonably ascertainable issue in a protest or in a hearing or failure to provide sufficient specificity to afford the Water Resources Department an opportunity to respond to the issue precludes judicial review based on that issue.

      (6) If, after the contested case hearing or, if a hearing is not held, after the close of the period allowed to file a protest, the director determines that the proposed use does not comply with the standards set forth in ORS 543.017 or rules adopted by the Water Resources Commission under ORS 543.017 or would otherwise impair or be detrimental to the public interest, the director shall issue a final order rejecting the application or modifying the proposed final order to conform to the public interest. If, after the contested case hearing or, if a hearing is not held, after the close of the period allowed to file a protest, the director determines that the proposed use would not impair or be detrimental to the public interest, the director shall issue a final order approving the application or otherwise modifying the proposed final order. A final order may set forth any of the provisions or restrictions to be included in the permit concerning the use, control and management of the water to be appropriated for the project, including, but not limited to, a specification of reservoir operation and minimum releases to protect the public interest.

      (7) If a contested case hearing is not held:

      (a) Where the final order modifies the proposed final order, the applicant may request and the department shall schedule a contested case hearing as provided under subsection (3) of this section by submitting the information required for a protest under ORS 537.153 (6) within 14 days after the director issues the final order. However, the issues on which a contested case hearing may be requested and conducted under this paragraph shall be limited to issues based on the modifications to the proposed final order.

      (b) Only the applicant or a protestant may appeal the provisions of the final order in the manner established in ORS chapter 183 for appeal of order other than contested cases.

      (8) If the presumption of public interest under ORS 537.153 (2) is overcome, then before issuing a final order, the director or the commission, if applicable, shall make the final determination of whether the proposed use or the proposed use as modified in the proposed final order would impair or be detrimental to the public interest by considering:

      (a) Conserving the highest use of the water for all purposes, including irrigation, domestic use, municipal water supply, power development, public recreation, protection of commercial and game fishing and wildlife, fire protection, mining, industrial purposes, navigation, scenic attraction or any other beneficial use to which the water may be applied for which it may have a special value to the public.

      (b) The maximum economic development of the waters involved.

      (c) The control of the waters of this state for all beneficial purposes, including drainage, sanitation and flood control.

      (d) The amount of waters available for appropriation for beneficial use.

      (e) The prevention of wasteful, uneconomic, impracticable or unreasonable use of the waters involved.

      (f) All vested and inchoate rights to the waters of this state or to the use of the waters of this state, and the means necessary to protect such rights.

      (g) The state water resources policy formulated under ORS 536.295 to 536.350 and 537.505 to 537.534.

      (9) Upon issuing a final order, the director shall notify the applicant and each person who submitted written comments or protests or otherwise requested notice of the final order and send a copy of the final order to any person who requested a copy and paid the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(p). [Amended by 1955 c.707 §36; 1961 c.224 §12; 1963 c.378 §1; 1975 c.581 §26; 1985 c.569 §19; 1985 c.673 §30; 1995 c.416 §13; 1997 c.587 §6; 2003 c.75 §96]

 

      537.173 Exceptions to final order; modified order. (1) Within 20 days after the Water Resources Director issues a final order under ORS 537.170 after the conclusion of a contested case hearing, any party may file exceptions to the order with the Water Resources Commission.

      (2) The commission shall issue a modified order, if allowed, or deny the exceptions within 60 days after the close of the exception period under subsection (1) of this section. [1995 c.416 §14]

 

      Note: See note under 537.153.

 

      537.175 Time limit for issuing final order or scheduling contested case hearing; applicant request for extension. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the Water Resources Department shall issue a final order or schedule a contested case hearing on an application for a water right referred to in ORS 537.140 or 537.400 within 180 days after the department proceeds with the application under ORS 537.150 (5).

      (2) At the request of the applicant, the department may extend the 180-day period set forth in subsection (1) of this section for a reasonable period of time.

      (3) If a contested case hearing is held, the department shall issue a final order:

      (a) Within 270 days after scheduling the hearing for a contested case proceeding that involves three or more parties not including the department; and

      (b) Within 180 days after scheduling the hearing for all other contested case proceedings.

      (4) If the applicant does not request an extension under subsection (2) of this section and the department fails to issue a proposed final order or schedule a contested case hearing on an application for a water right within 180 days after the department proceeds with the application under ORS 537.150 (5), the applicant may apply in the Circuit Court for Marion County for a writ of mandamus to compel the department to issue a final order or schedule a contested case hearing on an application for a water right. If the application is for an out-of-stream use, the writ of mandamus shall compel the department to issue a water right permit, unless the department shows by affidavit that to issue a permit may result in harm to an existing water right holder. [1995 c.416 §17]

 

      Note: See note under 537.153.

      537.190 Terms and conditions of approval; municipal water supplies; release of stored water. (1) The Water Resources Department may approve an application for less water than applied for, or upon terms, limitations and conditions necessary for the protection of the public interest, including terms, limitations and conditions relating to the release of water from an impoundment or diversion structure necessary to prevent rapid fluctuation in the stream level below the structure which may create a hazard to life or property, if there exists substantial reason therefor. In any event the department shall not approve an application for more water than can be applied to a beneficial use.

      (2) The department may approve an application for a municipal water supply to the exclusion of all subsequent appropriations, if the exigencies of the case demand.

      (3) When conditions beyond the control of the owner or operator of an impoundment or diversion structure, to which terms, limitations and conditions made as provided in subsection (1) of this section relate, threaten the safety of the structure and the release of water from the structure contrary to such terms, limitations and conditions is or may be necessary to remove the threat:

      (a) The terms, limitations and conditions shall not apply to such release of water.

      (b) The owner, operator or person in immediate charge of the structure shall immediately notify the department by telegraph or telephone of the situation.

      (c) The owner, operator or person in immediate charge of the structure shall immediately notify, to the best of the person’s ability, those persons whose life or property may be threatened by the release of water.

      537.211 Issuance of permit if application approved; contents of permit; effect; rejection of application; change in permit terms. (1) The approval of an application referred to in ORS 537.140 or 537.400 shall be set forth in a water right permit issued by the Water Resources Department. The permit shall specify the details of the authorized use and shall set forth any terms, limitations and conditions as the department considers appropriate including but not limited to any applicable condition required under ORS 537.289. A copy of the permit shall be filed as a public record in the department. The permit shall be mailed to the applicant, and upon receipt of the permit the permittee may proceed with the construction of the necessary works and may take all action required to apply the water to the designated beneficial use and to perfect the proposed appropriation.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, if an application under ORS 537.140 or 537.400 indicates that the applicant does not have written authorization or an easement permitting access to nonowned land crossed by the proposed ditch, canal or other work, the department may issue a final order approving the application if the approval includes a condition requiring the applicant to obtain such written authorization, or easement or ownership of such land and to provide the department with a copy of the written authorization, easement or evidence of ownership.

      (3) If an application referred to in ORS 537.140 or 537.400 is rejected, the department shall enter a written order setting forth the reasons for the rejection. The applicant shall take no action toward construction of the works or use of the water. The department shall mail a copy of the order to the applicant.

      (4) The holder of a water right permit may change the point of diversion, change the point of appropriation, change the point of diversion to allow the appropriation of ground water or use the water on land to which the right is not appurtenant if:

      (a) The use of water on land to which the right is not appurtenant, the change of point of diversion or the change in point of appropriation does not result in injury to an existing water right;

      (b) For a proposed change in the place of use of the water, the land on which the water is to be used is owned or controlled by the holder of the permit and is contiguous to the land to which the permit is appurtenant;

      (c) All other terms of the permit remain the same, including but not limited to the beneficial use for which the water is used and the number of acres to which water is applied;

      (d) Prior approval is obtained from the district if the water is transported or conveyed by an irrigation district organized under ORS chapter 545, a drainage district organized under ORS chapter 547, a water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552, a water control district organized under ORS chapter 553 or a district improvement company or a corporation organized under ORS chapter 554;

      (g) Diversion is provided with a proper fish screen, if requested by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife; and

      (h) For a request to transfer the point of diversion to allow the appropriation of ground water, the proposed change meets the standards set forth in ORS 540.531 (2) or (3).

      (5) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (4)(b) of this section, the holder of a water right permit may change the place of use of all or any portion of water under the permit to land that is not contiguous to the land to which the permit is appurtenant if:

      (a) The change to noncontiguous land is in furtherance of mitigation or conservation efforts undertaken for the purposes of benefiting a species listed as sensitive, threatened or endangered under ORS 496.171 to 496.192 or the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 to 1544), as determined by the listing agency; and

      (b) All other requirements of subsection (4) of this section are met.

      (6) For an application made by or on behalf of a public corporation, the department may issue a permit approving the application without requiring the applicant to obtain prior written authorization or an easement permitting access to nonowned lands affected by the proposed project. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to allow any person to trespass on the lands of another person.

      (7) When the department receives notice under subsection (4)(e) of this section, the department shall publish the notice in the department’s weekly public notice of water right applications.

      (8) If the use of water under the permit is for operation of a mining operation as defined in ORS 517.952:

      (a) Review of the application and approval or denial of the application shall be coordinated with the consolidated application process under ORS 517.952 to 517.989. However, such review and approval or denial shall take into consideration all policy considerations for the appropriation of water as set forth in this chapter and ORS chapter 536.

      (b) The permit may be issued for exploration under ORS 517.702 to 517.740, but the permit shall be conditioned on the applicant’s compliance with the consolidated application process.

      537.220 Assignment of application, permit or license. (1) Any application, permit or license to appropriate water may be assigned, subject to the conditions of the application or permit, but no such assignment shall be binding, except upon the parties to the assignment, unless filed for record in the Water Resources Department.

      (2) An assignment of an application, permit or license to appropriate water filed for record with the Water Resources Department shall identify the current record owners of all property described in the application, permit or license. The assignor shall furnish proof acceptable to the department that notice of the assignment has been given or attempted for each identified property owner not a party to the assignment. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §34; 1995 c.367 §1]

 

      537.225 Full or partial assignment of water right permit; issuance of replacement permits. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 537.220 and 537.635, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a record landowner holding a water right permit for an irrigation, nursery, temperature control, stock watering or agricultural water use that has a subsequent completion date may apply for assignment of all or part of the water right permit and for the issuance of a replacement water right permit that reflects that assignment. To obtain the assignment and replacement water right permits, the applicant shall submit an application to the Water Resources Department that includes, at a minimum:

      (a) A map prepared by a certified water right examiner and meeting department mapping standards that identifies the authorized place of use, rate of use, any applicable acre-feet allowances, tax lots and points of diversion or appropriation;

      (b) A copy of the deed showing that the applicant is an owner of the land;

      (c) An affidavit certifying that the water right has not been conveyed or withheld;

      (d) A statement by the applicant that the most recent water use under the permit, if any, has been exercised within relevant terms and conditions of the permit; and

      (e)(A) Agreements to the assignment and to the request for the issuance of replacement water right permits submitted jointly or individually by all owners of the land to which the water right is appurtenant; or

      (B) An assignment of interest and request for the issuance of replacement water right permits submitted by one or more of the owners of land to which the water right is appurtenant and information identifying the names, addresses and proportionate interests for those owners not submitting the assignment and request.

      (2) In addition to the application contents described in subsection (1) of this section, the department may require that the applicant provide any additional information the department deems appropriate to determining whether to approve the application.

      (3) Upon receiving an application under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall determine and notify the applicant of the fees payable under ORS 536.050 for processing the application. Upon receipt of the appropriate processing fees, the department shall:

      (a) Verify the address of each owner of the lands identified on the map contained in the application;

      (b) Verify that the deed supplied with the application matches the property proposed for assignment;

      (c) Prepare a statement that the proposed replacement water right permits will not result in the enlargement of the original water right, a proposed final order and drafts of replacement water right permits;

      (d) No later than one week prior to the date of the weekly notice described in paragraph (e) of this subsection, mail copies of the application, the map, the existing water right permit, the proposed final order and the draft replacement water right permits to each owner of land to which the existing water right is appurtenant; and

      (e) Provide public notice of the application in the weekly notice published by the department.

      (4) The department shall allow comment on the application for 30 days following public notice of the application in the weekly notice published by the department. Any protest against the proposed final order must be submitted no later than 45 days after the date of the weekly notice published by the department. A protest must be filed in the manner provided in ORS 537.227.

      (5) If the department determines that an application under subsection (1) of this section to assign all or part of a water right permit has been properly filed, and that the issuance of replacement water right permits will not result in the enlargement of the original water right or otherwise cause injury to other water right holders, the department shall issue one or more replacement water right permits to reflect the assignment. The replacement water right permits:

      (a) Must have the same conditions as the replaced water right permit, including but not limited to priority date, source of water and type of use;

      (b) May not add or change a point of diversion or point of appropriation;

      (c) May not result in the enlargement of the water use authorized under the replaced water right permit;

      (d) Must apportion the rate, and if applicable the duty, in proportion to the amount of land to which the water right is appurtenant; and

      (e) Must identify the land to which the replacement water right permit is appurtenant and the owner of that land.

      (6) This section does not apply to municipal or quasi-municipal permits or to permits held by a unit of local government, including but not limited to permits held by a port or water authority or a district. As used in this subsection, “unit of local government” has the meaning given that term in ORS 190.003 and “district” has the meaning given that term in ORS 540.505. [2013 c.166 §2]

 

      Note: 537.225 and 537.227 were added to and made a part of ORS chapter 537 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      537.227 Protest of application to assign all or part of water right permit. (1) A record landowner, an assignee, an affected water right permit holder or other interested person may protest a Water Resources Department proposed final order for a water right assignment under ORS 537.225. The protest must be in writing and received by the department within the time provided under ORS 537.225 (4). The protest must be accompanied by the protest fee required under ORS 536.050 and include:

      (a) The name, address and telephone number of the person filing the protest; and

      (b) A detailed explanation of why the proposed order does not conform with the criteria for a water right permit assignment and a description of the changes to the order that are necessary to correct the nonconformity.

      (2) A protest must identify all issues the person wishes to raise that are reasonably ascertainable at the time the protest is filed. The issues must directly pertain to whether the proposed replacement water right permits are authorized under and in conformance with ORS 537.225.

      (3) If a protest is properly filed, the department may work with the applicant for the water right assignment and the person filing the protest to determine whether the issues raised by the protest can be resolved informally. The department may:

      (a) Reissue a proposed final order;

      (b) Issue a final order; or

      (c) Refer the matter for a contested case hearing.

      (4) If the department is unable to resolve the issues informally and refers the matter for a contested case hearing, the issues properly before the administrative law judge are limited to whether the proposed replacement water right permits are authorized under and in conformance with ORS 537.225. Any unraised issue that was reasonably ascertainable at the time the protest was filed and any argument not raised in the protest with sufficient specificity to afford the department an opportunity for response is not subject to review at the contested case hearing.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 183.310, the parties to a contested case hearing held under this section are limited to:

      (a) The applicant for the water right assignment; and

      (b) Persons that timely filed a protest against the proposed order under ORS 537.225 (4). [2013 c.166 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 537.225.

 

      537.230 Time allowed for construction of irrigation or other work; extension; survey; map; requirements for supplemental water right. (1) As used in this section, “undeveloped portion” means the difference between the maximum rate or duty specified in a water right permit and the maximum rate or duty diverted as of the later of:

      (a) June 29, 2005;

      (b) The time specified in the permit to perfect the water right; or

      (c) The time specified in the last-approved extension of time to perfect the water right.

      (2) Except for a holder of a permit for municipal use, the holder of a water right permit shall prosecute the construction of any proposed irrigation or other work with reasonable diligence and complete the construction within a reasonable time, as fixed in the permit by the Water Resources Department, not to exceed five years from the date of approval.

      (3) The holder of a permit for municipal use shall commence and complete the construction of any proposed works within 20 years from the date on which a permit for municipal use is issued under ORS 537.211. The construction must proceed with reasonable diligence and be completed within the time specified in the permit, not to exceed 20 years. However, the department may order and allow an extension of time to complete construction or to perfect a water right beyond the time specified in the permit under the following conditions:

      (a) The holder shows good cause. In determining the extension, the department shall give due weight to the considerations described under ORS 539.010 (5) and to whether other governmental requirements relating to the project have significantly delayed completion of construction or perfection of the right;

      (b) The extension of time is conditioned to require that the holder submit, and obtain department approval of, a water management and conservation plan;

      (c) The extension of time is conditioned to provide that the holder may divert the undeveloped portion of the permit only upon approval by the department of the water management and conservation plan; and

      (d) For the first extension issued after June 29, 2005, for a permit for municipal use issued before November 2, 1998, the department finds that the undeveloped portion of the permit is conditioned to maintain, in the portions of waterways affected by water use under the permit, the persistence of fish species listed as sensitive, threatened or endangered under state or federal law. The department shall base its finding on existing data and upon the advice of the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. An existing fish protection agreement between the permit holder and a state or federal agency that includes conditions to maintain the persistence of any listed fish species in the affected portion of the waterway is conclusive for purposes of the finding.

      (4) Except as provided in ORS 537.240 and 537.248 and subsection (3) of this section, the Water Resources Department, for good cause shown, shall order and allow an extension of time, including an extension beyond the five-year limit established in subsection (2) of this section within which irrigation or other works shall be completed or the right perfected. In determining the extension, the department shall give due weight to the considerations described under ORS 539.010 (5) and to whether other governmental requirements relating to the project have significantly delayed completion of construction or perfection of the right.

      (5) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section and ORS 537.409, upon completion of beneficial use as required under this section, the holder of a permit shall hire a water right examiner certified under ORS 537.798 to survey the appropriation. Within one year after application of water to a beneficial use or the beneficial use date allowed in the permit, the holder shall submit a map of the survey as required by the Water Resources Department, that shall accompany the request for a water right certificate submitted to the department under ORS 537.250. If any property described in the permit is not included in the request for a water right certificate, the holder shall state the identity of the record owner of that property.

      (6) The Water Resources Director may waive the requirement under subsection (5) of this section that a holder of a permit hire a water right examiner certified under ORS 537.798 if:

      (a) The permit is a supplemental water right that shares the same distribution system and same place of use as the primary water right; and

      (b) The department determines that there is sufficient information in the records of the department to determine proof of beneficial use.

      (7) Notwithstanding ORS 537.410, for purposes of obtaining a water right certificate under ORS 537.250 for a supplemental water right, the holder of a permit shall have a facility capable of handling the full rate and duty of water requested from the supplemental source and be otherwise ready, willing and able to use the amount of water requested, up to the amount of water approved in the water right permit. To obtain a certificate for a supplemental water right, the holder is not required to have actually used water from the supplemental source if:

      (a) Water was available from the source of the primary water right and the primary water right was used pursuant to the terms of the primary water right; or

      (b) The nonuse of water from the supplemental source occurred during a period of time within which the exercise of the supplemental water right permit was not necessary due to climatic conditions. [Amended by 1985 c.617 §1; 1985 c.673 §201; 1987 c.542 §4; 1995 c.367 §2; 1995 c.416 §35; 1995 c.473 §5; 1997 c.446 §4; 1997 c.502 §1; 1997 c.557 §1; 1999 c.453 §1; 1999 c.665 §2; 2005 c.410 §1; 2017 c.704 §1]

 

      537.240 Federal permit; time for obtaining; cancellation; time for beginning and completing work. (1) In any case where a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is or shall be required in connection with the development of the applicant’s proposed project, the applicant shall make application for the necessary federal permit or license within six months, or, if the applicant is a municipal corporation, within 10 years, from the date of filing application for appropriation of water with the Water Resources Department.

      (2) Upon failure of the applicant to file with the department, within 30 days after the expiration of the period above prescribed, satisfactory proof that application for the federal permit or license has been duly made, the application to appropriate water shall be terminated and become void.

      (3) Where the application for the necessary permit or license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is finally rejected or disallowed, or if after being granted, the permit or license is revoked or forfeited because of failure to begin or carry on the construction work when and as required by the permit or license, then the department shall, upon the filing in the Water Resources Department of satisfactory proof of such fact, revoke and cancel any permit issued by the department for appropriation of water for use in the project for which the federal permit or license was required.

      (4) In case of any permit issued for the appropriation of water for the utilization of which a permit or license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is necessary, the time to be allowed for the beginning and completion of construction under the permit from the department shall be made to conform to the time fixed for such beginning and completion in the permit or license, and in any extension thereof, issued for the project by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §36; 1995 c.416 §36]

 

      537.248 Requirement to include in reservoir permit date for beginning and completing construction and for perfecting water right; extension. (1) When the Water Resources Department issues a reservoir permit for a new storage project to a county, municipality or district, the department shall include in the permit a date, not more than 10 years after the date the permit is issued, to begin and complete construction of diversion or storage works and to perfect the water right. An application for a reservoir permit under this section shall be subject to the provisions of ORS 537.140 to 537.211, except that the applicant need not submit engineering plans and specifications before the permit is issued. However, the applicant may not begin construction of the reservoir until the department approves the engineering plans and specifications.

      (2) By order, the Water Resources Director may extend the date for beginning and completing construction and for completing perfection of the use if the applicant shows reasonable diligence and good cause. An extension allowed under this subsection shall not exceed 10 years, but the applicant may request additional extensions.

      (3) As used in this section, “district” includes the entities set forth in ORS 198.010 and 198.180. [1995 c.473 §2; 1995 c.416 §35a]

 

      Note: 537.248 and 537.249 were added to and made a part of 537.140 to 537.252 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      537.249 Election to have proposed reservation considered as application for permit or rulemaking proceeding. (1) In lieu of the procedure established pursuant to ORS 537.358, for any reservation pending on July 5, 1995, the state agency that requested the reservation may elect to have the proposed reservation considered:

      (a) As an application for a permit under ORS 537.140 to 537.211 and 537.248; or

      (b) As a rulemaking proceeding under the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183 in which case the provisions of ORS 537.358 requiring a public interest review under ORS 537.170 shall not be applicable.

      (2) A state agency making any election under subsection (1) of this section shall submit a written request to the Water Resources Commission within 90 days after July 5, 1995. The commission shall proceed in accordance with the election made under subsection (1) of this section or, if an election is not submitted, according to the procedure established pursuant to ORS 537.358.

      (3) A reservation established under the provisions of this section shall have as a priority date the date established in rules of the commission in effect on July 5, 1995.

      (4) When issuing a reservoir permit for a multipurpose storage project using water reserved or proposed to be reserved under a request originally filed by the Water Resources Department before June 5, 1992, the department shall grant a preference for the project under ORS 537.352.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 537.356, the Water Resources Commission may accept requests to reserve unappropriated water before July 1, 1997, but shall not begin to process such requests before July 1, 1997. Any request to reserve unappropriated water submitted by the State Department of Agriculture before July 1, 1997, also shall consider municipal needs. The priority date of a request received in proper form by the Water Resources Commission after July 5, 1995, shall be the date of receipt. [1995 c.473 §3; 1995 c.416 §35b]

 

      Note: See note under 537.248.

 

      537.250 Water right certificate; issuance; inclusion of land not described in permit; recordation; duration of rights. (1) After the Water Resources Department has received a request for issuance of a water right certificate accompanied by the survey required under ORS 537.230 that shows, to the satisfaction of the department, that an appropriation has been perfected in accordance with the provisions of the Water Rights Act, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the department shall issue to the applicant a certificate of the same character as that described in ORS 539.140. The certificate shall be recorded and transmitted to the applicant as provided in that section.

      (2) When issuing a water right certificate under this section in the name of a district as defined in ORS 540.505, or in the name of a government agency for a district, the department may issue the water right certificate for land not described in the permit in accordance with ORS 537.252.

      (3) Rights to the use of water acquired under the provisions of the Water Rights Act, as set forth in a certificate issued under this section, shall continue in the owner thereof so long as the water shall be applied to a beneficial use under and in accordance with the terms of the certificate, subject only to loss:

      (a) By nonuse as specified and provided in ORS 540.610; or

      (b) As provided in ORS 537.297.

      (4) The department may not issue a water right certificate for municipal use under this section if:

      (a) An extension of time is required; and

      (b) The order approving the extension of time has not become final by operation of law or on appeal. [Amended by 1985 c.392 §11; 1985 c.673 §191; 1987 c.542 §6; 1989 c.509 §6; 1995 c.218 §3; 1995 c.365 §5; 1995 c.416 §21a; 2005 c.410 §3; 2017 c.704 §2]

 

      537.252 Certificate issued for land not described in permit; notice. (1) When issuing a water right certificate under ORS 537.250 to a district, or to a government agency for a district, the Water Resources Department may issue the water right certificate for land not described in the permit if:

      (a) Water furnished by the district under the permit has been applied beneficially to the land;

      (b) The land not described in the permit that is proposed to be included in the certificate is included within the legally established boundaries of the district and is subject to the charges, assessments and liens of the district;

      (c) The certificate does not authorize a greater rate, duty or acreage than is authorized by the terms of the permit, and all other conditions of the permit are satisfied;

      (d) The inclusion of land not described in the permit will not result in injury to other existing water rights or in enlargement of the right authorized under the permit; and

      (e) The impact to the water source of including land not described in the permit will not differ significantly from the impact expected at the time the permit was issued for the lands described in the permit.

      (2) If a district proposes to use water on lands not described in the permit, the Water Resources Department may issue a certificate that includes such additional lands if all of the conditions of subsection (1) of this section are satisfied and if, no later than 60 days before the district actually applies the water to the lands not described in the permit, the district provides written notice to the department. The notice shall include a copy of the original permit map modified to show the lands to be added and lands to be removed from the description of the place of use of the water. Upon receipt of the notice from the district, the department shall provide public notice of the proposed change by means of publication in the department’s weekly notice and by publication once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the county or counties in which the affected lands are located. The cost of publication shall be paid by the district.

      (3) If a district has issued an order of inclusion or exclusion, the boundaries of the irrigation district shall be deemed to have been legally changed in the absence of approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

      (4) As used in this section:

      (a) “District” has the meaning given in ORS 540.505.

      (b) “Legally established boundaries” means the boundaries of a district as established at the time of creation of the district and as the boundaries may have changed after creation of the district by an inclusion, exclusion or merger proceeding according to state law. [1995 c.218 §2; 1995 c.416 §21b; 2003 c.14 §343; 2011 c.52 §4]

 

      537.260 Cancellation of permit for failure of proof of completion of appropriation; issuance of limited certificate; contest of issuance of certificate; exception for municipalities. (1) Except as provided under subsection (4) of this section for a permit issued to a municipality, whenever the time within which any appropriation under a permit should have been perfected has expired and the owner of the permit fails or refuses within three months thereafter to submit to the Water Resources Department proof of completion of the appropriation as required by ORS 537.230 and 537.250, the department may, after 60 days’ notice by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt, order the cancellation of the permit. The cancellation shall have the same force and effect as cancellation of a permit in the proceedings provided for in ORS 537.410 to 537.450.

      (2) The department may determine the extent to which an appropriation has been perfected under any permit at the time of submission of final proof provided for in ORS 537.250, and shall limit the certificate provided for in that section to a description of such appropriation as has been actually perfected to the extent that the water applied for has been actually applied to the beneficial use contemplated in the permit.

      (3) Any person owning an application, permit or water right certificate subsequent in priority may jointly or severally contest before the department the issuance of the water right certificate at any time before it has issued, and after the time has expired for the completion of the appropriation under the permit, or within three months after issuance of the certificate. The contest shall be brought upon application made, and hearing shall be had in the same manner and after notice as provided in ORS 537.420 for proceedings for cancellation of permits. The department, in a final order, may cancel the permit or determine the extent to which the appropriation claimed thereunder has been perfected, and issue a water right certificate accordingly, or if a certificate has been issued, in the case of a contest within three months after its issuance, the department may cancel the water right certificate, or affirm its issuance, and if the water right certificate in such case is canceled, the permit upon which it is based shall also be canceled.

      (4) A municipality may partially perfect not less than 25 percent of the water authorized by its permit without loss of priority or cancellation of the municipality’s permit under this section. If a municipality defers perfection of its water right under this section, the department shall issue a certificate under ORS 537.250 only for the amount perfected. Upon perfection of the deferred amount, the municipality shall request a water right certificate for the remaining portion of the water applied for in the original permit application. As used in this section, “municipality” includes a city, a port formed under ORS 777.005 to 777.725 and 777.915 to 777.953, a domestic water supply district formed under ORS chapter 264 or a water authority formed under ORS chapter 450. [Amended by 1983 c.740 §211; 1985 c.673 §38; 1989 c.707 §2; 1991 c.249 §43; 1993 c.577 §35; 1995 c.416 §37]

 

      537.270 Conclusiveness of certificate. A water right certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of ORS 537.250 which, after the expiration of three months from the date it is issued, has not been contested and canceled in the manner provided in ORS 537.260, and a water right certificate, when issued under ORS 539.140, shall be conclusive evidence of the priority and extent of the appropriation therein described in any proceeding in any court or tribunal of the state, except in those cases where the rights of appropriation thereby described have been abandoned subsequent to issuance of the certificate.

 

      537.280 [Renumbered 537.335]

 

      537.282 Definition of “municipal applicant.” As used in ORS 537.282 to 537.299, “municipal applicant” means any municipal corporation or district as defined in ORS 543.655 that has applied for a permit to appropriate water for the purpose of generating hydroelectric power under the provisions of this chapter, or that has been accorded any right or preference under ORS 543.260, 543.270 or 543.610. [1985 c.392 §2]

 

      537.283 Procedure for applications to appropriate water for hydroelectric power; rules. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 537.140 to 537.350, in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, the Water Resources Commission shall by rule establish a procedure for processing applications to appropriate water for hydroelectric power under ORS 537.140 to 537.320.

      (2) Rules adopted under subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) To the extent possible, shall be consistent with the process established for other applications to appropriate water for other beneficial uses under ORS 537.140 to 537.252.

      (b) Shall not supersede any provision pertaining to hydroelectric power established under this chapter or ORS chapter 543, to the extent such provisions are applicable to applications to appropriate water for hydroelectric power purposes.

      (c) Need not comply with the mandatory time limits or notice provisions established under ORS 537.140 to 537.350 if such provisions are incompatible with the substantive requirements applicable to applications to appropriate water for hydroelectric power purposes. [1995 c.416 §32a]

 

      Note: 537.283 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 537 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      537.285 Municipal applicant may develop hydroelectric project jointly with private person; restrictions. A municipal applicant may contract with a private person for the purpose of generating hydroelectric power. The municipal applicant shall retain sufficient benefit and interest in, and control of a joint project as necessary for the project to be considered a municipal project. A municipal applicant and a private person developing a joint project under this chapter must comply with the rules adopted by the Water Resources Commission under ORS 537.287. [1985 c.392 §3]

 

      537.287 Rules for joint project of municipal applicant and private person. The Water Resources Commission shall establish rules necessary to carry out the provisions of ORS 537.285. The rules shall include the amount of control over and interest in a joint project a municipal applicant must retain in order to receive the benefit of the municipal preference and proceed under the municipal application process set forth in this chapter. [1985 c.392 §4]

 

      537.289 Conditions to be imposed on permit of municipal corporation or district. (1) Whenever the Water Resources Department issues a permit under ORS 537.211 allowing a municipal corporation or district, as defined in ORS 543.655, to appropriate water for the purpose of generating hydroelectric power, the department shall impose the following conditions on the permit, in addition to any other term, limitation or condition imposed under ORS 537.211:

      (a) That the permit may not be assigned to any nonmunicipal entity so as to result in a loss of ownership of the permit by a municipal corporation or district.

      (b) Water use during the extended season would not impair in-stream flows that are necessary to protect aquatic resources; and

      (c) Water diversion and use during the period of the extended season would not impair the achievement or maintenance of water quality standards as established for the water source by the Department of Environmental Quality.

      (2) If the source of water identified in the request is stored water and water is available from the storage source during the period of the extended irrigation season, the commission may extend the irrigation season as requested without making the findings required by subsection (1) of this section. However, use of water during the extended period shall be limited to the stored water.

      (3) In order to ensure that use of water during an extended irrigation season does not injure existing and future water rights, use of water during the extended period of the irrigation season shall be subordinated to all existing and future water rights.

      (4) Use of water during the extended irrigation season shall comply with all conditions and limitations of the permit or certificate, including the rate, duty and place of use of the right.

      (5) Use of water shall be regulated among irrigators for whom the season has been extended during the extended irrigation season according to the priority date of the permit or certificate. [1995 c.356 §1; 2007 c.187 §1]

      537.390 Valuation of water rights. In any valuation for rate-making purposes, or in any proceeding for the acquisition of rights to the use of water and the property used in connection therewith, under any license or statute of the United States or under the laws of Oregon, no value shall be recognized or allowed for such rights in excess of the actual cost to the owner of perfecting them in accordance with the provisions of the Water Rights Act. [Formerly 537.280; and then 537.335]

 

      537.395 Public recapture of water power rights and properties; no recapture of other rights. (1) Any certificate issued for power purposes to a person other than the United States, or the State of Oregon or any municipality thereof, shall provide that after the expiration of 50 years from the granting of the certificate or at the expiration of any federal power license, and after not less than two years’ notice in writing to the holder of the certificate, the State of Oregon, or any municipality thereof, may take over the dams, plants and other structures, and all appurtenances thereto, which have been constructed for the purpose of devoting to beneficial use the water rights specified in the certificate. The taking over shall be upon condition that before taking possession the state or municipality shall pay not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus such reasonable damages, if any, to valuable, serviceable and dependent property of the holder of the certificate, not taken over, as may be caused by the severance therefrom of the property taken.

      (2) The fair value of the property taken and the severance damages, if any, shall be determined by agreement between the holder of the certificate and the state or municipality, or, in case they cannot agree, by proceedings in equity instituted by the state or municipality in the circuit court of the county in which the largest portion of the property is located.

      (3) The right of the state or any municipality to take over, maintain and operate any property which has devoted to beneficial use water rights specified in the certificate, by condemnation proceedings upon payment of just compensation, is expressly reserved.

      (4) The provision for the recapture of any rights other than for power purposes, as provided in this section, contained in any certificate issued before June 14, 1939, shall be of no force and effect and may be canceled from the records wherever recorded and a new certificate issued with the recapture clause eliminated.

      (5) The owner of any certificate issued before June 14, 1939, for such rights may, upon surrendering the certificate, receive a new certificate therefor issued under and subject to the provisions of this section. [Formerly 537.290; and then 537.340]

 

PONDS AND RESERVOIRS

 

      537.400 Reservoir permits. (1) All applications for reservoir permits shall be subject to the provisions of ORS 537.130, 537.140, 537.142 and 537.145 to 537.240, except that an enumeration of any lands proposed to be irrigated under the Water Rights Act shall not be required in the primary permit. But the party proposing to apply to a beneficial use the water stored in any such reservoir shall file an application for permit, to be known as the secondary permit, in compliance with the provisions of ORS 537.130, 537.140, 537.142 and 537.145 to 537.240. The application shall refer to the reservoir for a supply of water and shall show by documentary evidence that an agreement has been entered into with the owners of the reservoir for a sufficient interest in the reservoir to impound enough water for the purposes set forth in the application, that the applicant has provided notice of the application to the operator of the reservoir and, if applicable, that an agreement has been entered into with the entity delivering the stored water. When beneficial use has been completed and perfected under the secondary permit, the Water Resources Department shall take the proof of the water user under the permit. The final certificate of appropriation shall refer to both the ditch described in the secondary permit and the reservoir described in the primary permit.

      (2) Whenever application is made for permit to store water in a reservoir or pond for any beneficial use which does not contemplate future diversion of the stored water except by livestock drinking from stock water ponds, the extent of utilization thereof may be included in the reservoir permit and no secondary permit shall be required. However, in cases where water from a stream is required to maintain a reservoir or pond by replacing evaporation and seepage losses, or is required to maintain suitable fresh water conditions for the proposed use and to prevent stagnation, the applicant for permit to store water in such reservoir or pond shall also file an application for permit to appropriate the waters of the stream.

      (3) An application submitted to construct a reservoir storing less than 9.2 acre-feet of water or with a dam less than 10 feet in height need not be accompanied by a map prepared by a water right examiner certified under ORS 537.798 as required by ORS 537.140 (4). The map submitted with the application shall comply with standards established by the Water Resources Commission. The survey required under ORS 537.230 shall be prepared by a water right examiner certified under ORS 537.798 and shall be submitted to the department before the department issues the water right certificate.

      (4) If a dam safety review is required under ORS 540.350, the department may issue a final order approving an application on the basis of preliminary plans, specifications and supporting information if the approval includes a condition requiring the commission’s approval of final plans, specifications and supporting information under ORS 540.350 before the permit is issued.

      (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 537.211 (2), the department may approve an application for a reservoir permit for which a dam safety review is required under ORS 540.350 and issue a permit, subject to the condition that before the reservoir may be filled, the permittee shall submit to the department evidence that the permittee owns, or has written authorization or an easement permitting access to, all lands to be inundated by the reservoir.

The Water Resources Commission may by rule provide that the owners of permits shall submit or furnish proofs of commencement of work, prosecution of work with due diligence, completion of work, and of the application of water to a beneficial use under the permits. Failure to comply with the commission’s rules in respect to the proofs shall be considered prima facie evidence of failure to commence work, prosecute work with due diligence, complete work, or apply water to the beneficial use contemplated by the permit in proceedings under ORS 537.410 to 537.440 for the cancellation of permits. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §45]

 

CONSERVATION AND USE OF CONSERVED WATER

 

      537.455 Definitions for ORS 537.455 to 537.500 and 540.510. As used in ORS 537.455 to 537.500 and 540.510:

      (1) “Conservation” means the reduction of the amount of water diverted to satisfy an existing beneficial use achieved either by improving the technology or method for diverting, transporting, applying or recovering the water or by implementing other approved conservation measures.

      (2) “Conserved water” means that amount of water that results from conservation measures, measured as the difference between:

      (a) The smaller of the amount stated on the water right or the maximum amount of water that can be diverted using the existing facilities; and

      (b) The amount of water needed after implementation of conservation measures to meet the beneficial use under the water right certificate. [1987 c.264 §1; 1993 c.641 §1]

 

      Note: 537.455 to 537.500 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 537 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      537.460 Legislative findings; policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that conservation and efficient utilization of water benefits all water users, provides water to satisfy current and future needs through reduction of consumptive waste, improves water quality by reducing contaminated return flow, prevents erosion and allows increased in-stream flow.

      (2) It is therefore declared to be the policy of the State of Oregon to:

      (a) Aggressively promote conservation;

      (b) Encourage the highest and best use of water by allowing the sale or lease of the right to the use of conserved water; and

      (c) Encourage local cooperation and coordination in development of conservation projects to provide incentives for increased efficiency and to improve streamflows.

      (3) As used in this section, “efficient utilization” means use without waste, upgrading of irrigation equipment to comply with modern practices within a reasonable time period or other methods used to meet both current and future water needs at the least cost. [1987 c.264 §2; 1993 c.641 §2; 2003 c.93 §1; 2005 c.22 §379]

[1987 c.264 §3; 1993 c.641 §3; 1995 c.274 §10; 2003 c.93 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 537.455.

 

      537.470 Allocation of conserved water by commission; criteria; percentage to state; certificates showing change in original water right. (1) Upon receipt of an application for allocation of conserved water under ORS 537.465, the Water Resources Commission shall give notice of receipt of the application in accordance with ORS 540.520 (5).

      (2) The commission shall allocate conserved water as provided in subsection (3) of this section and approve modifications of water rights as provided in subsection (6) of this section. The commission may not allocate conserved water pursuant to an application under ORS 537.465 if the application is filed more than five years after the conservation measure was implemented.

      (3) After determining the quantity of conserved water, if any, required to mitigate the effects on other water rights, the commission shall allocate 25 percent of the remaining conserved water to the state and 75 percent to the applicant, unless the applicant proposes a higher allocation to the state or more than 25 percent of the funds used to finance the conservation measures comes from federal or state public sources. If more than 25 percent of the funds used to finance the conservation measures comes from federal or state public sources and is not subject to repayment, the commission shall allocate to the state a percentage equal to the percentage of public funds used to finance the conservation measures and allocate to the applicant a percentage equal to the percentage of other funds used to finance the conservation measures. If the commission determines that the water allocated to the state is necessary to support in-stream flow purposes in accordance with ORS 537.332 to 537.360, the water shall be converted to an in-stream water right. If the water allocated to the state is not necessary to support in-stream flow purposes, it shall revert to the public for appropriation by the next user in priority. In no event, however, shall the applicant receive less than 25 percent of the remaining conserved water unless the applicant proposes a higher allocation to the state.

      (4) The commission shall notify the applicant and any other person requesting notice, of the action the commission intends to take under subsection (3) of this section. Any person objecting to the proposed allocation may file a protest requesting a contested case hearing before the commission.

      (5) The modification of water rights under an allocation of conserved water may not require a separate request for transfer under ORS 540.520.

      (6) After the commission completes the allocation of conserved water under subsection (3) of this section, the commission shall issue orders for proposed new certificates covering the changes in the original water rights. Once the conservation project is completed, separate new certificates preserving the previously established priority of rights shall be issued to cover the unaffected portion of the water rights and separate new certificates indicating the priority of rights as set forth in ORS 537.485 shall be issued to cover the right to the use of the allocated water. [1987 c.264 §4; 1989 c.62 §1; 1993 c.641 §4; 1995 c.274 §13; 1999 c.664 §7; 2003 c.93 §4]

      Note: See note under 537.455.

 

      537.485 Priority of right to use conserved water; choice of priority. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS chapter 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542 or 543, the priority of any right to the use of conserved water, including an in-stream water right, under an application submitted and approved by the Water Resources Commission under ORS 537.465 and 537.470 shall be either the same as or one minute after the priority of the water right held by the person implementing the conservation measures.

      (2) A person who implements a conservation measure may choose the priority of the water right for the conserved water in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. However, the priority date chosen must be the same for the portion of water allocated to the applicant and the portion of water allocated to the state. [1987 c.264 §7; 1993 c.641 §6; 2003 c.93 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 537.455.

 

      537.490 Use of conserved water; notice of dispensation of right to use. (1) Any person or agency allocated conserved water under ORS 537.470 may reserve the water in stream for future out-of-stream use or otherwise use or dispose of the conserved water. Any person or agency to whom conserved water is allocated shall notify the commission of the dispensation of the right to the use of conserved water. The notice shall include:

      (a) The name and address of the person buying or leasing the right to the use of conserved water;

      (b) The use to which the conserved water is to be put; and

      (c) The terms of any agreement between the appropriator and the person using the conserved water.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who holds a water right permit or certificate having a subsequent priority to a certificate issued under ORS 537.470 may not acquire a vested right to any water or return flow of water that results from either the lease of the right to the use of conserved water or the reservation of conserved water in stream for future use under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Any right to the use of conserved water sold under subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) Shall become appurtenant to the premises upon which the purchaser uses the water; and

      (b) Shall be subject to the provisions of ORS 540.505 to 540.585 and 540.610 to 540.650.

      (4) When the commission receives notice of the sale of the right to the use of conserved water under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall issue to the purchaser a new water right certificate covering the right to the use of conserved water that was sold. The certificate shall indicate the priority of the water right according to the provisions of ORS 537.485. [1987 c.264 §8; 1993 c.641 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 537.455.

 

      537.495 Receipt by state agency or political subdivision of right to use conserved water. Any agency or political subdivision of this state may purchase a right to the use of conserved water, as defined under ORS 537.455, or accept a gift of a right to the use of conserved water as defined under ORS 537.455. If an agency or political subdivision requests that the conserved water remain in the stream, the commission shall manage the water in a manner that results in the conserved water remaining in the stream. [1987 c.264 §9; 1993 c.641 §8]

 

      Note: See note under 537.455.

 

      537.500 Legal status of conserved water right. (1) A water right for conserved water under ORS 537.455 to 537.500 and 540.510 shall have the same legal status as any other water right for which a certificate has been issued.

      (2) A water right for conserved water that is reserved in stream for future out-of-stream use under ORS 537.490 or that the commission manages under ORS 537.495 is not subject to cancellation under ORS 537.260 or 537.410 to 537.450 or to abandonment or forfeiture under ORS 540.610 to 540.650.

      537.520 [Repealed by 1955 c.708 §38]

 

      537.525 Policy. The Legislative Assembly recognizes, declares and finds that the right to reasonable control of all water within this state from all sources of water supply belongs to the public, and that in order to insure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health it is necessary that:

      (1) Provision be made for the final determination of relative rights to appropriate ground water everywhere within this state and of other matters with regard thereto through a system of registration, permits and adjudication.

      (2) Rights to appropriate ground water and priority thereof be acknowledged and protected, except when, under certain conditions, the public welfare, safety and health require otherwise.

      (3) Beneficial use without waste, within the capacity of available sources, be the basis, measure and extent of the right to appropriate ground water.

      (4) All claims to rights to appropriate ground water be made a matter of public record.

      (5) Adequate and safe supplies of ground water for human consumption be assured, while conserving maximum supplies of ground water for agricultural, commercial, industrial, thermal, recreational and other beneficial uses.

      (6) The location, extent, capacity, quality and other characteristics of particular sources of ground water be determined.

      (7) Reasonably stable ground water levels be determined and maintained.

      (8) Depletion of ground water supplies below economic levels, impairment of natural quality of ground water by pollution and wasteful practices in connection with ground water be prevented or controlled within practicable limits.

      (9) Whenever wasteful use of ground water, impairment of or interference with existing rights to appropriate surface water, declining ground water levels, alteration of ground water temperatures that may adversely affect priorities or impair the long-term stability of the thermal properties of the ground water, interference among wells, thermal interference among wells, overdrawing of ground water supplies or pollution of ground water exists or impends, controlled use of the ground water concerned be authorized and imposed under voluntary joint action by the Water Resources Commission and the ground water users concerned whenever possible, but by the commission under the police power of the state except as specified in ORS 537.796, when such voluntary joint action is not taken or is ineffective.

      (10) Location, construction, depth, capacity, yield and other characteristics of and matters in connection with wells be controlled in accordance with the purposes set forth in this section.

      (11) All activities in the state that affect the quality or quantity of ground water shall be consistent with the goal set forth in ORS 468B.155. [1955 c.708 §2; 1985 c.673 §46; 1989 c.201 §2; 1989 c.833 §56]

 

      537.530 [Repealed by 1955 c.708 §38]

 

(Aquifer Storage and Recovery)

 

      537.531 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly declares that aquifer storage and recovery is a beneficial use inherent in all water rights for other beneficial uses. Aquifer storage and recovery is the storage of water from a separate source that meets drinking water standards in a suitable aquifer for later recovery and not having as one of its primary purposes the restoration of an aquifer. [1995 c.487 §2]

 

      537.532 Injection of ground water into aquifers; standards. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the injection into aquifers of water that complies with drinking water standards established by the Oregon Health Authority under ORS 448.273 under an aquifer storage and recovery limited license or permit:

      (a) Shall not be considered a waste, contaminant or pollutant;

      (b) Shall be exempt from the requirement to obtain a discharge permit under ORS 468B.050 or 468B.053 or a concentration limit variance from the Department of Environmental Quality;

      (c) Shall comply with all other applicable local, state or federal laws; and

      (d) May be located within or outside an urban growth boundary in conformance with land use laws.

      (2) In order to continue to protect the high quality of Oregon’s aquifers for present and future uses, the Legislative Assembly recognizes the need to minimize concentrations of constituents in the injection source water that are not naturally present in the aquifer. Each aquifer storage and recovery limited license or permit shall include conditions to minimize, to the extent technically feasible, practical and cost-effective, the concentration of constituents in the injection source water that are not naturally present in the aquifer. In no case may an aquifer storage and recovery limited license or permit establish concentration limits for water to be injected in excess of the standards established by the authority under ORS 448.273 or the maximum measurable levels established by the Environmental Quality Commission under ORS 468B.165, whichever are more stringent.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided, if the injection source water contains constituents regulated under ORS 448.273 or 468B.165 that are detected at greater than 50 percent of the established levels, the aquifer storage and recovery limited license or permit may require the permittee to employ, or continue the employment of, technically feasible, practical and cost-effective methods to minimize concentrations of such constituents in the injection source water. Constituents that have a secondary maximum contaminant level or constituents that are associated with disinfection of the water may be injected into the aquifer up to the standards established under ORS 448.273.

      (4) The Water Resources Department may, based upon valid scientific data, further limit certain constituents in the injection source water if the department finds the constituents will interfere with or pose a threat to the maintenance of the water resources of the state for present or future beneficial uses. [1995 c.487 §3; 1997 c.286 §9; 2009 c.595 §984]

 

      537.534 Rules for permitting and administering aquifer storage and recovery projects; limited license for test program; fees. (1) In accordance with this section, the Water Resources Commission shall establish rules for the permitting and administration of aquifer storage and recovery projects. The rules shall establish the Water Resources Department as the sole permitting agency for the projects, but the Department of Environmental Quality and the Oregon Health Authority may comment on permits for a project and recommend conditions to be included on the permit. When necessary, the applicant also shall obtain land use and development approval from a local government.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 537.130, the Water Resources Commission shall establish by rule a procedure to allow a person to obtain a limited license to store and use water injected into an underground aquifer for aquifer storage and recovery testing purposes for a short term or fixed duration after the person complies with the notice provision set forth in ORS 537.144. The rules shall provide a 30-day public comment period before issuance of a limited license. The Water Resources Department may attach conditions to the limited license regarding monitoring, sampling and rates of recovery up to 100 percent of the injection quantity. Aquifer storage and recovery under a limited license may be conditioned by the Water Resources Department to protect existing ground water rights that rely upon the receiving aquifer and the injection source water. The Water Resources Department may revoke or modify the limited license to use the stored water acquired under a limited license if that use causes injury to any other water right or to a minimum perennial streamflow. The Water Resources Director may issue a limited license for aquifer storage and recovery purposes for a term of not more than five years. The license may be renewed if the applicant demonstrates further testing is necessary.

      (3) To obtain a limited license for aquifer storage and recovery, the applicant shall provide to the Water Resources Department:

      (a) Well construction information;

      (b) Test results of the quality of the injection source water;

      (c) Test results of the quality of the receiving aquifer water;

      (d) The proposed injected water storage time, recovery rates and recovery schedule;

      (e) Preliminary hydrogeologic information including a description of the aquifer, estimated flow direction and rate of movement, allocation of surface water, springs or wells within the area affected by aquifer storage and recovery wells;

      (f) The fee established by rule by the commission pursuant to ORS 536.050 (1)(L); and

      (g) Any other information required by rule of the commission.

      (4) Only after completion of a test program under a limited license issued under subsection (3) of this section may the applicant apply for a permanent aquifer storage and recovery permit. Each application for an aquifer storage and recovery permit shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in ORS 536.050 for examination of an application for a permit to store water. The Water Resources Department shall be the sole permitting agency for the project and may place conditions on the permit consistent with rules adopted by the commission, but the Department of Environmental Quality and the Oregon Health Authority may review, comment on and recommend conditions to be included on the permit. When necessary, the applicant shall obtain land use and development approval from a local government. Where existing water rights for the injection source water have been issued, the Water Resources Department shall receive comments from interested parties or agencies, but the public interest review standards shall apply only to the matters raised by the aquifer storage and recovery permit application in the same manner as any new water right application, not to the underlying water rights. If new water rights for injection source water and aquifer storage and recovery are necessary, then the public interest review standards shall apply to the new permit application in the same manner as any new water right application. The Water Resources Director may refer policy matters to the commission for decision.

      (5) The commission shall adopt rules consistent with this section to implement an aquifer storage and recovery program. The rules shall include:

      (a) Requirements for reporting and monitoring the aquifer storage and recovery project aquifer impacts and for constituents reasonably expected to be found in the injection source water.

      (b) Provisions that allow any person operating an aquifer storage and recovery project under a permit, upon approval by the Water Resources Department, to recover up to 100 percent of the water stored in the aquifer storage facility if valid scientific data gathered during operations under the limited license or permit demonstrate that the injected source water is not lost through migration or other means and that ground water otherwise present in the aquifer has not been irretrievably lost as a result of aquifer storage or retrieval. The Water Resources Department may place such other conditions on withdrawal of stored water necessary to protect the public health and environment, including conditions allowing reconsideration of the permit to comply with ORS 537.532.

      (c) The procedure for allowing the Department of Environmental Quality and the Oregon Health Authority to comment on and recommend permit conditions.

      (6) The use of water under a permit as injection source water for an aquifer storage and recovery project up to the limits allowed in subsection (5)(b) of this section shall not affect the priority date of the water right permit or otherwise affect the right evidenced by the permit.

      (7) The holder of a permit for aquifer storage and recovery shall apply for a transfer or change of use if the use of recovered water is different from that which is allowed in the source water permit or certificate. [1995 c.487 §4; 1997 c.587 §2; 1999 c.665 §3; 2003 c.594 §6; 2009 c.595 §985]

 

(Appropriation of Ground Water)

 

      537.535 Unlawful use or appropriation of ground water, including well construction and operation. (1) No person or public agency shall use or attempt to use any ground water, construct or attempt to construct any well or other means of developing and securing ground water or operate or permit the operation of any well owned or controlled by such person or public agency except upon compliance with ORS 537.505 to 537.795 and 537.992 and any applicable order or rule adopted by the Water Resources Commission under ORS 537.505 to 537.795 and 537.992.

      (2) Except for those uses exempted under ORS 537.545, the use of ground water for any purpose, without a permit issued under ORS 537.625 or registration under ORS 537.605, is an unlawful appropriation of ground water. [1955 c.708 §4; 1957 c.341 §5; subsection (2) enacted as 1961 c.668 §2; 1985 c.673 §47]

 

      537.540 [Repealed by 1955 c.708 §38]

 

      537.545 Exempt uses; map; filing of use; fee; rules. (1) No registration, certificate of registration, application for a permit, permit, certificate of completion or ground water right certificate under ORS 537.505 to 537.795 and 537.992 is required for the use of ground water for:

      (a) Stockwatering purposes;

      (b) Watering any lawn or noncommercial garden not exceeding one-half acre in area;

      (B) Is reused for irrigation purposes and the period of irrigation is a period during which the reused water has never been discharged to the waters of the state; and

      (C) Is applied pursuant to a permit issued by the Department of Environmental Quality or the State Department of Agriculture under either ORS 468B.050 to construct and operate a disposal system or ORS 468B.215 to operate a confined animal feeding operation.

      (2) A ground water use for a purpose that is exempt under subsection (1) of this section, to the extent that the use is beneficial, constitutes a right to appropriate ground water equal to that established by a ground water right certificate issued under ORS 537.700.

      (3) Except for the use of water under subsection (1)(g) of this section, the Water Resources Commission by rule may require any person or public agency using ground water for any such purpose to furnish information with regard to such ground water and the use thereof. For a use of water described in subsection (1)(g) of this section, the Department of Environmental Quality or the State Department of Agriculture shall provide to the Water Resources Department a copy of the permit issued under ORS 468B.050 or 468B.215 authorizing the land application of ground water for reuse. The permit shall provide the information regarding the place of use of such water and the nature of the beneficial reuse.

      (4) If it is necessary for the Water Resources Department to regulate the use or distribution of ground water, including uses for purposes that are exempt under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall use as a priority date for the exempt uses the date indicated in the log for the well filed with the department under ORS 537.765 or other documentation provided by the well owner showing when water use began.

      (5) The owner of land on which a well is drilled to allow ground water use for a purpose that is exempt under subsection (1) of this section shall provide the Water Resources Department with a map showing the exact location of the well on the tax lot. The landowner shall provide a map required by this subsection to the department no later than 30 days after the well is completed. The map must be prepared in accordance with standards established by the department.

      (6) The owner of land on which a well described in subsection (5) of this section is located shall file the exempt ground water use with the Water Resources Department for recording. The filing must be accompanied by the fee described in subsection (7) of this section. The filing must be received by the department no later than 30 days after the well is completed.

      (7) The Water Resources Department shall collect a fee of $300 for recording an exempt ground water use under subsection (6) of this section. Moneys from fees collected under this subsection shall be deposited to the credit of the Water Resources Department Water Right Operating Fund. Notwithstanding ORS 536.009, moneys deposited to the fund under this subsection shall be used for the purposes of evaluating ground water supplies, conducting ground water studies, carrying out ground water monitoring, processing ground water data and the administration and enforcement of this subsection and subsections (3), (5), (6) and (8) of this section.

      (8) The Water Resources Commission shall adopt rules to implement, administer and enforce subsections (5) to (7) of this section. [1955 c.708 §5; 1983 c.372 §1; 1983 c.698 §1; 1985 c.673 §48; 1989 c.99 §1; 1989 c.833 §57; 1997 c.244 §3; 2001 c.248 §12; 2003 c.594 §2; 2009 c.819 §1]

Except as otherwise provided in ORS 537.545 or 537.575 or 537.595 and subject to determination under ORS 537.670 to 537.695, actual and lawful application of ground water to beneficial use prior to August 3, 1955, by or under the authority of any person or public agency or by or under the authority of a predecessor in interest of such person or public agency, when registered under ORS 537.605 and 537.610, is recognized as a right to appropriate ground water to the extent of the maximum beneficial use thereof at any time within two years prior to August 3, 1955. [1955 c.708 §6(2)]

 

      537.590 [Repealed by 1955 c.708 §38]

 

      537.595 Construction or alteration of well commenced prior to August 3, 1955, recognized as right to appropriate water when registered. Except as otherwise provided in ORS 537.545 or 537.575 or 537.585 and subject to determination under ORS 537.670 to 537.695, when any person or public agency on August 3, 1955, is lawfully engaged in good faith in such construction, alteration or extension of a well for the application of ground water to beneficial use, the right to appropriate such ground water, upon completion of such construction, alteration or extension and application of the ground water to beneficial use within a reasonable time fixed by the Water Resources Commission, when registered under ORS 537.605 and 537.610, is recognized to the extent of the beneficial use of the ground water.

      537.600 [Repealed by 1955 c.708 §38]

 

      537.605 Registration of right to appropriate ground water claimed under ORS 537.585 or 537.595; registration statement. (1) Any person or public agency claiming any right to appropriate ground water under ORS 537.585 or 537.595, except for any purpose exempt under ORS 537.545, is entitled to receive from the Water Resources Commission within three years after August 3, 1955, a certificate of registration as evidence of a right to appropriate ground water as provided in ORS 537.585 or 537.595. Failure of such person or public agency to file a registration statement within such period creates a presumption that any such claim has been abandoned.

      (2) Upon receipt of a request for registration by any person or public agency referred to in subsection (1) of this section within the period specified, the commission shall provide such person or public agency with a separate registration statement for each well, which shall be completed and returned to the commission.

      (3) Each registration statement shall be in a form prescribed by the commission, shall be under oath and shall contain:

      (a) The name and post-office address of the registrant.

      (b) The nature of the use by the registrant of the ground water upon which the claim of the registrant is based.

      (c) The dates when the ground water was or will be first applied to beneficial use and the dates when construction of the well was begun and completed.

      (d) The amount of ground water claimed.

      (e) If the ground water is used or is to be used for irrigation purposes, a description of the lands irrigated or to be irrigated, giving the number of acres irrigated or to be irrigated in each 40-acre legal subdivision, the dates of reclamation of each such legal subdivision and the date when the ground water was or will be completely applied.

      (f) The depth to the water table.

      (g) The location of the well with reference to government survey corners or monuments or corners of recorded plats.

      (h) The depth, diameter and type of the well, and the kind and amount of the casing.

      (i) The capacity of the well and well pump in gallons per minute, and the horsepower of the well pump motor.

      (j) If the ground water is artesian or other ground water not requiring pumping, the rate of flow in gallons in such manner as the commission may prescribe.

      (k) The amount of ground water pumped or otherwise taken from the well each year.

      (L) A copy of the log of the completed well, if such log is available.

      (m) If the ground water supply is supplemental to an existing water supply, identification of any application for a permit, permit, certification or adjudicated right to appropriate water made or held by the registrant.

      (n) Such other information as the commission considers necessary.

      (4) Each registration statement shall be accompanied by maps, drawings and other data as the commission considers necessary.

      (5) The commission may require that any registration statement be supplemented after any well is fully completed by a statement containing such additional information as the commission considers necessary.

      (6) Any person or public agency who failed to file a registration statement within the period set forth in subsection (1) of this section may file within one year after May 29, 1961, a petition with the commission requesting that the person be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption that the person has abandoned the claim. Upon the filing of such a petition the commission may schedule a hearing to take testimony and evidence on the date of well construction and the use of ground water or the commission may accept sworn statements in writing in support of such petition. No petition shall be denied without a public hearing. If it appears after hearing or from such sworn statements, that the person or public agency has a use of ground water that would be subject to determination under ORS 537.670 to 537.695 as defined in ORS 537.585 and 537.595, the commission shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to file a registration statement as described under subsection (3) of this section. Upon receipt of the completed registration statement the commission shall issue to the registrant a certificate of registration, as provided in ORS 537.610. [1955 c.708 §7; 1957 c.341 §6; 1961 c.668 §3; 1985 c.673 §50]

 

      537.610 Recording registration statement; issuing certificate of registration; effect of certificate; rules; fees. (1) The Water Resources Commission shall accept all registration statements referred to in ORS 537.605 completed and returned to the commission in proper form, endorse on the registration statement the date of the return and record each statement. Upon recording the statement, the commission shall issue to the registrant a certificate as evidence that the registration is completed.

      (2) The issuance of the certificate of registration serves as prima facie evidence that the registrant is entitled to a right to appropriate ground water and apply it to beneficial use to the extent and in the manner disclosed in the recorded registration statement and in the certificate of registration.

      (3) A certificate of registration issued under this section may not be construed as a final determination of any matter stated in the certificate of registration. The right of the registrant to appropriate ground water under a certificate of registration is subject to determination under ORS 537.670 to 537.695, and is not final or conclusive until so determined and a ground water right certificate issued. A right to appropriate ground water under a certificate of registration has a tentative priority from the date when the construction of the well was begun.

      (4) The commission shall adopt by rule the process and standards by which the commission will recognize changes in the place of use, type of use or point of appropriation for claims to appropriate ground water registered under this section. The commission shall adopt fees not to exceed $1,450 for actions taken to modify a certificate of registration. [1955 c.708 §8; 1985 c.673 §51; 2005 c.614 §1; 2009 c.819 §§8,15; 2013 c.644 §§6,7; 2017 c.571 §§5,6]

 

      537.615 Application for permit to acquire new right or enlarge existing right to appropriate ground water; plans and drawings. (1) Any person or public agency intending to acquire a wholly new right to appropriate ground water or to enlarge upon any existing right to appropriate ground water, except for any purpose exempt under ORS 537.545, shall apply to the Water Resources Department for and be issued a permit before withdrawing or using the ground water.

      (2) The application for a permit shall be in a form prescribed by the department and shall contain:

      (a) The name and post-office address of the applicant.

      (b) The nature of the use by the applicant of the ground water for which the application is made.

      (c) The dates of the beginning and completion of the construction of any well or other means of developing and securing the ground water.

      (d) The date when the ground water will be completely applied to the proposed beneficial use.

      (e) The amount of ground water claimed.

      (f) If the ground water is to be used for irrigation purposes, a description of the lands to be irrigated, giving the number of acres to be irrigated in each 40-acre legal subdivision.

      (g) The depth to the water table, if known.

      (h) The location of each well with reference to government survey corners or monuments or corners of recorded plats.

      (i) The proposed depth, diameter and type of each well, and the kind and amount of the casing.

      (j) The estimated capacity of each well and each well pump in gallons per minute, and the horsepower of each well pump motor.

      (k) If the ground water is artesian or other ground water not requiring pumping, the rate of flow in gallons in such manner as the Water Resources Commission may prescribe.

      (L) If the ground water supply is supplemental to an existing water supply, identification of any application for a permit, permit, certificate or adjudicated right to appropriate water made or held by the applicant.

      (m) Any other information as the department considers necessary to evaluate the application.

      (3) Each application for a permit shall be accompanied by any maps and drawings the department considers necessary.

      (4) The map or drawing required to accompany the application shall be of sufficient quality and scale to establish the location of the proposed point of diversion and the proposed place of use identified by tax lot, township, range, section and nearest quarter-quarter section along with a notation of the acreage of the proposed place of use, if appropriate. In addition, the department shall accept locational coordinate information, including latitude and longitude as established by a global positioning system. If the application is for a water right for a municipal use, the map need not identify the proposed place of use by tax lot.

      (5) Each application for a permit to appropriate water shall be accompanied by the examination fee set forth in ORS 536.050 (1).

      (6) If the proposed use of the water is for a mining operation as defined in ORS 517.952, the applicant shall provide the information required under this section as part of the consolidated application under ORS 517.952 to 517.989.

      (7) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 183, an application for a permit to appropriate ground water shall be processed in the manner set forth in ORS 537.505 to 537.795. Nothing in ORS chapter 183 shall be construed to allow additional persons to participate in the process. To the extent that any provision in ORS chapter 183 conflicts with a provision set forth in ORS 537.505 to 537.795, the provisions in ORS 537.505 to 537.795 shall control. [1955 c.708 §9; 1959 c.437 §3; 1985 c.673 §54; 1987 c.542 §7; 1991 c.735 §34; 1993 c.557 §4; 1995 c.416 §22; 1997 c.446 §6; 1997 c.587 §8; 2013 c.371 §33]

 

      537.620 Determination of completeness of application; initial review; preliminary determination; notice; public comments. (1) The Water Resources Department shall accept all applications for permits submitted under ORS 537.615 in proper form.

      (2) Within 15 days after receiving the application, the department shall determine whether the application contains the information listed under ORS 537.615 (2) and is complete and not defective, including the payment of all fees required under ORS 537.615 (5). If the department determines that the application is incomplete or defective or that not all fees have been paid, the department shall return the fees paid and the application to the applicant to remedy the defect. If an application is complete and not defective, the department shall indorse on the application the date upon which the application was received at the department, which shall be the priority date for any water right issued in response to the application.

      (3) Upon determining that an application is complete and not defective, the department shall determine whether the proposed use is prohibited by statute. If the proposed use is prohibited by statute, the department shall reject the application and return all fees to the applicant with an explanation of the statutory prohibition.

      (4) If the proposed use is not prohibited by statute, the department shall undertake an initial review of the application and make a preliminary determination of:

      (a) Whether the proposed use is restricted or limited by statute or rule or because the proposed use is located within a designated critical ground water area;

      (b) The extent to which water is available from the proposed source during the times and in the amounts requested; and

      (c) Any other issue the department identifies as a result of the initial review that may preclude approval of or restrict the proposed use.

      (5) Upon completion of the initial review and no later than 30 days after determining an application to be complete and not defective as described in subsection (2) of this section, the department shall notify the applicant of its preliminary determinations and allow the applicant 14 days from the date of mailing within which to notify the department to stop processing the application or to proceed with the application. If the applicant notifies the department to stop processing the application, the department shall return the application and all fees paid in excess of $260. If the department receives no timely response from the applicant, the department shall proceed with the application.

      (6) Within seven days after proceeding with the application under subsection (5) of this section, the department shall give public notice of the application in the weekly notice published by the department. The notice shall include a request for comments on the application and information pertaining to how an interested person may obtain future notices about the application and a copy of the proposed final order.

      (7) Within 30 days after the public notice under subsection (6) of this section, any person interested in the application shall submit written comments to the department. Any person who asks to receive a copy of the department’s proposed final order shall submit to the department the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(p). [1955 c.708 §10; 1981 c.589 §4; 1985 c.673 §55; 1989 c.201 §3; 1991 c.102 §2; 1991 c.400 §3; 1991 c.735 §35; 1993 c.557 §5; 1995 c.416 §23; 1997 c.587 §9; 2007 c.267 §3; 2009 c.819 §§9,16; 2013 c.644 §§8,9; 2017 c.571 §§7,8]

 

      537.621 Review of application; proposed final order; presumption; rebuttal; findings and conclusions; flow rate and duty; standing; protest; final order; contested case hearing. (1) Within 60 days after the Water Resources Department proceeds with the application under ORS 537.620 (5), the department shall complete application review and issue a proposed final order approving or denying the application or approving the application with modifications or conditions. The department may request the applicant to provide additional information needed to complete the review. If the department requests additional information, the request shall be specific and shall be sent to the applicant by registered mail. The department shall specify a date by which the information must be returned, which shall be not less than 10 days after the department mails the request to the applicant. If the department does not receive the information or a request for a time extension under ORS 537.627 by the date specified in the request, the department may reject the application and may refund fees in accordance with ORS 536.050 (4)(a). The time period specified by the department in a request for additional information shall allow the department to comply with the 60-day time limit established by this subsection.

      (2) In reviewing the application under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall determine whether the proposed use will ensure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health as described in ORS 537.525. The department shall presume that a proposed use will ensure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health if the proposed use is allowed in the applicable basin program established pursuant to ORS 536.300 and 536.340 or given a preference under ORS 536.310 (12), if water is available, if the proposed use will not injure other water rights and if the proposed use complies with rules of the Water Resources Commission. This shall be a rebuttable presumption and may be overcome by a preponderance of evidence that either:

      (a) One or more of the criteria for establishing the presumption are not satisfied; or

      (b) The proposed use would not ensure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health as demonstrated in comments, in a protest under subsection (7) of this section or in a finding of the department that shows:

      (A) The specific aspect of the public welfare, safety and health under ORS 537.525 that would be impaired or detrimentally affected; and

      (B) Specifically how the identified aspect of the public welfare, safety and health under ORS 537.525 would be impaired or be adversely affected.

      (3) The proposed final order shall cite findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall include but need not be limited to:

      (a) Confirmation or modification of the preliminary determinations made in the initial review;

      (b) A brief statement that explains the criteria considered relevant to the decision, including the applicable basin program and the compatibility of the proposed use with applicable land use plans;

      (c) An assessment of water availability and the amount of water necessary for the proposed use;

      (d) An assessment of whether the proposed use would result in injury to existing water rights;

      (e) An assessment of whether the proposed use would ensure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health as described in ORS 537.525;

      (f) A draft permit, including any proposed conditions, or a recommendation to deny the application;

      (g) Whether the rebuttable presumption under subsection (2) of this section has been established;

      (h) The date by which protests to the proposed final order must be received by the department; and

      (i) The flow rate and duty of water allowed.

      (4) In establishing the flow rate and duty of water allowed, the department may consider a general basin-wide standard, but first shall evaluate information submitted by the applicant to demonstrate the need for a flow rate and duty higher than the general standard. If the applicant provides such information, the department shall authorize the requested rate and duty except upon specific findings related to the application to support a determination that a lesser amount is needed. If the applicant does not provide information to demonstrate the need for a flow rate and duty higher than the general basin-wide standard, the department may apply the general standards without specific findings related to the application.

      (5) The department shall mail copies of the proposed final order to the applicant and to persons who have requested copies and paid the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(p). The department also shall publish notice of the proposed final order by publication in the weekly notice published by the department.

      (6) Any person who supports a proposed final order may request standing for purposes of participating in any contested case proceeding on the proposed final order or for judicial review of a final order. A request for standing shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by the fee established under ORS 536.050 (1)(n).

      (7) Any person may submit a protest against a proposed final order. A protest shall be in writing and shall include:

      (a) The name, address and telephone number of the protestant;

      (b) A description of the protestant’s interest in the proposed final order, and if the protestant claims to represent the public interest, a precise statement of the public interest represented;

      (c) A detailed description of how the action proposed in the proposed final order would impair or be detrimental to the protestant’s interest;

      (d) A detailed description of how the proposed final order is in error or deficient and how to correct the alleged error or deficiency;

      (e) Any citation of legal authority supporting the protest, if known; and

      (f) The protest fee required under ORS 536.050.

      (8) Requests for standing and protests on the proposed final order shall be submitted within 45 days after publication of the notice of the proposed final order in the weekly notice published by the department. Any person who asks to receive a copy of the department’s final order shall submit to the department the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(p), unless the person has previously requested copies and paid the required fee under ORS 537.620 (7), the person is a protestant and has paid the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(j) or the person has standing and has paid the fee under ORS 536.050 (1)(n).

      (9) Within 60 days after the close of the period for receiving protests, the Water Resources Director shall:

      (a) Issue a final order as provided under ORS 537.625 (1); or

      (b) Schedule a contested case hearing if a protest has been submitted and if:

      (A) Upon review of the issues, the director finds that there are significant disputes related to the proposed use of water; or

      (B) Within 30 days after the close of the period for submitting protests, the applicant requests a contested case hearing. [1995 c.416 §25; 1995 c.549 §1a; 1997 c.446 §7; 1997 c.587 §10; 2007 c.188 §3; 2009 c.819 §§10,17; 2013 c.644 §10]

 

      537.622 Contested case hearing; parties; issues. (1) Within 45 days after the Water Resources Director schedules a contested case hearing under ORS 537.621 (9), the Water Resources Department shall hold the contested case hearing. The issues to be considered in the contested case hearing shall be limited to issues identified by the administrative law judge.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 183 pertaining to contested case proceedings, the parties to any contested case hearing initiated under this section shall be limited to:

      (a) The applicant;

      (b) Any person who timely filed a protest; and

      (c) Any person who timely filed a request for standing under ORS 537.621 (6) and who requests to intervene in the contested case hearing prior to the start of the proceeding.

      (3) The contested case proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183 except:

      (a) As provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section; and

      (b) An interlocutory appeal under ORS 183.480 (3) shall not be allowed.

      (4) Each person submitting a protest or a request for standing shall raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably available arguments supporting the person’s position by the close of the protest period. Failure to raise a reasonably ascertainable issue in a protest or in a hearing or failure to provide sufficient specificity to afford the Water Resources Department an opportunity to respond to the issue precludes judicial review based on that issue. [1957 c.341 §2; 1983 c.740 §213; 1985 c.673 §56; 1995 c.416 §27; 2003 c.75 §97]

 

      537.625 Final order; appeal; contents of permit. (1) If, after the contested case hearing or, if a hearing is not held, after the close of the period allowed to file a protest, the Water Resources Director determines that the proposed use does not ensure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health as described in ORS 537.525, the director shall issue a final order rejecting the application or modifying the proposed final order as necessary to ensure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health as described in ORS 537.525. If, after the contested case hearing or, if a hearing is not held, after the close of the period allowed to file a protest, the director determines that the proposed use would ensure the preservation of the public welfare, safety and health as described in ORS 537.525, the director shall issue a final order approving the application or otherwise modifying the proposed final order. A final order may set forth any of the provisions or restrictions to be included in the permit concerning the use, control and management of the water to be appropriated for the project.

      (2) If a contested case hearing is not held:

      (a) Where the final order modifies the proposed final order, the applicant may request and the Water Resources Department shall schedule a contested case hearing as provided under ORS 537.622 (3) by submitting the information required for a protest under ORS 537.621 (7) within 14 days after the director issues the final order. However, the issues on which a contested case hearing may be requested and conducted under this paragraph shall be limited to issues based on the modifications to the proposed final order.

      (b) Only the applicant or a protestant may appeal the provisions of the final order in the manner established in ORS chapter 183 for appeal of order other than contested cases.

      (3) If the presumption of public welfare, safety and health under ORS 537.621 (2) is overcome, then before issuing a final order, the director or the Water Resources Commission, if applicable, shall make the final determination of whether the proposed use or the proposed use as modified in the proposed final order would preserve the public welfare, safety and health as described in ORS 537.525 by considering:

      (a) The conservation of the highest use of the water for all purposes, including irrigation, domestic use, municipal water supply, power development, public recreation, protection of commercial and game fishing and wildlife, fire protection, mining, industrial purposes, navigation, scenic attraction or any other beneficial use to which the water may be applied for which it may have a special value to the public.

      (b) The maximum economic development of the waters involved.

      (c) The control of the waters of this state for all beneficial purposes, including drainage, sanitation and flood control.

      (d) The amount of waters available for appropriation for beneficial use.

      (e) The prevention of wasteful, uneconomic, impracticable or unreasonable use of the waters involved.

      (f) All vested and inchoate rights to the waters of this state or to the use of the waters of this state, and the means necessary to protect such rights.

      (g) The state water resources policy.

      (4) Upon issuing a final order, the Water Resources Department shall notify the applicant and each person who submitted written comments or protests or otherwise requested notice of the final order and send a copy of the final order to any person who requested a copy and paid the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(p).

      (5) A right to appropriate ground water under a permit has a priority from the date when the application was filed with the department.

      (6) If the use of water under the permit is for operation of a mining operation as defined in ORS 517.952:

      (a) Review of the application and approval or denial of the application shall be coordinated with the consolidated application process under ORS 517.952 to 517.989. However, such review and approval or denial shall take into consideration all policy considerations for the appropriation of water as set forth in this chapter and ORS chapter 536.

      (b) The permit may be issued for exploration under ORS 517.702 to 517.740, but the permit shall be conditioned on the applicant’s compliance with the consolidated application process.

      (c) The permit shall include a condition that additional conditions may be added to the use of water when a water right certificate is issued, or when the use of water is changed pursuant to ORS 540.520 and 540.530 to use for a mining operation. [1955 c.708 §11; 1959 c.437 §4; 1981 c.61 §3; 1985 c.673 §57; 1995 c.416 §28; 1997 c.587 §11; 2013 c.371 §34]

 

      537.626 Exceptions to final order; modified order. (1) Within 20 days after the Water Resources Director issues a final order under ORS 537.625 after the conclusion of a contested case hearing, any party may file with the Water Resources Commission exceptions to the order.

      (2) The commission shall issue a modified order, if allowed, or deny the exceptions within 60 days after close of the exception period under subsection (1) of this section. [1995 c.416 §29]

 

      537.627 Time limit for issuing final order or scheduling contested case hearing; extension; writ of mandamus. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the Water Resources Department shall issue a final order or schedule a contested case hearing on an application for a water right referred to in ORS 537.615 within 180 days after the department proceeds with the application under ORS 537.620 (5).

      (2) At the request of the applicant, the department may extend the 180-day period set forth in subsection (1) of this section for a reasonable period of time.

      (3) If the applicant does not request an extension under subsection (2) of this section and the department fails to issue a proposed final order or schedule a contested case hearing on an application for a water right within 180 days after the department proceeds with the application under ORS 537.620 (5), the applicant may apply in the Circuit Court for Marion County for a writ of mandamus to compel the department to issue a final order or schedule a contested case hearing on an application for a water right. The writ of mandamus shall compel the department to issue a water right permit, unless the department shows by affidavit that to issue a permit may result in harm to an existing water right holder. [1995 c.416 §31]

 

      537.628 Terms; conditions; time limit for issuing final order after contested case hearing. (1) The Water Resources Department may approve an application for less ground water than applied for or upon terms, conditions and limitations necessary for the protection of the public welfare, safety and health. In any event the department shall not approve the application for more ground water than is applied for or than can be applied to a beneficial use. No application shall be approved when the same will deprive those having prior rights of appropriation for a beneficial use of the amount of water to which they are lawfully entitled.

      (2) If a contested case hearing is held, the department shall issue a final order:

      (a) Within 270 days after scheduling the hearing for a contested case proceeding that involves three or more parties not including the department; and

      (b) Within 180 days after scheduling the hearing for all other contested case proceedings. [1995 c.416 §30]

 

      537.629 Conditions or limitations to prevent interference with other users. (1) When an application discloses the probability of wasteful use or undue interference with existing wells or that any proposed use or well will impair or substantially interfere with existing rights to appropriate surface water by others, or that any proposed use or well will impair or substantially interfere with existing rights to appropriate ground water for the beneficial use of the water for its thermal characteristics, the Water Resources Department may impose conditions or limitations in the permit to prevent the same or reject the same after hearing, or, in the department’s discretion, request the Water Resources Commission to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to declare the affected area a critical ground water area under ORS 537.730 to 537.740.

      (2)(a) When an application discloses the probability that a proposed use or well will impair or interfere with the ability to extract heat from a well with a bottom hole temperature of at least 250 degrees Fahrenheit, the department may:

      (A) Approve the permit;

      (B) Impose conditions or limitations in the permit to prevent the probable interference or impairment;

      (C) After a hearing under ORS 537.622, reject the application; or

      (D) Request the commission to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to declare the affected area a critical ground water area under ORS 537.730 to 537.740.

      (b) In deciding whether to issue, deny or condition a permit under this subsection, the department shall consider any orders or permits applicable to the ground water reservoir issued by the State Geologist or the governing board of the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries under ORS chapter 522. [1995 c.416 §26]

 

      537.630 Time allowed for construction work under permit; extension; certificate of completion; survey; ground water right certificate; requirements for supplemental water right. (1) As used in this section, “undeveloped portion” means the difference between the maximum rate or duty specified in a water right permit and the maximum rate or duty appropriated as of the later of:

      (a) June 29, 2005;

      (b) The time specified in the permit to perfect the water right; or

      (c) The time specified in the last-approved extension of time to perfect the water right.

      (2) Except for the holder of a permit for municipal use, the holder of a permit issued pursuant to ORS 537.625 shall prosecute the construction of a well or other means of developing and securing the ground water with reasonable diligence and complete the construction within a reasonable time fixed in the permit by the Water Resources Department, not to exceed five years after the date of approval of the application. However, the department, for good cause shown, shall order and allow an extension of time, including an extension beyond the five-year period, for the completion of the well or other means of developing and securing the ground water or for complete application of water to beneficial use. In determining the extension, the department shall give due weight to the considerations described under ORS 539.010 (5) and to whether other governmental requirements relating to the project have significantly delayed completion of construction or perfection of the right.

      (3) The holder of a permit for municipal use shall commence and complete the construction of any proposed works within 20 years from the date on which the permit for municipal use is issued under ORS 537.625. The construction must proceed with reasonable diligence and be completed within the time specified in the permit, not to exceed 20 years. However, the department may order and allow an extension of time to complete construction or to perfect a water right beyond the time specified in the permit under the following conditions:

      (a) The holder shows good cause. In determining the extension, the department shall give due weight to the considerations described under ORS 539.010 (5) and to whether other governmental requirements relating to the project have significantly delayed completion of construction or perfection of the right;

      (b) The extension of time is conditioned to require that the holder submit and obtain department approval of a water management and conservation plan;

      (c) The extension of time is conditioned to provide that the holder may appropriate the undeveloped portion of the permit only upon approval by the department of a water management and conservation plan; and

      (d) For the first extension issued after June 29, 2005, for a permit for municipal use issued before November 2, 1998, the department finds that the undeveloped portion of the permit is conditioned to maintain, in the portions of waterways affected by water use under the permit, the persistence of fish species listed as sensitive, threatened or endangered under state or federal law. The department shall base its finding on existing data and upon the advice of the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. An existing fish protection agreement between the permit holder and a state or federal agency that includes conditions to maintain the persistence of any listed fish species in the affected portion of the waterway is conclusive for purposes of the finding.

      (4) If the construction of any well or other means of developing and securing the ground water is completed after the date of approval of the application for a permit under ORS 537.625, within 30 days after the completion, or if the construction is completed before the date of approval, within 30 days after the date of approval, the permit holder shall file a certificate of completion with the Water Resources Department, disclosing:

      (a) The depth to the water table;

      (b) The depth, diameter and type of each well, and the kind and amount of the casing;

      (c) The capacity of the well pump in gallons per minute and the drawdown thereof;

      (d) The identity of the record owner of any property that was described in the application for a permit under ORS 537.625 but is not included in the certificate of completion; and

      (e) Any other information the department considers necessary.

      (5) Upon completion of beneficial use necessary to secure the ground water as required under this section, the permit holder shall hire a water right examiner certified under ORS 537.798 to survey the appropriation. Within one year after applying the water to beneficial use or the beneficial use date allowed in the permit, the permit holder shall submit the survey as required by the Water Resources Department to the department along with the certificate of completion required under subsection (4) of this section. If any property described in the permit is not included in the request for a water right certificate, the holder of the permit shall state the identity of the record owner of that property.

      (6) After the department has received a certificate of completion and a copy of the survey as required by subsections (4) and (5) of this section that show, to the satisfaction of the department, that an appropriation has been perfected in accordance with the provisions of ORS 537.505 to 537.795 and 537.992, except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, the department shall issue a ground water right certificate of the same character as that described in ORS 537.700. The certificate shall be recorded and transmitted to the applicant as provided in ORS 537.700.

      (7) The department may not issue a water right certificate for municipal use under this section if:

      (a) An extension of time is required; and

      (b) The order approving the extension of time has not become final by operation of law or on appeal.

      (8) The procedure for cancellation of a permit shall be as provided in ORS 537.260.

      (9) Notwithstanding ORS 537.410, for purposes of obtaining a water right certificate under subsection (6) of this section for a supplemental water right, the holder of a permit shall have a facility capable of handling the full rate and duty of water requested from the supplemental source and be otherwise ready, willing and able to use the amount of water requested, up to the amount of water approved in the water right permit. To obtain a certificate for a supplemental water right, the holder is not required to have actually used water from the supplemental source if:

      (a) Water was available from the source of the primary water right and the primary water right was used pursuant to the terms of the primary water right; or

      (b) The nonuse of water from the supplemental source occurred during a period of time within which the exercise of the supplemental water right permit was not necessary due to climatic conditions. [1955 c.708 §12; 1959 c.437 §5; 1985 c.617 §2; 1985 c.673 §202; 1987 c.542 §8; 1995 c.367 §3; 1995 c.416 §34; 1997 c.446 §8; 1999 c.453 §2; 2005 c.410 §2; 2017 c.704 §4]

      537.720 Violation of terms of law or permit or certificate; action by Water Resources Commission. Whenever, after notice to and opportunity to be heard by such holder, the Water Resources Commission finds that the holder of any permit or certificate of registration issued under ORS 537.505 to 537.795 and 537.992 is willfully violating any provision of the permit or certificate of registration or any provision of ORS 537.505 to 537.795 and 537.992, the commission may cancel or suspend the permit or certificate of registration or impose conditions on the future use thereof to prevent such violation. [1955 c.708 §24; 1985 c.673 §61]

 

      537.730 Designation of critical ground water area; rules; notice. (1) The Water Resources Commission by rule may designate an area of the state a critical ground water area if:

      (a) Ground water levels in the area in question are declining or have declined excessively;

      (b) The Water Resources Department finds a pattern of substantial interference between wells within the area in question;

      (c) The department finds a pattern of interference or potential interference between wells of ground water claimants or appropriators within the area in question with the production of geothermal resources from an area regulated under ORS chapter 522;

      (d) The department finds a pattern of substantial interference between wells within the area in question and:

      (A) An appropriator of surface water whose water right has an earlier priority date; or

      (B) A restriction imposed on surface water appropriation or a minimum perennial streamflow that has an effective date earlier than the priority date of the ground water appropriation;

      (e) The available ground water supply in the area in question is being or is about to be overdrawn;

      (f) The purity of the ground water in the area in question has been or reasonably may be expected to become polluted to an extent contrary to the public welfare, health and safety; or

      (g) Ground water temperatures in the area in question are expected to be, are being or have been substantially altered except as specified in ORS 537.796.

      (2) The proceeding to designate a critical ground water area shall be conducted according to the provisions under ORS chapter 183 applicable to the adoption of rules by an agency, except that a hearing on a critical ground water declaration shall occur at least 60 days after notice has been given.

      (3) In addition to the notice requirements under ORS 183.335, the department shall give notice by regular mail to:

      (a) The owners of record of all ground water registrations, permits and certificates for water use within the affected area; and

      537.742 Contested case proceeding to limit use of ground water in critical ground water area. (1) Any time after the Water Resources Commission adopts a rule under ORS 537.730 designating a critical ground water area, the commission may initiate a contested case proceeding to limit the use of ground water in the area if the commission has reason to believe that any of the qualifying criteria of ORS 537.730 (1) exists.

      (2) Upon the conclusion of a contested case proceeding initiated under subsection (1) of this section and upon finding that the problems that resulted in the designation of a critical ground water area under ORS 537.730 can be resolved by implementing one or more of the corrective control provisions of this section, the commission shall issue a final order establishing any one or more of the following corrective control provisions:

      (a) A provision apportioning the permissible total withdrawal as established by rule under ORS 537.730, among the appropriators holding valid rights to ground water in the critical area in accordance with the relative dates of priority of such rights.

      (b) A provision according preference, without reference to relative priorities, to withdrawals of ground water in the critical area for residential and livestock watering purposes first. Thereafter, the commission may authorize withdrawals of ground water in the critical area for other beneficial purposes, including agricultural, industrial, municipal other than residential, and recreational purposes, in such order as the commission considers advisable under the circumstances, so long as such withdrawal will not materially affect a properly designed and operating well with prior rights that penetrates the aquifer.

      (c) A provision reducing the permissible withdrawal of ground water by any one or more appropriators or wells in the critical area.

      (d) Where two or more wells in the critical area are used by the same appropriator, a provision adjusting the total permissible withdrawal of ground water by such appropriator, or a provision forbidding the use of one or more of such wells completely.

      (e) A provision requiring the abatement, in whole or part, or the sealing of any well in the critical area responsible for the admission of polluting materials into the ground water supply or responsible for the progressive impairment of the quality of the ground water supply by dispersing polluting materials that have entered the ground water supply previously.

      (f) A provision requiring and specifying a system of rotation of use of ground water in the critical area.
