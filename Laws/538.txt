      (7) Within 14 days after receiving a notice of intent submitted pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, the department shall, in the weekly notice published by the department, give public notice of the submission of the notice of intent.

      (8) The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the City of Pendleton have entered into an agreement addressing the development and use of the City of Pendleton’s water rights in the Umatilla River and the impact on tribal interests from such development. The agreement includes implementation of the minimum streamflow in the main stem of the Umatilla River resulting from the exercise by the City of Pendleton of its surface water right of the north fork of the Umatilla River under this section. The City of Pendleton shall exercise such right consistent with the agreement or successor agreements between the City of Pendleton and the tribes provided in this subsection. In no event will the City of Pendleton exercise the right granted under this section so as to reduce streamflows in the Umatilla River to be less than state in-stream water rights for the Umatilla River existing as of January 1, 2002. [Amended by 1995 c.359 §1; 2001 c.298 §1]
