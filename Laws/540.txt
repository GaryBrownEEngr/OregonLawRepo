DISTRIBUTION OF WATER FROM IRRIGATION DITCHES AND RESERVOIRS

 

      540.210 Distribution from ditch or reservoir. (1) Whenever any water users from any ditch or reservoir, either among themselves or with the owner thereof, are unable to agree relative to the distribution or division of water through or from the ditch or reservoir, either the owner or any such water user may apply to the watermaster of the district in which the ditch or reservoir is located, by written notice, setting forth such facts, and asking the watermaster to take charge of the ditch or reservoir for the purpose of making a just division or distribution of water from it to the parties entitled to the use thereof.

      (2) The watermaster shall then take exclusive charge of the ditch or reservoir, for the purpose of dividing or distributing the water therefrom in accordance with the respective and relative rights of the various users of water from the ditch or reservoir, and shall continue the work until the necessity therefor shall cease to exist.

      (3) The distribution and division of water shall be made according to the relative and respective rights of the various users from the ditch or reservoir, as determined by the Water Resources Director, by decree of the circuit court, or by written contract between all of the users filed with the watermaster.

      (4) The circuit court having jurisdiction may request the watermaster of the district to take charge of any such ditch or reservoir, and to enforce any decree respecting such ditch or reservoir made under the jurisdiction of the court.

 

      540.220 Payment of assistant watermaster. (1) A watermaster may appoint an assistant to take charge of the ditch, pipeline or reservoir involved in a distribution or division of water under ORS 540.210.

The Water Resources Commission may require the water users to pay in advance the estimated compensation and expenses of the assistant involved in the distribution or division of the water.

      (2) In the case of partnership ditches, pipelines or mutual irrigation corporations organized for the benefit of the members or stockholders, the expense of the assistant shall be paid by the water users in proportion to the area of land for which each water user is entitled to the use of water from the ditch, pipeline or reservoir, so that each shall pay the same rate per acre.

      (3) In the case of ditches, pipelines and reservoirs constructed and operated for sale or rental of water, the wages and expense of the assistant shall be paid by the owner of the ditch, pipeline or reservoir, unless otherwise provided in written contracts with water users using water from the ditches, pipelines and reservoirs involved in the distribution or division of water.

The lien shall attach to each tract of land entitled to the use of water for irrigation from the ditch, pipeline or reservoir, and upon the crops produced upon the lands during the irrigation season for which the distribution is made. If a ditch, pipeline or reservoir is owned or operated by a person engaged in the business of selling or renting water from the ditch, pipeline or reservoir, the wages and expense shall be a lien upon the ditch, pipeline or reservoir. The wages and expense shall be paid monthly by the water users, the mutual irrigation company, or the person engaged in the business of selling or renting water from a ditch, pipeline or reservoir. [Amended by 1985 c.421 §14]

 

      540.250 Lien, notice of intent to claim; foreclosure; attorney fees.

      (2) The lien shall be made effective by filing a similar notice to that prescribed under ORS 540.250 within 60 days from the date of payment of the wages and expense, with the county clerk. It may be enforced and foreclosed, and the same procedure, including the allowance of reasonable attorney fees, shall be followed in the foreclosure as in the case of a lien claimed and foreclosed by the watermaster under ORS 540.250. The lien shall not be considered an exclusive remedy. [Amended by 1985 c.421 §16]

The watermaster shall then close, or so adjust the headgates of all ditches from the stream or watercourse, not entitled to the use of such stored water, as will enable those having the right to secure the volume to which they are entitled. The watermaster shall keep a true and just account of the time spent in the discharge of the watermaster’s duties as defined in this section, and the Water Resources Commission shall present a bill of one-half the expense so incurred to the reservoir owner, manager or lessee. If the owner, manager or lessee neglects for 30 days, after presentation of the bill of costs, to pay it, the costs shall be made a charge upon the reservoir and the state shall have a preference lien therefor. Upon notice from the commission, the Attorney General shall foreclose the lien and collect the amount due, as provided in this section, in the same manner as other liens on real property are foreclosed. [Amended by 1955 c.39 §1; 1961 c.636 §7; 1985 c.673 §93]

 

      540.420 Jointly owned ditches; performance by co-owner; recovery for default. In all cases where ditches are owned by two or more persons and one or more of such persons fails or neglects to do a proportionate share of the work necessary for the proper maintenance and operation of the ditch, or to construct suitable headgates or measuring devices at the points where water is diverted from the main ditch, the owner desiring the performance of such work may, after having given 10 days’ written notice to the other owner who has failed to perform a proportionate share of the work, perform such share, and recover therefor from the person in default the reasonable expense of the work.

 

      540.430 Nonpayment by ditch co-owner; lien on interest; foreclosure; stoppage of water delivery. (1) Upon the failure of any co-owner to pay a proportionate share of the expense, as mentioned in ORS 540.420, within 30 days after receiving a statement of the same as performed by the co-owner, the latter may secure payment of the claim by filing an itemized and sworn statement thereof, setting forth the date of performance and the nature of the labor performed, with the county clerk of the county wherein the ditch is situated. When so filed it shall constitute a valid lien against the interest of the person in default, which lien may be established and enforced in the same manner as provided by law for the enforcement of mechanic’s liens.

      (2) In lieu of proceeding to enforce the lien, the person performing the labor may file an itemized and sworn statement with the watermaster of the district within which the ditch is located, setting forth the date of performance, the nature of the labor performed, the total expense incurred by the person and the proportion of the expense each owner should pay, together with a written request that the watermaster take charge of the distribution of the water from the ditch to the parties entitled to the use thereof. Thereupon the watermaster may proceed to distribute the water in accordance with established rights. However, if an owner or user has not paid the proportion of expenses of the owner or user incurred for the proper maintenance and operation of the ditch, the watermaster may serve such party with written notice, personally, by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt, setting forth the proportion of expenses incurred for which the owner or user is obligated to pay. If the party so served refuses or neglects to pay that part of the expense within 10 days after the serving or mailing of the notice, the watermaster may refuse to deliver water to be used upon the lands of such person until after the expense has been paid. [Amended by 1991 c.249 §52]

 

      540.435 Installation of totalizing measuring device; annual water use report; hearing; effect of failure to comply with order. (1) In addition to any other authority of the Water Resources Commission to order installation of a measuring device, if the commission finds accurate water use information necessary because of serious water management problems created by ground water decline, unresolved user disputes or frequent water shortages, the commission by rule may require a water right owner using any surface or ground water source within the state to install a totalizing measuring device and to submit annually a water use report.

      (2) Before the commission implements any requirements under subsection (1) of this section the commission shall:

      (a) Cause a hearing to be conducted in the affected area to determine whether a serious management problem exists; and

      (b) Allow any affected person an opportunity to present alternative methods or devices that could be used to provide the information necessary to manage the water resource or to alleviate the water management problem.

      (3) The watermaster may prohibit the diversion or use of water by anyone who has failed to comply with a commission rule or order requiring installation of measuring devices or submission of a water use report. [1987 c.649 §7]

 

      540.440 Owner to clear weeds from ditch right of way. All persons owning or controlling any water ditches shall keep their right of way along the ditches clean and free from wild oats, mustard, thistles, or any weeds or noxious grasses whatsoever. [Amended by 2011 c.9 §73]

 

CHANGES IN USE OF WATER; TRANSFER OF WATER RIGHTS; EXCHANGE

 

      540.505 Definitions. As used in ORS 540.505 to 540.585:

      (d) A transfer application for which an order approving the change has been issued under ORS 540.530 and for which proper proof of completion of the change has been filed with the Water Resources Commission. [1991 c.957 §2; 1995 c.274 §1; 1997 c.42 §2]

 

      540.510 Appurtenancy of water to premises; restrictions on change of use, place of use or point of diversion; application for transfer of primary and supplemental water rights; right to use conserved water. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) to (8) of this section, all water used in this state for any purpose shall remain appurtenant to the premises upon which it is used and no change in use or place of use of any water for any purpose may be made without compliance with the provisions of ORS 540.520 and 540.530. However, the holder of any water use subject to transfer may, upon compliance with the provisions of ORS 540.520 and 540.530, change the use and place of use, the point of diversion or the use theretofore made of the water in all cases without losing priority of the right theretofore established. A district may change the place of use in the manner provided in ORS 540.572 to 540.580 in lieu of the method provided in ORS 540.520 and 540.530. When an application for change of the use or place of use for a primary water right is submitted in accordance with this section, the applicant also shall indicate whether the land described in the application has an appurtenant supplemental water right or permit. If the applicant also intends to transfer the supplemental water right or permit, the applicant also shall include the information required under ORS 540.520 (2) for the supplemental water right or permit. If the applicant does not include the supplemental water right or permit in the transfer application, the Water Resources Department shall notify the applicant that the supplemental water right or permit will be canceled before the department issues the order approving the transfer of the primary water right, unless within 30 days the applicant modifies the application to include the supplemental water right or permit or withdraws the application. The department may approve the transfer of the supplemental water right or permit in accordance with the provisions of ORS 540.520 and 540.530. The department shall not approve the transfer of a supplemental water right or permit if the transfer would result in enlargement of the original water right or injury to an existing water right. If the department approves the transfer of the primary water right but does not approve the transfer of the supplemental water right or permit, the department shall notify the applicant of the department’s intent to cancel that portion of the supplemental water right or permit described in the transfer application before the department issues the primary water right transfer order, unless the applicant withdraws the transfer application within 90 days.

      (2) Subject to the limitations in ORS 537.490, any right to the use of conserved water allocated by the Water Resources Commission under ORS 537.470 may be severed from the land and transferred or sold after notice to the commission as required under ORS 537.490.

      (B) The use continues to be for municipal purposes and would not interfere with or impair prior vested water rights; or

      (C) The use is authorized under a permit granted under ORS 468B.050 or 468B.053 and for which a reclaimed water registration form has been filed under ORS 537.132.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “municipality” means a city, a port formed under ORS 777.005 to 777.725, 777.915 to 777.953 and 778.010, a domestic water supply district formed under ORS chapter 264, a water supplier as defined in ORS 448.115 or a water authority formed under ORS chapter 450.

      (4) Pursuant to the provisions of ORS 540.570 or 540.585, any water used under a permit or certificate issued to a district may be applied to beneficial use on lands within the district to which the right is not appurtenant.

      (5) The relocation of a point of diversion as necessary to follow the movements of a naturally changing stream channel does not constitute a change in point of diversion for purposes of ORS 540.520 if:

      (a) The diversion point stays within 500 feet of the point of diversion on record with the Water Resources Department;

      (b) The change does not move the diversion point upstream or downstream beyond the diversion point of another appropriator; and

      (c) The diversion is provided with a proper fish screen, if requested by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

      (6) In the event that government action results in or creates a reasonable expectation of a change in the surface level of a surface water source that impairs or threatens to impair access to a point of diversion authorized by a water right permit, certificate or decree, the owner of the water right may change the point of diversion or add an additional point of diversion in accordance with the provisions of this section in lieu of complying with the requirements of ORS 540.520 and 540.530. Before changing the point of diversion, the water right owner shall provide written notice of the proposed change to the Water Resources Department. Within 15 days after receipt of such notice, the department shall provide notice by publication in the department’s public notice of water right applications. Within 60 days after the department receives notice from the owner, the Water Resources Director, by order, shall approve the change unless the director finds the changes will result in injury to other existing water rights. All other terms and conditions of the water right shall remain in effect.

      (7) The sale or lease of the right to the use of conserved water under ORS 537.490 does not constitute a change of use or a change in the place of use of water for purposes of ORS 540.520.

      (8) Ground water applied to an exempt use as set forth in ORS 537.141 or 537.545 may be subsequently applied to land for irrigation purposes under ORS 537.141 (1)(i) or 537.545 (1)(g) without application for a change in use or place of use under this section.

The notice shall include the date on which the last notice by publication will occur. The cost of the publication shall be paid by the applicant in advance to the department. In applications for only a change in place of use or for a change in the point of diversion of less than one-fourth mile, and where there are no intervening diversions between the old diversion of the applicant and the proposed new diversion, no newspaper notice need be published. The department shall include notice of such applications in the weekly notice published by the department.

      (6) Within 30 days after the last publication of a newspaper notice of the proposed transfer or the mailing of the department’s weekly notice, whichever is later, any person may file, jointly or severally, with the department, a protest against approval of the application.

      (7) If a timely protest is filed, or in the opinion of the Water Resources Director a hearing is necessary to determine whether the proposed changes as described by the application would result in injury to existing water rights, the department shall hold a hearing on the matter. Notice and conduct of the hearing shall be under the provisions of ORS chapter 183, pertaining to contested cases, and shall be held in the area where the rights are located unless all parties and persons who filed a protest under this subsection stipulate otherwise.

      (8) An application for a change of use under this section is not required if the beneficial use authorized by the water use subject to transfer is irrigation and the owner of the water right uses the water for incidental agricultural, stock watering and other uses related to irrigation use, so long as there is no increase in the rate, duty, total acreage benefited or season of use.

      (9) A water right transfer under subsection (1) of this section is not required for a general industrial use that was not included in a water right certificate issued for a specific industrial use if:

      (a) The quantity of water used for the general industrial use is not greater than the rate allowed in the original water right and not greater than the quantity of water diverted to satisfy the authorized specific use under the original water right;

      (b) The location where the water is to be used for general industrial use was owned by the holder of the original water right at the time the water right permit was issued; and

      (c) The person who makes the change in water use provides the following information to the Water Resources Department:

      (A) The name and mailing address of the person using water under the water right;

      (B) The water right certificate number;

      (C) A description of the location of the industrial facility owned by the holder of the original water right at the time the water right permit was issued; and

      (D) A description of the general industrial use to be made of the water after the change. [Amended by 1983 c.807 §1; 1985 c.673 §94; 1987 c.339 §3; 1989 c.1000 §7; 1995 c.274 §7; 1995 c.490 §2; 1997 c.42 §3; 1999 c.555 §4; 1999 c.664 §2; 2011 c.52 §6]

 

      540.523 Temporary transfer of water right or permit; terms; revocation; status of supplemental water right or permit. (1) In accordance with the provisions of this section, any person who holds a water use subject to transfer may request that the Water Resources Department approve the temporary transfer of place of use and, if necessary to convey water to the new temporary place of use, temporarily change the point of diversion or point of appropriation for a period not to exceed five years. An application for a temporary transfer shall:

      (a) Be submitted in writing to the Water Resources Department;

      (b) Be accompanied by the appropriate fee for a change in the place of use as set forth in ORS 536.050;

      (c) Include the information required under ORS 540.520 (2); and

      (d) Include any other information the Water Resources Commission by rule may require.

      (2) Notwithstanding the notice and waiting requirements under ORS 540.520, the department shall approve by order a request for a temporary transfer under this section if the department determines that the temporary transfer will not injure any existing water right.

      (3) All uses of water for which a temporary transfer is allowed under this section shall revert automatically to the terms and conditions of the water use subject to transfer upon expiration of the temporary transfer period.

      (4) The time during which water is used under an approved temporary transfer order does not apply toward a finding of forfeiture under ORS 540.610.

      (5) The department may revoke a prior approval of the temporary transfer at any time if the department finds that the transfer is causing injury to any existing water right.

      (6) Any map that may be required under subsection (1) of this section need not be prepared by a certified water right examiner.

      (7) The lands from which the water right is removed during the period of a temporary transfer shall receive no water under the transferred water right.

      (8) When an application for a temporary change of the place of use for a primary water right is submitted in accordance with this section, the applicant also shall indicate whether the land described in the application has an appurtenant supplemental water right or permit. If the applicant also intends to temporarily transfer the supplemental water right or permit, the applicant also shall include the information required under ORS 540.520 (2) for the supplemental water right or permit. If the applicant does not include the supplemental water right or permit in the temporary transfer application, the Water Resources Department shall notify the applicant that the supplemental water right or permit will be canceled before the department issues the order approving the temporary transfer of the primary water right, unless within 30 days the applicant modifies the application to include the supplemental water right or permit or withdraws the application. The department may approve the temporary transfer of the supplemental water right or permit in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department may not approve the temporary transfer of a supplemental water right or permit if the temporary transfer would result in enlargement of the original water right or injury to an existing water right. If the department approves the temporary transfer of the primary water right but does not approve the temporary transfer of the supplemental water right or permit, the department shall notify the applicant of the department’s intent not to allow the temporary transfer of the supplemental water right or permit before the department issues the order for the temporary transfer of the primary water right. If the department does not allow the temporary transfer of the supplemental right, the supplemental right shall remain appurtenant to the land described in the application, but may not be exercised until the primary right reverts to the original water use. If the primary water right does not revert soon enough to allow use of water under the supplemental right within five years, the supplemental right shall become subject to cancellation for nonuse under ORS 540.610.

      (9) In issuing an order under subsection (2) of this section, the department shall include any condition necessary to protect other water rights. [1995 c.274 §6; 1997 c.42 §4; 1997 c.587 §12; 2001 c.788 §§3,9]

 

      540.524 Substitution of supplemental water right from ground water source for primary water right from surface water source; application; fee. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 540.510 or 540.670, upon approval of an application submitted to the Water Resources Department, the holder of both a primary water right originating from a surface water source and a supplemental water right permit or certificate originating from a ground water source may substitute the use of the supplemental water right for the primary water right. A substitution may not be made under this subsection if the use of the supplemental water right results in an enlargement or expansion of the primary water right. This subsection does not authorize a change in place of use, type of use, point of diversion or point of appropriation.

      (2) An application required under subsection (1) of this section shall be submitted on forms provided by the department. The department may request additional information if necessary to assist with the injury evaluation. Each application shall be submitted with the fee described in ORS 536.050 (1)(s).

      (3) Upon receiving an application under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall provide notice, accept protests and conduct hearings on protests in the manner described in ORS 540.520 (5), (6) and (7).

      (4) The Water Resources Director shall issue an order approving or denying the substitution. If the proposed substitution will result in injury to other water rights, the director shall prohibit or condition the use to avoid or mitigate the injury. The director shall issue an order approving or denying the substitution within 90 days after the department receives an application under subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) For the purpose of ORS 540.610, a substituted primary surface water right shall be treated as a supplemental water right, and a substituted supplemental ground water right shall be treated as a primary water right.

      (6) A completed and approved substitution of a supplemental ground water right for a primary surface water right under this section may be terminated upon a request by the water right holder or by an order of the director if the director determines that the use of the ground water as the primary water right causes injury to other water rights. Upon termination, the substituted primary and supplemental water rights shall revert back to their original status. [1999 c.555 §2]

      540.525 Installation of fish screening or by-pass device as prerequisite for transfer of point of diversion. (1) Upon receipt of an application for a change in the point of diversion under ORS 540.520, the Water Resources Department shall consult with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to determine whether the diversion is:

      (a) Equipped with an appropriate fish screening or by-pass device; or

      (b) Included on the priority list of screening projects established pursuant to section 8, chapter 933, Oregon Laws 1989.

      (2) If the original point of diversion is included in the priority list of screening projects established pursuant to section 8, chapter 933, Oregon Laws 1989, the department, after consulting with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, may require the installation of an appropriate fish screening or by-pass device at the new point of diversion.

      (3) When consulting with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the department shall determine whether the installation of an appropriate fish screening or by-pass device is necessary to prevent fish from leaving the body of water and entering the diversion.

      (4) Any individual who is required to install a fish screening or by-pass device under this section at a point of diversion may participate in the State Department of Fish and Wildlife’s cost-sharing program for the installation of screening or by-pass devices. [1995 c.274 §6a; 2007 c.625 §11]

 

      540.530 Order authorizing change of use, place of use or point of diversion; consent to injury; new or modified certificate. (1)(a) If, after hearing or examination, the Water Resources Commission finds that a proposed change can be effected without injury to existing water rights, the commission shall make an order approving the transfer and fixing a time limit within which the approved changes may be completed.

      (b) If, after hearing or examination, the commission finds that a proposed change in point of diversion cannot be effected without injury to existing water rights, upon receipt by the commission of an affidavit consenting to the change from every holder of an affected water right, the commission may make an order approving the transfer and fixing a time limit within which the approved changes may be completed.

      (c) If, after hearing or examination, the commission finds that a proposed change in point of diversion cannot be effected without injury to an in-stream water right granted pursuant to a request under ORS 537.336 or an in-stream water right created pursuant to ORS 537.346 (1), the Water Resources Department may consent to the change only upon a recommendation that the department do so from the agency that requested the in-stream water right. The agency that requested the in-stream water right may recommend that the department consent to the change only if the change will result in a net benefit to the resource consistent with the purposes of the in-stream water right.

      (d)(A) If an in-stream water right would be injured by a proposed change under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the department shall obtain a recommendation from the agency that requested the in-stream water right. If the recommendation of the agency is to consent to the change, the department shall provide public notice of the recommendation and, consistent with state laws regarding cooperation with Indian tribes in the development and implementation of state agency programs that affect tribes or rights and privileges of tribes, the department shall consult with affected Indian tribes.

      (B) The recommendation of an agency under this paragraph must be in writing and, if the recommendation is to consent to the change, must describe the extent of the injury to the in-stream water right, the effect on the resource and the net benefit that will occur as a result of the proposed change. The recommendation may include any proposed conditions that are necessary to ensure that the proposed change will be consistent with the recommendation.

      (C) In determining whether a net benefit will result from the proposed change, the recommendation of an agency must include an analysis of the cumulative impact of any previous changes under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection that allow injury to the affected in-stream water right.

      (D) A person may comment on the recommendation of an agency. The comment must be in writing and must be received by the department within 30 days after publication of notice under this paragraph. If a written comment received by the department requests a meeting on the proposed change, the department and the agency that requested the in-stream water right shall hold a joint public meeting within 90 days of the receipt of the comment requesting a meeting.

      (e)(A) If, after review of public comments and consultation with the agency that requested the in-stream water right, the agency that requested the in-stream water right does not withdraw its recommendation to consent to the change, the department may approve the change consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection.

      (B) An order approving a change under paragraph (c) of this subsection shall include written findings on the extent of the injury to the in-stream water right, the effect on the resource and the net benefit that will occur as a result of the change. The order shall include any conditions necessary to ensure that the change will be consistent with the findings and ensure that the change will result in a continued net benefit to the resource consistent with the purposes of the in-stream water right.

      (C) In determining whether a net benefit will result from the change, the order of the department must include an analysis of the cumulative impact of any previous changes approved under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection that allow injury to the affected in-stream water right.

      (f) The time allowed by the commission for completion of an authorized change under paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection may not be used when computing a five-year period of nonuse under the provisions of ORS 540.610 (1).

      (2)(a) If a certificate covering the water right has been previously issued, the commission shall cancel the previous certificate or, if for an irrigation district, the commission may modify the previous certificate and, when proper proof of completion of the authorized changes has been filed with the commission, issue a new certificate or, if for an irrigation district, modify the previous certificate, preserving the previously established priority of rights and covering the authorized changes. If only a portion of the water right covered by the previous certificate is affected by the changes, a separate new certificate may be issued to cover the unaffected portion of the water right.

      (b) If the change authorized under subsection (1) of this section is necessary to allow a change in a water right pursuant to ORS 537.348, is necessary to complete a project funded under ORS 541.932, or is approved by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife as a change that will result in a net benefit to fish and wildlife habitat, the Water Resources Department, at the discretion of the Water Resources Director, may waive or assist the applicant in satisfying any of the proof of completion requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection. The assistance provided by the department may include, but need not be limited to, development of a final proof survey map and claim of beneficial use.

      (3) Upon receiving notification of the merger or consolidation of municipal water supply entities, or the formation of a water authority under ORS chapter 450, the commission shall cancel the previous certificates of the entities replaced by the merger, consolidation or formation and issue a new certificate to the newly formed municipality or water authority. The new certificate shall preserve the previously established priority of rights of the replaced entities and shall allow beneficial use of the water on any lands acquired in the merger, consolidation or formation. [Amended by 1975 c.581 §26b; 1983 c.807 §2; 1985 c.673 §95; 1989 c.707 §4; 1993 c.577 §37; 1999 c.664 §3; 1999 c.804 §1; 2001 c.299 §§1,2; 2005 c.614 §4]

 

      540.531 Transfer of surface water point of diversion to ground water; requirements; priority; mitigation measures; return to surface water diversion; rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 537.515 and 537.535, an owner of a surface water use subject to transfer may apply for a transfer of the point of diversion to allow the appropriation of ground water if the proposed transfer complies with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section and with the requirements for a transfer in point of diversion specified in ORS 540.520 and 540.530.

      (2) The Water Resources Department may allow a transfer of the point of diversion under subsection (1) of this section if:

      (a)(A) The new point of diversion appropriates ground water from an aquifer that is hydraulically connected to the authorized surface water source;

      (B) The proposed change in point of diversion will not result in enlargement of the original water right or in injury to other water right holders;

      (C) The use of the new point of diversion will affect the surface water source similarly to the authorized point of diversion specified in the water use subject to transfer; and

      (D) The withdrawal of ground water at the new point of diversion is located within 500 feet of the surface water source and, when the surface water source is a stream, is also located within 1,000 feet upstream or downstream of the original point of diversion as specified in the water use subject to transfer; or

      (b) The new point of diversion is not located within the distance requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(D) of this subsection, the holder of the water use subject to transfer submits to the department evidence prepared by a licensed geologist that demonstrates that the use of the ground water at the new point of diversion will meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(A) to (C) of this subsection.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the department shall allow a transfer of the point of diversion under subsection (1) of this section in the Deschutes Basin ground water study area if:

      (a) The new point of diversion appropriates ground water from an aquifer that is hydraulically connected to the authorized surface water source;

      (b) The proposed change in the point of diversion will not result in enlargement of the original water right or in injury to other water right holders; and

      (c) The use of the new point of diversion will affect the surface water source hydraulically connected to the authorized point of diversion specified in the water use subject to transfer. The department may not require that the use of the new point of diversion affect the surface water source similarly to the authorized point of diversion specified in the water use subject to transfer under this subsection.

      (4) All applicable restrictions that existed at the original point of diversion shall apply at the new point of diversion allowed under this section.

      (5) The new point of diversion shall retain the original date of priority. However, if within five years after approving the transfer, the department finds that the transfer results in substantial interference with existing ground water rights that would not have occurred in the absence of the transfer, the new point of diversion shall be subordinate to any existing right injured by the transferred water right or permit.

      (6)(a) The department shall approve an application to return to the last authorized surface water point of diversion if a holder of a water use subject to transfer submits an application to the department within five years after the department approves a transfer under this section.

      (b) The department shall approve an application to return to the last authorized surface water point of diversion after five years of the date the department allows a transfer under subsection (3) of this section if a holder of a water use subject to transfer submits an application to the department, and the return will not result in injury to an existing water right.

      (7) For transfers allowed under this section, the department shall require mitigation measures to prevent depletion from any surface water source not specified in the permit or certificated or decreed water right, except that the department may not require mitigation measures if the transfer complies with subsection (3) of this section.

      (8) The Water Resources Commission shall adopt rules that prescribe:

      (a) The process for reviewing applications submitted under this section;

      (b) The persons to whom the department shall provide notice of the receipt of an application submitted under this section; and

      (c) The persons who may participate in the process of reviewing applications submitted under this section.

      (9) As used in this section:

      (a) “Deschutes Basin ground water study area” means the part of the Deschutes River Basin that is designated by the Water Resources Commission by rule.

      (b) “Similarly” means that the use of ground water at the new point of diversion affects the surface water source specified in the permit or certificated or decreed water right and would result in stream depletion of at least 50 percent of the rate of appropriation within 10 days of continuous pumping. [1995 c.274 §4; 1999 c.555 §5; 2003 c.705 §1; subsection (9) of 2003 Edition enacted as 2003 c.705 §3; 2005 c.614 §2]

[1987 c.815 §7]

 

      540.545 Transfer of water rights following county acquisition of land. Whenever the title to lands within a district has been or is acquired by the county within which the land is located, by foreclosure of tax liens or otherwise, the county court or board of county commissioners, upon request of the district, may make application under the provisions of ORS 540.505 to 540.585 to have the water rights appurtenant to such lands transferred to other lands within the district which are owned by the county or privately owned. [Formerly 540.540; 1991 c.957 §8]

 

      540.550. [Renumbered 540.589 in 2017]

      540.560 Order changing description of land to which water right is appurtenant; limitation; purpose; hearing; effect of final order. (1) If the Water Resources Commission considers that a certificate of water right does not identify the lands to which the right is appurtenant with sufficient specificity for management, delivery or transfer of that right, the commission may issue an order clarifying and refining the description of the land to which the water right is appurtenant.

      (2) An order issued under this section may not reduce the rate, duty or number of acres stated in the certificate of water right. The sole purpose of an addendum to a water right certificate is to better define the location of acreage to which the water right is appurtenant, where the certificate states only that the use is limited to a number of acres within a larger tract.

      (3) Any order issued under this section shall be served on the legal owner of the land to which the water right is appurtenant and on the occupant of the land, by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the owner or occupant files a written request for a hearing within 30 days after service of the order, the commission shall conduct a hearing of the matter under ORS 183.413 to 183.484.

      (4) A final order under this section shall become an addendum to and shall be filed with the certificate of water right that the order clarifies. For all purposes, the final order shall constitute the description of the land to which the water right is appurtenant. [1987 c.649 §9]

 

      540.570 Temporary transfers within districts; procedure; fee. (1) Provided that the proposed transfer complies with all of the provisions of this subsection and will not result in injury to any existing water right, a district with a manager may, for one irrigation season, temporarily transfer the place of use of water appurtenant to any land within the legal boundaries of the district to an equal acreage elsewhere within the legal boundaries of that district or temporarily transfer the type of use identified in a right to store water. A temporary transfer of the place of use may occur if:

      (a) The rate and duty, and the total number of acres to which water will be applied under the transfer, do not exceed existing limits on the water use subject to transfer;

      (b) The type of use authorized under the water use subject to transfer remains the same; and

      (c) The land from which the water use is being transferred does not receive any water under the right being transferred during the irrigation season in which the change is made.

      (2) Provided that the proposed transfer complies with all the provisions of this subsection and will not result in injury to or enlargement of an existing water right, a district with a manager may, for one irrigation season, temporarily change the point of diversion or appropriation combined with a change in place of use, change the point of diversion in the event that an emergency prevents the district from diverting water from its authorized point of diversion, change the point of diversion to allow for the appropriation of ground water or change a primary right to a supplemental right if:

      (a) The land on which the water is to be used is within the district’s legal boundaries established pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554;

      (b) The other terms of the permit or certificate remain the same, including the beneficial use for which the water is used and the number of acres to which water is applied;

      (c) The diversion is provided with a proper fish screen, if required by the Water Resources Department; and

      (d) For a proposal to transfer the point of diversion to allow for the appropriation of ground water, the proposed change meets the standards set forth in ORS 540.531 (2).

      (3) When a district or an owner or an owner’s agent within a district who is subject to the charges or assessments of the district wishes to use water on alternate acreage within the district, if the district has approved the owner’s request, the district shall submit to the department a petition seeking a temporary transfer under this section. The district shall submit the petition prior to making the proposed change. The petition may contain changes to one or more tax lots within the district and shall:

      (a) Include the information required under ORS 540.574 (3);

      (b) Be accompanied by a map in a form satisfactory to the department and certified by the district. If the water right is on a tract of land of five acres or less, the assessor’s tax map with a notation of the acres of water right shall be sufficient for identification of the tract and place of use;

      (c) Include a statement that a written authorization for the transfer from each landowner affected by the particular temporary transfer is on file with the district;

      (d) Include any other information required by rules of the Water Resources Commission; and

      (e) Include a fee in the amount required under ORS 536.050 (1)(i).

      (4) The district shall notify each affected landowner that the department may reject the transfer or may require mitigation to avoid injury to other water rights. Upon receipt of a completed petition under subsection (3) of this section, the department shall place a summary of the petition in the weekly notice published by the department. The department shall accept written public comments on the petition for 30 days following publication of the weekly notice. The department shall consider comments that pertain to the potential for injury to an existing water right or to the enlargement of the water use subject to transfer in determining whether to condition, reject or revoke a temporary transfer.

      (5) Use of water on lands from which the right is transferred and in the new temporary location during the same irrigation season or calendar year is prohibited and may subject the district and the landowner to civil penalties.

      (6) The department may condition, reject or revoke a temporary transfer at any time to the extent necessary to avoid injury if the department finds the transfer is causing injury to an existing water right.

      (7) Upon expiration of the temporary transfer period, all uses of water for which a temporary transfer is allowed under this section shall revert automatically to the terms and conditions of the original water right permit, certificate or adjudication under ORS chapter 539 as evidenced by a court decree.

      (8) The time during which water is used under an approved temporary transfer order does not apply toward a finding of forfeiture under ORS 540.610. [1987 c.649 §10; 1991 c.957 §9; 1995 c.554 §4; 2001 c.788 §§4,10; 2003 c.705 §§15,16; 2005 c.401 §1]

 

      Note: Sections 22, 23 and 25, chapter 705, Oregon Laws 2003, provide:

      Sec. 22. Section 23 of this 2003 Act is added to and made a part of ORS 540.505 to 540.580. [2003 c.705 §22]

      Sec. 23. (1) In order to increase district water management flexibility, the Water Resources Department shall establish a pilot project in which districts may temporarily allow, for water uses subject to transfer, the use of water on any land within the legal boundaries of the district established pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554.

      (2) The use of water on any land within the legal boundaries of the district may be allowed if:

      (a) The rate and duty, and the total number of acres to which water will be applied under the transfer, do not exceed existing limits on the water use subject to transfer;

      (b) The type of use authorized under the water use subject to transfer is for irrigation and remains the same; and

      (c) The land from which the water use is being transferred does not receive any water under the right being transferred during the irrigation season in which the change is made.

      (3) The department shall allow the pilot project to be implemented in the Talent Irrigation District, the Owyhee Irrigation District, the Tualatin Valley Irrigation District, the Central Oregon Irrigation District, the Swalley Irrigation District, the Westland Irrigation District, the North Unit Irrigation District, the Arnold Irrigation District, the Stanfield Irrigation District, the West Extension Irrigation District, the Hermiston Irrigation District, the Medford Irrigation District, the Sutherlin Water Control District, the Santiam Water Control District and the Ochoco Irrigation District or their successor districts. However, any district participating in the project must:

      (a) Have defined state district boundaries;

      (b) Have a management structure that can ensure that water is applied only where the water use is authorized;

      (c) Not irrigate an area in any one irrigation season that exceeds the maximum number of acres allowed to be irrigated under the original water right;

      (d) Have a full and accurate measurement of the water appropriated;

      (e) Have an accurate map identifying the location of authorized use, by priority date, for review upon request and provide a copy of the map to the watermaster; and

      (f) Have on file statements by any landowner affected by the water use change indicating that the landowner agrees to the change.

      (4) If any of the specified districts are unable to participate in the project, the department may identify another district for the project. Before allowing another district to participate in the project for the first time, the department shall publish notice of the planned participation by publication in the weekly notice published by the department and shall allow the public at least 20 days to provide information to assist the department in determining whether the district meets the qualifications required under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) The department may require that use of water under the pilot project cease and that the use revert to the use allowed under the water right of record if the department determines that:

      (a) The district does not meet the qualifications established in subsection (3) of this section;

      (b) The water is being used in a manner that violates the requirements in subsection (2) of this section; or

      (c) The changes made to the use of water would result in injury to existing water rights or an enlargement of the original water right.

      (6) The department shall annually, prior to commencement of the irrigation season, publish notice of the districts that might intend to make use of the pilot program during the year. The notice shall identify the districts by name and provide the contact information for the watermasters for the districts. The department shall publish the notice by publication in the weekly notice published by the department.

      (7) Use of water under the pilot project constitutes a beneficial use of water and does not constitute nonuse for purposes of forfeiture under ORS 540.610. [2003 c.705 §23; 2009 c.283 §1; 2015 c.384 §2]

      Sec. 25. Sections 22 and 23, chapter 705, Oregon Laws 2003, are repealed on January 2, 2022. [2003 c.705 §25; 2007 c.10 §2; 2009 c.283 §3; 2015 c.384 §3]

      540.572 Application of certificated water elsewhere within district; notice. (1) Upon compliance with this section and ORS 540.574 and 540.576, whenever land within the legal boundaries of a district is no longer irrigated or susceptible of irrigation, the district may apply the certificated water to which such land is entitled to other irrigable lands within the legal boundaries of the district if the district:

      (a) Is managed by a full-time manager; and

      (b) Is implementing a conservation plan approved by the Water Resources Commission, and meets all other management responsibility criteria for districts and conservation and efficiency criteria required by the Water Resources Commission.

      (2) If a water user of a district has not made beneficial use of the water to which the user is entitled for a period of four successive years, the district shall advise the user and any security interest holder of record that if the user does not use the water for a fifth successive year, the district may petition the Water Resources Commission for a transfer of the water right under ORS 540.574.

      (3) When a district wishes to transfer the use of water under this section, the district shall provide notice of its intent to petition for a transfer to the user and any security interest holder of record of the land whose right of record would be transferred. The notice shall be sent to the last-known address for the user with a return receipt requested.

      (4) The notice required under subsection (3) of this section shall:

      (a) Include:

      (A) The number of acres for which the user is being charged or assessed;

      (B) A general description or tax lot of the land to which the water is assigned;

      (C) A description of the use; and

      (D) A request for confirmation that the information in the notice is correct.

      (b) Advise the user that:

      (A) The district has determined that the user’s land is no longer irrigated or susceptible of irrigation and that the district intends to petition the Water Resources Commission for approval to transfer the user’s water right to other lands in the district.

      (B) If the user disagrees with the determination of the district that the user’s land is no longer irrigated or susceptible of irrigation or if the user has some other objection to the proposed action of the district, the user shall so advise the district in writing within 30 days after the notice is mailed.

      (C) The user shall advise the district in writing within the foregoing time period if the user believes the presumption of forfeiture under ORS 540.610 is rebuttable for a reason provided under ORS 540.610.

      (5) If the district receives a written objection within 30 days after the mailing of the notice under subsection (3) of this section, the district manager shall attempt to resolve the matter with the user. If the user’s objections cannot be resolved by the manager, a hearing shall be held before the board of directors who shall make a determination whether to proceed with the petition to the Water Resources Commission.

      (6) If no written objections are received by the district within 30 days after the mailing of the notice under subsection (3) of this section, or following resolution or hearing under subsection (5) of this section, the district may petition the Water Resources Commission for approval of the transfer under ORS 540.574.

      (7) As used in this section:

      (a) “Irrigable land” means land that is currently under irrigation or susceptible of irrigation for agricultural, horticultural, viticultural or grazing purposes.

      (b) “No longer irrigated or susceptible of irrigation” means:

      (A) Land on which water for irrigation has not been applied for a period of five successive irrigation seasons; or

      (B) Land that does not have reasonable access to the system of irrigation works of the district, or that cannot be irrigated from or that is not susceptible to or would not, by reason of being permanently devoted to uses other than agricultural, horticultural, viticultural or grazing, be directly benefited by actual irrigation from the district.

      (c) “Owned” or “controlled” means ownership in fee, purchase on a land sale contract, option to purchase or lease.

      (d) “User” means an owner of land with an appurtenant water right who is subject to the charges or assessments of a district and from whose land the water right would be transferred by the petition and map filed under ORS 540.574 and an owner of land to which the water right would be transferred. [1991 c.957 §3]

 

      540.574 Petition for approval of transfer. (1) In accordance with the requirements of subsection (3) of this section, a district may petition the Water Resources Commission for approval and acceptance of a district map indicating the transfer of the location and use of the water rights within the district or any part of the district. The map shall be in a form satisfactory to the commission and shall be certified by the district rather than a certified water right examiner. In no event shall the petition and map expand a water right of the district or its users beyond the total right of record for the district. If the district complies with the requirements of ORS 540.572 to 540.580, and after the opportunity for hearing under ORS 540.578, the commission shall issue an order approving the transfer and proceed as provided in ORS 540.530 (1) and (2).

      (2) If the commission denies the petition under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall hold a hearing on the denial. Notice and conduct of the hearing shall be according to the provisions of ORS chapter 183 applicable to a contested case proceeding.

      (d) A general description of the district boundaries.

      (e) A general description of the users’ land and the water right for each parcel from which and to which water rights are to be transferred. If the water right is on a tract of land of five acres or less, a notation of the acres of water right on the assessor’s tax map shall be sufficient for identification of the place of use and the extent of use.

      (f) A description of the use that is proposed to be made of the water on each parcel.

      (g) An affirmation by the petitioner that the map and petition are accurate to the best of the petitioner’s knowledge.

      (h) A statement by the petitioner that notice has been given as required under ORS 540.572 (2), and that the water right has not previously been forfeited under ORS 540.610 due to an earlier or longer period of nonuse. [1991 c.957 §4]

 

      540.576 Notice of petition; protest; user rights. After filing a petition under ORS 540.572, the district shall send a copy of the petition and map and a notice to the users of the district whose right of record is to be transferred and who are to receive the transferred right. The copy of the petition and the notice shall be sent to the last-known address of the user with a return receipt requested. The notice accompanying the petition shall advise the user that:

      (1) Sixty days after the date of mailing of the notice, the Water Resources Commission shall accept the petition and the water right shall be transferred unless a protest is filed or the petition does not meet the requirements of ORS 540.572 to 540.580; and

      (2) The user has the right to protest the petition and transfer in the manner described in ORS 540.578. [1991 c.957 §5]

 

      540.578 Filing of protest; hearing on proposed transfer. (1) Any user may file with the Water Resources Commission, within 60 days after the date of mailing the notice under ORS 540.576, a protest against approval of the petition, map and transfer. Whenever a timely protest is filed, or in the opinion of the commission a hearing is necessary to determine whether the district has complied with the requirements of ORS 540.572 to 540.580, or the proposed transfers described in the petition would result in injury to existing water rights, the commission shall hold a hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be conducted according to the provisions of ORS chapter 183 applicable to contested case proceedings. The hearing shall be held in the area of the state where the rights are located unless the parties and the persons who filed the protest under this section stipulate otherwise.

      (2) If, after examination or hearing, the commission finds that the petition complies with the requirements of ORS 540.572 to 540.580, and that the proposed changes described in the petition would not result in injury to existing water rights, the commission shall issue an order approving the transfer and proceed as provided in ORS 540.530 (1) and (2).

      (3) A certificate issued under this section for the transferred water right shall have the evidentiary effect provided for in ORS 537.270 unless the right to appropriate water described in the certificate is forfeited after the certificate is issued. [1991 c.957 §6]

 

      540.580 Permanent transfer of place of use of water within district; requirements; procedure. (1) In accordance with this section, a district may by petition request that the Water Resources Department approve the permanent transfer of the place of use of water within a district as long as the proposed transfer complies with all of the following:

      (a) The rate, duty and total number of acres to which water is to be applied under the water use subject to transfer are not exceeded;

      (b) The use authorized under the water use subject to transfer remains the same;

      (c) The change in place of use will not result in injury to any existing water right; and

      (d) The land from which the water right is removed by the transfer shall receive no water under the transferred right.

      (2) A district may submit a petition for a permanent transfer prior to or subsequent to the change in place of use, but no later than the end of the calendar year in which the change occurs. The petition submitted by the district may include an unlimited number of transfers within the same petition. A petition under this section shall:

      (a) Include the information required under ORS 540.574 (3), except for the statement that a notice under ORS 540.572 (2) has been given;

      (b) Be accompanied by a map in a form satisfactory to the department and certified by the district. If the water right is on a tract of land of five acres or less, the assessor’s tax map with a notation of the acres of water right shall be sufficient for identification of the tract and place of use;

      (c) Include a statement that each landowner affected by a permanent transfer has authorized the transfer in a writing that is on file with the district;

      (d) Include any other information required by rules of the Water Resources Commission; and

      (e) Include the fee required under ORS 536.050 (1)(h) for a change in the place of use.

      (3) If a district allows a change in the place of use of water before obtaining the approval of the department, the district shall:

      (a) Notify each affected landowner that the change is subject to the approval of the department and that the department may reject the transfer or may require mitigation to avoid injury to other water right holders; and

      (b) Notify the department in advance of the change. The notice shall include:

      (A) The name of the district and the certificate number of each water right that is the subject of the change;

      (B) The names of the users within the district from whose lands and to whose lands water rights are to be transferred;

      (C) A general description of the users’ lands by township, range, quarter quarter section and tax lot number, and of the water right, for each parcel from which and to which water rights are to be transferred; and

      (D) A description of the use that is proposed to be made of the water on each parcel.

      (4) Upon receipt of the notice required under subsection (3)(b) of this section, the department shall provide public notice in the weekly notice published by the department.

      (5) If a district allows a change in the place of use of water before obtaining approval of the department under this section, the department may direct the district to cease delivery of water or mitigate injury where the change in place of use is causing injury to an existing water right.

      (6) Within 15 days after the filing of a petition under subsection (2) of this section, the department shall include notice of the petition in the weekly notice published by the department. Within 30 days after the mailing of the department’s weekly notice, any potentially affected holder of an existing water right may file, jointly or severally, with the department, a protest against approval of the petition.

      (7) Subject to the provisions of subsection (8) of this section, whenever a timely protest is filed, or in the opinion of the Water Resources Director a hearing is necessary to determine whether the proposed changes as described in the petition would result in injury to existing water rights, the department may hold a hearing on the petition. Notice and conduct of the hearing shall be according to the provisions of ORS chapter 183 pertaining to contested cases, shall be scheduled within 45 days after the filing of the petition, and shall be held in the area where the rights are located unless all parties and persons who filed a protest under this subsection stipulate otherwise.

      (8) If a water user within the district files a protest claiming injury to a water right delivery by the district, no contested case hearing shall be required, but the district shall resolve the matter directly with the water user.

      (9) After examination or hearing, the department shall issue an order approving the transfer if the proposed change can be effected without injury to existing water rights. If no hearing is scheduled under subsection (7) of this section, the order of the department shall be issued within 90 days after the date of the filing of the petition. If the proposed change cannot be effected without injury to existing water rights, the department may condition approval, including requiring mitigation of the effects on other water rights, to the extent necessary to avoid injury. If a hearing is scheduled, the department shall issue a final order within 120 days after scheduling the hearing.

      (10) Within 20 days after the director issues a final order under this section, the district or any protestant may file with the commission exceptions to the final order. The commission shall issue an order granting or denying the exceptions within 30 days after receiving the exceptions.

      (11) If a certificate covering the water right has been previously issued, the department may amend the certificate or may cancel the certificate and issue a new certificate preserving the previously established priority of rights and covering the authorized changes. If only a portion of the water right covered by the previous certificate is affected by the changes, a separate new certificate may be issued to cover the unaffected portion of the water right. A certificate as amended or issued under this section has the evidentiary effect provided for in ORS 537.270 as to the new lands except when the right to appropriate water described in the certificate is abandoned after the certificate is amended or issued.

      (12) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, a petition filed on or before December 31, 1996, may include all changes in place of use allowed by a district after July 1, 1992, and before November 30, 1996.

      540.587 Report on implementation of temporary transfer provisions. The Water Resources Department shall submit a report, in the manner provided in ORS 192.245, that shall include a summary of the features of the process employed by the Water Resources Commission to implement ORS 540.585. The report shall be submitted no later than January 31 of each year to the Legislative Assembly or to an interim committee related to natural resources, as appropriate. [2003 c.705 §10]

 

      Note: 540.587 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 540 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      540.589 Ratification of prior transfer of water rights to irrigation district. All attempted transfers or sales, prior to March 6, 1931, to an irrigation district, of water rights which theretofore had been appurtenant to lands located in the district and which lands at the time of the attempted transfer or sale were owned by the county, shall be considered to be legal and binding, and the water rights which were appurtenant to such lands shall be considered to have become the property of the district to which attempted to be conveyed, but appurtenant only to lands within the boundaries of the district as they existed on March 6, 1931, if the irrigation district applied to the Water Resources Director, within five years after March 6, 1931, under the provisions of section 47-712, Oregon Code 1930, as amended by chapter 102, Oregon Laws 1931, to have the water rights made appurtenant to other lands within the irrigation district. In that event, the county shall sell the lands without any water rights being appurtenant thereto. If the irrigation district failed within five years after March 6, 1931, to make such application, then title to the water rights shall be considered to have been forfeited. [Formerly 540.550]

 

FORFEITURE OF WATER RIGHTS

 

      540.610 Use as measure of water right; forfeiture for nonuse; confirmation of rights of municipalities. (1) Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and the limit of all rights to the use of water in this state. Whenever the owner of a perfected and developed water right ceases or fails to use all or part of the water appropriated for a period of five successive years, the failure to use shall establish a rebuttable presumption of forfeiture of all or part of the water right.

      (2) Upon a showing of failure to use beneficially for five successive years, the appropriator has the burden of rebutting the presumption of forfeiture by showing one or more of the following:

      (a) The water right is for use of water, or rights of use, acquired by cities and towns in this state, by appropriation or by purchase, for all reasonable and usual municipal purposes.

      (b) A finding of forfeiture would impair the rights of such cities and towns to the use of water, whether acquired by appropriation or purchase, or heretofore recognized by act of the legislature, or which may hereafter be acquired.

      (c) The use of water, or rights of use, are appurtenant to property obtained by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs under ORS 407.135 or 407.145 for three years after the expiration of the period of redemption provided for in ORS 18.964 while the land is held by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, even if during such time the water is not used for a period of more than five successive years.

      (d) The use of water, or rights of use, under a water right, if the owner of the property to which the right is appurtenant is unable to use the water due to economic hardship as defined by rule by the Water Resources Commission.

      (e) The period of nonuse occurred during a period of time within which land was withdrawn from use in accordance with the Act of Congress of May 28, 1956, chapter 327 (7 U.S.C. 1801-1814; 1821-1824; 1831-1837), or the Federal Conservation Reserve Program, Act of Congress of December 23, 1985, chapter 198 (16 U.S.C. 3831-3836, 3841-3845). If necessary, in a cancellation proceeding under this section, the water right holder rebutting the presumption under this paragraph shall provide documentation that the water right holder’s land was withdrawn from use under a federal reserve program.

      (f) The end of the alleged period of nonuse occurred more than 15 years before the date upon which evidence of nonuse was submitted to the commission or the commission initiated cancellation proceedings under ORS 540.631, whichever occurs first.

      (g) The owner of the property to which the water right was appurtenant is unable to use the water because the use of water under the right is discontinued under an order of the commission under ORS 537.775.

      (h) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the water right holder was using reclaimed water in lieu of using water under an existing water right.

      (i) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the water right holder was reusing water through land application as authorized by ORS 537.141 (1)(i) or 537.545 (1)(g) in lieu of using water under an existing water right.

      (j) The owner or occupant of the property to which the water right is appurtenant was unable to make full beneficial use of the water because water was not available. A water right holder rebutting the presumption under this paragraph shall provide evidence that the water right holder was ready, willing and able to use the water had it been available.

      (k) The holder of a water right is prohibited by law from using the water. If the prohibition is subject to remedial action that would allow the use of the water, the water right holder shall provide evidence that the water right holder is conducting the remedial action with reasonable diligence.

      (L) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the exercise of all or part of the water right was not necessary due to climatic conditions, so long as the water right holder had a facility capable of handling the full allowed rate and duty, and was otherwise ready, willing and able to use the entire amount of water allowed under the water right.

      (m) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the water was included in a transfer application pending before the Water Resources Department.

      (n) The nonuse of a supplemental water right occurred during a period of time when the primary water right used in conjunction with that supplemental water right was leased as an in-stream water right pursuant to ORS 537.348.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the owner of a perfected and developed water right uses less water to accomplish the beneficial use allowed by the right, the right is not subject to forfeiture so long as:

      (a) The user has a facility capable of handling the entire rate and duty authorized under the right; and

      (b) The user is otherwise ready, willing and able to make full use of the right.

      (4) The right of all cities and towns in this state to acquire rights to the use of the water of natural streams and lakes, not otherwise appropriated, and subject to existing rights, for all reasonable and usual municipal purposes, and for such future reasonable and usual municipal purposes as may reasonably be anticipated by reason of growth of population, or to secure sufficient water supply in cases of emergency, is expressly confirmed.

      (5) After a water right is forfeited under subsection (1) of this section, the water that was the subject of use shall revert to the public and become again the subject of appropriation in the manner provided by law, subject to existing priorities. [Amended by 1985 c.689 §5; 1987 c.339 §4; 1989 c.699 §1; 1989 c.833 §61a; 1991 c.370 §6; 1995 c.356 §2; 1995 c.366 §1; 1997 c.42 §5; 1997 c.244 §5; 1997 c.283 §1; 1999 c.335 §3; 1999 c.804 §§3,4; 2005 c.222 §1; 2005 c.542 §70; 2005 c.625 §70]

 

      540.612 Exemption from forfeiture. If a district, as defined in ORS 540.505, petitions for a transfer as provided in ORS 540.574 no later than the end of the calendar year of the fifth year of nonuse under ORS 540.610 (1), the forfeiture provisions of ORS 540.610 shall not apply to the lands from which the water right is sought to be transferred pending approval of the district’s petition. The time required for the processing of the petition, including any time required for hearings, appeals and completion of an authorized change, shall not be included when computing a five-year period of nonuse under the provisions of ORS 540.610 (1). [1991 c.957 §11]

 

      540.615 [1961 c.140 §1; 1987 c.339 §5; repealed by 1989 c.699 §4]

 

      540.620 [Repealed by 1955 c.671 §1]

 

      540.621 Cancellation of abandoned water right upon request of owner. Whenever the owner of a perfected and developed water right certifies under oath to the Water Resources Commission that the water right has been abandoned by the owner and that the owner desires cancellation thereof, the commission shall enter an order canceling the water right. Effective upon the date of the entering of such order, the water which was the subject of use under the water right shall revert to the public and become again the subject of appropriation in the manner provided by law, subject to existing priorities. [1955 c.670 §1; 1979 c.67 §5; 1985 c.673 §96]

 

      540.630 [Repealed by 1955 c.671 §1]

 

      540.631 Cancellation of forfeited water right; notice. Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Water Resources Commission upon the commission’s own determination or upon evidence submitted to the commission by any person that a perfected and developed water right has been forfeited as provided in ORS 540.610 (1), and would not be rebutted under ORS 540.610 (2), the commission shall initiate proceedings for the cancellation of such water right by causing written notice of such initiation of proceedings to be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the legal owner of the lands to which the water right is appurtenant and to the occupant of such lands. The notice to the legal owner shall be addressed to the legal owner at the owner’s last address of record in the office of the county assessor of the county in which the lands are located. The notice shall contain a complete description of the water right and of the lands to which the water right is appurtenant. The notice shall state that the legal owner or the occupant has a period of 60 days from the date of the mailing of the notice within which to protest the proposed cancellation of the water right. [1955 c.670 §2; 1985 c.673 §97; 1989 c.699 §2; 1991 c.249 §53]

 

      540.640 [Repealed by 1955 c.671 §1]

 

      540.641 Protest of cancellation; procedure. (1) If the legal owner or the occupant receiving notice as provided in ORS 540.631 fails to protest the proposed cancellation of the water right within the 60-day period prescribed in the notice, the Water Resources Commission may enter an order canceling the water right.

      (2) If the legal owner or the occupant receiving notice as provided in ORS 540.631 files a protest against the proposed cancellation of the water right with the commission within the 60-day period prescribed in the notice, the commission shall fix a time and place for a hearing on the protest. The commission shall cause written notice of the hearing to be given at least 10 days prior to the hearing to the person protesting the cancellation of the water right and to any other person who in the opinion of the commission is an interested party to the proceeding. The hearing shall be held by the commission and shall be conducted under the provisions of ORS chapter 183 pertaining to contested cases. After the hearing the commission shall enter an order canceling the water right, canceling in part or modifying the water right, or declaring that the water right shall not be canceled or modified. [1955 c.670 §3; 1975 c.581 §26c; 1983 c.807 §3; 1985 c.673 §98]

 

      540.650 Issuance of new water right certificate for water rights not canceled. If the order of the Water Resources Commission or the final decree on the appeal therefrom under ORS 540.641 cancels in part or modifies the water right, that portion of the water right not canceled or continued as modified shall be reaffirmed by a new water right certificate issued by the commission. Such certificate shall be of the same character as that described in ORS 539.140. The certificate shall be recorded and transmitted to the owner of the water right as provided in ORS 539.140. [1955 c.670 §4; 1979 c.67 §6; 1985 c.673 §99]

 

      540.660 Affidavit of watermaster that circumstances prevent use of water right in accordance with terms of certificate; procedures for cancellation of right. (1) If a watermaster has reason to believe that circumstances exist that prevent a water right from being exercised according to the terms and conditions of the water right certificate issued under ORS 537.250 or 539.140, such as the land to which the water right is appurtenant is covered by an impermeable surface, or the diversion mechanism used to appropriate water under a water right is no longer operable, the watermaster shall file an affidavit with the Water Resources Director. The affidavit shall state that to the best of the watermaster’s knowledge, there is no physical way the water may be applied to a beneficial use in accordance with the terms and conditions of the water right certificate.

      (2) If the watermaster files an affidavit under subsection (1) of this section each year for five consecutive years, the affidavits shall constitute prima facie evidence that the water has not been applied to a beneficial use for five years and the Water Resources Commission shall initiate proceedings under ORS 540.631 to cancel the water right.

      (3) The Water Resources Department shall provide notice of the affidavit filed with the Water Resources Director under subsection (1) of this section. The department shall provide such notice in the following manner:

      (a) If there are 25 or fewer record owners of the land, the department shall mail a copy of the affidavit to each record owner.

      (b) If there are more than 25 record owners, the department shall provide general notice by publication according to the procedures established in ORS 193.010 to 193.100.

      (c) If the land is within the boundaries of an irrigation district, the department shall mail a copy of the affidavit to the irrigation district.

      (4) As used in this section, “record owner” means the person shown as the owner of the land in the county deed records established under ORS chapter 93. [1987 c.339 §1]

 

      540.670 Effect of cancellation of primary water right on supplemental right; change from supplemental to primary right; priority date. (1) The cancellation of a primary water right for nonuse under ORS 540.641 shall not also cancel a supplemental water right unless the supplemental water right also has not been used beneficially for five or more years.

      (2) If the Water Resources Commission cancels a primary water right under ORS 540.641 the commission may issue a new water right certificate changing the supplemental water right to a primary right if the commission finds that the change would not result in injury to existing water rights.

      (3) A supplemental right changed to a primary right under subsection (2) of this section shall retain the priority date of the supplemental right. [1987 c.339 §2]

 

PROHIBITED ACTS; INJUNCTIONS

 

      540.710 Interference with headgate, or use of water denied by watermaster or other authority; evidence of guilt. No person shall willfully open, close, change or interfere with any lawfully established headgate or water box without authority, or willfully use water or conduct water into or through the ditch of the person which has been lawfully denied the person by the watermaster or other competent authority. The possession or use of water when the same shall have been lawfully denied by the watermaster or other competent authority shall be prima facie evidence of the guilt of the person using it.

 

      540.720 Unauthorized use or waste of water; evidence of guilt of user. No person shall use without authorization water to which another person is entitled, or willfully waste water to the detriment of another. The possession or use of such water without legal right shall be prima facie evidence of the guilt of the person using it.

 

      540.730 Obstruction interfering with access to or use of works. Whenever any appropriator of water has the lawful right of way for the storage, diversion, or carriage of water, no person shall place or maintain any obstruction that shall interfere with the use of the works, or prevent convenient access thereto.

 

      540.740 Injunctive relief against action of watermaster. Any person who may be injured by the action of any watermaster may appeal to the circuit court for an injunction. The injunction shall only be issued in case it can be shown at the hearing that the watermaster has failed to carry into effect the order of the Water Resources Commission or decrees of the court determining the existing rights to the use of water. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §100]

 

      540.750 Injunction suits; notice; hearing. In suits for injunction affecting the use of water from streams upon which the rights to water have been determined, no restraining order shall be granted before hearing had after at least three days’ notice thereof, served upon all parties defendant. All suits for injunction involving the use of water shall be heard, either in term time or during vacation, not later than 15 days after issues joined, unless for good cause shown further time be allowed.
