WATER COMPANIES ORGANIZED UNDER 1891 ACT

 

      541.010 Furnishing of water for certain purposes declared to be a public use; rates; amendment of law. (1) The use of the water of the lakes and running streams of Oregon, for general rental, sale or distribution, for purposes of irrigation, and supplying water for household and domestic consumption, and watering livestock upon dry lands of the state, is a public use, and the right to collect rates or compensation for such use of water is a franchise. A use shall be deemed general within the purview of this section when the water appropriated is supplied to all persons whose lands lie adjacent to or within reach of the line of the ditch, canal or flume in which the water is conveyed, without discrimination other than priority of contract, upon payment of charges therefor, as long as there may be water to supply.

      (2) Rates for the uses of water mentioned in this section may be fixed by the Legislative Assembly or by such officer as may be given that authority by the Legislative Assembly, but rates shall not be fixed lower than will allow the net profits of any ditch, canal, flume or system thereof to equal the prevailing legal rate of interest on the amount of money actually paid in and employed in the construction and operation of the ditch, canal, flume or system.

      (3) This section and ORS 541.020 to 541.080 may at any time be amended by the Legislative Assembly, and commissioners for the management of water rights and the use of water may be appointed.

 

      541.020 Construction of ditches and canals by corporation; route across lands. Whenever any corporation organized under the Act of 1891, pages 52 to 60, Oregon Laws 1891, finds it necessary to construct its ditch, canal, flume, distributing ditches, or feeders across the improved or occupied lands of another, it shall select the shortest and most direct route practicable, having reference to cost of construction upon which the ditch, canal, flume, distributing ditches, or feeders can be constructed with uniform or nearly uniform grade.

 

      541.030 Ditches and canals across state lands; grant of right of way. The right of way, to the extent specified in the Act of 1891, pages 52 to 60, Oregon Laws 1891, for the ditches, canals, flumes, distributing ditches, and feeders of any corporation appropriating water under the provisions of the Act of 1891, across all lands belonging to the State of Oregon and not under contract of sale, is granted.

 

      541.040 Headgate; mode of construction. Every corporation having constructed a ditch, canal or flume under the provisions of the Act of 1891, pages 52 to 60, Oregon Laws 1891, shall erect and keep in good repair a headgate at the head of its ditch, canal or flume, which, together with the necessary embankments, shall be of sufficient height and strength to control the water at all ordinary stages. The framework of the headgate shall be of timber not less than four inches square, and the bottom, sides and gate shall be of plank not less than two inches in thickness.

 

      541.050 Leakage or overflow; liability; exception. Every corporation having constructed a ditch, canal, flume or reservoir under the provisions of the Act of 1891, pages 52 to 60, Oregon Laws 1891, shall be liable for all damages done to the persons or property of others, arising from leakage or overflow of water therefrom growing out of want of strength in the banks or walls, or negligence or want of care in the management of the ditch, canal, flume or reservoir. However, damage resulting from extraordinary and unforeseen action of the elements, or attributable in whole or in part to the wrongful interference of another with the ditch, canal, flume or reservoir, which may not be known to the corporation for such length of time as would enable it by the exercise of reasonable efforts to remedy the same, shall not be recovered against the corporation.

 

      541.055 District liability for seepage and leakage from water or flood control works; limitation on commencement of action. (1) Any person or irrigation, drainage, water improvement or water control district organized pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554 that owns, operates or maintains any irrigation, drainage, water supply, water control or flood control works shall be liable for damage caused by seepage and leakage from such works only to the extent that such damage is directly and proximately caused by the negligence of the person or irrigation, drainage, water improvement or water control district organized pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554 and not otherwise. Damage resulting from extraordinary and unforeseen action of the elements, or attributable in whole or in part to the wrongful interference of another person or irrigation, drainage, water improvement or water control district organized pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554 with the irrigation, drainage, water supply, water control or flood control works, which may not be known to the person or irrigation, drainage, water improvement or water control district organized pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554 for such length of time as would enable the person or irrigation, drainage, water improvement or water control district organized pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554 by the exercise of reasonable efforts to remedy the same, shall not be recovered against the person or irrigation, drainage, water improvement or water control district organized pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554.

      (2) An action or suit under subsection (1) of this section must be commenced within two years from the date when the damage is first discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered. However, in no event shall any such action or suit be commenced more than four years from the date the damage actually occurred. [1979 c.882 §1]

 

      541.060 Waste of water; flooding premises; unnecessary diversion. Every corporation having constructed a ditch, canal or flume under the provisions of the Act of 1891, pages 52 to 60, Oregon Laws 1891, shall carefully keep and maintain the embankments and walls thereof, and of any reservoir constructed to be used in conjunction therewith, so as to prevent the water from wasting and from flooding or damaging the premises of others. The corporation shall not divert at any time any water for which it has no actual use or demand.

 

      541.070 Ditches, canals and flumes as real estate. All ditches, canals and flumes permanently affixed to the soil, constructed under the provisions of the Act of 1891, pages 52 to 60, Oregon Laws 1891, are declared to be real estate, and the same or any interest therein shall be transferred by deed only, duly witnessed and acknowledged. The vendee of the same, or any interest therein, at any stage shall succeed to all the rights of the vendor, and shall be subject to the same liabilities during ownership.

 

      541.080 Suits involving water rights; parties; decree as to priorities. In any suit commenced for the protection of rights to water acquired under the provisions of the Act of 1891, pages 52 to 60, Oregon Laws 1891, the plaintiff may make any or all persons who have diverted water from the same stream or source parties to the suit, and the court may in one decree determine the relative priorities and rights of all parties to the suit. Any person claiming a right on the stream or source, not made a party to the suit, may become such on application to the court, when it is made to appear that the person is interested in the result, and may have the right of the person determined. The court may at any stage, on its own motion, require any persons having or claiming rights to water on the stream or source, to be brought in and made parties, when it appears that a complete determination of the issue involved cannot be made without their presence.

 

APPROPRIATION OF WATER FOR MINING AND ELECTRIC POWER UNDER 1899 ACT

 

      541.110 Use of water to develop mineral resources and furnish power. The use of the water of the lakes and running streams of Oregon for the purpose of developing the mineral resources of the state and to furnish electric power for all purposes, is declared to be a public and beneficial use and a public necessity. Subject to the provisions of the Water Rights Act (as defined in ORS 537.010), the right to divert unappropriated waters of any such lakes or streams for such public and beneficial use is granted.

 

      541.120 Ditches and canals through lands; use of existing ditch by others than owner; joint liability. No tract or parcel of improved or occupied land in this state shall, without the written consent of the owner, be subjected to the burden of two or more ditches, canals, flumes or pipelines constructed under the Act of 1899, pages 172 to 180, Oregon Laws 1899, for the purpose of conveying water through the property, when the same object can be feasibly and practically attained by uniting and conveying all the water necessary to be conveyed through such property in one ditch, canal, flume or pipeline. Any person having constructed a ditch, canal, flume or pipeline for the purpose provided in the Act of 1899 shall allow any other person to enlarge such ditch, canal, flume or pipeline, so as not to interfere with the operations of the person owning the same, and to use such ditch, canal, flume or pipeline in common with the person owning the same, upon payment to such person of a reasonable proportion of the cost of constructing and maintaining the ditch, canal, flume or pipeline. Such persons shall be jointly liable to any person damaged.

 

      541.130 Right of way for ditches across state lands. The right of way to the extent specified in the Act of 1899, pages 172 to 180, Oregon Laws 1899, for the ditches, canals, flumes, pipelines, distributing ditches, and feeders of any person appropriating water under the provisions of that Act, across any and all lands belonging to the State of Oregon and not under contract of sale, is granted.

In any stream system where construction is contemplated by the United States under the Act of Congress approved June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388 to 390, and known as the Reclamation Act, the Water Resources Commission shall make a hydrographic survey of the stream system, and shall deliver an abstract thereof together with an abstract of all data necessary for the determination of all rights for the use of the waters of such system, to the Attorney General. The Attorney General, together with the district attorneys of the districts affected by the stream system shall, at the request of the Secretary of the Interior, enter suit on behalf of the State of Oregon, in the name of the state, for the determination of all rights for the use of the water, and shall diligently prosecute the same to a final adjudication. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §101]

 

      541.230 State lands within irrigated area; restrictions on sale; conveyance of lands needed by United States. No lands belonging to the state, within the areas to be irrigated from work constructed or controlled by the United States or its authorized agents, shall be sold except in conformity with the classification of farm units by the United States. The title of such land shall not pass from the state until the applicant therefor has fully complied with the provisions of the laws of the United States and the regulations thereunder concerning the acquisition of the right to use water from such works, and shall produce the evidence thereof duly issued. After the withdrawal of lands by the United States for any irrigation project, no application for the purchase of state lands within the limits of such withdrawal shall be accepted, except under the conditions prescribed in this section. Any state lands needed by the United States for irrigation works may, in the discretion of the Department of State Lands, be conveyed to it without charge. [Amended by 1967 c.79 §1]

 

      541.240 Right of way for ditches and canals; reservation in conveyances. There is granted over all the unimproved lands now or hereafter belonging to the state the necessary right of way for ditches, canals, and reservoir sites for irrigation purposes constructed by authority of the United States or otherwise. All conveyances of state land made after May 18, 1905, shall contain a reservation of such right of way and reservoir sites.

 

      541.250 Cession to United States not rescinded. Nothing in ORS 541.220 to 541.240 shall be construed as rescinding the cession by the state to the United States of lands, as provided in chapter 5, Oregon Laws 1905.

 

SUITS FOR DETERMINATION OF WATER RIGHTS UNDER 1905 ACT

 

      541.310 Suits for determination of rights; parties; survey of stream; disbursements. In any suit wherein the state is a party, for determination of a right to the use of the waters of any stream system, all who claim the right to use the waters shall be made parties. When any such suit has been filed the court shall call upon the Water Resources Commission to make or furnish a complete hydrographic survey of the stream system as provided in ORS 541.220, in order to obtain all data necessary to the determination of the rights involved. The disbursements made in litigating the rights involved in the suit shall be taxed by the court as in other equity suits. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §102]

 

      541.320 Decrees adjudicating rights; filing; statement as to matters adjudicated. Upon the adjudication of the rights to the use of the water of a stream system, a certified copy of the decree shall be prepared by the clerk of the court, without charge, and filed in the Water Resources Department.

(1) Pursuant to the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, a district may petition the Water Resources Commission for approval and acceptance of a district map indicating the location and use of the water rights within the district or any part thereof. The petition and map shall be in a form satisfactory to the commission and shall be certified by the district rather than a certified water right examiner. For a district that notifies the Water Resources Department under ORS 541.327 (4), the map must be submitted in an electronic format meeting the standards set by the department. The petition and map may not expand a water right of the district or its users beyond the total right of record of the district. If the district has met the requirements of ORS 541.325 to 541.331 and after the opportunity for hearing under ORS 541.331, the commission shall instruct the director to issue a new certificate to the district listing the requested locations and uses and retaining the original priority date. If the commission denies the petition, the commission shall hold a hearing on the denial. Notice and conduct of the hearing shall be under the provisions of ORS chapter 183 pertaining to contested cases. The hearing shall be conducted in the area where the right is located unless the parties and the persons who file the protest under this section stipulate otherwise.

      (2) The petition required under subsection (1) of this section shall be submitted on or before July 1, 1994, or before June 30, 2010, for a district notifying the department under ORS 541.327 (4), and shall include:

      (a) The name of the district and the certificate number of each water right contained in the petition.

      (b) The names of all users within the district whose lands are included in the petition.

      (c) A general description of the district boundaries.

      (d) A general description of the users’ land and all water rights per each parcel affected by the petition and the map. If the water right is on a tract of land of five acres or less, a notation of the acres of water right on the assessor’s tax map shall be sufficient for identification of the place of use and the extent of use.

      (e) A description of the use that is proposed to be made of the water on each parcel.

      (f) An affirmation by the petitioner that the map and petition are accurate to the best of the petitioner’s knowledge.

      (3) A petition submitted under this section shall contain no more acres of land than the least of the following:

      (a) The number of acres assessed by the district as of July 1, 1989;

      (b) The number of acres assessed by the district as of July 1, 1993; or

      (c) If a district notifies the department under ORS 541.327 (4), the number of acres assessed by the district as of December 31, 2003.

      (4) Before submitting a petition under subsection (2) of this section, the district shall send a notice to the user of every parcel whose right of record is to be altered, as evidenced by the district’s records. This notice shall be sent to the last-known address for the user with a return receipt requested. The notice shall include the number of acre-feet of water or its equivalent, for which the user is being assessed, a general description or tax lot of the land to which the water is assigned, a description of the use and a request for confirmation that the information in the notice is correct. Thirty days after the notice is mailed, the district shall prepare a petition and map as described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. Payment for water by the user or the user’s predecessor for a period of five years before the petition shall create a rebuttable presumption that the number of acres billed and paid by the user or the user’s predecessor is equal to the user’s water right.

      (5) Within 30 days after the commission issues a proposed order regarding the petition, the district shall send notice to the users of the district whose right of record is to be altered by the proposed order. This notice shall be sent to the last-known address of the user with a return receipt requested. The notice shall include the number of acres of land, or its equivalent, for which the user is being assessed, a general description or tax lot number of the land to which the water is assigned and a description of the use. In addition to the notice of the proposed order that the district sends to the users, the district shall publish at the same time notice in a newspaper having general circulation in the area in which the water rights are located for a period of at least two weeks. Not less than one publication in each week shall be made. The notice shall state:

      (a) The number of acres of water right that each parcel shall receive and the associated priority dates;

      (b) That the proposed map and order are available for inspection at the office of the district during normal business hours for a period of 60 days from the date of first publication;

      (c) That not less than 60 days after the date of first publication, the commission shall approve the petition and map and issue a final order unless a protest is filed or the petition does not meet the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section; and

      (d) That the user has the right to protest the proposed order and map as described in ORS 541.331.

      (6) If the commission returns a petition or map to a district for correction, the commission may prescribe a deadline for the petitioner to provide additional information or correct the petition or map. If the petitioner fails to meet the deadline prescribed by the commission, the commission may deny the petition. [1989 c.1000 §3; 1991 c.957 §13; 1993 c.818 §3; 2003 c.691 §2; 2011 c.52 §8]

 

      Note: See note under 541.325.

 

      541.331 Protest against approval of petition; hearing; issuance of water right certificate; land subject to inclusion. (1) Any user may file with the Water Resources Department, within 60 days after the date of first publication, under ORS 541.329, a protest against a proposed order approving the petition. Whenever a timely protest is filed or in the opinion of the Water Resources Director a hearing is necessary to determine whether the district has met the requirements of ORS 541.325 to 541.333 or the proposed changes described in the proposed order would result in injury to existing water rights, the department shall hold a hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be conducted according to the provisions of ORS chapter 183 applicable to contested cases. The hearing shall be held in the area where the rights are located unless the parties and the persons who filed the protest under this section stipulate otherwise.

      (2) If after examination or hearing, the department finds that the district has met the requirements of ORS 541.325 to 541.331 and that the changes described in the proposed order would not result in injury to existing water rights, the department shall issue a final order approving the petition and map as described in the proposed order. If a water right certificate for the water right has been issued previously, the department shall cancel the previous certificate and issue a new certificate that conforms to the final order and map and retains the original priority date.

      (3) A certificate issued under this section shall have the evidentiary effect provided for in ORS 537.270 except when the right to appropriate water described in the certificate is abandoned after the certificate is amended or issued.

      (4) The department may approve for inclusion in a new certificate under ORS 541.329 and this section only land which, on July 1, 1993, or, if a district notifies the department under ORS 541.327 (4), on December 31, 2003, is:

      (a) Land within the legal boundaries of the district as those boundaries were originally described or as they may have been changed by legally prescribed inclusion or exclusion proceedings.

      (b) Land for which inclusion in the district has been requested previously as prescribed by law.

      (c) Land on which a previously perfected water right has been applied beneficially and for which the user has been charged or assessed by the district in at least one of the last five years and for which the user is currently being charged or assessed. [1989 c.1000 §4; 1993 c.818 §4; 1995 c.554 §7; 1999 c.590 §1; 2003 c.691 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 541.325.

 

      541.333 Application for change of place of use, point of diversion or use; contents; form of map. (1) Whenever the owner of a water right for irrigation, domestic use, stock water storage or other use, for any reason desires to change the place of use, the point of diversion or the use made of the water under ORS 541.327, an application shall be filed with the Water Resources Department.

      (2) The application required under subsection (1) of this section shall include:

      (a) The name of the owner;

      (b) The previous use of the water;

      (c) A description of the premises upon which the water is used;

      (d) A description of the premises upon which it is proposed to use the water;

      (e) The use which is proposed to be made of the water;

      (f) The reasons for making the proposed change;

      (g) If the application is made under ORS 541.327 (1), evidence that the water has been used within the past five years upon lands owned or controlled by the owner of the water right;

      (h) In the event the application is made pursuant to ORS 541.327 (2), evidence that the water has been used within the past five years in the quarter quarter of a section; and

      (i) The approval of the district in which the water right is located.

      (3) The description of the premises or mapping required under ORS 541.329 (2) shall not require a map prepared by a certified water right examiner, but shall be in a form satisfactory to the Water Resources Commission. If the water right is on a tract of land of five acres or less, the assessor’s tax map with a notation of the acres of water right shall be sufficient for identification of the tract and place of use.

      (4) A certificate issued under this section has the evidentiary effect provided for in ORS 537.270 except when the right to appropriate water described in the certificate is abandoned after the certificate is amended or issued. [1989 c.1000 §5; 1995 c.554 §8]

      541.689 Projects requiring determination of seasonally varying flows; methodology. (1) The Water Resources Department shall make a determination as provided under subsection (2) of this section if an application for a loan or grant from the Water Supply Development Account is for a project that requires a water storage or aquifer recharge permit or limited license for the storage of water outside of the official irrigation season and:

      (a) Impounds surface water on a perennial stream;

      (b) Diverts water from a stream that supports state or federally listed sensitive, threatened or endangered fish species; or

      (c) Diverts more than 500 acre-feet of surface water annually.

      (2) The department shall review a completed application for a project described in subsection (1) of this section to determine whether the applicable seasonally varying flows have been established under this section for the stream of interest. If the department determines that the applicable seasonally varying flows have not previously been established, the department shall establish the seasonally varying flows before issuing a loan or grant from the account. The department may use account moneys to pay the cost of establishing a seasonally varying flow and to pay other costs directly related to project development.

      (3) The Water Resources Department shall establish any seasonally varying flows under subsection (2) of this section in consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and any affected Indian tribes. The Water Resources Department may rely upon existing scientific data and analysis or may fund new data and analysis. The Water Resources Department shall establish seasonally varying flows using a methodology established by Water Resources Commission rules.

      (4) If the department establishes applicable seasonally varying flows for the stream of interest, the department shall make the seasonally varying flows a condition of:

      (a) The new or existing water storage or aquifer recharge permit or limited license for the storage of water issued for any project described in subsection (1) of this section that receives a loan or grant from the account; and

      (b) The new or existing water storage or aquifer recharge permit or limited license for the storage of water issued for any subsequent project that:

      (A) Receives a loan or grant from the account;

      (B) Is for the storage of water outside of the official irrigation season; and

      (C) Has a diversion point that is subject to seasonally varying flows.

      (5) The applicant for or holder of a permit or license described in subsection (4)(b) of this section may request that the applicable seasonally varying flows established under subsection (2) of this section for the stream of interest be altered based upon new information. There is, however, a rebuttable presumption that existing applicable seasonally varying flows protect and maintain the biological, ecological and physical functions of the stream to the extent required by commission rules.

      (6) The department shall condition a water storage permit and resulting certificate, aquifer recharge permit and resulting certificate or limited license for a project that receives a grant or loan from the account and meets the other conditions described in subsection (4) of this section to protect the seasonally varying flow in effect at the time the loan or grant is issued for the project.

      (7) For purposes of any project that receives a loan or grant from the account and meets the other conditions described in subsection (4) of this section, the department shall use a seasonally varying flow methodology provided by commission rules in lieu of any other methodologies for determining seasonally varying flows or any methodologies for determining peak and ecological flows outside of the official irrigation season.

      (8) Subsections (1) to (7) of this section do not eliminate or alter any applicable standard for department review of an application to determine whether water is available for purposes of reviewing an application for a new water storage or aquifer recharge permit or a limited license for the storage of water.

      (6) That the commission may institute an appropriate action or suit to prevent use of the facilities of a water development project financed by the Water Development Fund by any person who is delinquent in the repayment of any moneys due the Water Development Administration and Bond Sinking Fund.

      (7) That a loan for a water development project is assignable or transferable to a third party only with the prior approval of the commission. The commission may approve a loan assignment or transfer only if the commission finds that the assignee or transferee qualifies as a water developer as defined in ORS 541.700 (7) and the assignment or transfer does not have serious adverse effect upon the family farm unit structure in this state. [1977 c.246 §6; 1981 c.166 §3; 1985 c.673 §116; 1999 c.212 §3; 2009 c.907 §7; 2013 c.784 §35]

 

      541.735 Payment of funds by State Treasurer pursuant to loan contract.

      541.740 Liens and other loan security; foreclosure; rules. (1)(a) When a loan is made to a water developer other than a water developer described in ORS 541.700 (7)(a), (b), (c) or (d) for the construction of a water development project under ORS 541.700 to 541.855, the State of Oregon has a lien for the amount of the unpaid balance of the loan. The lien created by this subsection attaches to the real property held in fee simple of the water developer or to the user charges, including interest, owed to or received by the water developer. The lien created by this subsection does not attach to a leasehold. At the discretion of the Water Resources Commission, the lien may attach to all real property, whether owned by the water developer or other persons, which is served by the water development project or which is served by a water source enhanced or restored by the water development project.

      (b) Except for tax liens, the lien created by this section is prior and superior to all other liens or encumbrances upon the affected real property or user charges, without regard to the date on which the other liens or encumbrances attached to the real property or user charges. However, the commission may elect to accept a second or parity lien position against the real property or user charges encumbered by this section, if the commission determines the lien position would provide adequate security for the water development loan, as set forth in rules adopted by the commission.

      (c) The existence or foreclosure of the lien created by this subsection shall not cause the acceleration of payment of user charges or other payments on affected real property. Such payments shall continue to be made as they become due.

      (2) When a loan is made under ORS 541.700 to 541.855 to a water developer described in ORS 541.700 (7)(a), (b), (c) or (d), the loan shall be secured by a mortgage or security agreement in the full amount of the loan. The mortgage or security agreement shall be a first lien, or a parity or second lien if the commission determines it would provide adequate security, upon such real property of the water developer as the commission shall require for adequate security.

      (3) When a lien created by subsection (1) of this section is foreclosed, a person whose real property is subject to the lien solely because that real property is irrigated or drained by reason of a water development project or because the real property is served by a water source improved by a water development project for watershed enhancement, shall only have that portion of real property subjected to foreclosure that represents that person’s pro rata share of the indebtedness.

      (4) When a loan is made to a water developer under ORS 541.700 to 541.855, the commission shall file notice of the loan with the recording officer of each county in which is situated real property of the water developer or real property to which the lien created by subsection (1) or (2) of this section may attach. The notice shall contain a description of the real property of the water developer, a description of any other real property that will be served by the water development project and to which the lien is to attach, the amount of the loan and a statement that the State of Oregon has a lien against such real property as provided in subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

      (5) Upon payment of all amounts loaned to a water developer pursuant to ORS 541.700 to 541.855, the commission shall file with each recording officer referred to in subsection (4) of this section a satisfaction notice that indicates repayment of the loan.

      (6) The commission may cause to be instituted appropriate proceedings to foreclose liens for delinquent loan payments, and shall pay the proceeds of any such foreclosure, less expenses incurred in foreclosing, into the Water Development Administration and Bond Sinking Fund. In a foreclosure proceeding, the commission may bid on property offered for sale in the proceeding and may acquire title to the property on behalf of the state.

      (7) The commission may take any action, make any disbursement, hold any funds or institute any action or proceeding necessary to protect the state’s interest.

      (8) Notwithstanding ORS 293.240, the commission may compromise, release, discharge, waive, cancel or settle a claim against a water developer if such action:

      (a) Is consistent with the purposes of ORS 541.700 to 541.855;

      (b) Does not impair the ability to pay the administrative expenses of the commission or the obligations of any bonds outstanding; and

      (c) Is, under the circumstances, the means most likely to preserve the claim or to recover the greatest part of the amount claimed.

      (9) The commission, by rule, may set out procedures to be used when a water developer is unable to make required loan payments because of illness, injury, death, involuntary job loss or economic stress due to factors beyond individual control. The rules shall be effective to the extent permitted by the terms of the contracts associated with affected loans. The rules:

      (a) May provide for a temporary reduction of loan payment;

      (b) May provide for any other solution jointly agreed to by the water developer and the commission;

      (c) Shall provide for repayment of the amount of any loan payments reduced under the rules in accordance with terms and conditions agreed upon by the borrower and the commission; and

      (d) Shall require the commission to consider the effect of any payment reduction or delay on the solvency of the program as a whole, on estimates of the most probable financial position of the program in the future and on other borrowers in the program.

      (10)(a) Upon application by a water developer, the commission may grant a partial release of security when the commission determines that granting the requested release will not jeopardize the water development loan program’s security position.

      (b) The remaining property must qualify as security for the loan balance under the applicable law.

      (c) Notwithstanding compliance with paragraph (b) of this subsection, the commission may require that the loan balance be reduced as consideration for granting the requested release. [1977 c.246 §8; 1981 c.166 §4; 1985 c.673 §118; 1987 c.636 §4; 1989 c.950 §3; 1999 c.212 §4; 2009 c.907 §8; 2013 c.784 §36]

 

      541.741 Recovery of certain interest amounts. The Water Resources Commission shall not attempt to recover interest amounts credited or paid before January 1, 1986, to any water developer who borrowed moneys under ORS 541.700 to 541.855 and shall adjust the borrower’s account balance as necessary to reflect those credits as lawful payments on the borrower’s contractual obligations to the state. [1989 c.950 §2]

 

      Note: 541.741 was added to and made a part of ORS 541.700 to 541.855 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      541.745 Remedies of commission when water developer fails to comply with contract. If a water developer fails to comply with a contract entered into with the Water Resources Commission for construction and repayment as provided in ORS 541.730, the commission, in addition to remedies provided in ORS 541.740, may seek other appropriate legal remedies to secure the loan and may contract with any other water developer as provided in ORS 541.730 for continuance of construction and for repayment of moneys from the Water Development Fund used to continue construction and interest on the moneys. [1977 c.246 §8; 1981 c.166 §4; 1985 c.673 §119]

 

      541.750 Repayment of moneys to Water Development Administration and Bond Sinking Fund. Any water developer that enters into a contract with the Water Resources Commission for construction and repayment as provided in ORS 541.730 or 541.745 may obtain moneys for repayment to the Water Development Administration and Bond Sinking Fund under the contract in the same manner as other moneys are obtained for other authorized purposes. The commission may also provide by contract or otherwise, for the construction, operation and maintenance of a water development project until the project is assumed by such new water developer. Moneys in the Water Development Fund may be used for such construction, operation and maintenance, and if so used, shall be repaid to the Water Development Administration and Bond Sinking Fund by the contracting water developer. [1977 c.246 §10; 1985 c.673 §120]

      541.756 Projects obtaining other funds for construction; repayment of funds loaned by state. Except as provided in ORS 541.760:

      (1) If any water development project investigated under ORS 541.700 to 541.855, other than a safe drinking water project financed in whole or in part from moneys in the Special Public Works Fund created by ORS 285B.455 or the Water Fund created by ORS 285B.563, is constructed with funds other than those loaned under ORS 541.700 to 541.855, the amount expended by the state shall immediately become due and payable, together with interest at the rate provided in ORS 541.730 (2) from the date of notification of the amount due.

      (2) If any water development project is refinanced or financial assistance is obtained from other sources, other than a safe drinking water project financed in whole or in part from moneys in the Special Public Works Fund created by ORS 285B.455 or the Water Fund created by ORS 285B.563, after the execution of the loan from the state, all such funds shall be first used to repay the state.

If a water development project has any secondary use, and if the water developer receives from any source other than the Water Development Fund any funds to assist in the construction, operation or maintenance of such secondary use, the amount of the loan to the water developer from the Water Development Fund shall be limited to that amount necessary for the construction of those portions of the project not funded by other sources. [1977 c.246 §15]

 

      541.765 Authorization for loans for certain federal projects.

(The Oregon Plan)

 

      541.895 Legislative findings; principles of Oregon Plan; policy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) The long-term protection of the water resources of this state, including sustainable watershed functions, is an essential component of Oregon’s environmental and economic stability and growth;

      (b) Each watershed in Oregon is unique, requiring different management techniques and programs;

      (c) Management techniques and programs for the protection and enhancement of watersheds can be most effective and efficient when voluntarily initiated at the local level;

      (d) Cooperative partnerships between affected private individuals, interested citizens, tribes and representatives of local, state and federal agencies may improve opportunities to achieve the protection, enhancement and restoration of the state’s watersheds; and

      (e) The establishment of such cooperative partnerships should be encouraged by local individuals, local organizations and representatives of state agencies.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly declares that the Oregon Plan for integrating regulatory efforts while fostering incentives and voluntary action for environmental stewardship should be founded upon the following principles:

      (a) Promoting collaboration and partnerships among local, state, regional, tribal and federal governments and private individuals and organizations;

      (b) Establishing clear, technically defensible, practicable and achievable recovery and restoration objectives;

      (c) Assessing the conditions in each watershed to determine the quality of the existing environment, to identify the causes for declines in habitat, fish and wildlife populations and water quality, and to assist with the development of locally integrated action plans for watersheds that will achieve agreed-upon protection and restoration objectives;

      (d) Coordinating implementation of integrated watershed action plans;

      (e) Monitoring and ensuring implementation of the integrated watershed action plans using adaptive management to make appropriate changes in action plans and goals as needed; and

      (f) Establishing funding priorities across basins based on the value of programs and projects for watershed and habitat recovery.

      (3) It is the policy of the State of Oregon that:

      (a) Voluntary programs initiated at the local level to protect and enhance the quality and stability of watersheds are a high priority of the state and should be encouraged;

      (b) State agencies are encouraged to respond cooperatively to local watershed protection and enhancement efforts and coordinate their respective activities with other state agencies and affected local, regional, tribal and federal governments and private landowners to the greatest degree practicable; and

      (c) State agencies responding to local watershed protection and enhancement efforts are encouraged to foster local watershed planning, protection and enhancement efforts before initiating respective action within a watershed. [Formerly 541.353]

 

      Note: See note under 541.890.

 

      541.898 Oregon Plan described; goals; elements; Governor to negotiate with federal government. (1) As used in this section when referring to salmonid recovery:

      (a) “Listed unit” means one population or a group of populations of a species, such as an evolutionarily significant unit, that has been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205), as amended, or under ORS 496.171 to 496.192.

      (b) “Native fish” means a fish indigenous to Oregon and not introduced. Naturally produced fish and hatchery produced fish are both native fish if the fish are indigenous to Oregon and not introduced.

      (c) “Naturally produced” means a fish that reproduces and completes its full life cycle in its natural habitat. Naturally produced progeny of hatchery fish are naturally produced.

      (d) “Population” means a group of fish that:

      (A) Originates and reproduces in a particular area at a particular time;

      (B) Does not interbreed to any substantial degree with any other group reproducing in a different area or in the same area at a different time; and

      (C) Is composed of naturally produced fish, hatchery produced fish or a combination of both.

      (e) “Recovery” means that a proportion of the constituent populations of naturally produced native fish belonging to a listed unit are sufficiently abundant, productive and diverse in life histories and distribution such that the listed unit as a whole is likely to be self-sustaining into the foreseeable future.

      (f) “Self-sustaining” means having a sufficient proportion and distribution of constituent populations:

      (A) Likely to survive prolonged periods of habitat, oceanic, climatic and environmental conditions that are detrimental to a population; and

      (B) Having habitat of sufficient quality and quantity likely to provide survival rates adequate to maintain associated ecological, cultural and economic benefits.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds that the efforts of many Oregonians have resulted in the creation of the Oregon Plan, and recognizes that the Oregon Plan is guided by the following mission and goals:

      (a) The mission of the Oregon Plan is to restore the watersheds of Oregon and to recover the fish and wildlife populations of those watersheds to productive and sustainable levels in a manner that provides substantial ecological, cultural and economic benefits.

      (b) The goals of the Oregon Plan that guide the citizens of Oregon in achieving the mission of the Oregon Plan are the:

      (A) Establishment and maintenance of an infrastructure that provides long-term continuity in leadership, direction and oversight of watershed restoration and species recovery.

      (B) Continued opportunity for a wide range of natural resource uses that are consistent with watershed restoration and species recovery.

      (C) Implementation of existing laws and environmental regulations to achieve the mission before enacting new laws and environmental regulations.

      (D) Development and maintenance of funding for programs to protect and restore watersheds.

      (E) Development of expectations for the sustainability of interrelated natural resources that accurately reflect a scientific understanding of the physical and biological constraints of the ecosystem.

      (F) Enhancement of habitat available to support healthy populations of fish and wildlife throughout the state.

      (G) Production of populations of threatened or endangered species to achieve levels of natural production consistent with overall restoration goals.

      (H) Establishment of a science-based system that supports evaluation of the Oregon Plan and provides a basis for making appropriate future changes to management programs.

      (I) Coordination of activities and programs among federal, state and local governments and other entities.

      (J) Use of voluntary and collaborative processes to achieve the mission of the Oregon Plan whenever possible.

      (3) The Oregon Plan is a comprehensive program for the protection and recovery of species and for the restoration of watersheds throughout this state.

(Watershed Enhancement Program)

 

      541.923 Watershed management program; project funding; high priority watersheds. (1) The Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board shall initiate a watershed management program that relies on the establishment of voluntary local watershed councils comprised of residents, state and federal agency staff, members of federally recognized Indian tribes and other citizens interested in the management of watersheds and that provides for the development by these partnerships of local plans that may include but are not limited to the assessment of the watershed condition, the creation of a watershed action plan and a strategy for implementing the action plan. The program shall focus state resources on the achievement of sustainable watershed health, including funding major projects that contribute to the overall health of a watershed. In addition, the board shall fund smaller, voluntary projects for watershed enhancement and for restoration of riparian areas and associated uplands.

      (2) In carrying out the program under subsection (1) of this section, the board may designate high priority watersheds. However, the designation of high priority watersheds is intended only as a management tool for state agencies in allocating resources to support coordinated watershed management activities. Such designation is not intended to establish or confer any right, duty or authority, nor to have any legal significance beyond that described in this section, nor to discourage or prohibit the formation and function of voluntary local watershed councils in other watersheds.

      (3) The elected officials representing the appropriate local government groups containing or within a proposed watershed council area shall determine whether to participate in the voluntary formation of a local watershed council. When multiple local government groups are involved within an area that would be served by a watershed council, the affected local government groups shall together determine their respective roles and the appropriate method for appointing members to a local watershed council.
