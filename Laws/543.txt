      Note: 543.013 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 543 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      543.014 [2007 c.212 §2; 2009 c.405 §§1,2; repealed by 2015 c.386 §15]

 

      543.015 Policy. The Legislative Assembly declares that it is the policy of the State of Oregon:

      (1) To protect the natural resources of this state from possible adverse impacts caused by the use of the waters of this state for the development of hydroelectric power.

      (2) To permit siting of hydroelectric projects subject to strict standards established to protect the natural resources of Oregon.

      (3) To require the Water Resources Commission, the Energy Facility Siting Council, the Department of Environmental Quality and other affected state agencies to participate to the fullest extent in any local, state or federal proceedings related to hydroelectric power development in order to protect the natural resources of Oregon. [1985 c.569 §2]

 

      543.017 Minimum standards for development of hydroelectric power; public interest considerations; rules. (1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in ORS 543.015, the following minimum standards shall apply to any action of the Water Resources Commission relating to the development of hydroelectric power in Oregon:

      (a) The anadromous salmon and steelhead resources of Oregon shall be preserved. The commission shall not approve activity that may result in mortality or injury to anadromous salmon and steelhead resources or loss of natural habitat of any anadromous salmon and steelhead resources except when an applicant proposes to modify an existing facility or project in such a manner that can be shown to restore, enhance or improve anadromous fish populations within that river system.

      (b) Any activity related to hydroelectric development shall be consistent with the provisions of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program providing for the protection, mitigation and enhancement of the fish and wildlife resources of the region as adopted by the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council pursuant to Public Law 96-501.

      (c) Except as provided in this paragraph, no activity may be approved that results in a net loss of wild game fish or recreational opportunities. If a proposed activity may result in a net loss of any of the above resources, the commission may allow mitigation if the commission finds the proposed mitigation in the project vicinity is acceptable. Proposed mitigation that may result in a wild game fish population, or the fishery the wild game fish population provides, being converted to a hatchery dependent resource is not acceptable mitigation. A water dependent recreational opportunity must be mitigated by another water dependent recreational opportunity. Mitigation of water dependent recreational opportunities that, in the judgment of the commission, are of statewide significance with a recreational opportunity that is readily available on other waters of this state is not acceptable mitigation. In deciding whether mitigation is acceptable, the commission shall consult with other local, state and federal agencies.

      (d) Other natural resources in the project vicinity, including water quality, wildlife, scenic and aesthetic values, and historic, cultural and archaeological sites, shall be maintained or enhanced. No activity may be approved that, in the judgment of the commission after balancing gains and losses to all affected natural resources, may result in a net loss of natural resources. In determining whether the proposed activity may result in a net loss of natural resources, the commission may consider mitigation if the commission determines the proposed mitigation in the project vicinity is acceptable. Mitigation may include appropriate measures considered necessary to meet the net loss standard. In determining whether mitigation is acceptable, the commission shall consult with appropriate state, federal and local agencies.

      (e) In determining whether it is in the public interest to allocate water for a proposed hydroelectric development, the commission shall consider present and future power needs and shall make a finding on the need for the power. For a hydroelectric project with a nominal electric generating capacity of 25 megawatts or more, the Water Resources Commission shall consider any recommendation by the Energy Facility Siting Council. The Energy Facility Siting Council’s recommendation shall be based solely on information contained in the hearing record of the Water Resources Commission. The commission’s order on the proposed hydroelectric development shall describe the Energy Facility Siting Council’s recommendations on the need for the power. If the commission’s decision on the need for power is contrary to the Energy Facility Siting Council’s recommendation, the commission’s order shall explain the commission’s failure to follow the recommendation of the Energy Facility Siting Council. The commission also shall consult with the Energy Facility Siting Council on other matters within the expertise of the Energy Facility Siting Council.

      (2) The commission shall adopt all necessary rules to carry out the policy set forth in ORS 543.015 and to implement the minimum standards set forth in subsection (1) of this section. In the absence of implementing rules, any action of the commission relating to hydroelectric development shall comply with the standards as set forth in this section.

      (3) Nothing in this section limits the authority of any state agency to make recommendations regarding appropriate license conditions during the consideration of the issuance of a license or permit for an existing hydroelectric project. [1985 c.569 §3; 1993 c.544 §6; 1995 c.229 §2; 2007 c.71 §176]

      (6) Perform all acts, exercise all powers and issue all orders which, in the judgment and discretion of the commission, are necessary to effectuate the purposes of ORS 543.010 to 543.610. [Amended by 1955 c.673 §3; 1955 c.707 §39; 1961 c.224 §13; 1985 c.673 §140; 1995 c.229 §3]

 

      543.055 Hearings and witnesses. (1) The Water Resources Commission may hold hearings and take testimony orally, by deposition or in such other form as the commission considers satisfactory, either within or without this state. The Water Resources Commission may require, by subpoena, the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence.

      (2) An administrative law judge assigned from the Office of Administrative Hearings established under ORS 183.605, shall conduct any contested case hearing that the commission is required or permitted by law to hold. The administrative law judge has the same powers with respect to the conduct of the hearing as are granted by law to the commission, including the taking of testimony, the signing and issuance of subpoenas and the administering of oaths and affirmations to witnesses. The administrative law judge shall keep a record of the proceedings on the hearing and shall transmit such record to the commission.

      (3) The commission may designate any person to take the testimony, affidavit or deposition of a witness. The person so designated may administer an oath or affirmation to any such witness and take the testimony thereof in accordance with such rules as the commission may prescribe.

      (4) Witnesses appearing before the commission or any person designated by the commission to take testimony shall be paid the fees and mileage provided for witnesses in ORS 44.415 (2). [1955 c.673 §2; 1961 c.224 §14; 1985 c.673 §141; 1989 c.980 §15; 1999 c.849 §§112,113; 2003 c.75 §46]

      543.078 Annual fee for hydroelectric project. (1) On or before January 1 of each year, each holder shall pay to the State of Oregon an annual fee for each hydroelectric project that is subject to this section. The annual fee required by this section shall be based on the theoretical horsepower specified in the water right for each project.

      (2) The amount of the annual fee required under subsection (1) of this section shall be determined in the following manner:

      (a) Subject to the schedule set forth in subsection (3) of this section, each holder shall pay an amount, in 1998 dollars, equal to $0.405 per theoretical horsepower covered by the water right for the holder’s hydroelectric project. The annual fee may be set forth in the water right or may be established by order of the Water Resources Director and shall be adjusted annually for inflation according to rules established by the Water Resources Commission. The annual fee also may be adjusted through the periodic review process established in ORS 543.085.

      (b) Each holder of a hydroelectric project that produces 123.5 theoretical horsepower or less shall pay an annual fee of $50 for that project.

      (3) The fee determined in subsection (2) of this section shall apply to a project on the January 1 following the occurrence of an event enumerated as follows:

      (a) A licensee or water right certificant shall begin to pay the annual fee after the final order for the reauthorized water right is issued under ORS 543A.130.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, if a licensee holds, on October 23, 1999, an original state hydroelectric license for which the original expiration date was or is more than five years after the expiration date of the original Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for the project, the licensee shall begin payment of the annual fee established under this section after the expiration date of the original state hydroelectric license.

      (c) A power claimant, or uncertificated claimant, licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall begin to pay the annual fee after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues a new license. A power claimant or uncertificated claimant that received a new license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission within 10 years prior to October 23, 1999, shall begin to pay the annual fee on January 1, 2000.

      (d) A power claimant, or uncertificated claimant, whose project is exempted from licensure by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or not licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall begin paying the annual fee under this section on January 1, 2008, for that project.

      (4) No fee shall be assessed under ORS 543.710 for a project subject to an annual fee under this section. [1999 c.873 §5]

 

      543.080 Project specific fees; summary of project specific expenditures. (1) In addition to the annual fee set forth in ORS 543.078, a holder may be required to pay project specific fees.

      (2) Project specific fees are fees that compensate a state agency for the agency’s reasonable and necessary oversight of a holder’s implementation of the protection, mitigation and enhancement measures included in a water right for the project, a certificate issued pursuant to ORS 468B.040 or 468B.045 or a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license.

      (3) Project specific fees shall be considered at the time of reauthorization or relicensing of a hydroelectric project and, if needed, shall be established before the proposed final order is issued under ORS 543A.115, and shall be included in the reauthorized water right or the certificate issued pursuant to ORS 468B.040 or 468B.045. In the case of power claims and uncertificated claims, project specific fees shall be considered at the time of relicensing and, if needed, shall be included in an order of the Water Resources Director amending the claim pursuant to ORS 543.092 or in a certificate issued for the project pursuant to ORS 468B.040 or 468B.045.

      (4) The need for, and amount of, a project specific fee shall be based upon the following factors:

      (a) Experimental or unproven nature of the proposed mitigation;

      (b) Significance of the resource affected;

      (c) Need for ongoing agency involvement in reviewing the effectiveness of the proposed measure;

      (d) Need for agency personnel to perform field work or research efforts; and

      (e) Overall nature of the protection, mitigation or enhancement measures, including but not limited to consideration of whether the measure is simple, complex, closed-ended or adaptive and whether the measure is determined solely by the holder or by an agency or public committee.

      (5) A project specific fee may not be assessed for:

      (a) Work on projects other than the project for which the fee is established;

      (b) Work that is paid for by the annual hydroelectric fee;

      (c) Development of statewide hydroelectric policy;

      (d) Coordination of statewide activities within an agency;

      (e) Costs to the agency of Attorney General assistance associated with ongoing litigation; or

      (f) Routine monitoring of compliance with nonadaptive management provisions of the water right, an uncertificated claim, a certificate issued pursuant to ORS 468B.040 or 468B.045 or a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license.

      (6) A project specific fee shall be time-limited. One year before expiration of a project specific fee, the holder and any affected agency shall review the need, if any, to modify, extend or terminate the project specific fee. After such review, the agency shall propose a fee modification, extension or termination. Any dispute regarding the proposed fee action shall be referred to an independent fact finder selected by mutual agreement, whose costs shall be borne one-half by the holder and one-half by the agency. The fact finder shall review whether the proposed fee action is appropriate under and consistent with the criteria set forth in subsections (2), (4) and (5) of this section. The fact finder shall not review the substance of the protection, mitigation and enhancement measures contained in the water right, the uncertificated claim, the certificate issued pursuant to ORS 468B.040 or 468B.045 or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license. The fact finder shall forward its determination in writing to the holder and agency. Upon receipt and consideration of the fact finder’s determination, the agency shall notify the holder whether the project specific fee is modified, extended or terminated. If the holder is dissatisfied with the fee action, the holder may request administrative or judicial review in accordance with statutes or rules applicable to a particular agency’s fee action. The written determination of the fact finder shall be admissible in any such administrative or judicial hearing. Notwithstanding any other law, a presumption shall exist in favor of the determination of the fact finder and the burden shall be on the party seeking a fee action contrary to the determination of the fact finder to demonstrate that a different fee action is justified under this section.

      (7) Subject to subsections (2) to (5) of this section, the amount of a project specific fee shall be established based on an estimate of the cost to the agency of the labor, supplies and overhead expended by the agency in providing reasonable and necessary oversight of a holder’s implementation of the protection, mitigation and enhancement measures included in the water right, the uncertificated claim, the certificate issued pursuant to ORS 468B.040 or 468B.045 or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license. The estimate used to derive a project specific fee amount shall be determined by using increments of not more than 0.25 full-time equivalents.

The Water Resources Department shall impose as a condition to any water right permit to appropriate water for hydroelectric purposes granted under ORS 537.211 or any license granted under ORS 543.260 that the person operating the hydroelectric project shall, during the operational lifetime of the project, perform or allow the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to perform, any tests or studies required by the department to evaluate the effectiveness of measures for the protection of fish. The scope and cost of these studies will be negotiated between the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the operator. [1985 c.674 §6; 1987 c.158 §116; 1995 c.416 §40]

 

      Note: 543.265 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 543 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      543.270 Preference in granting permit or license; municipal use. In issuing preliminary permits, and in issuing licenses where no preliminary permit is held by an applicant for a license, preference shall be given to the application which appears to the Water Resources Commission to be best adapted to conserve and utilize the water power involved. However, any application for the use of water made by any municipal corporation of this state under any law of the state, before a preliminary permit is issued, or before a license is issued when no preliminary permit upon the proposed project has been issued, shall always have preference. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §151]

 

      543.280 Fee payments by licensee. (1) Any person who applies to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a preliminary permit to operate a hydroelectric project shall, at the same time, apply for a state preliminary permit. An applicant for a state preliminary permit for a new hydroelectric project shall submit to the Water Resources Commission a complete copy of any application for the project filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other federal agency. For preliminary permits, if the copy of the federal application is filed with the commission at the same time it is filed with the federal agency, at the commission’s discretion, such copy may fulfill the requirements of ORS 543.210, except for the fee requirement in ORS 543.210 (4).

      (2) An applicant for a preliminary permit or license for a project or for a permit to appropriate water for power purposes shall pay to the state a project fee based on the capacity of the project to cover costs of recording, publishing notices, conducting the hearing required by ORS 543.225 and making investigations necessary to determine whether a permit should be granted.

      (3) The amount of the total project fee required under subsection (2) of this section shall be:

      (a) For a project of less than 100 theoretical horsepower, $1,000.

      (b) For any project of 100 theoretical horsepower or more, an amount equal to $5,000 plus $1,000 per megawatt for each megawatt of capacity in excess of five megawatts, up to a maximum of $100,000.

      (4) Except for projects of less than 100 theoretical horsepower, the project fee required under subsection (2) of this section shall be payable in advance before each of four stages of project review as established by rule by the Water Resources Commission. The payment schedule shall not require the applicant to pay more than $2,500 of the project fee at the first stage of project review or more than 50 percent of the total project fee in the first two stages of the project review. For a project of less than 100 theoretical horsepower, the applicant shall pay 50 percent of the fee at the time of filing the application for a preliminary permit or application for a permit to appropriate water for power purposes and the remaining 50 percent before the commission issues a license or a water right permit. A person may withdraw an application for a hydroelectric project after any stage of project review without further payment of fees under this section.

      (5) In addition to the project fee required under subsection (2) of this section, any applicant for a project to be sited at a location where anadromous fish or threatened or endangered species are present shall pay a surcharge of 30 percent of the total project fee. The surcharge shall be collected in conjunction with the project fee at each stage of the project review.

      (6) The commission shall provide an applicant a statement itemizing the staff time, resources and costs expended to review the application at each project stage. The statement shall include the costs expended by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Water Resources Department specific to the project. [Amended by 1957 c.581 §1; 1985 c.673 §152; 1991 c.869 §9]

 

      543.290 Filing of maps, plans, estimates and other materials; incorporation as part of license; alteration; further statements and data. The applicant for a license shall submit to and file with the Water Resources Commission:

      (1) All maps, plans, specifications and cost estimates as may be required by the commission for a full understanding of the proposed project. The maps, plans and specifications, when approved by the commission, shall become a part of the license, if one is issued upon the application, and thereafter no change shall be made in any such maps, plans and specifications until the proposed change has been approved by the commission. When a proposed change is approved by the commission, the changes shall become a part of the license.

      (2) Any further statements and data as may be required by the commission concerning the proposed project, the market to be served, the financial responsibility of the applicant, the plan of financing and any other matters deemed material by the commission. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §153]

 

      543.300 Conditions governing license; fees; waiver of conditions. Any license issued under ORS 543.010 to 543.610 shall take into consideration, and shall be on, the following conditions:

      (1) That the proposed project shall be such as, in the judgment of the Water Resources Commission, is well adapted to the development and utilization of the water power involved.

      (2) That the licensee shall construct and build the project according to the maps, plans and specifications filed with and approved by the commission, and within the time fixed by the license or by any lawful extension thereof.

      (3) The operations of the licensee so far as they affect the use, storage and discharge from storage of waters affected by the license, shall at all times be controlled by such reasonable rules as the commission may prescribe for the protection of life, health and property, and in the interest of the fullest practicable conservation and utilization of such waters for power purposes and for other beneficial public uses, including recreational purposes. The licensee shall release water from the project reservoir at such rate in cubic feet per second, or such volume in acre-feet per specified period of time, as the commission may prescribe.

      (4) That the licensee will maintain the project, and each part thereof, in good order and repair and in efficient operation, for the development and transmission of electricity to its reasonable capacity; shall make all necessary renewals and replacements as required; and shall maintain and operate the project, and all parts thereof, conformably to the rules of the commission not inconsistent with ORS 543.010 to 543.610.

      (5) That the licensee will pay to the state annually not more than $1 for each horsepower covered by the license. This sum shall constitute a first lien upon the project, which lien may be enforced by suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, or payment thereof may be enforced by the state in an action for debt. Payment of such license fees may be waived by the commission during all or any part of the period of construction. The fees need not be uniform throughout the entire period of the license, but may be for different amounts for different periods. The amount of the license fees, within the minimum and maximum limits herein specified, shall be determined by the commission and expressed in the license.

      (6) Other and further conditions not inconsistent with ORS 543.010 to 543.610 as the commission may require in the public interest.

      (7) In issuing a license for a minor project of not more than 100 horsepower the commission may waive all or any of the conditions and requirements of ORS 543.010 to 543.610 except the period for which a license may be issued, and the annual charge as determined by the commission under subsection (5) of this section. In issuing licenses for projects in excess of 100 horsepower for which the applicants are required to secure permits and licenses from the United States as a condition precedent to the construction of the projects, the commission may waive and modify such of the terms, conditions and requirements of ORS 543.010 to 543.610, except the period for which a license may be issued and the annual charge as determined by the commission under subsection (5) of this section, as the commission, by order, after full investigation and public hearing, shall find to make impracticable the construction of such projects. During the time that a licensee is not a public utility and does not sell electric energy, and does not sell bonds or other evidences of debt against the licensee’s plant, the commission may waive the accounting and amortization requirements of ORS 543.010 to 543.610, even where the project involved exceeds 100 horsepower.

      (8) Subsection (5) of this section does not apply to a water right reauthorized pursuant to ORS chapter 543A. [Amended by 1959 c.560 §1; 1961 c.224 §19; 1985 c.673 §154; 1999 c.873 §23]

 

      543.310 Disposition of moneys collected. Except as provided in ORS 536.015, all moneys collected under the provisions of ORS 543.010 to 543.610 shall forthwith be paid to the State Treasurer and become a part of the General Fund. [Amended by 1985 c.674 §10; 1991 c.869 §10]

 

      543.320 Effect of amendment or repeal of law. The right to alter, amend or repeal ORS 543.010 to 543.610, or any part thereof, hereby is expressly reserved; but no such alteration, amendment or repeal shall affect any license theretofore issued under the provisions of ORS 543.010 to 543.610, or the rights of any licensee thereunder, unless expressly assented to by the licensee.

(1) The licensee shall commence the construction of the project works within the time fixed in the license, which shall not be more than two years from the date thereof, shall thereafter in good faith and with due diligence prosecute such construction, and shall, within the time fixed in the license, complete and put into operation such part of the ultimate development as the Water Resources Commission considers necessary to supply the reasonable needs of the then available market, and shall, from time to time thereafter construct such portion of the balance of the development as the commission directs, so as to supply adequately the reasonable market demands until development is completed.

      (2) The period for commencement of construction may be extended once but not longer than two additional years, and the period for the completion of construction carried on in good faith and with reasonable diligence may be extended by the commission when not incompatible with the public interests.

      (3) If the licensee does not commence actual construction of the project works or of any specified part of the project works, within the time prescribed in the license or as extended by the commission, then, after due notice given, the license shall, as to the project works or part of the project works, be terminated upon written order of the commission. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §155]

 

      543.420 Noncompletion of construction within prescribed time; judicial proceedings; sale of property; disposition of proceeds; rights of purchaser. If construction of a project under license has been begun but has not been completed within the time prescribed in the license or in any lawful extension thereof, then the Attorney General, upon request of the Water Resources Commission, shall institute proceedings in the circuit court for the county in which some part of the project is situated, for termination of the rights of the licensee under the license, the sale of the property embraced in the project, and for such other relief as the case may demand. Any judgment or decree entered in the proceeding shall provide for distribution of the proceeds of the sale to the parties equitably entitled thereto. The purchaser at any such sale shall take the property subject to all the terms and conditions of the license under which construction was begun, except insofar as they may be modified by the commission. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §156]

 

      543.430 Proceedings after completion of project for violation of license terms; authority of court; sale of project. The Attorney General shall, upon request of the Water Resources Commission, institute proceedings in the circuit court for the county in which any project, or the major part of a project is situated, after the project has been completed, for the purpose of revoking for violation of its terms any license issued under ORS 543.010 to 543.610, or for the purpose of correcting or remedying by injunction, mandamus or other appropriate writ or decree, any act by the licensee in violation of the terms of those sections, or of any rule or order of the commission. The court shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and may issue and execute all necessary process to compel compliance with the terms of any license, the terms of ORS 543.010 to 543.610, the lawful orders and rules of the commission. If a decree revoking a license is entered, the court may sell the whole, or any part, of a project under the license; wind up the business of the licensee conducted in connection with the project; distribute the proceeds to the parties equitably entitled thereto; and make and enforce such further orders and decrees as equity and justice may require. At any such sale the purchaser shall take the rights and privileges belonging to the licensee and shall perform all the duties of the licensee under the license. The remedies provided by this section are in addition to the remedies otherwise provided by ORS 543.010 to 543.610. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §157]

 

      543.440 Transfer of license, rights or property; effect. No voluntary transfer of any license or any rights under a license or of any property acquired, constructed or operated pursuant to license issued under ORS 543.010 to 543.610 shall be made without written approval of the Water Resources Commission. Any successor or assignee of any licensee under any project acquired, constructed or operated by licensee, whether by voluntary transfer approved by the commission or sale upon foreclosure, execution or otherwise, shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the license and of the provisions of ORS 543.010 to 543.610 to the same extent as though the successor or assignee was the original licensee thereunder. Any mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien suffered or created upon any such project shall be subject and subordinate to all the terms and conditions of ORS 543.010 to 543.610. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to any transfer, voluntary or involuntary, to the state or any municipal corporation thereof, and upon such transfer the license shall terminate. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §158]

      543.525 ORS 543.530 to 543.550 not applicable to regulated utilities. The provisions of ORS 543.530 to 543.550 shall not apply to any licensee which is a utility as defined in ORS 757.005 and regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon. [1965 c.333 §1]

 

      Note: 543.525 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 543 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      543.530 Issuance by licensee of stocks, bonds or other interest without authorization of Water Resources Commission prohibited. (1) No licensee shall issue any share of corporate stock, or any bond, or other evidence of interest in or indebtedness of the licensee, or assume any obligation or liability as lessor, lessee, guarantor, indorser, surety or otherwise, in respect of the corporate shares, bonds or other evidence of indebtedness of any person in connection with the financing, acquisition, construction, maintenance or operation of any project, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the licensee, and after investigation by the Water Resources Commission of the purposes and uses of the proposed issue and the proceeds thereof, or of the proposed assumption of obligation or liability, the commission, by order, authorizes the issue or assumption. The commission shall make the order only if the commission finds that the issue or assumption:

      (a) Is for some lawful object of the licensee, compatible with the public interest, and is necessary to, or appropriate for, the proper performance by the licensee of the terms and conditions of the license and will not impair the licensee’s ability to perform the terms and conditions; and

      (b) Is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purposes.

      (2) The commission may grant or deny the application to authorize the issue or assumption, or grant the same in part and deny in part, and may modify the provisions of any previous order and prescribe such terms and conditions as the commission considers necessary or appropriate in the premises. Every such application shall be made in such form and contain such data as the commission by rule may prescribe.

No bonds, notes or other obligations or securities or corporate stock shall be issued in connection with the financing, construction or acquisition of any project or part of a project, under a license issued pursuant to ORS 543.010 to 543.610, except for cash or property. If issued for property, the price or value at which the property is to be acquired by the licensee and made a part of any such project must be submitted to and approved by the Water Resources Commission before it is purchased or acquired. All corporate shares issued in connection with any such project shall have a nominal or par value. All bonds, notes or other obligations or securities, and all shares of corporate stock issued or sold by any licensee in connection with the acquisition, construction or financing of any project, or part of a project, shall be issued or sold or used in the purchase or acquisition of property at the full face or nominal value thereof, unless the commission consents to and approves the sale for cash, or the use of cash in the purchase or acquisition of property at a discount from the face or nominal value of the property. Any discount so approved and consented to shall be considered a part of the cost of financing. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §160]

 

      543.550 Liens prohibited; exceptions; what may be included by mortgage, trust deed, or sale; determination of investment in case of sale of part. No lien for labor, services, materials, machinery or equipment shall exist or be acquired or enforced upon any property acquired, constructed or made a part of any project under license issued pursuant to ORS 543.010 to 543.610. No property shall be put into or made part of any such project unless owned by the licensee free and clear of all liens and claims whatsoever, except a lien created by the licensee upon the whole property embraced in the project by mortgage or deed of trust, to the end that the entire property embraced in the project be kept and maintained as an indivisible whole. The mortgage or deed of trust may include other property. Any voluntary sale or any sale upon a judgment of foreclosure, execution or otherwise, shall be of the whole property embraced in the project unless the Water Resources Commission, by an order in writing, consents to and approves of a sale of a part of the property. If less than the whole of any property embraced in a project is sold with the consent and approval of the commission, the commission shall determine at the time of the sale the actual net investment in the part sold, as well as the actual net investment in the part remaining unsold. [Amended by 1985 c.673 §161; 2003 c.576 §496]

 

      543.560 Bond of licensee or letter of credit securing claims of suppliers; enforcement of obligation; action for sums due State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation.

(1) Upon not less than two years’ notice in writing the state, or any municipality thereof, shall have the right at any time to take over and thereafter to maintain and operate any project constructed under a license pursuant to ORS 543.010 to 543.610, upon payment of just compensation, including such reasonable damages, if any, to valuable, serviceable and dependent property of the holder of the license, not taken over, as may be caused by the severance therefrom of the property taken, and shall assume all contracts entered into by the licensee which are required to have and do have the express approval of the Water Resources Commission. If the sum to be paid cannot be agreed upon by the holder of the license and the municipality or the state, as the case may be, it shall be determined in a proceeding in equity instituted by the state or municipality, as the case may be, in the circuit court of the county in which the major part of the project is located.

      (2) There is also expressly reserved to the state, and any municipality thereof, the right to take over all or any part of any project by condemnation proceedings as may be provided by the laws of Oregon or the charter of any such municipality. [Amended by 1983 c.799 §8]

 

      543.620 [Repealed by 1995 c.229 §9]

 

POWER GENERATION BY DISTRICTS

 

      543.650 Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that a significant potential exists for the development of the hydroelectric generation capabilities of water systems serving domestic water supply districts, irrigation districts, drainage districts, water improvement districts and water control districts. The Legislative Assembly also finds that the development of such hydroelectric generation capabilities is desirable for meeting the electrical energy needs of the citizens of the State of Oregon. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to provide domestic water supply districts, irrigation districts, drainage districts, water improvement districts and water control districts with the authority and the right to exercise municipal preference in the development of hydroelectric generation capabilities in connection with their water systems. Further, it is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that the development of hydroelectric generation capabilities under ORS 543.650 to 543.685 does not become the primary function of domestic water supply districts, irrigation districts, drainage districts, water improvement districts and water control districts. [1981 c.420 §1]

 

      543.655 Definitions for ORS 543.650 to 543.685. As used in ORS 543.650 to 543.685, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “District” means any one of the following:

      (a) A domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264.

      (b) An irrigation district organized under ORS chapter 545.

      (c) A drainage district organized under ORS chapter 547.

      (d) A water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552.

      (e) A water control district organized under ORS chapter 553.

      (2) “Principal Act” means the statutes, other than ORS 543.650 to 543.685, which describe the powers of a district, including, but not limited to, the statutes under which a district is proposed or is operating.

      (3) “Water system” means any structure or facility constructed by persons and used by a district to achieve the district’s purpose under the district’s principal Act whether or not such structure or facility is owned by the district. [1981 c.420 §2; 1985 c.561 §4]

 

      543.660 Authority of district to enlarge or modify water system and power generating facilities; joint district ventures; prohibitions; sale of energy; regulations. (1) A district, alone or jointly with other districts, electric cooperatives, as defined in ORS 261.010, people’s utility districts, a cooperative as defined in ORS 62.015, municipal corporations authorized to engage in generating and distributing electricity or public utilities, as defined in ORS 757.005, engaged in the business of generating and distributing electricity, may enlarge or modify its water system for the purpose of generating electricity and may operate and maintain such facilities, notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (a) of this subsection. If a district already has hydroelectric generating capability, the district may enlarge or modify the district’s facilities used for generation of hydroelectric power. Two or more districts may, as a joint venture, generate electricity under ORS 543.650 to 543.685 as long as the structure or facility that is enlarged or modified to produce the electricity is part of the water system of at least one of the districts participating in the joint venture. However, a district may not:

      (a) Construct, acquire, operate or maintain any facility or structure that is not an enlargement or modification of the district’s water system solely or primarily for the purpose of generating electricity; or

      (b) Be created solely or primarily for the purpose of constructing, acquiring, operating or maintaining hydroelectric facilities.

      (2) A district shall sell the excess electric energy generated at such hydroelectric facilities to the Bonneville Power Administration, a public utility as defined in ORS 757.005, an electric cooperative as defined in ORS 261.010, a people’s utility district, a cooperative as defined in ORS 62.015, a municipal corporation or a municipally owned utility. Any sale of excess electric energy shall be made in accordance with terms and conditions of the Federal Power Act, as amended by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. As used in this subsection, “excess electric energy” means electric energy not used by the district to meet its own electric pumping requirements.

      (3) The board of directors of the district shall establish regulations governing electric energy generation and sale under this section.

      (4) Electricity shall be sold under this section only at wholesale. [1981 c.420 §3; 1985 c.561 §5; 1995 c.195 §44; 2003 c.802 §80; 2005 c.22 §381]

 

      543.662 Authority of district to develop joint project with private person; restrictions. A district may contract with a private person to enlarge or modify the district’s water system for the purpose of generating hydroelectric power. The district shall retain sufficient benefit and interest in, and control of a joint project as necessary for the project to be considered a district project. A district and a private person developing a joint project under ORS 543.650 to 543.685 must comply with the rules adopted by the Water Resources Commission under ORS 543.664. [1985 c.561 §2]

 

      543.664 Rules relating to joint projects of districts and private persons. The Water Resources Commission shall establish rules necessary to carry out the provisions of ORS 543.662. The rules shall include the amount of control over and interest in a joint project a district must retain in order to receive the benefit of the municipal preference and proceed under the municipal application process set forth in ORS chapter 537. [1985 c.561 §3]

 

      543.665 Authority to issue revenue bonds to acquire hydroelectric facilities. (1) In addition to any other authority under its principal Act to issue bonds, a district, when authorized at any properly called election, shall have the power to sell and dispose of revenue bonds to construct or acquire hydroelectric facilities in conformance with ORS 543.650 to 543.685 to develop the hydroelectric generation capabilities of the water system, and to pledge as security therefor all or any part of the unobligated net revenue of the district or system.

      (2) Revenue bonds may be issued by a district to construct or acquire hydroelectric facilities in connection with its water system in conformance with ORS 543.650 to 543.685, including, but not limited to, dams, canals, generating plants, transmission lines, other power equipment and acquire the necessary property and rights therefor, for the purpose of generating hydroelectric energy.

      (3) The revenue bonds authorized by this section shall be issued in the same manner and form as are general obligation bonds of the district, but they shall be payable, both as to principal and interest, from revenues only, as specified by this section. The revenue bonds shall not be subject to the percentage limitation applicable to general obligation bonds and shall not be a lien upon any of the taxable property within the corporate limits of such district, but shall be payable solely from such part of the revenues of the district as remain after payment of obligations having a priority and of all expenses of operation and maintenance of the district, including any taxes levied against it. All revenue bonds shall contain a clause reciting that both the principal and interest are payable solely from operating revenues of the district remaining after paying such obligations and expenses. [1981 c.420 §4; 1985 c.561 §6]

 

      543.670 Manner of issuance of revenue bonds. All revenue bonds issued under ORS 543.665 shall be issued as prescribed in ORS chapter 287A, but the requirements of ORS 287A.150 do not apply. [1981 c.420 §5; 1983 c.557 §12; 2007 c.783 §216]

 

      543.675 Power of eminent domain not to be exercised to acquire hydroelectric facilities. Notwithstanding any powers of eminent domain and condemnation given to a district under its principal Act, a district shall not exercise any power of condemnation or eminent domain to condemn, appropriate or acquire real property for the purpose of constructing, acquiring, operating or maintaining hydroelectric facilities. [1981 c.420 §6]

USE OF EXISTING WATER RIGHT FOR HYDROELECTRIC PURPOSES

 

      543.760 Definition of water right. As used in ORS 543.765, “water right” means a water use established by an adjudication under ORS chapter 539 as evidenced by a court decree or a certificated ground water or surface water right that is issued for some use other than for hydroelectric power and that serves as the underlying water right for an application to use water for hydroelectric purposes. [2007 c.657 §1]

 

      Note: 543.760 and 543.765 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 543 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      543.765 Certificate to use water for hydroelectric purposes within artificial delivery system; expedited application process; certificate conditions; annual payments; fees.
