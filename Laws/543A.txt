GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      543A.005 Definitions. As used in ORS 543A.005 to 543A.415:

      (1) “Commission” means the Water Resources Commission.

      (2) “Department” means the Water Resources Department.

      (3) “Director” means the Water Resources Director.

      (4) “Federally licensed project” means an existing project licensed under ORS 543.260 that is also licensed by and has been or will be reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act, as amended.

      (5) “Project” has the meaning given in ORS 543.010.

      (6) “State project” means an existing project for which the authority to operate is a time-limited water right for the use of water for hydroelectric purposes and that is not licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “State project” includes a project granted an exemption by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

      (7) “Team” means a Hydroelectric Application Review Team established pursuant to ORS 543A.035, 543A.075 or 543A.300.

      (8) “Water right” includes the use of water for hydroelectric purposes pursuant to a license issued under ORS 543.260. [1997 c.449 §1]

 

      543A.010 Findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that many hydroelectric projects within the state hold water rights for hydroelectric purposes for a limited time period, and that those water rights will expire. State law does not currently prescribe a means for reauthorizing the use of water for hydroelectric purposes. Therefore, the Sixty-eighth Legislative Assembly created a hydroelectric task force to recommend a process and standards for a coordinated state review of existing facilities. The hydroelectric task force was composed of representatives of interested state agencies, investor-owned utilities, publicly owned utilities, municipalities, environmental organizations, agricultural organizations and nonutility owners of hydroelectric projects. In its report to the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly, the hydroelectric task force included legislative recommendations that served as the foundation for the provisions of this chapter and ORS 468.065, 468B.040, 468B.045, 468B.046, 536.015, 536.050, 543.012 and 543.710. [1997 c.449 §2]

 

      543A.015 Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter and ORS 468.065, 468B.040, 468B.045, 468B.046, 536.015, 536.050, 543.012 and 543.710 to establish a process for developing a coordinated state position to be reflected in governmental proceedings related to the reauthorization of existing hydroelectric facilities. The coordinated state position shall be reflected in state decisions, including but not limited to decisions relating to the allocation of water, certification of water quality and other state regulatory actions, as well as in state comments on federal actions, including relicensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. [1997 c.449 §3]

 

      543A.020 Policy. The Legislative Assembly declares that it is the policy of the State of Oregon:

      (1) To reauthorize the use of water by existing projects provided that such projects meet the standards established in ORS 543A.025, are consistent with other applicable state laws and will not impair or be detrimental to the public interest.

      (2) To recognize that existing projects have resulted in both benefits and costs to society, and that the opportunity exists on reauthorization to promote the public benefits while minimizing the public costs.

      (3) To maintain or enhance the natural resources of the state and to protect the natural resources of the state from adverse impacts caused by the continued existence of a project.

      (4) To protect the health and safety of the residents of the state.

      (5) To require the Water Resources Department and other affected state agencies to conduct a coordinated review of projects seeking reauthorization in order to develop a unified state position in any local, state or federal proceedings related to the reauthorization of hydroelectric projects. [1997 c.449 §4]

 

      543A.025 Minimum standards for decision on reauthorization of water right; rules. (1) Following the process set forth in ORS 543A.005 to 543A.410, the Water Resources Director shall issue a water right for continued operation of an existing hydroelectric project upon a finding that the proposed use will not impair or be detrimental to the public interest, considering:

      (a) Conserving the highest use of the water for all purposes, including irrigation, domestic use, municipal water supply, power development, public recreation, protection of commercial and game fishing and wildlife, fire protection, mining, industrial purposes, navigation, scenic attraction or any other beneficial use to which the water may be applied for which it may have a special value to the public.

      (b) The maximum economic development of the waters involved.

      (c) The control of the waters of this state for all beneficial purposes, including drainage, sanitation and flood control.

      (d) The amount of waters available for appropriation for beneficial use.

      (e) The prevention of wasteful, uneconomic, impracticable or unreasonable use of the waters involved.

      (f) All vested and inchoate rights to the waters of this state or to the use of the waters of this state, and the means necessary to protect such rights.

      (g) The state water resources policy formulated under ORS 536.295 to 536.350 and 537.505 to 537.534.

      (2) In determining whether the proposed use will impair or be detrimental to the public interest, the following minimum standards shall apply:

      (a) For impacts to fish and wildlife resources attributable to the project, the Water Resources Department shall require:

      (A) Mitigation for:

      (i) Adverse impacts that occur due to new construction or operational changes to the project; and

      (ii) Ongoing adverse impacts existing at the time of reauthorization; and

      (B) Appropriate measures to promote restoration and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources to support goals expressed in statute or in standards, plans, guidelines and policies adopted by rule by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission.

      (b) All conditions included in a water right certificate issued to reauthorize the use of water for hydroelectric purposes shall be consistent with any plan adopted by the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council for the protection, mitigation and enhancement of the fish and wildlife resources of the region.

      (c) The project shall comply with water quality standards adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission.

      (d) The project shall not endanger the public health and safety. The project shall be operated in a manner that provides practical protection from vulnerability to seismic and geologic hazards.

      (e) Wetland resources shall be protected, maintained or enhanced. The Water Resources Department shall impose conditions on reauthorization consistent with this paragraph after considering impacts to wetland resources associated with the project, including wetlands lost or created by construction and operation of the project, and mitigation proposed by the applicant. Reauthorization that results in a net loss to existing wetland resources shall not be approved.

      (f) Other resources in the project vicinity including recreational opportunities, scenic and aesthetic values, historic, cultural and archaeological sites, and botanical resources shall be protected, maintained or enhanced. The department shall impose conditions on reauthorization consistent with this paragraph after considering impacts to such resources associated with the project, including resources lost or created by construction and operation of the project, and mitigation proposed by the applicant. If the project results in a net loss to existing resources, reauthorization shall not be approved.

      (3) In determining the mitigation, restoration and rehabilitation measures required under subsection (2) of this section, the Water Resources Department shall consider historic impacts, ongoing impacts and projected future impacts of the project and the existence and success of past mitigation measures associated with the project. Required mitigation, restoration and rehabilitation may include measures to restore or replace the benefits of historic resource conditions in order to meet resource goals contained in standards, plans, guidelines and policies adopted by rule by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission and in rules adopted by other state agencies with regulatory or advisory responsibility for the project.

      (4) The Water Resources Commission shall adopt all rules necessary to carry out the policy set forth in ORS 543A.020 and to implement the minimum standards set forth in subsection (2) of this section. In the absence of implementing rules, the department may act on applications for reauthorization of a project subject to the standards set forth in this section.

      (5) As used in this section, “mitigation” means addressing the adverse effects of a project proposed for reauthorization by considering, in the following order of priority:

      (a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain development action or parts of that action;

      (b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the development action and its implementation;

      (c) Rectifying the impact by repairing or rehabilitating the affected environment;

      (d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation or maintenance operations during the life of the development action by monitoring and taking appropriate corrective measures; and

      (e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing comparable substitute resources or environments. [1997 c.449 §5]

      543A.305 Conversion of hydroelectric water right to in-stream water right; exceptions. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Holder” has the meaning given that term in ORS 543.075.

      (b) “In-stream water right” has the meaning given that term in ORS 537.332.

      (c) “Reauthorize” has the meaning given that term in ORS 543.075.

      (2) An in-stream water right shall be subject to the limitations of ORS 537.350 and shall be maintained in perpetuity, in trust for the people of the State of Oregon. The priority date of the in-stream water right shall be the same as that of the converted hydroelectric water right. The location of the in-stream water right shall be the same as the point of diversion identified in the hydroelectric water right.

      (3) Five years after the use of water under a hydroelectric water right ceases, or upon expiration of a hydroelectric water right not otherwise extended or reauthorized, or at any time earlier with the written consent of the holder of the hydroelectric water right, up to the full amount of the water right associated with the hydroelectric project shall be converted to an in-stream water right, upon a finding by the Water Resources Director that the conversion will not result in injury to other existing water rights. In making the evaluation, the director shall consider the actual use of the hydroelectric project and the resulting impacts on actual use by other existing water rights as of October 23, 1999. The director may include mitigation measures as conditions of the in-stream water right to avoid injury and to ensure the continuation of authorized water uses by other existing water rights.

      (4) If the hydroelectric project is authorized by a pre-1909 unadjudicated claim of registration, the determination of injury shall be based upon an evaluation of the actual use as measured during the five years preceding the conversion action, and shall not constitute a determination under ORS 537.670 to 537.695 as to the underlying claim of registration of the pre-1909 use. Judicial review of a final order relating to such a conversion shall be limited to review of the conversion action.

      (5) This section shall not apply to projects on boundary waters that operate with water rights issued by the State of Oregon and by any other state except upon the written request of the water right holder.

      (6) If hydroelectric production is not the sole beneficial use authorized by a water right, this section shall apply only to conversion of that portion of the water right used exclusively for hydroelectric purposes.

      (7) This section shall not apply if the holder, at any time prior to conversion under subsection (3) of this section, transfers the hydroelectric water right under ORS 540.520 and 540.530, except that if a time-limited hydroelectric water right is transferred under ORS 540.520 and 540.530, the provisions of this section shall apply at the time of expiration of the time-limited water right. [1999 c.873 §2]

      (3) Before submitting an application to reauthorize a state project under ORS 543A.035, the applicant shall request from the team an estimate of the costs expected to be incurred in processing the application. The team shall inform the applicant of that amount and require the applicant to make periodic payments of such costs pursuant to a cost reimbursement agreement. The cost reimbursement agreement shall provide for payment of 25 percent of the estimated costs when the applicant submits an application under ORS 543A.035.

      (4) Before the close of public comment on study proposals developed by the applicant for a federally licensed project under ORS 543A.085, the team shall estimate the costs expected to be incurred in evaluating the project. The team shall inform the applicant of that amount and require the applicant to make periodic payments of such costs pursuant to a cost reimbursement agreement. The cost reimbursement agreement shall provide for a first payment of 25 percent of the estimated costs on a schedule established in the agreement.

      (5) If costs of the team’s evaluation of a project exceed the estimate in the cost reimbursement agreement, the applicant shall pay any excess costs shown in an itemized statement prepared by the team. In no event shall the team and its participating agencies incur evaluation expenses in excess of 110 percent of the fee initially estimated unless the team provided prior notification to the applicant and a detailed projected budget the team believes is necessary to complete evaluation of the application. If costs are less than the fee paid, the team shall refund the excess to the applicant.

      (6) The Water Resources Department shall reimburse participating agencies for costs incurred in their review of a project. Such costs shall not include expenses of other state agencies for which a fee is otherwise collected under state law. [1997 c.449 §33; 2001 c.369 §7]

 

      543A.410 Fee schedule; appeal. (1) All expenses incurred by the Hydroelectric Application Review Team and its participating agencies that are charged to or allocated to the fee paid by an applicant shall be necessary, just and reasonable. Upon request, the team shall provide the applicant with a detailed justification for all charges. Not later than January 1 of each year, the Water Resources Director by order shall establish a schedule of fees that those persons submitting a notice of intent must submit under ORS 543A.030 or 543A.075. The fee schedule shall be designed to recover the actual costs of evaluating the notice of intent. Fees shall be based on actual, historical costs incurred by the team and its participating agencies to the extent historical costs are available. The fees established by the schedule shall reflect the size and complexity of the project for which a notice of intent is submitted.

      (2) If a dispute arises regarding the necessity or reasonableness of expenses charged to or allocated to the fee paid by an applicant, and if the dispute is not resolved by the directors of the affected agencies, the applicant may seek judicial review in circuit court of the amount of expenses charged or allocated as provided in ORS 183.480, 183.484, 183.490 and 183.500. If the applicant establishes that any of the charges or allocations are unnecessary or unreasonable, the amount found to be unnecessary or unreasonable shall be refunded to the applicant. The applicant shall not waive the right to judicial review by paying the portion of the fee or expense in dispute. [1997 c.449 §34]

 

      543A.415 Reauthorization fee. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, each holder of an existing hydroelectric license shall pay to the Water Resources Department annually a reauthorization fee in an amount per theoretical horsepower covered by the existing license that, when added to the amount per theoretical horsepower covered by the existing license that is paid under ORS 543.300, equals 28 cents for each horsepower covered by the existing license, or $15, whichever is greater, for the purpose of implementing the state reauthorization process established by this chapter and ORS 468.065, 468B.040, 468B.045, 468B.046, 536.015, 536.050, 543.012 and 543.710. The reauthorization fee shall be paid until the project is reauthorized, and a water right issued, under this chapter and ORS 468.065, 468B.040, 468B.045, 468B.046, 536.015, 536.050, 543.012 and 543.710. Upon reauthorization and issuance of a water right, a new annual fee shall be assessed under ORS 543.300, and the reauthorization fee shall no longer apply.

      (2) The department shall notify existing license holders of the amount of the fee described in subsection (1) of this section. The notice shall state the date by which the license holder must notify the department if the license holder does not intend to reauthorize the project. The department shall assess the fee described in subsection (1) of this section unless the license holder notifies the state that it does not intend to apply to reauthorize the project upon expiration of the license. The holder of an existing hydroelectric license that notifies the department that it does not intend to reauthorize the project need not pay the reauthorization fee and may not seek reauthorization of the project upon expiration of the existing license.

      (3) The department shall submit a report to the Legislative Assembly during each odd-numbered year regular session describing the department’s use of reauthorization funds.

      (4) Four cents of each 28 cents paid as a reauthorization fee as required by subsection (1) of this section shall be deposited to the Water Resources Department Hydroelectric Fund and disbursed to the Department of Environmental Quality. [1997 c.449 §37; 1999 c.873 §17; 2003 c.14 §348; 2011 c.545 §61]
