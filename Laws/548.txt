(1) The board of supervisors of any drainage district or the board of directors of any irrigation district may, whenever it is determined by such board that it is for the best interests of the district, enter into a contract with any governmental agency of the United States, for a loan:

      548.310 Validation of prior contracts and bonds. All contracts entered into before November 15, 1935, by any drainage district or irrigation district with any governmental agency of the United States, and any bonds issued before or after November 15, 1935, pursuant to such contract, for any of the purposes provided by ORS 548.305 to 548.325, which comply with the provisions of ORS 548.305 and are otherwise regular and duly made and issued according to law, are declared valid, notwithstanding that the total amount of any such loan so provided to be made by the governmental agency exceeds in the aggregate the total amount of the outstanding indebtedness of such district in any case where all or any part of such loan is for purposes other than refunding the outstanding indebtedness of such district.

If the contract does not provide for a lien docket nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an irrigation or drainage district from providing a lien docket as prescribed by law. In case any lands located within an irrigation or drainage district are sold for taxes such sale shall not operate to extinguish any lien appearing on the lien docket and payable at a future time.

 

      548.325 Charges or assessments; emergency fund.

When any irrigation or drainage district has adopted a plan for refunding and compromising any or all of its outstanding indebtedness, and pursuant to ORS 548.305 to 548.325 has entered into a contract with any governmental agency for a loan for the purpose of carrying out such plan, and the board of directors or board of supervisors for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions contained in the contract have authorized the issuance of bonds of the district pursuant to ORS 548.315, and such plan of refinancing and compromise has been accepted in writing by the holders of more than 90 percent of such outstanding indebtedness to be refunded and compromised, such irrigation or drainage district may commence and prosecute a proceeding in rem for the purpose of obtaining constructive consent, to the plan, of the unknown holders of the evidences of the indebtedness to be refunded and compromised, and of the known holders of such evidences of indebtedness who have not so given their consent in writing. The proceeding shall be commenced in the circuit court of the county in which the office of the district is located, by filing a petition verified by the oath of the president or secretary of the district.

 

      548.340 Contents of petition. The petition shall set forth the plan for refunding and compromising the indebtedness and shall further recite what percentage in amount of the holders of the evidences of indebtedness to be refunded or retired have filed their written consent to the proposed plan, which percentage shall not be less than 90 percent, and shall further set forth what steps have been taken to obtain the consent of all nonconsenting holders of the evidences of indebtedness. The petition shall also state the name and place of residence of all of the holders of the evidences of indebtedness who are known to the district, and shall show that diligent efforts have been made to ascertain the names and residences of all the holders.

 

      548.345 Notice; failure of holder to object constitutes consent. (1) Upon presentation of the petition to the judge of the court, the judge shall, if it appears that diligent efforts have been made by the irrigation or drainage district to ascertain the names and places of residence of all the holders of the evidences of indebtedness so to be refunded and compromised, authorize the district to publish, and it shall publish for at least four consecutive weeks in three newspapers published within the state, to be designated by the court, one of which papers shall be published in the county in which the office of the board of directors or board of supervisors is situated, a notice specifying the particular indebtedness which it is proposed to refund and compromise, together with the plan which has been adopted by the district for the refunding and compromising; also, a general description of the refunding bonds, if any, which it is proposed to issue to the holders of the indebtedness. The notice shall require all holders of the evidences of indebtedness so to be refunded or compromised to file in the matter of the petition in the circuit court their written dissent from or objection to the proposed plan of refunding and compromise. The notice shall also state that any holders who fail to file their dissent and protest to the plan shall be deemed to have consented thereto.

      (2) The district shall also cause the notice to be served in the manner provided by law for service of summons in civil actions upon all the holders whose names and places of residence are known to the district and who reside within Oregon. The district shall also deposit a copy of the notice in the United States mail addressed to each of the known holders who reside without the state, with postage prepaid.

      (3) Dissent in writing must be filed in the court and cause within 90 days from the date of the first publication of the notice; or, in the case of holders whose names and places of residence are known to the district and who reside within the state, within 90 days from the date of service of the notice upon them; or, in the case of holders whose names and places of residence are known to the district and who reside without the state, within 90 days from the date of mailing the notice.

      (4) After the expiration of said period of 90 days the holders so failing to file their objection and protest with the court shall be deemed to have consented to the refunding and compromise of the indebtedness under the terms set forth in the notice, and such failure shall be equivalent to the offer in writing signed by the known consenting holders. [Amended by 1989 c.182 §34]

 

      548.350 Hearing; judgment; county treasurer as trustee. (1) After the expiration of 90 days from the date of the first publication of the notice and the service and mailing thereof, as set forth in ORS 548.345, the district shall file in the proceeding in the circuit court its verified return of its acts made under the order of the court, attaching affidavits of the publication of the notice in three newspapers, and proof of service of the notice upon the holders of the evidences of indebtedness whose names and places of residence are known to the district and who reside within the state, and of the mailing thereof to such known holders residing without the state.

      (2) Thereupon the court shall hear the cause and shall enter a judgment providing that all the holders of the evidences of indebtedness to be refunded and compromised by the plan or proceeding of the district, who within 90 days after the date of the first publication of the notice and the serving and mailing thereof did not file in the court their written dissent and objections to the proceedings, have consented that their evidences of indebtedness be refunded and compromised under the proposed plan.

      (3) In the judgment the court shall direct the officers of the district to deposit with the county treasurer of the county in which the district is headquartered, as trustee for the persons entitled thereto, the cash or refunding bonds which under the plan of refunding and compromise belong to the holders of the evidences of indebtedness whose consent was so obtained by the court proceedings. The judgment shall further provide that upon the payment of said money or bonds to the county treasurer as trustee, the evidences of indebtedness so held by the holders shall be deemed paid and no longer shall be an obligation of the district; and that upon the surrender to the county treasurer of the evidences of indebtedness, together with any unpaid interest coupons belonging to the same, the county treasurer shall pay on demand to the holders the money or bonds so deposited with the county treasurer as trustee, and shall mark the evidences of indebtedness canceled and deliver them to the district. All holders of the evidences of indebtedness to be refunded and compromised shall be deemed to have notice of all steps and proceedings had. [Amended by 1989 c.182 §35; 2003 c.576 §515]

 

      548.355 Nature of proceedings; appeal; nonprejudicial errors; costs. The procedure in the circuit court under the provisions of ORS 548.340 to 548.350 shall be in the nature of an action in rem not triable by right to a jury. Any holders of any evidences of indebtedness affected by any such court procedure provided for in those sections, or any other interested party, may appeal to the Court of Appeals at any time within 30 days after the rendition of the judgment of the circuit court. The court inquiring into the regularity, legality or correctness of any of such proceedings shall disregard any error, irregularity or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties, and may approve the proceedings in part and disapprove the remainder. Costs in the proceeding may be allowed and apportioned between the parties in the discretion of the court. [Amended by 1979 c.284 §170]

 

      548.360 Moneys and securities; custody. All moneys and securities received under ORS 548.350 may be deposited with the State Treasurer for safekeeping. [Amended by 1989 c.182 §36]

All acts of the State Reclamation Commission had before March 4, 1935, in connection with any such loans authorized before that date, are ratified and confirmed. [Amended by 1955 c.707 §67; 1989 c.182 §37]
