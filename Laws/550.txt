      550.150 Purpose of ORS 550.150 to 550.400.

This area also represents a significant cultural and community history of flooding, displacement and loss, a history that should be remembered so that it is not repeated. The purpose of ORS 550.150 to 550.400 is to create a new special district that has the legislative authority and financial capability to carry out the purposes set forth in ORS 550.170 (1).
