MISCELLANEOUS

 

      552.710 Subdistrict procedure; authority. (1) When a district has adopted a plan under ORS 552.403, subdistricts may be created as provided by this section.

      (2) Proceedings to create subdistricts, located totally or partially within or outside of a district, may be initiated by a petition of the landowners within the subdistrict. Except as otherwise provided by this section, the petition shall fulfill the same requirements concerning the subdistrict as a petition is, by ORS 552.118, required to fulfill concerning the creation of the main district. The petition shall be filed with the county board of the county where the greater portion of land within the boundaries of the subdistrict is located, and shall be accompanied by an undertaking as provided by ORS 552.118. Proceedings to create a subdistrict shall conform in all things to the provisions relating to the creation of a district. However, the owners of 50 percent or more of the total acreage within the proposed subdistrict shall be required to sign the petition for the creation of a subdistrict.

      (3) If the county board adopts an order creating a subdistrict, the clerk of the county board shall give notice of the order to the district board. The district board of the main district is the governing board of each subdistrict of the district. For the purpose of qualifying to be a member of a district board, under ORS 552.208 (1), ownership of land within a subdistrict, regardless of the location of the subdistrict, is considered ownership of land within the district. The territory within one subdistrict may be included within another subdistrict or subdistricts.

      (4) After the creation of a subdistrict, proceedings in reference to a subdistrict shall in all matters conform to the provisions of this chapter applicable to districts. In all matters affecting only a subdistrict, provisions of this chapter applicable to a district apply to the subdistrict as though it were an independent district.

      (5) The petition for creation of a subdistrict shall include a statement of the amount or quantity of water for which the subdistrict desires to acquire the perpetual use and the amount of money the subdistrict is willing to pay therefor. Prior to the entry of a judgment creating a subdistrict, the county board shall be furnished the verified consent of the district board to furnish such perpetual use of water for the purposes specified to the subdistrict at a price and upon the terms mentioned in the petition.

      (2) Except as provided by this section, dissolution, liquidation and transfer proceedings shall be conducted as provided by ORS 198.920 to 198.955.

      (3) When a petition is filed or a resolution is adopted initiating dissolution proceedings, the governing board of the dissolving district and the district board of the water improvement district shall meet with each other to agree on a debt distribution plan to be voted upon as a part of the proposal. The debt distribution plan may provide for any distribution of indebtedness between the water improvement district and the dissolving district. If the boards do not agree on a debt distribution plan or if the area within the dissolving district remains liable under the plan for any portion of the indebtedness outstanding at the time of the dissolution and transfer, the district board of the water improvement district shall be ex officio board of the dissolved district for the purpose of levying taxes or collecting charges in such area until the bonded and other indebtedness of the dissolved district is paid.

      (4) The consent of all the known holders of valid indebtedness against the dissolving district shall be obtained or provision made in the debt distribution plan for the payment of the nonassenting holders. The area within the boundaries of the dissolving district shall not by reason of the dissolution and transfer be relieved from liabilities and indebtedness previously contracted by the dissolving district.

      (5) If the dissolution is approved at an election in accordance with the law applicable to the dissolving district, the governing body of the dissolving district shall convey to the water improvement district all assets of the dissolving district after paying and discharging the debts and obligations to, or procuring releases from the nonassenting holders, in accordance with the debt distribution plan.

Notice of a hearing to be held before the district board or the county board shall be published once each week for four consecutive weeks, making four publications, and the last publication shall be at least five days before the date set for the hearing. All other notices required to be published under this chapter shall be published once each week for two consecutive weeks, making two publications, and the last publication shall be at least five days before the date of the event for which the notice is given. This section does not apply to provision of notice for an election. [1969 c.606 §12; 1971 c.647 §119; 1983 c.350 §304]
