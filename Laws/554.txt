There must be at least one regular meeting of the members in each year, to be fixed by the bylaws, and there shall be such other meetings as may be called under the provisions of the bylaws.

      (4) When members representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast or their appointed proxies do not attend the regular annual meeting of the members of the corporation or any other meeting called under the bylaws, the directors of the corporation may call another meeting of the members on a date that is not later than 60 days after the date of the meeting at which a quorum was not obtained. At such subsequent meeting, members representing 25 percent or more of the votes entitled to be cast shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. [Amended by 1985 c.466 §1; 1995 c.233 §2]

      554.135 Alternative method for collecting assessments. (1) In lieu of the method of levy and assessment provided for in ORS 554.130, the board of directors may provide in the bylaws or by resolution for the billing and collection of the rates, tolls, fees, fines and charges of the corporation in the manner provided in this section.

      (2) The bylaws or the resolution establishing the rates, tolls, fees, fines and charges shall fix the time when they shall become due and payable, and shall also fix a time after which they shall become delinquent, which time shall be any time within one year from the due date.

      554.140 Directors’ duty to institute proceedings to enforce lien; attorney fees. (1) The board of directors shall institute proceedings to enforce the lien of any assessment when the last installment of such assessment is delinquent for more than three months. If the board fails to promptly institute and diligently prosecute in good faith proceedings for enforcement of a lien after that time and any member or creditor of the corporation shall give written notice to the board of such delinquency and request that such procedure be instituted and the board neglects for 30 days thereafter in good faith to bring suit to enforce the lien, the members of the board so failing shall each be jointly and severally liable to the corporation in the amount of the delinquent assessment.

      (2) Any member or creditor of the corporation may bring an action on behalf of the corporation in its name against any such directors to enforce the payment thereof; however, no directors shall be personally liable for payment of a delinquent assessment if:

      (a) The record of proceedings of a duly constituted meeting of the board held prior to the commencement of such action show either that such director presented or voted in favor of a resolution presented and voted upon by the board calling for the prompt commencement of such enforcement proceedings; or

      (b) If no meeting of the board was held between the time prescribed for enforcement of a delinquent assessment lien and the commencement of an action against the directors by a member or creditor of the corporation, that such director duly requested a special meeting of the board of directors be called for the purpose of adopting such a resolution and that the proposed resolution was submitted with the request.

      554.150 Action to compel assessment. If the board of directors neglects to make any assessment provided by ORS 554.005 to 554.340 for 30 days after the time when it is required to be made, any member of the corporation or any creditor thereof who is likely to be injured thereby may bring an action to compel the assessment to be made. In any such case the costs and expenses thereof may be assessed to the directors who were willfully negligent in failing to make the same and judgment rendered against them jointly and severally by the court in the same action. In such action the corporation and the directors shall be parties defendant. [Amended by 1979 c.284 §173]

 

      554.160 Assessments to provide funds to meet obligations; custody, disbursement and disposal of funds; general operating expenses. (1) When any bonds or obligations of the corporation are payable from revenue of assessments pledged for the payment thereof, the board of directors shall, at the time of creating such indebtedness or issuing such bonds or obligations or at any time thereafter when assessments therefor are made, designate such fund by appropriate name and shall at the time of making each assessment thereafter determine the amount and portion of the assessment in dollars which is required to be then made for revenue of such fund. In determining and levying every assessment provided in ORS 554.005 to 554.340 the board of directors shall provide separately for the amount to be so raised for each of the several funds so designated and named including the general operation and maintenance fund.

      (2) The revenues apportioned to the funds pledged to the payment of bonds and obligations shall be separately held and kept and accounted for. The corporation shall disburse the funds only for the purposes for which levied until the indebtedness and obligation for which the assessment was made is fully paid with interest, whereupon the remainder shall be transferred to the general fund of the corporation for the payment of expenses of the corporation and its operation and maintenance. At the time of making assessments the board of directors shall first determine the estimated amount necessary for the expenses of operation and maintenance and then the several amounts for the respective funds, and determine that the whole amount thereof is within the limitations, restrictions and provisions of the landowners’ notice provided for in ORS 554.170 to 554.190. [Amended by 1969 c.694 §47; 2001 c.215 §30]

Owners of all the land described in the articles of incorporation or amendments thereto may at any time after the adoption of the plans and specifications for improving the land as provided in ORS 554.210, mutually covenant and agree for the purpose of binding their respective lands, as provided in ORS 554.180. Such covenants and agreements shall attach to and run with the land for the purpose of limiting, restricting and governing the conduct of the corporation. Such covenants, limitations, restrictions and agreements must not be inconsistent with the articles of incorporation, and after the recording of the same as provided in ORS 554.190 they may not be altered, amended, modified or rescinded during the life of such corporation without the consent of landowners representing two-thirds of the lands in the district and persons having an interest in such lands and the corporation and its creditors if any there are. After the recording, the bylaws of the corporation and every act and proceeding of such corporation must be in accordance with and subject to the limitations, restrictions and provisions thereof. [Amended by 1965 c.427 §1]

 

      554.180 Landowners’ notice; contents. (1) If the owners of all the land desire to enter into such covenant with respect to matters hereinafter provided they shall make, subscribe and acknowledge before some person authorized to take acknowledgment of deeds, a notice to whom it may concern, which notice shall contain:

      (a) A description of the land with the same particularity as is provided for in the articles of incorporation.

      (b) A statement that the owners of the described land have incorporated themselves under the corporate name of (stating such name), and that the land will be improved as described in the articles of incorporation of record in the Office of the Secretary of State and in the office where deeds and other instruments affecting the title to real property are recorded in the county where the land is situated.

      (c) A statement either that the land shall be subject to any indebtedness incurred by the corporation, or that the land shall be subject to the lien of any assessments thereon by the corporation for its works and the improvement of the land as described in the articles of incorporation under the provisions of ORS 554.005 to 554.340.

      (2) If all the landowners desire, they may therein further limit, restrict and provide with respect to said matters and the conduct of the corporation with regard to the described land by mutually determining and stating therein any or all of the following:

      (a) Whether all the land is uniformly and in like amount per acre or per parcel thereof benefited by the improvements; and if not so benefited they may by agreement determine and apportion the relative amount of benefits per acre or per parcel between the several parcels and portions describing the same with the same particularity as is provided for the articles of incorporation.

      (b) The whole amount of benefit per acre or per parcel which will accrue from the works and improvement proposed in the articles of incorporation. If the lands are not uniformly benefited they may determine and appraise the benefits as to the several parcels and portions of all of the land and in that case particularly describe the same and state the amount of benefits accruing to the respective portions and parcels thereof per acre or per parcel in dollars, which shall in such case be the maximum amount per acre or per parcel as a lien thereon for any purpose of the corporation other than for operation and maintenance.

      (c) The whole amount in dollars of annual benefits which will accrue per acre or per parcel from the works and improvement described in the articles of incorporation. If it has been determined that all the land is not so uniformly and equally benefited they shall in such case determine and state the amount in dollars of the annual benefit per acre or per parcel of the several parcels and portions of all the land particularly describing the same, which amount of annual benefits so determined shall be the maximum amount of assessments by the corporation per acre or per parcel made and apportioned according to such determination as a lien upon the land payable per annum inclusive of the operation and maintenance assessments, and the assessment of any land in any year in excess of these annual benefits is to the extent of such excess void. [Amended by 1987 c.94 §149; 1995 c.233 §5]

 

      554.190 Recording notice; effect; lien on land; priority. (1) The notice shall be recorded in the office where deeds and other instruments affecting the title to real property are recorded in the county where the land is situated. From the recording thereof such notice shall be a covenant to and with the corporation and its members and creditors, attaching to and running with the described land and every part thereof, granting the rights, privileges and liens as in ORS 554.005 to 554.340 provided and in the notice stated with respect thereto. In addition, such recording shall constitute prior approval of the members of the corporation of those actions of the board of directors obligating the corporation as authorized in ORS 554.220 to 554.280.

      (2) If it is stated in the notice that the land described in the articles of incorporation and the notice shall be subject to any indebtedness incurred by the corporation, all debts and obligations of the corporation theretofore and thereafter created shall be a lien upon the land described in the notice prior to every other lien attaching to the land subsequent to the time of recording of the notice, except state, county and school taxes, whether such debt or obligation of the corporation is in existence at the time the latter lien attaches or is created afterward. Such lien shall not be personal but shall be an obligation upon the land and run with the land.

      (3) If, however, the landowners state in the notice that the land described in the articles of incorporation shall be subject to the lien of assessments by such corporation for the works and improvement of the land, then all the debts and obligations of the corporation shall be a direct obligation of the corporation with the irrevocable right of the creditors and obligees to have assessments made by the corporation for the payment of such debts and obligations pursuant to the provisions of ORS 554.005 to 554.340 and within the limitations, restrictions and provisions of the landowners’ notice. In such case every debt and obligation of the corporation created within the limitations and restrictions of the landowners’ notice is with the implied or express covenant that the corporation will make the assessments necessary to be made for the payment thereof as same may mature and be payable, and will prorate and apportion the same to all the described lands in accordance with the provisions of ORS 554.005 to 554.340 and the notice. Every assessment made pursuant to this subsection and the landowners’ notice by the corporation and prorated and apportioned pursuant to such notice within the limitations, restrictions and provisions thereof shall be a lien upon the acreage of such land as so assessed by the corporation, and the lien shall relate back, vest and attach thereto as of the time of filing for record of the landowners’ notice. Every other lien, right, title, interest and estate attaching, vesting or in any manner accruing or acquired subsequent to the filing of such landowners’ notice, whether before or after such assessment, except state, county and school taxes, shall be inferior and subject to the lien of such assessment. [Amended by 1991 c.459 §432e]

 

      554.200 Incurring indebtedness before notice recorded; scope of notice. When any corporation is organized pursuant to ORS 554.005 to 554.340, the board of directors and the corporation may not lawfully incur any indebtedness or obligation of such corporation, except as otherwise provided in ORS 554.005 to 554.340, before the landowners’ notice has been executed and recorded. When the notice is so recorded, it shall be notice to the world of the facts therein stated. It shall not be necessary, for the purpose of the lien of any assessment or indebtedness of the corporation upon any of the lands described therein, to file or record in the office where deeds and other instruments affecting the title to real property are recorded, any resolution of the corporation or notice of assessment, indebtedness or lien; but as to all matters upon the recording of the landowners’ notice every person interested in any of the land therein described or dealing with respect thereto is put upon inquiry respecting the same and shall ascertain from the corporation the extent and amount of such indebtedness, assessment and lien upon the land. [Amended by 1987 c.158 §117]

      (a) Designating and authorizing the expenditures for preliminary investigation and report upon the plans and cost of works and construction, or repair or reconstruction of the same, or purchasing or acquiring any property, ditches, dikes, levees, plants, improvements, easements, rights of way, water rights, or other things necessary, advantageous or beneficial for improving the land under the plan described in the articles of incorporation; or

      (b) Determining and declaring that such preliminary investigation and the expense thereof is unnecessary.

      (5) Pursuant to action under subsection (4) of this section, the directors shall then:

      (6) The directors shall submit the detailed plans and specifications and report to a meeting of the members of the corporation for adoption. Adoption must in that case be made by resolution passed by a two-thirds vote of all the votes to which the members may be entitled.

      (7) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (6) of this section, when a corporation formed under ORS chapter 554 takes ownership of existing sanitary sewer facilities under ORS 554.020 (1)(b), the board of directors may adopt as detailed plans and specifications of the corporation the plans and specifications of the former owner or operator of the sanitary sewer facilities without securing a competent engineer. [Amended by 2013 c.284 §4]

 

      554.220 Bonds; denominations; interest; maturities; execution; coupons; amortized installment obligations. (1) At any time after recording the landowners’ notice as provided in ORS 554.190 and adoption of a plan for improvement of the land described in the articles of incorporation as provided in ORS 554.210, the board of directors may, if in their judgment it seems best, and subject to the limitations, restrictions and provisions of the landowners’ notice, issue bonds or other obligations of the corporation necessary or convenient for improving the lands, including the refunding of outstanding bonds and any indebtedness of the corporation.

      (2) Bonds and obligations shall not be sold for less than 90 percent of their face value, and may be issued all at the same time or in such amounts as the board deems necessary. Before issuing any bonds or obligations the board shall first pass a resolution authorizing the same and provide the whole amount thereof and the purpose of same and if payable from a separate fund shall designate the same. The resolution shall prescribe the form and substance of the bonds or obligations and provide with respect thereto the matters and things otherwise prescribed therefor in ORS 554.005 to 554.340.

Bonds and obligations received in payment of any obligation shall be numbered consecutively and the lowest numbers paid off first.

      (4) No obligations of the corporation shall be issued by the board unless it is determined that the annual assessment which will be required for the payment thereof as same matures together with other assessments which will be necessary for maintenance and operation expense and other purposes will not exceed in the whole the maximum amount of annual benefits which may be assessed and apportioned in any one year.

Whenever the board of directors of the corporation shall by resolution determine it to be for the best interest of the corporation, the board may enter into contract with the United States or its duly constituted agencies, or any municipal or other corporation of Oregon, or any person, for the purpose of procuring or receiving a loan or financial assistance for any works or improvement of the corporation, or for the maintenance and operation of any works or improvement of the corporation or of such other party, or for the purpose of acquiring jointly or controlling and managing in conjunction with such other party any works or improvement or any easement or right of way necessary for such improvement or work; and may bind the corporation for the maintenance, support and operation of the whole or any part thereof after construction of the same; and may agree that any works or improvement of the United States or any constituted governmental agency embracing any part of the works or improvement of the corporation or serving any purpose thereof shall be subject to the control, rules and regulations of the United States or any of its constituted agencies or officers as any law or regulation of the United States may require; and may agree to protect the United States and its constituted governmental agencies or officers from any loss or damage by reason of any works or improvement for or in behalf of the corporation as any law may require as a condition thereof; and may contract with the United States to furnish without cost such easements and rights of way and other property as shall be necessary for the proposed improvement and works of the corporation and their maintenance and operation, as required or provided by law as a condition thereof.

 

      554.270 Purchase or lease of works and water rights; provision as to payment; serial coupon obligations. (1) Whenever the board of directors of the corporation shall by resolution determine that it is to the best interest of the corporation, the board may enter into contracts for the purchase or option to purchase or lease, upon such terms as it determines to the best interest of the corporation, any ditch, works, improvement, easement, right of way, water right or other thing required or advantageous to the corporation for the works and improvement of the land described in the articles of incorporation within the scope of the purposes therein named.

      (2) In any such case the board may by such contract provide for spreading the payments over such period as may be agreed upon and may issue therefor serial installment coupon obligations in such number and denominations as it may determine, inclusive of interest at such rate as the board may provide on all unpaid assessments, together with an amount sufficient to pay a proportionate part of the cost of administering the bond assessment program and issuing the bonds authorized under ORS 554.220 and 554.250, including, but not limited to, legal, printing and consultant’s fees, such amount to be determined by the governing body. The installment coupons shall be of such amount and stated maturity as will pay and retire all installment coupon obligations of such designated series evenly, justly and ratably from year to year at the same time, and shall be general obligations of the corporation, payable from a fund as provided in ORS 554.280. [Amended by 1981 c.322 §9]

 

      554.275 Activity of corporation as urban service. The activity of a corporation for drainage or flood control organized under ORS 554.005 to 554.340 is deemed to be an urban service, as defined in ORS 195.065, if the corporation:

      (1) Is located in a county that has a population greater than 700,000; and

      (2) Operates a flood control project as defined in ORS 547.057 located within the urban growth boundary established by Metro or within the incorporated boundary of a city. [2015 c.544 §16]

 

      Note: 554.275 was added to and made a part of 554.005 to 554.340 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      554.280 Resolution for serial coupon obligations; maturities; interest; retirement; recitals; fund for payment; assessments. (1) For the purpose stated in ORS 554.270, the board of directors shall by resolution determine and declare that the same is to the best interest of the corporation; briefly describe the purpose and object thereof and the amount of money required therefor; provide for, authorize and direct issuing the installment coupon obligations, describing and fixing the number of such obligations constituting the series and the denominations thereof; and shall adopt and prescribe the form and substance of such obligations. Each obligation shall bear the same series designation and be separately serially numbered, which series designation and serial number shall likewise appear upon each installment coupon attached. Coupons of each obligation shall be serially numbered in the order of their maturity and shall be so payable at a place designated in the bonds.

      (2) Interest at a rate determined by the board may be included and amortized for the retirement of both principal and interest as provided in the resolution and in this section. Every obligation shall recite that it is issued pursuant to such resolution and payable from a fund derived from annual assessments of the lands described in the articles of incorporation for such purpose, the proceeds of which are pledged for the payment, and that the corporation covenants to levy such assessments according to law and the resolution in amount sufficient, inclusive of estimated delinquencies, to pay the installment coupons thereto attached as they mature.

      (3) The resolution shall appropriately designate the fund. The board of directors shall thereafter on or before the time fixed in the bylaws determine and assess the amount necessary to be assessed at such time for payment of the installment coupons as they mature. Proceeds from such assessment shall constitute a fund which is pledged for payment of such obligations. The treasurer shall segregate and keep separate the proceeds of every assessment for such funds, and shall deposit the same in an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008, in a separate account designating such fund. The district treasurer shall not disburse the same except as provided in this section. [Amended by 1969 c.694 §49; 1977 c.188 §11; 1981 c.94 §50; 1981 c.526 §8; 1997 c.631 §494; 2001 c.215 §32]

 

      554.290 Warrants to pay claims; interest; assessments to pay warrants; limitation on amount of warrants. All claims against the corporation shall be paid by warrants drawn on the treasurer of the corporation and signed by the president and secretary of the board of directors. If any warrant is not paid when presented to the treasurer of the board of directors, because of lack of funds in the treasury, that fact shall be indorsed on the warrant and the warrant shall draw interest thereafter at a rate determined by the board until there is money in hand to pay the amount of the warrant and the interest then accumulated. No interest shall be allowed on warrants after sufficient funds are in the treasury to pay the indorsed warrants and interest. The secretary of the board shall give notice to the payee or other holder if known whenever sufficient funds are available to pay outstanding warrants. Warrants shall be numbered, drawn against the proper fund, and paid from such fund in the order of issuance. The board of directors shall levy an assessment each year of sufficient amount of money to pay the outstanding warrants. No warrants shall be issued the payment of which in the ensuing year inclusive of the assessments required for all other purposes will exceed the annual assessment limit fixed in the landowners’ recorded notice, or the aggregate indebtedness of which with all other indebtedness for other purposes than operation and maintenance will exceed the total benefits to accrue to the land described in the articles of incorporation as stated in the recorded landowners’ notice. [Amended by 1981 c.94 §51]

An amendment shall not affect the date of priority of the lien of the corporation upon any land, but as to any new land included by an amendment the lien shall attach from the date of the recording of the amended notice. No land can be excluded until its proportionate share of all existing debts of the corporation has been paid.

      (2) An amendment other than an amendment to include or exclude land shall be voted upon by the members at a regular meeting or a special meeting called for that purpose. The amendment shall require approval by two-thirds or more of the votes of the members present or by proxy. The articles of amendment shall be submitted to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing.

      (3) In addition to the procedures available for administrative dissolution under ORS 554.302 and 554.305, any such corporation may be dissolved and its affairs terminated as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. However, no corporation may be dissolved as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section before payment or release of all debts and obligations of the corporation, including every contract and agreement with the federal or the state government, or its or their constituted governmental authorities or agencies, or the assumption of its obligations by another with the consent of all parties.

      (4) The board of directors of the corporation shall cause notice to be given of a meeting of the members, which notice shall contain a statement to the effect that the dissolution of the corporation will be considered at the meeting, and a brief statement of the reasons why dissolution is deemed advisable. The question of whether or not the corporation shall be dissolved may be presented at the meeting, and if two-thirds or more of the votes of the members present or by proxy are cast in favor of dissolution, the board shall proceed to dissolve the corporation and liquidate its affairs. The board shall constitute a board of trustees and as such shall dispose of the property of the corporation and pay its debts and obligations or procure releases thereof; provided, that in case an irrigation district, drainage district or flood control district is organized to include the lands in the corporation or any part thereof, the board of directors of the corporation, or the board of trustees in case the corporation has voted to dissolve, shall convey to such irrigation, drainage or flood control district any and all irrigation works or other property owned by such corporation, upon the assumption by the irrigation, drainage or flood control district of the obligations of the corporation.

      (5) Upon completing the liquidation of the corporation, the trustees shall submit to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing a statement that the corporation has been dissolved and its affairs liquidated. The trustees also shall send a true copy of the statement to the county clerk of the county in which the corporation had its principal place of business, that the corporation has been legally dissolved, and the clerk shall record the statement in the records of the office of the clerk. [Amended by 1971 c.200 §9; 1985 c.351 §23; 1987 c.94 §150; 1995 c.233 §6; 2013 c.284 §8]

      (2) If the corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State, within 45 days after notice is given, that each of the grounds that the Secretary of State has determined to be a ground for the dissolution does not exist, the Secretary of State shall dissolve the corporation.

      (3) A corporation administratively dissolved continues the corporation’s corporate existence but may not carry on any activities except activities that are necessary or appropriate to wind up and liquidate the corporation’s business and affairs and notify claimants.

      (4) The administrative dissolution of a corporation does not terminate the authority of the corporation’s registered agent.

      554.307 Reinstatement of dissolved corporation. (1) A corporation that the Secretary of State administratively dissolved under ORS 554.305 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement within five years from the date of dissolution. The application must state:

      (a) The name of the corporation and the effective date of the corporation’s administrative dissolution; and

      (b) That the ground or grounds for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated.

      (2) If the Secretary of State determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (1) of this section, that the information is correct and that the corporation’s name satisfies the requirements of ORS 554.040 (2), the Secretary of State shall reinstate the corporation.

      (3) When effective, the reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on the corporation’s business as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred.

      (4) The Secretary of State may waive the requirement under subsection (1) of this section that the corporation apply for reinstatement within five years after the date of administrative dissolution if the corporation requests the waiver and provides evidence of the corporation’s continued existence as an active concern during the period of administrative dissolution.

      554.410 Applicability of ORS 554.005 to 554.340 to corporations organized under 1911 Act. Nothing in ORS 554.005 to 554.340 shall be so construed as to affect the validity of any district improvement company organized before March 4, 1937, under the provisions of chapter 172, Oregon Laws 1911, or its rights in or to property, or any of its rights or privileges of whatsoever kind or nature; but such corporations hereby are made subject to the provisions of ORS 554.005 to 554.340 so far as applicable. The provisions of ORS 554.005 to 554.340 shall not affect, impair or discharge any contract, obligation, lien or charge for or upon which such a company was or might become liable or chargeable had those sections not been passed; nor shall they affect the validity of any bonds issued prior to March 4, 1937; nor shall they affect any action then pending. All such corporations organized after March 4, 1937, shall be organized under the provisions of ORS 554.005 to 554.340 and not otherwise. Any corporation organized before March 4, 1937, under the provisions of chapter 172, Oregon Laws 1911, which amends its articles of incorporation and landowners’ notice as provided in ORS 554.420, shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of ORS 554.005 to 554.340.

 

      554.420 Amendment of articles, and landowners’ notice, of corporation organized under 1911 Act. (1) Articles of incorporation of any district improvement company organized before March 4, 1937, under the provisions of chapter 172, Oregon Laws 1911, and the recorded notice of the owners of the lands described in such articles of incorporation, may be amended as provided in this section.

      (2) If the members desire to amend the articles of incorporation they shall execute the amended articles, stating therein that such articles are for the purpose of amending articles of the same corporation of record in the Office of the Secretary of State and in the county where the land therein described is situated; that the amended articles are signed by an officer, director or court-appointed fiduciary by authority of a resolution of the board of directors; and that such articles as amended and adopted are as therein set out. The amended articles must conform with ORS 554.040. The amended articles must describe the land with particularity and state the owners thereof and the persons having any interest therein. The board of directors shall determine whether all landowners and persons having any interest in the lands have duly executed the same.

      (3) If satisfied therewith the board of directors may, upon the execution by all landowners of the amended landowners’ notice and being satisfied therewith and that all have executed the same, by resolution authorize an officer, director or court appointed fiduciary to execute the same on behalf of the corporation. Thereupon the amended articles shall be submitted to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing. The requirements for filing a document under ORS 554.005 apply to the amended articles.

      (4) One true copy of the amended articles also shall be filed in each county where the land is situated.

      (5) The landowners’ amended notice shall be executed and recorded in the manner provided in ORS 554.180 and 554.190.

      (6) From the filing of the amended articles by the Secretary of State, the amended articles and landowners’ notice shall be effective instruments for every purpose; provided that such amended notice shall in no manner affect any lien, encumbrance, interest or estate in any of the lands attached, fixed or vested at the time of filing the same, or the priority thereof. If in such amendments it appears that the corporation is not for profit and it is so stated therein, the corporation shall thereafter pay any applicable fee under ORS 554.016. [Amended by 1971 c.200 §10; 1987 c.94 §156; 1991 c.132 §35; 2013 c.284 §11]

 

      554.430 Applicability of 1911 Act, as amended, to corporations organized under that Act. To the extent only that, by reason of the provisions of ORS 554.410, they have not been superseded, sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12, chapter 172, Oregon Laws 1911, as amended by section 2, chapter 101, Oregon Laws 1917, and by chapters 267 and 420, Oregon Laws 1927, and as supplemented by section 2, chapter 164, Oregon Laws 1923, shall remain applicable to corporations organized before March 4, 1937, under the provisions of chapter 172, Oregon Laws 1911.

 

      554.440 Malheur Improvement Company; exclusion or inclusion of land. (1) Any person holding land within the Malheur Improvement Company district created under chapter 172, Oregon Laws 1911, who desires to have the land of the person excluded from the Malheur Improvement Company district, may file a petition with the secretary of such district. The petition shall be in writing, verified, and shall set forth the description of the lands desired to be excluded, and the reasons for such exclusion. Likewise, any person owning lands without such district who desires to have the lands of the person included within the district, may file a petition with the secretary, which petition shall be in writing, verified, and shall set forth the reasons why the land should be included in the district, and further, that the lands are susceptible of irrigation or drainage, as the case may be, from the system of works of the district.

      (2) The secretary shall present any such petition at the next meeting of the board of directors of the improvement company. The board shall fix a time for the hearing thereof, either at a special meeting of the members of the corporation called for the purpose, or at the next regular annual meeting of the members. At such meeting, the petitioners may present witnesses and be represented either in person or by attorney, to establish the allegations set forth in the petition. Upon such hearing, the matter of including or excluding such lands from the district shall be put to a vote of the members, and if a majority vote of the members owning lands in the district is in favor of the relief asked for in the petition, then an order shall be made in the minutes in accordance with such vote.

      (3) The secretary shall thereupon make a certificate certifying to the fact of the filing of such petition and the hearing thereon, and the action taken by the members of the district, and in such certificate shall describe the land included or excluded from the district, as the case may be. The secretary shall submit the certificate to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing and shall file a true copy of the certificate with the county clerk of the county where the lands are situated. From and after the filing of the certificate by the Secretary of State the land described in the certificate shall be included or excluded, as the case may be, in or from the improvement company district.

      (4) The articles of incorporation of the Malheur Improvement Company shall upon the filing of the certificate by the Secretary of State, and without any procedure other than as in this section provided, be deemed amended to include or exclude, as the case may be, the lands described in such certificate; provided, however, that any land within such improvement company district, and excluded therefrom on petition, shall not be relieved from the payment of its proportion of any bonded indebtedness created and outstanding of the company, prior to the exclusion of such lands therefrom. Lands without the improvement company district, and included therein by petition, shall be subject to any assessment thereafter levied by the company, whether for bonded indebtedness or otherwise. [Amended by 1987 c.94 §157]
