      (2) If the subsequent organization does not embrace all territory embraced in the invalid organization, such taxes as have been collected from the levy upon property in areas not embraced in the subsequent organization shall be refunded to the payers thereof by the custodian of the taxes before the balance is turned over to the subsequent organization.

      (3) If no such subsequent organization is created for weather modification, within a period of two years after the entry of the judgment of invalidation, the taxes collected shall be refunded by the custodian of them to the taxpayers who paid them. [1969 c.698 §19; 2003 c.576 §522]
