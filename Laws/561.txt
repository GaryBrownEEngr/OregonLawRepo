      (c) The disease or infestation exists in another state, territory or country or in any locality within this state; and

      561.605 Detention, seizure or embargo of agricultural products; labeling; notification. (1) In order that the rights of consumers, property owners or other affected persons may be protected and procedures made uniform the State Department of Agriculture, its agents, employees or officials, shall observe the procedure prescribed by ORS 561.605 to 561.620 whenever it becomes necessary for the department to detain, seize or embargo any food, article or product under any law the administration of which is vested in the department.

      (2) The department shall cause to be affixed to the products being detained, seized or embargoed, a notice that the products are being detained, seized or embargoed by the department and warning all persons that they may not be removed from the place at which they are being held without written permission from the department.

If the person in possession of the products is not the owner, the department shall make a reasonable effort to notify the owner. Such notice shall state the reason for the department’s action, and shall notify the owner or person in possession of the right to be heard before the department in opposition to the action. [Formerly part of 616.095]

 

      561.610 Request for hearing; when held.

The request may be filed either by the owner or the person in possession but the time limited for filing such request is to be computed from the time the required notice is first received by either of such persons. When the department receives a request for a hearing, it shall designate the time and place of hearing.

      (2) The hearing shall not be held sooner than 10 days after the request for a hearing has been received by the department. However, if the subject matter of the department’s action is perishable goods, or if, in the opinion of the department, other good and sufficient reason appears, the hearing may, at the request of the owner or person in possession of such goods, be held at an earlier date.

If it appears that all or a part of the products may not be reconditioned, relabeled or segregated in such a way as to comply with state laws, that portion of the products which may not be so treated shall be destroyed, unless the owner or person in possession executes and delivers to the department a good and sufficient bond to the effect that the products shall not be sold, disposed of or used contrary to the laws of Oregon and the rules, regulations or orders thereunder promulgated. If any food products are found to be unfit for human consumption but suitable for animal feeding, such food products may be used for animal feeding as permitted by the department.

      (2) If it appears to the department that there is a reasonable possibility that a product is capable of salvage and the owner or person in possession does not seek to regain custody within the time and in the manner provided in ORS 561.605 to 561.620, the department may dispose of the product so as to obtain such salvage. Any salvage so recovered shall, after paying the costs of sale or disposition and including storage, if any, be remitted to the true owner, if known, or if not known, then to the person in possession.
