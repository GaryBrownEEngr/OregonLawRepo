COUNTY FAIRS, BOARDS AND FAIR FINANCES

 

      565.190 Financing county exhibits at state fair. A county court is authorized to appropriate out of the general fund of the county not otherwise appropriated money for the purpose of sponsoring a county exhibit at the annual state fair. This section shall not be deemed to limit the authority of a county which has adopted a charter under section 10, Article VI, Oregon Constitution. [1973 c.537 §7]

 

      565.210 County fairs; county fair board; members; appointment; term; bond or letter of credit. (1) Any county may hold county and industrial fairs, but only one county fair shall be held in each county.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 565.265, in counties holding county fairs, the county court of such county shall appoint a board consisting of not less than three nor more than seven members, to be known as the county fair board. Members of the county fair board must be residents of the county, except that the county court may elect to appoint not more than one board member who is a resident of an adjoining county. When the first members of the board are appointed under this section, one member shall be appointed for a term to expire the January next following appointment, one for a term to expire one year from the January next following appointment, and one for a term to expire two years from the January next following appointment. In addition to the three members, the county court may, at any time, appoint not more than four additional members, the fourth and sixth members to be appointed for a term to expire one year from the January next following appointment and the fifth and seventh members, if any, for a term to expire two years from the January next following appointment. Annually thereafter, at the first meeting in January, upon the expiration of the term of a member, a successor shall be appointed to serve for three years.

      (3) The court shall require each member of the board to furnish a good and sufficient bond or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 in favor of the county, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office. The bond or letter of credit for each member shall be in a sum equal to $10,000 or 20 percent of the total revenues received by the fair in the last fiscal year ending prior to the appointment of such member, whichever is the lesser amount. The bond or letter of credit when approved by the county court shall be filed with the county clerk. The premium on the bond or the fee for the letter of credit shall be paid for by the county fair board as an expense of the board.

      (4) No more than one member of the county court may serve as a member of the county fair board.

      (5) A member of a county fair board appointed under this section may be removed from office for cause as provided in ORS 565.225. [Amended by 1957 c.118 §1; 1961 c.684 §1; 1981 c.134 §1; 1985 c.716 §1; 1991 c.331 §84; 1995 c.710 §1; 1997 c.435 §2; 1997 c.631 §497; 1999 c.59 §178; 1999 c.681 §7; 2007 c.421 §1]

 

      565.220 County fair board; organization; quorum; president and secretary. (1) The members of a county fair board shall, as soon as their bonds have been filed and approved, meet and organize by electing a president and selecting a secretary.

      (2) A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of all business at meetings. In the absence of the president another member of the board shall perform the duties of the president.

      (3) The secretary provided for in subsection (1) of this section is not required to be a member of the board. The secretary shall execute a bond or furnish an irrevocable letter of credit, as required of board members by ORS 565.210. [Amended by 1953 c.675 §12; 1961 c.684 §2; 1965 c.513 §2; 1967 c.275 §2; 1991 c.331 §85]

 

      565.225 Removal of county fair board member. A member of a county fair board appointed under ORS 565.210 may be removed by the county court for inefficiency, neglect of duty, misconduct in office, incompetence, incompatibility, dereliction of duty or other good cause, as those terms may be defined by county ordinance. A member of the fair board shall not be removed by the county court until after the member receives a copy of a statement containing the cause for removal and a hearing on the removal is held. The statement shall be given to the member at least 10 days prior to the hearing, at which the member must have an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. When the county court removes a member of the fair board, a record of the proceedings, together with the cause for removal and findings thereon, shall be filed in the office of the county clerk. [1999 c.681 §2]

 

      565.230 Management of county fairs; licenses; disposition of proceeds; donations of real property; agreements for limitation of liability. (1) The county fair board has the exclusive management of the ground and all other property owned, leased, used or controlled by the county and devoted to the use of the county fair, and is entrusted and charged with the entire business management and financial and other affairs of such fair.

      (2) In order that the fairgrounds and buildings may be utilized to the fullest extent for pleasure, recreation and public benefit, the board shall at all times have the authority to provide park facilities for the public or to issue licenses and grant permits for the holding of any exhibitions, shows, carnivals, circuses, dances, entertainments or public gatherings upon the fairgrounds. During the progress of county agricultural or industrial fairs and not otherwise, any such businesses so licensed by the board shall not be required to pay license to any city or county other than to the board as provided in this section. The board shall fix the sum to be paid for such permits and licenses, which shall be issued and signed by the president and secretary of the board. The moneys received from the issuance of such permits and licenses shall be deposited to the credit of the fair fund and warrants drawn against it the same as upon the disbursement of any other fair funds.

      (3) Donations of real property for the use of the county fair shall be made by an instrument that may be accepted for recording by a county clerk. An instrument of donation shall be recorded in the records of the county clerk where deeds are located. The donated property shall be used in compliance with the express intentions and purposes set forth in the instrument of donation.

      (4) A county court may conclude that an agreement is needed to protect the county and the county court from liability relating to personnel or contractual matters. If the county court asks the county fair board to begin negotiations for an agreement, the county fair board and the county court must enter into an agreement concerning the rules, policies and procedures to be used in the conduct of fair activities for the purpose of limiting the liability of the county for personnel and contractual matters. However, if a county court determines that an agreement is unnecessary or that an existing agreement provides sufficient protection from liability, then an agreement under this subsection is not required. [Amended by 1953 c.675 §12; 1969 c.239 §4; 1969 c.693 §1; 1999 c.681 §8]

 

      565.240 Rules and regulations; peace officers; appointment and powers. The board may make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary for the proper conduct and management of their respective fairs. It may appoint such marshals or police as may be necessary to keep order and preserve the peace during the time and at the place of holding the fairs and at all other times when the board deems such appointments necessary for the preservation of the peace and the protection of public and private property upon the fairgrounds. The officers so appointed have the same authority for the preservation of order and making arrests upon the grounds as would a deputy sheriff.

 

      565.250 [Repealed by 1981 c.134 §4]

 

      565.260 Fair board or agricultural society existing prior to June 4, 1913. If there existed on June 4, 1913, a county fair board, or an agricultural society in any county holding a county fair within the county, the board shall be considered the county fair board of the county by the provisions of ORS 565.210 to 565.310, and shall be governed under the rules and bylaws already in force of the association, provided there is only one county fair held in each county. [Amended by 2005 c.22 §384]

 

      565.265 Abolishment of county fair board. (1) As provided in this section and ORS 565.268 and 565.271, a county court may abolish the county fair board appointed under ORS 565.210.

      (2) A county court may initiate proceedings to abolish the county fair board by issuing an order creating a county fair advisory committee with six members who shall all be residents of the county. Upon issuance of the order under this subsection, the county court shall appoint three members to the advisory committee and the county fair board shall appoint three members. The advisory committee shall consider the relevant issues and make recommendations concerning the abolition of the county fair board and, if abolition is recommended, the future operation of the county fair by either a fair association or a fair district. If a majority of the advisory committee agrees that abolishing the county fair board is in the best interests of the residents of the county, the advisory committee shall recommend abolition of the county fair board. If the advisory committee recommends abolition of the county fair board, the county court and the county fair board may meet to consult and negotiate concerning the future operation of the county fair and fairgrounds. If the county court and the county fair board agree that it is in the best interests of the residents of the county to have a fair association or fair district replace the county fair board, the county court may adopt a resolution that expresses the intention of the county court to abolish the county fair board, sets forth the reasons for the intended action, states that either a fair association or a fair district will replace the county fair board and declares that the abolition of the county fair board is in the best interests of the residents of the county.

      (3) A resolution adopted by a county court under subsection (2) of this section must be accompanied by a resolution adopted by the county fair board that acknowledges the proposed action of the county court and declares that abolition of the county fair board is in the best interests of the residents of the county. The resolution adopted by a county fair board under this subsection must be adopted at a regular public meeting of the county fair board and filed with the county court.

      (4) After adoption of the resolutions described in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the county court shall conduct a public hearing concerning the abolition of the county fair board at which testimony of interested persons and other evidence shall be received.

      (5) Notice of the public hearing required by subsection (4) of this section shall be published twice in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the county. The first notice shall be published between the 90th day and the 60th day before the hearing. The second notice shall be published between the 30th day and the 20th day before the hearing.

      (6) After the public hearing required by subsection (4) of this section, the county court shall consider the testimony given and the other evidence received at the hearing. If the county court determines that abolishing the county fair board is in the best interests of the residents of the county, the county court shall issue an order abolishing the county fair board and authorizing either the creation of a fair district or an agreement with a fair association for the purpose of managing and operating the county fair. The abolition of the county fair board shall be effective on the date specified in the order. [1999 c.681 §3; 2003 c.101 §1]

 

      565.268 Agreements for fair association to exercise powers of county fair board. (1) As used in this section, a “fair association” means a corporation incorporated under ORS chapter 65 that has a board of directors with at least three members and that is authorized by its articles of incorporation to exercise the powers and perform the functions exercised and performed by a county fair board under ORS 565.210 to 565.310.

      (2) If the order issued by a county court under ORS 565.265 authorizes an agreement with a fair association, the county court, before the abolition of the county fair board, shall enter into an agreement with a fair association for the management and operation of the county fair. Except as otherwise provided in the agreement, a fair association may exercise all of the powers and authority granted to a county fair board under ORS 565.210 to 565.310.

      (3) An agreement between a county court and a fair association under this section may not provide for the conveyance or other transfer of public property to the fair association unless the public property is transferred as allowed by the laws of this state. [1999 c.681 §4]

 

      565.270 [Repealed by 1959 c.579 §1]

 

      565.271 Initiation of proceedings for replacement of county fair board by fair district. If the order issued by a county court under ORS 565.265 authorizes the formation of a fair district to replace the county fair board, the county court, before the abolition of the county fair board, shall initiate the formation of the fair district by order as provided in ORS 198.835. After initiation of formation proceedings as provided in this section, a fair district may be created as provided in ORS 198.705 to 198.955 and 565.275. [1999 c.681 §5]

      (b) Sue and be sued in its name.

      (3) Five district board members shall be elected at the election for district formation. If the effective date of the formation of the district occurs in an odd-numbered year, two district board members shall be elected for four-year terms and the other three district board members shall be elected for two-year terms. If the effective date of the formation occurs in an even-numbered year, two district board members shall be elected for three-year terms and the other three district board members shall be elected for one-year terms. The district board members shall be elected at large by position number. Each district board member shall hold office until election and qualification of a successor.

      (4) ORS chapter 255 governs the nomination and election of district board members and the conduct of district elections.

Should a board decide not to hold a county fair, the county court may in its discretion expend such funds, or any portion thereof, for paying premiums upon exhibits of livestock, agricultural and horticultural products at any fair, land products show or livestock exposition held in this state.
