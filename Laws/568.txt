The Department of Revenue shall adopt rules further defining the method to be used to credit the amount.

      (3) If a district that is being dissolved does not have tax levying authority, the board of trustees shall turn over to the State Department of Agriculture any surplus moneys remaining to the credit of the district after payment of the indebtedness of the district. If the assets of the district are insufficient to pay the indebtedness, the board of trustees shall determine whether any of the indebtedness is given priority by law over other indebtedness. The board of trustees shall apply the assets of the district first to the payment of indebtedness that is given priority by law over other indebtedness. If any assets remain after the payment of indebtedness that is given priority by law, the board of trustees shall apply the assets to the payment of a uniform percentage of each remaining indebtedness.

      (4) The board of trustees may transfer any district assets, other than moneys, available after the payment of all district indebtedness to the State Department of Agriculture or to another soil and water conservation district. [2009 c.220 §20]

WIND EROSION CONTROL

 

      568.810 Purpose of ORS 568.810 to 568.890; types of wind erosion. (1) The purpose of ORS 568.810 to 568.890 is to effectuate the control of wind erosion by forming districts in which all land owners affected shall carry out wind erosion control measures whenever serious wind erosion conditions prevail.

      (2) Two types of wind erosion conditions shall be recognized:

      (a) The actual movement of soil by wind to such a degree that the topsoil is being noticeably destroyed.

      (b) Conditions which will result in a noticeable movement of the topsoil by wind action.

 

      568.820 Designation of areas by county court upon petition; description of boundaries. (1) The county court of any county east of the summit of the Cascade Mountains may designate areas as wind erosion districts when presented with a duly certified petition adequately describing the boundaries or area included in such districts and when the petition bears the signatures of two-thirds of the landowners or qualified representatives in the described district. Five such signatures shall be a minimum requirement.

      (2) Boundaries described by metes and bounds or areas described by quarter sections shall be deemed adequately described.

 

      568.830 Publication and posting of notices describing districts; when regulations are enforced. (1) The county court shall within 10 days after declaring a wind erosion district cause to be published an official notice adequately describing the district.

      (2) Each notice shall be posted in a prominent place in the county courthouse and shall be published in one or more newspapers serving the district, for two consecutive issues if weekly or two times at an interval of one week if daily or semiweekly.

      (3) Ten days after the last publication of the official notice the provisions of ORS 568.810 to 568.890 shall be enforced as set forth in ORS 568.840 to 568.890.

 

      568.840 Election of advisory board; meetings; members; functions. (1) Within 30 days after a wind erosion district has been designated by the county court the court shall cause to be posted in three public places in such wind erosion district a written or printed notice notifying the farm operators thereof to assemble at some designated convenient place on the 10th day after the date of notice at 10 a.m. for the purpose of electing four directors who shall be known as the advisory board, to serve until their successors are duly elected or appointed. Two members of the initial board shall be elected to serve for one year and two shall be elected to serve for two years. Vacancies in the advisory board shall be filled by appointment by the board.

      (2) As soon as 20 percent or more of the farm operators of the district have assembled pursuant to such notice they shall constitute a quorum to do business. Such meeting shall organize by the election of a chairperson and secretary of the meeting and then may proceed to elect four members of the advisory board. In either January or February in each year following the initial meeting, the chairperson of the advisory board shall call an annual meeting of the farm operators of the wind erosion district. At least five days before the meeting, notice of the meeting shall be given by posting in three public places in the wind erosion district a written or printed notice notifying the farm operators thereof to assemble at some designated convenient place at the appointed time for the annual meeting. At the meeting two members of the advisory board to serve for two years shall be elected. All members of the advisory board shall be farm operators of the district in which they are elected.

      (3) Within 10 days after the initial or yearly election, the advisory board shall meet and elect a chairperson and secretary from their members who shall serve until the next election. All other meetings of the advisory board shall be held as the need arises, at the call of the chairperson. Three members constitute a quorum.

      (4) The functions of the advisory board are:

      (a) To recommend to the county court a person or persons for the position of wind erosion inspector.

      (b) To consult and advise with the inspector as to the most feasible methods of effectuating wind erosion control in the district.

      (c) To act as a board of appeal when disputes arise between the wind erosion inspector and the owner or occupant of land within the district, concerning action relating to the enforcement of ORS 568.810 to 568.890. [Amended by 1959 c.278 §1]

 

      568.850 Wind erosion inspector; appointment; duties; appeal from decision; compensation; expenses. (1) The county court, upon the recommendation of the advisory board, shall appoint an inspector who shall, within the wind erosion district or districts under the supervision of the inspector:

      (a) Determine when serious wind erosion conditions prevail.

      (b) Serve notices on landowners or occupants to effectively control wind erosion on their lands or correct conditions which may allow wind erosion to occur.

      (c) When necessary, control or supervise control of wind erosion or conditions which may allow wind erosion to occur on lands where the owners or occupants thereof fail or refuse to do so.

      (2) The inspector shall be the sole judge of whether serious wind erosion conditions do or do not prevail, except that appeal from the decisions of the inspector may be made to the advisory board as provided in ORS 568.840. In case of appeal to the advisory board, the inspector shall abide by a majority decision of the advisory board.

      (3) The persons appointed wind erosion inspectors by the county court may receive for services reasonable wages, as determined by the county court, for the time actually employed in the performance of duty under the provisions of ORS 568.810 to 568.890 and may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in carrying out those provisions. All wages and expenses paid wind erosion inspectors shall be paid by the county court from funds set aside for this purpose, as provided in ORS 568.880.

 

      568.860 Inspector may enter lands in district; service of notice on owner or occupant. (1) The wind erosion inspector shall have access to all lands within the district or districts under the supervision of the inspector. If in the judgment of the inspector wind erosion is occurring or is likely to occur because proper control measures are not being practiced, the inspector shall serve a written notice to any such owner or occupant of such land, or where unable to serve such notice personally, shall post the same and two copies thereof in three conspicuous places on the land where the provisions of ORS 568.810 to 568.890 are not being complied with, bearing date of service on posting of same and a statement setting forth that work on the control of wind erosion must be commenced within five days; except that when serious blowing is actually occurring, four hours from the date of service is sufficient notice.

      (2) A copy of the notice or notices, each showing the period of grace allowed, together with proof of service indorsed thereon, shall be filed with the county court.

 

      568.870 County court may authorize inspector to control erosion; expenses of control. (1) If the owner or occupant of the land fails or refuses to control wind erosion in accordance with ORS 568.810 to 568.890, the wind erosion inspector shall at once notify the county court, and the county court shall authorize the wind erosion inspector or such assistants as the inspector may employ to go upon the land and control the wind erosion, using the most effective and practical methods which will operate with the least injury to the land or the crops thereon.

      (2) Verbal authorization by telephone from one or more members of the county court is sufficient authority for commencing wind erosion control work when actual wind erosion is occurring and when an official four-hour notice, as provided in ORS 568.860 has been served on the owner or occupant of the land.

      (3) Upon completion of the work the wind erosion inspector shall file with the county clerk an itemized statement of the expenses necessarily incurred in the control of the wind erosion, including the inspector’s own wage, if any, verified by the oath of the inspector. When the statement is filed, the county clerk shall cause the same to be entered upon a lien docket prepared for that purpose.

      (4) If such charges and expenses are not paid to the county clerk and the lien discharged by the owner or occupant of the lands within 90 days from the date the lien is docketed, the county clerk shall certify the same to the tax collector of the county, who shall extend the amount thereof upon the current tax roll, and when so extended the same shall constitute a valid lien against the premises and shall be collected by the tax collector in the same manner as taxes are collected.

      (5) If within 10 days from the date of filing and docketing the lien no objections have been filed thereto, the county court shall pay the amount thereof out of the general fund of the county to the claimants.

 

      568.880 Tax levy for wind erosion control. The county courts of the several counties may levy a tax and create a fund for the control of wind erosion on county land within the wind erosion districts and for expenses of erosion control which cannot fairly be charged to the individual landowners. The amount estimated by the county court as being sufficient for such purposes may be placed in the county budget; and after consideration at the meeting held for the purpose of passing upon the tax levy of the electors of the county, may become one of the items for which expenditure may be made during the ensuing year.

 

      568.890 District may be dissolved; disposition of district funds; change of district boundaries. (1) Any wind erosion district may be enlarged, contracted or dissolved by the county court when a petition is filed bearing the signatures of two-thirds of the landowners of the district and stating the changes in the district boundaries that are desired.

      (2) All such changes shall be described as provided in ORS 568.820. Any moneys remaining in any fund for the control of wind erosion shall, after the dissolution of all such districts in the county, be credited to the general fund of the county.
