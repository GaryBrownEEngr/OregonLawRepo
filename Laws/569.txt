CONTROL EFFORTS

 

(Generally)

 

      569.350 Necessity of eradication of weeds; cooperation in control and eradication. Noxious weeds have become so thoroughly established and are spreading so rapidly on state, county and federally owned lands, as well as on property in individual ownership and in transition to county ownership through tax delinquency, that they hereby are declared a menace to the public welfare. While it is recognized that complete eradication may not be practicable, it hereby is established that steps leading to eradication and control are necessary and that responsibility rests not only on the individual landowner and operator but also on the county, state and federal government, and that the county, state and federal government should cooperate with individual owners in the control and eradication of noxious weed pests. [Formerly 570.505]

 

      569.355 State and counties to control noxious weeds. The state and the respective counties shall control any weeds designated as noxious by the state or the respective counties in any such county on land under their respective ownerships. [Formerly 570.510]

 

      569.360 County governing body may create weed control district; petition for special weed control district. (1) The county governing body of each county may declare the county, or any portion of the lands in a county, a weed control district for the purpose of destroying such weeds and of preventing the seeding and spread of such other weeds and plants as the governing body may for the purposes of ORS 569.360 to 569.495 declare noxious.

      (2) If the county is not made a weed control district or if the county weed control district does not include all such weeds or plants desired as included as noxious, interested parties may present a petition for a special weed control district. The petition shall describe the area to be included in the special weed control district and name the noxious weeds to be destroyed or prevented from blooming and producing seed within the district, and must be signed by more than half of the landowners in the area described in the petition who also own more than half of the acreage in the area. Upon presentation of such a petition, the county governing body shall declare such area a special weed control district and such weeds noxious within the district, in accordance with the petition. [Formerly 570.515]

 

      569.370 Weed inspectors; appointment; duties; compensation. (1) The court shall, upon declaring a weed control district, appoint a weed inspector or inspectors, whose duties it shall be:

      (a) To find out if any noxious weeds or plants are being permitted to grow and produce bloom or seed within the district or districts contrary to the provisions of ORS 569.360 to 569.495;

      (b) To serve notices;

      (c) When necessary to destroy or cut or to supervise the destruction or cutting of the noxious weeds growing or seeding within the weed control district; and

      (d) To conduct investigations, approve plans and certify expenditures pertaining to weed control projects pursuant to ORS 569.480.

      (2) The person or persons appointed by the county court shall receive for their services reasonable wages, as determined by the county court, for the time actually employed in the performance of duty under ORS 569.360 to 569.495. [Formerly 570.520]

 

      569.375 Notice of district creation and weeds to be controlled. The county court shall, upon declaring a weed control district or districts, cause to be published an official notice describing each district and naming weeds to be destroyed and to be prevented from producing seed within the districts. The notice shall be published in a newspaper or newspapers, not exceeding three in number, serving the districts, in two consecutive issues if weekly, or two times at intervals of one week if daily or semiweekly. Immediately after the last publication of the official notice, the provisions of ORS 569.360 to 569.495 shall be enforced. [Formerly 570.525]

 

      569.380 Weed inspector right of entry; service of notice to eradicate weeds; department or district control measures. (1) The weed inspector shall have access to the land within the district.

      (2) When the provisions of ORS 569.360 to 569.495 are not being complied with, the weed inspector shall serve a written notice to the owner or occupant of the land. When the weed inspector is unable to serve the notice personally, the weed inspector shall post the notice and two copies thereof in three conspicuous places on the land. The notice shall contain:

      (a) The date of service or posting of notice.

      (b) The name of the weed or weeds growing on the land, and a statement setting forth that the weeds must be destroyed or must be prevented from producing seed within a specified time of not less than two days or more than 20 days, to be established by the inspector, from the date of service of the notice.

      (3) The service of notice as provided in subsection (2) of this section imposes a requirement on the owner or occupant of the land to destroy or prevent the weeds from seeding or spreading during the continuation of ownership or occupancy of the land or until the district is dissolved. A copy of the notice, together with proof of service indorsed thereon, shall be filed with the county court.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, ORS 569.370 or 569.390, with permission of the owner or occupant of land, employees of the State Department of Agriculture, or of designated weed control districts, may enter the land to identify noxious weeds and to implement or provide for the implementation of integrated noxious weed control measures, including but not limited to the application of pesticides to the land. The control or eradication of noxious weeds may be conducted with or without charge to the owner or occupant of the land. A notice as described in subsection (2) of this section is not required for the conduct of activities described in this subsection. [Formerly 570.530]

 

      569.390 Owner or occupant to eradicate weeds. Each person, firm or corporation owning or occupying land within the district shall destroy or prevent the seeding on such land of any noxious weed within the meaning of ORS 569.360 to 569.495 in accordance with the declaration of the county court and by the use of the best means at hand and within a time declared reasonable and set by the court, except that no weed declared noxious shall be permitted to produce seed. [Formerly 570.535; 2011 c.597 §233]

 

      569.395 Eradication of weeds on public lands and rights of way. The State Highway Commission, the respective county courts, reclamation districts and municipalities shall destroy or prevent the spread or seeding of any noxious weed within the meaning of ORS 569.360 to 569.495 on any land owned by them or constituting the right of way for any highway, county road, drainage or irrigation ditch, power or transmission line, or other purposes under their respective jurisdictions. [Formerly 570.540]

 

      569.400 Refusal or failure to control weeds; authorized destruction or control; quarantine; expense statement. (1) If the owner or occupant of the land fails or refuses to immediately destroy or cut the noxious weeds in accordance with ORS 569.360 to 569.495, the weed inspector shall at once notify the county court. The county court shall at once take necessary steps for enforcement of ORS 569.360 to 569.495. The county court shall authorize the weed inspector or such assistants as the weed inspector may employ to go upon the land or premises and, except as provided in this subsection, destroy the noxious weeds or control them in such manner as will destroy all seeds of such noxious weeds. If destruction or control of the weeds on any farm is in the judgment of the county weed inspector impracticable because the weeds may be too far advanced, or if for any other reason the means of control available are unsatisfactory, the weed inspector shall so notify the county court. The county court shall request the State Department of Agriculture to immediately quarantine any such uncontrolled noxious weed infested farm within the county to prevent the movement of infested crops or of livestock from such farm except under conditions prescribed in the quarantine that will prevent spread of the weeds by such crops or livestock. In all cases where the inspector undertakes to destroy or control noxious weeds, the most effective and practical method, in the judgment of the inspector, and with least injury to the land or crops, shall be used.

      (2) Upon the completion of such work the person so appointed and authorized by the county court shall file with the county clerk an itemized statement of the expenses necessarily incurred in the destruction of such weeds, including the wages of the person as provided in ORS 569.370, verified by the oath of the person. [Formerly 570.545; 2017 c.494 §2]

 

      569.410 Statement to be entered on lien docket; recovery of unpaid amount. When the statement of expenses is filed, the county clerk shall cause it to be entered upon a lien docket prepared for that purpose. The amount of the charges and expenses when so docketed shall constitute a first lien upon such lands or premises, except as to taxes. If the charges and expenses are not paid and the lien discharged by the owner or occupant of such lands within 90 days from the date the lien is docketed, the county may recover the expenses in an action at law. [Formerly 570.550]

 

      569.415 Payment for work. If within 10 days from the date of filing and docketing the lien as provided in ORS 569.400 and 569.410, no objections have been filed thereto, the county court shall pay to the person or persons appointed by the court, as provided in ORS 569.370 (1), out of the general funds of the county, the amount of such lien. [Formerly 570.555]

 

      569.420 County tax for weed control fund; expenditure. (1) The county courts of the several counties of this state hereby are required to levy a tax and create a fund to be known as the weed control fund for the control of weeds on county highways and public lands and for cooperation with individuals, state and federal agencies in controlling noxious weeds within weed control districts. The amount estimated by the county court as being sufficient for such purposes may be placed in the county budget and after consideration at the meeting held for the purpose of passing upon the tax levy by the electors of the county, may become one of the items for which expenditure may be made during the ensuing year.

      (2) When such a fund is created, it shall be expended under the supervision of the county court in such manner as to effectuate the purposes of ORS 569.360 to 569.495. [Formerly 570.560]

 

      569.425 Special assessment. Notwithstanding ORS 569.420, in addition to or in lieu of the tax authorized by ORS 569.420, a county governing body may levy a special assessment based upon benefit to finance weed control activities. All such assessments shall be treated in the same manner as the tax referred to in ORS 569.420. [Formerly 570.562]

 

      569.435 Dissolution of weed control district; disposition of funds. If in the judgment of the court the enforcement of ORS 569.360 to 569.495 in any county which has been declared a weed control district seems impracticable or likely to work injury to the people of the district, it may after a hearing declare that such weed control district no longer exists. Any special weed control district shall be declared terminated by the county court when a majority of landowners in the district, by petition or by public hearing state that they desire such district terminated for any weeds declared noxious in the district. Any moneys remaining in any fund for weed control shall, after the termination of the district, be credited to the general fund of the county. [Formerly 570.565]

 

      569.445 Duty to clean machinery before moving; weed infested residue not to be moved. No person operating or having control of any threshing machinery, clover huller, hay baler, seed cleaning or treating machinery or other machinery shall move said machinery over any public road or from one farm to another without first thoroughly cleaning it. Before moving it, all hay or bundle racks and all other equipment shall be thoroughly swept and cleaned. All hay, straw or other crop residue infested with noxious weeds under the meaning of ORS 569.360 to 569.495 having partially or fully formed seeds shall not be moved from the land on which grown to other lands not infested with any of the weeds in the field from which such crop material came. [Formerly 570.570]

 

      569.450 [Formerly 570.575; repealed by 2013 c.195 §1]

[Formerly 570.600]

 

(Grants to Counties)

 

      569.515 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (1) Noxious weeds present a serious threat that adversely affects industries vital to the Oregon economy, including but not limited to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism industries;

      (2) Failure to control the spread of noxious weeds in Oregon will reduce the productivity of Oregon industries and adversely affect marketing by those industries, resulting in a loss of business and the loss of existing jobs;

      (3) The use of aggressive measures to control the spread of noxious weeds will improve the actual and perceived quality of Oregon products and further the promotion and expansion of markets for those products; and

      (4) The control of noxious weeds through county weed control district programs will benefit Oregon’s economy by preventing the loss of existing jobs, by promoting and expanding Oregon business and by preventing the decline of Oregon business. [2011 c.392 §1]

 

      569.520 Grants for carrying out county weed control district duties; rules. (1) The State Department of Agriculture shall establish a grant program for the purpose of assisting counties in carrying out weed control district duties, functions and powers under ORS 569.360 to 569.495. After deducting department administrative expenses for the program, the department shall apply the balance of moneys received for the grant program to fund grants as described in this section.

      (2) A county qualifies for a grant under this section if the county has:

      (a) Established a weed control district under ORS 569.360 to 569.495;
