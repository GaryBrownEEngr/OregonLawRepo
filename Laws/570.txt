      (a) Within a specified time;

      (b) At the expense of the owner or responsible party who authorized the separation; and

      (2) If the owner or the agent of the owner fails to comply with the notice, the articles shall be destroyed by the officer at the expense of the owner or agent. If the articles cannot be reshipped out of the state without danger of the insect or other plant pest escaping to the orchards, vineyards, farms, gardens or ornamentals and their products of Oregon, the articles shall immediately be destroyed by, or under the direction of, the inspecting official or the person who inspected the articles. [Amended by 2015 c.203 §11]

 

      570.160 Procedure when shipment is sound, but from infected or infested area.

A notice mailed to the shipper or shippers of infested or infected articles at the return address on any such shipment of infested or infected articles is considered sufficient notice to the owner or owners thereof within the requirements of ORS 570.140 to 570.165. [Amended by 2005 c.22 §387]

 

      570.170 Department to make inspections; infected or infested matter declared public nuisance. The State Department of Agriculture, whenever the department deems necessary, shall cause an inspection to be made of any orchards, nurseries, trees, plants, vegetables, vines or field crops or any fruit packing house, storeroom, salesroom or any other place or thing within this state. Any places, orchards, nurseries, trees, plants, shrubs, vegetables, vines, fruit, field crops or articles found infested or infected with any insects or other plant pests injurious to fruits, plants, trees, vegetables, vines, grain or other field crops, or with seeds, eggs, larvae or pupae of injurious insects or other plant pests liable to spread to other places or localities, or of such a nature as to be a public danger, are declared to be a public nuisance. The department shall give the record owner or owners written notice that the articles, things or places are infested or infected. [Amended by 2015 c.203 §12]

 

      570.175 Procedure for abatement of public nuisance. (1) Whenever any public nuisance as described in ORS 570.170 exists at any place in the state on property of any owner upon whom notice has been served and who has failed or refused to abate such nuisance within the time and in the manner specified in such notice, or when any such nuisance exists on the property of a nonresident or on any property the owner of which cannot be served with notice in the manner provided in ORS 570.190, after diligent search within the county in which such nuisance exists, the State Department of Agriculture shall make a report to the district attorney of the county in which the nuisance exists, or if the nuisance exists on property which lies in two or more counties, to the district attorney of any of such counties, setting forth the description of the property upon which the nuisance exists and naming the pest or other condition which renders such property a nuisance. The district attorney shall prepare from such report and any other available information a petition to the circuit court of the county, signed in manner and form required for a complaint in a civil action, in which the property or premises sought to be declared a nuisance shall be described with reasonable certainty. The petition shall set forth the names of each owner, encumbrancer or other person interested in such property or premises so far as the same can be ascertained from the public records, and pray that the court enter an order declaring such premises or property a public nuisance and directing the abatement of such nuisance by destruction or otherwise.

      (2) Such action shall be brought in the name of the State of Oregon by the Director of Agriculture in the official capacity of director and shall proceed as an action not triable by right to a jury.

      (3) Service of summons shall be made in the manner provided for service of summons in a civil action; provided, that where service is had by publication, the period of publication required shall be shortened to once a week for two consecutive weeks, and such service by publication is deemed complete upon the expiration of 21 days from and after the date of the first publication of such notice. The person or persons so served by publication shall appear and answer within 31 days from the date of the first publication of such notice.

      (4) The court may, upon the application of any party, or upon its own motion, and for reasonable cause, adjourn the proceedings from time to time, and may order new or further notice to be given to any party whose interest may be affected.

      (5) At the time and place appointed for hearing the petition, or to which the hearing may have been adjourned, if the court has satisfactory proof that all parties interested in the property or premises have been duly served with notice as prescribed in this section, and further satisfied by competent proof that the conditions of such premises or property warrant its being declared a public nuisance, it shall enter an order condemning such property as a public nuisance and directing that the owner or other person ordered by the court shall destroy such property or abate such nuisance in such other manner as the court shall direct. If the nuisance is abated by any person other than the owner, then in the order of the court directing the abatement of the nuisance the court shall further order that an accurate account of the cost and expense necessary to the abatement be kept and a report made to the court within five days after the completion of the abatement of the nuisance. The report shall be in writing, verified by the one making it and shall be served and filed as a cost bill in a civil action. Objections to the statement, if any, shall be made, served, filed and determined as objections to a cost bill in a civil action. The judgment which orders the abatement of a nuisance shall also provide that the owner or owners of the property upon which the nuisance exists pay the expense of abating the nuisance, that it shall be a judgment lien on the property prior to all other liens and, if not paid within 60 days after the statement of expense is filed, execution may issue. [Amended by 1979 c.284 §174]

 

      570.180 Summary abatement of nuisance. Any authorized officer, employee or inspector of the State Department of Agriculture may, in any case where an urgent emergency exists, abate any public nuisance, as described in ORS 570.170, in a summary manner, doing as little damage as possible to the things or premises on which or in which such nuisance exists, with notice to the owner or owners sent by mail at or subsequent to the time of such abatement.

 

      570.185 Application of ORS 570.170 to 570.180 limited. The provisions of ORS 570.170 to 570.180 shall not be construed to apply to shipments of infested or infected articles mentioned in ORS 570.135.

Service shall be made in the following manner:

      (i) Having the care or control of the minor;

      (ii) With whom the minor resides; or

      (iii) In whose service the minor is employed.

      (d) If the owner is a person judicially declared to be of unsound mind, or incapable of conducting the affairs of the person, and for whom a guardian has been appointed, on the guardian.

      (e) If any owner is a resident of the county and personal service of the notice cannot, with diligence, be had, personal service may be made on some person of the family, above the age of 14 years, at the residence or usual place of abode of the owner.

PLANT PESTS

 

      570.210 Control of plant pests not subject to quarantine; rules. The State Department of Agriculture may adopt rules requiring the use of measures to control the spread of a specific plant pest that is not the subject of a quarantine if:

      (1) Failure to control the plant pest will have an identifiable effect on plants, with a resulting unacceptable level of economic impact in the state; and

      (2) The measures required by the department are of a type proven effective to achieve the control levels determined by the department for the plant pest. [2009 c.98 §5]

 

      570.215 Prohibition against movement of plant pests; permits; rules. (1) A person may not possess or knowingly move a plant pest within this state unless the person possesses:

      (b) A State Department of Agriculture permit authorizing the possession or movement.

      (2) The State Department of Agriculture may not issue a permit to possess or move a plant pest unless the department determines that the proposed possession or movement will not create a hazard to agricultural, forest or horticultural interests within the state or to the environmental quality of the state.

      (3) If the department issues a permit to move a plant pest, the permittee must ensure that a copy of the permit is affixed to or accompanies the shipping container, box, package or other receptacle containing the plant pest. The department may adopt rules governing the attachment or accompaniment. [2009 c.98 §6]

 

      570.220 Research regarding plant pests. The State Department of Agriculture may conduct research to prevent the introduction or spread of plant pests into or within the state.

The methods may be established or introduced if the director or chief considers control or eradication to be possible and practicable. [Amended by 2015 c.203 §14]

 

      570.310 Cooperation with interested groups and agencies. (1) The Director of Agriculture, and the chief of the division of plant industry, may cooperate with any group of citizens, municipalities and counties in the state, Oregon State University, the extension service, the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, and such agencies as the director designates to carry out the provisions of this section and ORS 570.305.

      (2) The director, acting by and through the chief of the division of plant industry, may in the discretion of the director, provide funds, labor, materials and supplies for the purposes of this section and ORS 570.305.

 

      570.320 Horticultural inspectors to prevent introduction of diseased matter into state. It is the special duty of all officers, employees and deputies to whom the duty to act as horticultural inspectors is assigned, to inspect nursery stock, trees, shrubs, plants, fruits, bulbs and vegetables and other articles mentioned in ORS 570.320 to 570.330, coming from points within the state, and to enforce the provisions of ORS 570.320 to 570.330 and all other horticultural laws of the state relating thereto. Any such officer, employee or deputy of the State Department of Agriculture also shall have all the duties, powers and rights of a county horticultural inspector and are granted jurisdiction to act throughout the state.

 

      570.325 Collaboration with federal department. The officers, employees and inspectors of the State Department of Agriculture and county inspectors are authorized to collaborate with the United States Department of Agriculture in all matters relating to the inspection of nursery stock, plants, fruits, vegetables, bulbs, seeds or other plant products shipped into this state from foreign countries or from other states or territories.

 

      570.330 Containers and wrappers to be labeled. Each carload, case, box, package, crate, bundle, or bale of trees, shrubs, plants, vines, cuttings, grafts, scions, buds, fruit pits, fruit or vegetables imported or brought into this state shall have plainly and legibly marked thereon in a conspicuous manner and place, the name and address of the person, firm or corporation shipping the same and the name and address of the consignee; also the name of the country, state or territory where the contents were grown and must show that it contains nursery stock, seedlings or seeds.

 

      570.335 Prunings and cuttings to be burned. No person, firm or corporation owning or operating any nursery, fruit orchard of any kind, hopyards, flower gardens or ornamental trees shall throw any cuttings or prunings or parts of any fruit trees, nursery stock, ornamental trees, or hop vines into any public road, highway, lane, field or other enclosure, or into any watercourse of any kind; but shall destroy such cuttings or prunings or parts with fire within a reasonable time, except when infested or infected with a contagious pest or disease. Such infested or infected prunings, cuttings or parts shall immediately be destroyed by fire.

 

      570.345 Spraying or destroying infested or infected matter; notice. Any person, firm or corporation owning or operating a nursery, fruit orchard, hopyard, flower garden or ornamental trees, and knowing the nursery, fruit orchard, hopyard, flower garden or ornamental trees to be infested or infected with any kind of insect or other plant pest that is or may become a menace to horticultural or farm crops, or on being served with a written notice by the State Department of Agriculture that the nursery, fruit orchard, hopyard, flower garden or ornamental trees are infested or infected, shall immediately spray or destroy the nursery, fruit orchard, hopyard, flower garden or ornamental trees as the department directs. [Amended by 2005 c.22 §388; 2015 c.203 §15]

 

      570.350 Traffic in infested or infected fruit prohibited; seizure; failure of owner to show fruit; sale to canneries and factories permitted. (1) A person may not import into this state, transport within this state or sell or offer for sale by displaying in stores, in or at fruit stands, along public highways or in any other manner within this state fruit that is infested with any insect or other plant pest. The fact that any fruit bears the marks of scale, insects or disease or is worm eaten, in excess of tolerances permitted by the State Department of Agriculture, is prima facie evidence that the fruit is infested or infected.

      (2) If an inspector, or other authorized person of the department, making an inspection of fruit finds that the fruit does not meet the requirements of this section or of other provisions of law, the inspector or other authorized person shall place a seizure on the fruit and immediately serve written notice of the seizure upon the owner or person having possession. The owner or person having possession may not sell or dispose of the seized fruit or move the seized fruit from the place of location provided for in the notice of seizure without written permission from the inspector. The failure of the person in possession of the seized fruit to show the fruit in possession, or a written release signed by a person authorized by the department, is prima facie evidence that the owner or person having possession of the fruit at the time of seizure has violated the provisions of this section.

      (3) In addition to the penalties provided for in ORS 570.990, fruit seized for violation of this section shall:

      (a) Be disposed of by court order or by consent of the owner or person in possession; or

      (b) Be destroyed by the inspector making the seizure or by other persons authorized by the department, by burning or by other means that will completely eradicate the insect or other plant pest, without compensation to the owner, agent or person in possession of the fruit, if it reasonably appears to the inspector or other authorized person that the infestation presents an immediate danger of spreading the insects or other plant pests to orchard or farm crops in this state.

      (4) Infested or infected fruit may be sold to evaporators, fruit canneries, fruit product factories or other by-product factories if:

      (a) The fruit is used solely for the production of manufactured fruit products, beverages or other manufactured products or by-products; and

      (b) The nature of the infestation or infection is not such as to make the article of food or beverage manufactured from the fruit unhealthful or unfit for use as a food or beverage.

      (5) The sale of fruit under subsection (4) of this section is subject to grades and regulations adopted by the department. [Amended by 2015 c.203 §16]

 

      570.355 Packing or delivery for shipment of infected fruit is misdemeanor; manufacture into by-product permitted. Each person who packs or prepares for shipment to any point within this state, or who delivers or causes to be delivered to any express agent or railroad agent or other person or to any transportation company or corporation for shipment to any point outside of this state, any fresh, cured or dried fruit infected with insects or other plant pests injurious to trees, shrubs, plants, fruits or vegetables is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section does not prevent the grower of infected fruit grown within this state from manufacturing the fruit into a by-product or selling and shipping the fruit to a by-product factory. [Amended by 2015 c.203 §17]

 

      570.360 Department to present evidence of violations; prosecution in justice court. The State Department of Agriculture shall present evidence of violation of any provision of ORS 564.020, 570.010 to 570.050, 570.125, 570.320, 570.335 to 570.355, and 632.490 to the district attorney for the county in which any such violation may occur.

The inspector shall be paid out of the general funds of the county such wages as are fixed by the county court or board of county commissioners.

 

      570.425 Inspector has access to land in area; refusal to comply with control area order. (1) The control area inspector has access to the land within the control area that is within the county for which the inspector was appointed.

      (2) In the event an owner or occupant of any land fails or refuses to treat the trees, plants or their produce as provided by the control area order, the inspector shall at once notify the appointing authority of such fact and they shall authorize the inspector and such assistants as the inspector may employ to go upon the land or premises and treat the trees, plants or their produce thereon. The most effective and practical method as approved by the Director of Agriculture shall be used.

 

      570.430 Procedure for collection of expenses incurred by inspector. (1) On the completion of the work, the inspector shall file with the county clerk an itemized statement of expenses necessarily incurred in the operation, including the wages of the inspector for time spent therein, both on the preparation and completion of the operation, verified by the oath of the inspector. When such statement is filed, the county clerk shall cause the same to be entered upon a lien docket prepared for that purpose. The amount of the expenses when so docketed shall constitute a first lien upon such land and premises, except as to taxes. The county court or board of county commissioners shall hear and promptly decide any objection to the amount of expenses assessed.

      (2) If the expenses are not paid and the lien discharged by the owner or occupant of the lands within 90 days from the date the lien is docketed, the county may recover the expenses in an action at law. [Amended by 1991 c.459 §436]
