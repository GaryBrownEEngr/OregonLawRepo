      (1) Any person whose business consists only of retail sales to the ultimate consumer and the total of such sales of nursery stock does not exceed $250 during a fiscal year. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the provisions of ORS 564.040, 564.991, 571.005 to 571.230 and 571.991 apply at any time the sales of nursery stock exceed $250 during a fiscal year.

[1963 c.461 §15; 1971 c.756 §1; 1975 c.110 §1; 1977 c.638 §2; 1999 c.535 §1; 2007 c.541 §6]

 

      571.050 [Repealed by 1963 c.461 §34]

 

      571.055 License required to grow or deal in nursery stock; false representations or statements regarding licenses. (1) No person, without first obtaining a license from the State Department of Agriculture, shall:

      (a) Operate as a grower, dealer or agent.

      (b) Advertise or display nursery stock for sale on any stand, market stall, store or other place of business.

      (c) Advertise nursery stock for sale by the use of signboards, placards, public communications media, newspapers, business letterhead stationery or other circulating medium.

      (d) Transport, move, store or warehouse nursery stock grown or held for sale. However, this paragraph does not apply to common carriers.

      (2) No person shall:

      (a) Falsely represent that the person is a licensed grower, dealer or agent.

      (b) Willfully make a false statement when making an application for a license. [1963 c.461 §§5,9]

 

      571.057 License application; contents; fee; assessments. (1) Each person required to be licensed by ORS 571.055 shall apply for a license, or for renewal of a license, on a form furnished by the State Department of Agriculture, that contains:

      (a) The name and address of the applicant, the number of locations to be operated by the applicant and the addresses of those locations, and the assumed business name of the applicant;

      (b) If other than an individual, a statement whether the applicant is a partnership, corporation or other organization;

      (c) The gross dollar volume of sales or purchases of nursery stock by the applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year; and

      (d) The type of business to be operated and, if applicant is an agent, the principals the applicant represents.

      (2) Each application for a license must be accompanied by a license fee as provided for by this section and any amounts required by ORS 571.075 (3). An application is not a public record but is subject to audit and review by the department. An applicant for an original license or for a renewal license, without a full calendar year of prior nursery stock sales or purchase experience upon which to base the fees, shall base the fees on an estimated annual gross dollar volume of sales or purchases of nursery stock by the applicant. Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 571.075, upon application by the person for a renewal of license for a subsequent year, the fees for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual annual gross dollar volume of sales or purchases of nursery stock by the applicant. Any additional fees found to be due must be paid to the department at the time of application for renewal of license. The department shall refund any overpayment found to be due the applicant.

      (3)(a) The department shall establish the license fees for growers and dealers after consulting with the State Nursery Research and Regulatory Committee and after public hearing in accordance with ORS chapter 183. The department shall establish the fees on the basis of annual gross dollar volume of sales or purchases of nursery stock within Oregon for the calendar year immediately preceding the license period.

      (b) The license fees may not be less than $65 or more than $40,000. The millage rate may not be less than one-tenth mill or more than 10 mills. The department shall establish the fees in an amount sufficient to allow the department to administer and enforce the provisions of ORS 564.040, 564.991, 571.005 to 571.230 and 571.991.

      (c) In addition to and at the time of payment of the annual license fee, growers and dealers shall pay assessments for the expenses of carrying out the provisions of ORS 571.230 (2) and (3). Dealers shall pay 0.0002 times the gross dollar purchases in the previous license year. Growers shall pay 0.0002 times the gross dollar sales in the previous license year. The assessment may not be less than $10.

      (4) For florists and landscape contracting businesses, dealer and agent fees must be computed on the basis of gross purchases of plants. For greenhouse operators and growers, including persons collecting native plants, fees must be computed on the basis of gross sales of plants or sales value of plants produced in Oregon.

      (5) Each grower or dealer is entitled to one sales location under the license of the grower or dealer. Each additional sales location, yard, branch store, stall or peddling vehicle maintained by the grower or dealer requires the payment of the full license fee for each of the additional sales outlets. A grower who is also a dealer shall be licensed only as a grower. [1971 c.756 §6; 1977 c.638 §3; 1985 c.659 §1; 1993 c.683 §3; 2007 c.71 §178; 2007 c.541 §7; 2015 c.533 §2]

 

      571.059 License fee surcharge. (1) As used in this section, “dealer” and “grower” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 571.005.

      (2) The State Department of Agriculture shall make a yearly determination of the additional amount, if any, required to achieve a principal balance of $250,000 in the Plant Pest and Disease Emergency Response Fund. If the department determines that an additional amount is required to achieve a principal balance of $250,000, the department shall determine an assessment rate based on the additional amount required to achieve the $250,000 fund balance and the total in the previous license year of gross dollar purchases by dealers, gross dollar sales by growers and sales value of plants produced in Oregon by licensees under ORS 571.057 other than dealers or growers.

      (3) The department may impose a surcharge on license fees established pursuant to ORS 571.057. The surcharge for a licensee shall be calculated based on the assessment rate determined under subsection (2) of this section and the purchase, sales or sales value volume that is the basis for the license fee assessed to the licensee under ORS 571.057. Surcharges imposed under this subsection shall be deposited to the fund.

      (4) The department shall apply for any federal funding available and may seek gifts, grants and donations for the purpose of increasing or replenishing the fund balance or avoiding expenditures from the fund. [2005 c.540 §2]

 

      Note: 571.059 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 571 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

(1) Upon receipt of a fee established by the State Department of Agriculture, the department may issue a temporary nursery sale license for the holding of a nursery stock sale conducted by, or for the benefit of, a duly registered nonprofit organization, where such sale does not exceed seven consecutive days.

      (2) Application for a temporary nursery sale license shall be made on a form furnished by the department, and shall be accompanied by the license fee. A separate application and license fee is required for each sale.

      (3) The department may prescribe the conditions of such temporary nursery sales license, which conditions shall be stated in the license. Any such license may be revoked or suspended by the department for violation of any of the conditions stated therein. ORS 571.005 to 571.230 and 571.991 shall not be applicable to such temporary nursery sales except as provided in this section.

      (4) The department shall establish the fee described in subsection (1) of this section by rule. The department shall establish the fee at a level sufficient to cover the costs to the department associated with issuing the temporary nursery sale license, but not more than $50. [1971 c.756 §8; 2009 c.98 §25]

      (2) Failure to pay the fees when due forfeits the right to operate as a grower, dealer or agent.

      (3) Any person who has been previously licensed to grow or sell nursery stock and whose right to grow or sell has been forfeited shall not be issued a renewal license except upon written application to the department accompanied by a sum of money equal to the regular license fee, as provided in ORS 571.057.

      (3) If the license has not expired, an agent may revive the license by giving notice to the department that the agent is again acting as an agent.
