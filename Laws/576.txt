      576.054 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Commodity industries are vital elements of the state economy. Commodity industries:

      (C) Encourage responsible stewardship of valuable land and marine resources; and

      (D) Produce substantial quantities of necessary food for the state, nation and world.

      (b) Commodity commissions support commodity industries and enhance and preserve the economic interests of the state.

      (c) Commodity commissions function in the same manner as a broad range of other programs established by the Legislative Assembly that are funded by the public through fees assessed according to the relationship of the fee payer to a particular program.

      (d) Commodity commissions are not established to benefit individual persons engaged in commodity industries, but are intended to improve the overall conditions for the particular commodity for which a commission is established and thereby benefit the overall economy of the state and all the citizens of the state.

      (e) Mandated cooperative efforts engaged in by commodity commissions are a proven, effective method to avoid economic waste and maintain stable agricultural markets.

      (f) It is in the public interest that:

      (A) Support for Oregon’s commodity industries be clearly expressed;

      (B) Adequate protection be given to commodities and commodity uses, activities and operations; and

      (C) Each commodity be promoted individually and as part of a stabilized comprehensive industry by increasing consumption of commodities in this state and the United States and internationally.

      (2) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that commodity commissions do the following for the purpose of serving commodity industries and the citizens of this state:

      (a) Participate in the formulation and implementation of public policy through expressive activities.

      (b) Reflect a continuing commitment by the state to commodity industries that are integral to the economy of this state.

      (c) Represent a policy of support for persons engaged in commodity industries and for their critical role in the economy of this state, especially the economy of rural areas.

      (d) Provide benefits to entire commodity industries and all the citizens of this state.

      (e) Enhance the image of Oregon commodities for the purpose of increasing the overall demand for those commodities. To achieve that purpose, the Legislative Assembly intends that commodity commissions operate primarily to create a more receptive environment for commodities and for the individual efforts of persons engaged in commodity industries and thereby complement individual, targeted and specific activities.

      (f) Use mandatory cooperative efforts to complement state, federal and international laws and programs.

      (g) Protect the citizens of this state by educating them regarding the quality, care and methods used in the production of Oregon commodities.

      (h) Increase knowledge regarding the healthful qualities and dietetic value of Oregon commodities.

      (i) Support and engage in research programs and activities that benefit the planting, production, harvesting, handling, processing, marketing and use of Oregon commodities. [2003 c.604 §2]

      (b) A commission may assess, levy and collect a differential assessment, the amount of which the commission shall determine, based on the intended use, type or variety of the commodity.

      (c) All casual sales of the commodity made by the producer direct to the consumer are exempt from the assessment.

      (d) A commission may, by rule, define and regulate handling, processing and casual sales.

      (3) The amount of the assessment provided for in subsection (2) of this section is limited as follows:

      (a) If a commission assesses on a unit basis, the assessment may not exceed one and one-half percent of the industry average unit price. The commission may determine the industry average unit price by considering data and estimates of the United States Department of Agriculture, Oregon State University or other reliable sources.

      (b) If a commission assesses on a percentage of dollar value basis, the assessment may not exceed one and one-half percent of the dollar value received by a producer for the raw commodity. If the dollar value received by a producer is not otherwise determinable, the commission may establish the dollar value based on the industry average unit price for that year for the raw commodity.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section:

      (a) The maximum assessment by the Oregon Clover Seed Commission may not exceed one and one-half percent of the industry average unit price for products within the same market category, if assessed on a unit basis.

      (b) The maximum assessments by the Oregon Albacore Commission and the Oregon Tall Fescue Commission may not exceed three percent of the industry average unit price if assessed on a unit basis or three percent of the value received by a producer for the raw commodity if assessed on a percentage of dollar value basis.

      (e) The maximum assessment by the Oregon Hop Commission may not exceed two percent of the industry average unit price if assessed on a unit basis.

      (f) The assessment by the Oregon Sheep Commission may not be less than $0.50 or more than $1 per head. The commission may not increase the assessment by more than $0.10 during any 12-month period. Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the commission may levy the assessment on any sheep produced and sold in this state regardless of the disposition of the sheep and regardless of whether the sale is a casual sale. This paragraph does not allow the commission to apply an assessment to a transaction that occurs prior to the effective date of the rule adopting the assessment.

      (5) A commission shall assess and levy an assessment under subsections (2) to (4) of this section to the producer at the time and in the manner provided by the commission by rule. The commission is the owner of a collected assessment. A person who collects an assessment holds the assessment in trust for the benefit of the commission and the state and shall remit the assessment in the time and manner required by the commission under ORS 576.335.

      (6) Notwithstanding subsection (5) of this section, a commission may assess, levy and collect an assessment from a first purchaser at the time and in the manner provided by the commission by rule. Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, the assessment may not exceed the limits described in subsections (3) and (4) of this section.

      (7) A regional commission may assess, levy and collect an assessment only on the commodity produced in the counties in which the regional commission functions.

      (2) A commission may waive the penalty and interest described in subsection (1) of this section upon a showing of good cause.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if an assessment is collected pursuant to a federal marketing order or agreement, a commission may establish a penalty or interest rate that is consistent with that order or agreement. [1953 c.489 §28; 2003 c.604 §42]

(1) A commodity producer may dispute the amount of a commodity assessment levied against the producer on a unit basis under ORS 576.325 if the total assessment levied against the producer during an assessment period established by commodity commission rule exceeds the total dollar value received by the producer for the raw commodity during that assessment period multiplied by the maximum lawful assessment percentage.

      (2) A commodity producer who disputes the amount of a commodity assessment as provided under subsection (1) of this section must file any challenge to the assessment with the appropriate commodity commission no later than 60 days after the close of the assessment period. The challenge must be on a form provided by the State Department of Agriculture. A commodity commission shall process a challenge under this section as provided by rules adopted under subsection (4) of this section.

      (3) A commodity producer filing a challenge under this section bears the burden of proving the total dollar value received by the producer during the assessment period. If the producer acts as a handler or processor for all or part of the producer’s commodity production, the producer also bears the burden of proving that the prices paid to the producer are equivalent to prices paid in arm’s-length transactions. A commodity commission shall refund the amount of the assessment that the producer proves is in excess of the total dollar value received by the producer for the raw commodity during the assessment period multiplied by the maximum lawful assessment percentage.

      (4) The department shall adopt necessary and proper uniform rules for commodity commissions to carry out this section. The department rules shall include, but need not be limited to, procedures for the filing, processing and formal or informal resolution of challenges and for determining commodity prices paid in arm’s-length transactions. A commodity commission shall adopt rules establishing assessment periods and may adopt supplemental rules that do not conflict with the rules of the department.

      (3) A budget prepared for a transition period must be submitted for public comment, adopted and approved separately from the budget prepared for the subsequent fiscal year. ORS 576.416 and this subsection do not prohibit a commission from submitting a transition period budget and fiscal year budget for separate public comment or adoption at the same public meeting.

      (4) This section does not authorize the use of a fiscal year that begins January 1 and ends December 31 by any entity that:

The budget also must show the actual receipts and expenditures by or under the authority of the commission for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the proposed budget is prepared, if any, and the estimated receipts and expenditures by or under the authority of the commission for the fiscal year in which the budget is prepared, if any.

      (3) Estimated receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year for which the budget is adopted must be fully itemized and be prepared and arranged to clearly show each item of receipts and expenditures. To the extent practicable, the items of receipts and expenditures must be arranged under major groups or categories that are the same as the most recent classifications of revenue and expenditures established pursuant to ORS 291.206.

      (4) The budget shall contain only one estimate for emergency or other expenditures that are unforeseen at the time the budget is prepared.

      (5) A commission shall call and hold at least one public meeting upon the proposed budget. In selecting a time and place for a meeting, a commission shall be guided by consideration for the convenience of the majority of the producers of the commodity.

If the director determines that the budget fails to meet the requirements in any respect, the director shall immediately notify the commission of the particular failures. The commission shall promptly take all practicable measures to remedy the failures and shall resubmit a copy of the budget to the director for examination. The director shall retain the certified copy of the final budget and make the budget available for public inspection during normal business hours of the State Department of Agriculture.

      (d) Unless expressly provided otherwise in a seed production contract that is authenticated by the producer and seed dealer prior to the producer planting the agricultural seed, the minimum period for an initial contract is two years. This paragraph does not establish a minimum period for an extension or renewal that follows an initial contract period.

      (2) It is an implied condition of any price or payment requirement described in subsection (1) of this section that the producer is performing, or has completed performance, in accordance with the seed production contract and has not otherwise breached the contract.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a seed production contract described in this section may contain any additional terms agreed to by the parties.

      (4) If a seed production contract is extended or renewed, for the extension or renewal period the parties may:

      Note: See note under 576.715.

 

      576.721 Payment due date provisions in contracts authenticated prior to planting. (1) A seed production contract that is authenticated by the producer and seed dealer prior to the producer planting the agricultural seed may contain payment due date terms that differ from the payment due date terms described in ORS 576.718 (1)(b) if the contract:

      (a) Provides for the price of the seed to be determined no later than March 15 of the calendar year following harvesting of the seed;

      (2) Payments due from a seed dealer to a producer under the terms of a seed bailment contract, or due to a seed grower under the terms of a seed purchase contract, are subject to lien under ORS 87.226 and to security interests perfected as provided under ORS chapter 79. [2011 c.356 §4]

      (c) The amount of grass seed to be purchased; and

      (d) The species, cultivars and quality standards of the grass seed to be purchased.

      (2) If the seed purchase contract does not settle the price of the grass seed, the contract is enforceable and price shall be determined as described in ORS 72.3050 (1) to (3). A seed purchase contract must require the seed dealer to make payment to the seed grower within 30 days after seed delivery. However, upon written mutual agreement of the seed grower and the seed dealer, the grower may extend the period available for the dealer to make payment. [2011 c.356 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 576.715.

 

      576.732 Contract modification; damages for breach. (1) A party to a seed production contract or seed purchase contract may not, as a condition of performance, require the other party to agree to a material modification of the contract.

      (2) In any action to recover damages for breach of a seed production contract or seed purchase contract, if the court finds that a party to the contract failed to act in good faith as defined in ORS 71.2010, the court may award the prevailing party court costs and reasonable attorney fees. [2011 c.356 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 576.715.

 

      576.735 Seed not meeting quality standards. (1) If testing as provided under a seed production contract establishes that agricultural seed does not meet the quality standards set forth in the contract, the producer may at any time send the test results to the seed dealer and inquire whether the seed dealer intends to purchase the seed. If, within 30 days after the seed dealer receives the test results and inquiry from the producer, the seed dealer delivers a response informing the producer that the seed dealer intends to purchase the seed, the response is an accord that forms a seed purchase contract for the seed purchased under this subsection. Except as provided in this subsection regarding price, the parties may establish the terms of the seed purchase contract as provided under ORS 576.729. The price of the seed that is subject to the seed purchase contract shall be:

      (a) Any price stated in the seed production contract for seed not meeting quality standards;

      (b) If not determined by the seed production contract, any price agreed to by the parties; or

      (c) If not determined by the seed production contract or by agreement, the market price for seed of the same kind and quality as the produced seed. However, a seed price established by the use of market price may not exceed any price established in the seed production contract for seed that meets quality standards.

      (2) An accord that creates a seed purchase contract under subsection (1) of this section does not affect the terms of a seed production contract for any seed that was not described in the test results and inquiry sent by the producer.

      (3) A producer may send test results and make an inquiry under subsection (1) of this section in any manner that documents seed dealer receipt of the test results and inquiry. A seed dealer may send a response under subsection (1) of this section to a producer in any manner that documents producer receipt of the response.

      (4) If, within 30 days after the seed dealer receives the test results and inquiry from the producer, the seed dealer has not delivered a response informing the producer that the seed dealer intends to purchase the seed, the seed dealer is deemed to have refused purchase of the seed and to have authorized the producer to sell the seed in a commercially reasonable manner as “Variety Not Stated Seed.” This subsection does not authorize the sale of any seed, seed stock or plant life of a protected variety grown or used by the producer other than a sale of seed as “Variety Not Stated Seed.” The remedy provided under this subsection is in addition to any other remedy available to a producer by law. An authorization for sale arising under this subsection is in addition to any other conditional or unconditional authorization for sale that a seed dealer may grant to a producer. [2011 c.356 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 576.715.

 

      576.738 Seed dealer failure to timely make payment; fee. (1) If a seed dealer fails to pay a producer for agricultural seed when payment is due under a seed production contract or fails to pay a seed grower for grass seed when payment is due under a seed purchase contract, the producer or seed grower may notify the State Department of Agriculture. Upon notification by a producer or seed grower, the department shall determine whether payment has been made when due. If the department determines that the seed dealer has not made a payment that is due under a seed production contract or seed purchase contract, the department shall notify the seed dealer in writing that the dealer has 30 days to pay the producer or seed grower all delinquent amounts plus interest on each delinquent amount at the rate of one percent per month simple interest from the final payment date for that delinquent amount.

      (2) A seed production contract or seed purchase contract may not vary the terms of the remedy provided by this section. A seed dealer may appeal the notice given by the department under this section as provided in ORS chapter 183. This section does not prevent a producer or seed grower from filing a notice of lien against a seed dealer.

      (3) If a seed dealer fails to make payment as required by a notice given by the department under this section, the department shall suspend any seed dealer license issued to the dealer until the dealer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that the dealer is current on all payments due to all producers and seed growers. An order suspending a license under this subsection is subject to ORS chapter 183. However, the department may not suspend a seed dealer license under this section using the procedure described in ORS 183.430 (2).

      (4) A seed dealer that fails to make payment on a seed production contract or seed purchase contract as required by a notice given by the department under this section is considered to have authorized the producer or seed grower to sell in a commercially reasonable manner any seed from the contract that is still in the possession of the producer or seed grower. This subsection does not prevent a seed dealer from giving consent to the producer or seed grower by other means and does not supersede the terms of a consent given by other means.

      (5) The department may charge a producer or seed grower a fee, not to exceed $50, for determining whether payment has been made in accordance with the terms of a seed production contract or seed purchase contract. The department may charge a producer or seed grower a fee, not to exceed $200, for notifying a seed dealer in writing regarding the deadline for payment of delinquent amounts plus interest. [2011 c.356 §8]

 

      Note: See note under 576.715.

      (3) The department may refuse to issue a seed dealer license to an applicant if the applicant, any owner or officer of the applicant or any individual exercising substantial control over the seed industry activities of the applicant:

      (a) Is a seed dealer for which the license has been suspended under ORS 576.738;

      Note: See note under 576.780.

 

      576.786 Payment due date terms in contracts authenticated prior to planting. (1) A seed production contract that is authenticated by the producer and seed dealer prior to the producer planting the other seed may contain payment due date terms that differ from the payment due date terms described in ORS 576.783 (1)(b) if the contract states the date by which final payment for the other seed is due.

      (2) If a seed production contract that is authenticated by the producer and seed dealer prior to the producer planting the other seed does not contain the information required under subsection (1) of this section, notwithstanding any contrary payment due date terms stated in the contract, the payment due date terms of the contract are subject to ORS 576.783 (1)(b).

      Note: See note under 576.780.

 

      576.789 Seed bailment contracts and seed purchase contracts; title; lien. (1) A seed bailment contract or seed purchase contract does not create a possessory security interest in goods under ORS chapter 79. For a seed bailment contract, filing, recording or notice of the contract is not a requirement for establishing, during the term of the contract, the validity of the contract or for establishing and confirming in the seed dealer the title to all seed, seed stock and plant life grown or used by the producer under the terms of the contract.

      (2) Payments due from a seed dealer to a producer under the terms of a seed bailment contract, or due to a seed grower under the terms of a seed purchase contract, are subject to lien under ORS 87.226 and to security interests perfected as provided under ORS chapter 79. [2018 c.26 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 576.780.

 

      576.792 Terms of seed purchase contract. (1) The terms of a seed purchase contract must include:

      (d) The species, cultivars and quality standards of the other seed to be purchased.

      (2) If the seed purchase contract does not settle the price of the other seed, the contract is enforceable and price shall be determined as described in ORS 72.3050 (1) to (3). A seed purchase contract must require the seed dealer to make payment to the seed grower within 30 days after seed delivery. However, upon written mutual agreement of the seed grower and the seed dealer, the grower may extend the period available for the dealer to make payment. [2018 c.26 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 576.780.

 

      576.795 Modification of contract; damages for breach. (1) A seed dealer that requests modification to the payment terms of a seed production contract for other seed shall pay an amount equal to at least 25 percent of the value of the contract prior to modification of the contract.

      (2) A party to a seed production contract or seed purchase contract may not, as a condition of performance, require the other party to agree to a material modification of the contract. A contract modification obtained in violation of this subsection is unenforceable.

      (3) In any action to recover damages for breach of a seed production contract or seed purchase contract, if the court finds that a party to the contract failed to act in good faith as defined in ORS 71.2010, the court may award the prevailing party court costs and reasonable attorney fees. [2018 c.26 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 576.780.

 

      576.798 Seed not meeting contract quality standards. (1) If testing as provided under a seed production contract establishes that other seed does not meet the quality standards set forth in the contract, the producer may at any time send the test results to the seed dealer and inquire whether the seed dealer intends to purchase the seed. If, within 30 days after the seed dealer receives the test results and inquiry from the producer, the seed dealer delivers a response informing the producer that the seed dealer intends to purchase the seed, the response is an accord that forms a seed purchase contract for the seed purchased under this subsection. Except as provided in this subsection regarding price, the parties may establish the terms of the seed purchase contract as provided under ORS 576.792. The price of the seed that is subject to the seed purchase contract shall be:

      (a) Any price stated in the seed production contract for seed not meeting quality standards;

      (b) If not determined by the seed production contract, any price agreed to by the parties; or

      (c) If not determined by the seed production contract or by agreement, the market price for seed of the same kind and quality as the produced seed. However, a seed price established by the use of market price may not exceed any price established in the seed production contract for seed that meets quality standards.

      (2) An accord that creates a seed purchase contract under subsection (1) of this section does not affect the terms of a seed production contract for any seed that was not described in the test results and inquiry sent by the producer.

      (3) A producer may send test results and make an inquiry under subsection (1) of this section in any manner that documents seed dealer receipt of the test results and inquiry. A seed dealer may send a response under subsection (1) of this section to a producer in any manner that documents producer receipt of the response.

      (4) If, within 30 days after the seed dealer receives the test results and inquiry from the producer, the seed dealer has not delivered a response informing the producer that the seed dealer intends to purchase the seed, the seed dealer is deemed to have refused purchase of the seed and to have authorized the producer to sell the seed in a commercially reasonable manner as “Variety Not Stated Seed.” This subsection does not authorize the sale of any seed, seed stock or plant life of a protected variety grown or used by the producer other than a sale of seed as “Variety Not Stated Seed.” The remedy provided under this subsection is in addition to any other remedy available to a producer by law. An authorization for sale arising under this subsection is in addition to any other conditional or unconditional authorization for sale that a seed dealer may grant to a producer. [2018 c.26 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 576.780.

 

      576.800 [1997 c.9 §1; renumbered 571.350 in 2009]

 

      576.802 Failure of seed dealer to make timely payment; fee. (1) If a seed dealer fails to pay a producer for other seed when payment is due under a seed production contract or fails to pay a seed grower for other seed when payment is due under a seed purchase contract, the producer or seed grower may notify the State Department of Agriculture. Upon notification by a producer or seed grower, the department shall determine whether payment has been made when due. If the department determines that the seed dealer has not made a payment that is due under a seed production contract or seed purchase contract, the department shall notify the seed dealer in writing that the dealer has 30 days to pay the producer or seed grower all delinquent amounts plus interest on each delinquent amount at the rate of one percent per month simple interest from the final payment date for that delinquent amount.

      (2) A seed production contract or seed purchase contract may not vary the terms of the remedy provided by this section. A seed dealer may appeal the notice given by the department under this section as provided in ORS chapter 183. This section does not prevent a producer or seed grower from filing a notice of lien against a seed dealer.

      (3) If a seed dealer fails to make payment as required by a notice given by the department under this section, the department shall suspend any seed dealer license issued to the dealer until the dealer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that the dealer is current on all payments due to all producers and seed growers. An order suspending a license under this subsection is subject to ORS chapter 183. However, the department may not suspend a seed dealer license under this section using the procedure described in ORS 183.430 (2).

      (4) A seed dealer that fails to make payment on a seed production contract or seed purchase contract as required by a notice given by the department under this section is considered to have authorized the producer or seed grower to sell in a commercially reasonable manner any seed from the contract that is still in the possession of the producer or seed grower. This subsection does not prevent a seed dealer from giving consent to the producer or seed grower by other means and does not supersede the terms of a consent given by other means.

      (5) The department may charge a producer or seed grower a fee, not to exceed $200, for determining whether payment has been made in accordance with the terms of a seed production contract or seed purchase contract. The department may charge a producer or seed grower a fee, not to exceed $50, for notifying a seed dealer in writing regarding the deadline for payment of delinquent amounts plus interest. [2018 c.26 §8]
