      (b) The growing of grain is an agricultural industry that contributes to the economic welfare of Oregon.

      (c) Because a surplus of grain is grown in this state and, during recurrent years, that surplus has been in excess of all available markets, it is necessary that additional markets for grain be found in order to provide profitable enterprises for producers and to provide employment for labor and industry dependent upon grain.

      (2) The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health and welfare by providing means for the protection and stabilization of industry for grain produced in this state. [Amended by 2003 c.604 §87; 2011 c.181 §7; 2013 c.93 §7]
