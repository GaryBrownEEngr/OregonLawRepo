      (3) To set up the necessary procedures to make effective the provisions of this chapter, such as the purchase of supplies, printing, stationery and equipment, and the appointing of clerical help and assistance, all of which expense shall be audited and paid as a part of the general expense of the administration of this chapter.

[Amended by 1959 c.201 §1]

 

      587.050 Petition for services by department.

Any owner of grain desiring to store it shall make a written application to the State Department of Agriculture indicating where the grain is stored, the kind of structure in which stored and the encumbrance on the grain, if any. The application shall be signed and sworn to by the applicant. Whenever any grain is owned by more than one owner, the application shall be signed by all having an interest in the grain. In case such grain is mortgaged, the application for inspection shall be signed by the owner. The department in its discretion may require the mortgagee, mortgagor or any other person having an interest in the grain to sign applications or other documents required in carrying out this chapter. [Amended by 1959 c.201 §3]

 

      587.100 Making inspections; inspection certificates; issuing warehouse certificates. (1) When application is made to the State Department of Agriculture for the inspection and sealing of grain, whether upon the farm or on or near any railroad right of way, or other suitable place, the department shall, as soon as it is possible so to do, inspect the grain. If the grain and the structure in which it is stored comply with this chapter and the regulations of the department, the department shall:

      (a) Obtain the number and description of the bags of grain or measure and obtain the cubic feet content of the grain in the bin.

      (b) Estimate the amount of grain in storage, sample the grain to secure an average sample, so as to obtain a required amount of grain to mix and divide into two samples.

      (c) Number the bin and the samples to correspond, seal the bin with a seal provided by the department and place on the structure a printed copy of the penalty provided by ORS 587.990 (2) for the unlawful breaking of the seal.

      (d) Forward to its laboratory one of the samples obtained from the bin, and obtain from the laboratory inspection certificates, in triplicate, which shall be dated, numbered and shall designate the owner’s name, the number of the sample inspected, the kind of grain, and if mixed, the percentage of each kind, the dockage and, upon request, the moisture and protein content.

      (2) As soon as inspection certificates are obtained, the department shall issue negotiable warehouse certificates in triplicate, attaching to each a copy of the inspection certificate. When approved by the department the certificates are deemed to be issued by the proper authority of the department. Any certificate issued for grain owned by more than one person, or mortgaged, shall be issued in the name of such persons, including the mortgagee.

      (3) An authorized representative of the department may at any time enter upon the premises where any grain is stored under this chapter for the purpose of making an inspection thereof, and the acceptance of the warehouse certificate by the owner is consent to such entry and inspection. [Amended by 1959 c.201 §4]

      587.130 Filing and recording certificates.

      587.140 Care by owner of stored grain; delivery to certificate holder; sale by owner. The owner of grain stored under this chapter is charged with the due care of the grain and shall exercise that degree of care and diligence which an ordinary and prudent person would exercise with regard to similar property of the person’s own. The owner shall also, upon demand of the holder of the certificate and with the approval of the State Department of Agriculture, deliver the grain to the marketplace indicated in the application without charge to the holder. No legal demand for the delivery of the grain can be made, however, upon the owner until the maturity of the obligation for which the certificate is pledged, or until the security becomes in any way impaired; but the owner of the grain in the discretion of the owner with the approval of the department may sell the grain prior to the maturity of the obligation of the owner under the certificate. [Amended by 1959 c.201 §8]

 

      587.150 Locking and sealing storage facilities; bond as waiver of. The locking up and sealing of any storage facility acceptable to the State Department of Agriculture hereby is waived, if and when the applicant has filed a warehouseman’s bond, as a guaranty to the carrying out of the provisions of this chapter. Such bond shall be passed on and approved by the department.

 

      587.160 Determination of amount of grain; warehouse certificate as evidence; owner liable for actual amount. Whenever the amount of grain certified to on the warehouse certificate has been computed by cubic measurements or by number of bags, the amount shall be deemed to be prima facie the amount of the grain, but the actual amount shall be determined by the actual weight thereof. The owner, however, is responsible and liable to the holder of the certificate, for the delivery of the amount of grain indicated on the certificate by actual weight, or the value of any shortage thereof.

The department may also make a charge for travel, overtime or other necessary expenses. All such fees shall be paid to the department and deposited with the State Treasurer in the General Fund to the credit of the Department of Agriculture Account and are continuously appropriated to carrying out this chapter.
