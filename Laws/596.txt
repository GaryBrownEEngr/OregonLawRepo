      (2) The order of the court shall be based upon a duly verified petition filed by the department setting forth the facts relative to such resistance or lack of cooperation. A copy of the petition may be served either by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt upon the owner or person in charge of the livestock or in the manner provided for service of summons in civil actions. Such owner or person in charge shall appear and answer the allegations of the petition within 10 days from the date the petition was served.

      (3) If the owner or person in charge of any livestock or property fails to appear or the court either with or without such appearance finds the allegations of the petition are true and the action by the department necessary for the eradication and control of diseases of livestock in this state, the court shall enter its order requiring the owner or person in charge to cease and desist from such resistance or to comply with the lawful orders of the department, as the case may be. However, the court may enter its order without a hearing, if it satisfactorily appears to the court that a delay in answering would jeopardize disease eradication and control. A request by the department for a summary order by the court relative to any lack of cooperation or resistance by the owner or person in charge shall be supported by an affidavit showing the necessity for summary action.

      (4) The sheriff of the county in which such livestock or property is located shall execute such order by serving upon the owners or person in charge of such livestock or property a copy thereof duly certified to by the clerk of the circuit court, and by enforcing the provisions thereof.

[1953 c.633 §3]

      (a) Livestock or property owned by the federal government or the State of Oregon, or any governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality of those governments.

      (b) Livestock or property if the owner thereof has failed to comply with any of the provisions of ORS 596.075, 596.331, 596.351, 596.355, 596.371 or 596.460 or with any rules promulgated under ORS 596.321 or has acted in contravention to department authority under ORS 596.311, 596.341, 596.361, 596.388, 596.392 to 596.416 and 596.470 as to any of that livestock or property.

      (d) Livestock or property that has been negligently or willfully exposed to or contaminated by a disease.

      (e) Livestock that were imported from a county or defined area that is under quarantine at the order of the federal government, the State of Oregon or the state of origin, for the disease that the livestock is affected by.

      (2) Any transaction referred to in subsection (1)(c) or (i) of this section with regard to any livestock animal disqualifies the owner of that livestock from receiving indemnity for all livestock or property owned by that person for which indemnity would otherwise be payable. [1953 c.633 §8; 1971 c.483 §4; 1981 c.334 §1; 1983 c.101 §7; 1985 c.91 §4; 1991 c.420 §4; 1999 c.102 §5; 2001 c.22 §6]

 

      596.650 Indemnity; appraisal of animal or property prior to destruction. (1) An owner may claim indemnity on any animal or property ordered destroyed by the State Department of Agriculture. Each animal or article of property which is eligible for indemnity shall be appraised prior to its destruction. The department shall provide forms on which claims for indemnity can be made, to the owner of livestock or property ordered destroyed at the time the order of destruction is given to the owner. The claim for indemnity, order of destruction and appraisal may be included in one form at the discretion of the department. In order to qualify for indemnity, the owner shall submit a claim to the department within seven days after receiving such claim form from the department. The appraisal shall be performed by two appraisers, one of whom shall be selected by the department and one of whom shall be selected by the owner. If they cannot agree on the appraised value, a third appraiser shall be immediately appointed by the two appraisers selected by the department and the owner and the department and owner advised of the appointment. If the owner fails to select an appraiser within 10 days after the department’s request therefor, the department shall appoint two appraisers to evaluate the livestock or property. The appraisers shall view each animal or article of property to be appraised and inspect documents, premises or any other items deemed necessary to perform the appraisal. Upon completion of the appraisal, the appraisers shall record the evaluations on a form supplied by the department and shall submit the completed appraisal form to the department within 10 days after completion of the appraisal. The department shall then notify the owner of the results of the appraisal.

      (2) The livestock or property shall be appraised on the basis of current market value of animals or property of like kind, quality and physical condition at the time the destruction was ordered. As used in this subsection, “market value” means the average selling price of animals or property of like kind and quality in the locality where the animals or property are situated, during the 30 days immediately preceding the appraisal, and if no such average selling price can be determined in the locality, then the average selling price in the next nearest locality where it can be determined.

      (3) If the livestock condemned by the department are registered and the owner claims enhanced value by such fact, a certified copy of the certificate of registry shall accompany the appraisal report. [1953 c.633 §4; 1965 c.217 §3; 1981 c.334 §2]

 

      596.660 Method of destruction; salvage. When in the opinion of the State Department of Agriculture livestock or property which is condemned can be destroyed in a manner which will permit some salvage to be realized, without prejudice to adequate disease control or eradication measures or to human health and welfare, the department may authorize such methods of destruction and prescribe the conditions upon which it may be carried out. In no case shall a method of destruction be authorized merely because it permits salvage, unless it may be accomplished within seven days from the date the destruction order is delivered.

 

      596.670 [1953 c.633 §6; repealed by 1965 c.217 §4 (596.671 enacted in lieu of 596.670)]

 

      596.671 Amount of indemnity. The indemnity shall be a sum, which added to the salvage, shall not exceed 80 percent of the appraised value of each animal or article of property. [1965 c.217 §5 (enacted in lieu of 596.670); 1971 c.705 §1; 1981 c.334 §3]

 

      596.680 [1953 c.633 §7; repealed by 1965 c.217 §6 (596.681 enacted in lieu of 596.680)]

 

      596.681 Limit of state indemnity to livestock owner also receiving federal indemnity. If the owner of livestock destroyed at the order of the State Department of Agriculture is eligible for indemnity payable by the federal government, the owner may also be indemnified by the State of Oregon. However, the State of Oregon shall only pay the difference between the maximum amounts set forth in ORS 596.671 and the amount payable by the federal government. [1965 c.217 §7 (enacted in lieu of 596.680); 1981 c.334 §4]
