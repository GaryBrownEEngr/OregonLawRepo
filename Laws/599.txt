Such schedule which may vary depending on the type of livestock auction market operation, the estimated or actual volume of sales or other standards which the department deems necessary, in so far as is reasonable and practicable, shall conform to the bonding law and rules of the federal Packers and Stockyards Act prescribed in subsection (5) of this section. The department in addition may require before it gives its approval to a bond or renewal thereof that the applicant submit a financial statement or other information to assist the department in determining the necessary size or type of bond which may be necessary for the protection of persons who may be covered or affected thereby.

      (5) Any livestock auction market licensee or applicant for license who presents to the department satisfactory evidence of compliance with the bonding provisions of the federal Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, 7 U.S.C. 181 to 228, as amended, and effective June 29, 1971, shall be deemed in compliance with the bonding requirements of this section during such time as the licensee or applicant complies with the bonding provisions of such federal statute.

      (2) With the approval of the claimants who filed claims, the department may settle such claims with the surety, without filing legal action. Such settlement unless appealed to the circuit court within 30 days as provided by law, is final between the surety and all claimants covered by the bond.

      (3) If any claimant, or the surety, does not agree with the findings of the department, the department shall file a declaratory judgment action without right to jury trial in the circuit court in the name of the State of Oregon for the benefit of the claimants as authorized by ORS chapter 28. Unless appealed as prescribed by law, the order of the court shall be final between the surety and all claimants covered by the bond. [1961 c.283 §3; 1979 c.284 §178]

During any 24-hour period if the brand inspection fees that the department is authorized to collect through and in a livestock auction market under ORS chapter 604 do not total $50, the livestock auction market licensee shall include and at the same time pay to the department the difference between the actual brand inspection total fees collected and $50.

      (b) The department shall notify the applicant by certified mail within 30 days of receipt of an application submitted under paragraph (a) of this subsection whether the application has been approved or denied. If the department shall fail to act on the application within the 30-day period, it shall be deemed approved.

      (c) If the department finds that moving the location of the auction market facility would result in a substantial extension of the trading area served, it shall consider the application to be an application for a new license pursuant to ORS 599.406 and shall not consider it unless all requirements for such an application are met. The department may by rule establish criteria for determining whether an extension of trading area is substantial. [1971 c.578 §2]

In order to carry out the provisions of ORS 596.020, the State Department of Agriculture may require such testing, treating and examining of livestock sold, traded, exchanged or handled at or through any stockyard as in its judgment may be necessary to prevent the spread of brucellosis, tuberculosis or paratuberculosis, hog cholera and other infectious, contagious or communicable diseases among the livestock of this state. [1957 c.390 §20; 1959 c.63 §7]

      (b) Assume and carry out the program, procedures, services and work being done or to be done by the federal agency or federal department in Oregon to eradicate and to prevent the spread of brucellosis, tuberculosis, paratuberculosis or other infectious, contagious, communicable or dangerous diseases in livestock auction markets or stockyards or the animals handled by such markets or yards.

      (2) The State Department of Agriculture may contract with or enter into agreements with the agencies or departments of the federal government referred to in subsection (1) of this section to receive funds which shall be deposited with the State Treasurer to be paid out and used by the State Department of Agriculture in carrying out the provisions of any Oregon law and of the Act of Congress under which the money is paid in accordance with the terms of the contract or agreement. Such funds are continuously appropriated for the purpose of carrying out this chapter in accordance with the terms of the contract or agreement. [1957 c.390 §21; 1967 c.637 §19]

      599.540 Withdrawal of purebred livestock from sale. (1) In cases where there is an animal listed in the printed catalog or other advertisements of any auction sale of purebred livestock and is withdrawn prior to the sale, the reason for such withdrawal shall be publicly stated by the owner or consignor or the agents of the owner or consignor, or by the auctioneer, prior to the commencement of such sale.

      (2) As used in ORS 599.530 and this section, the term “purebred livestock” includes all animals registered or eligible to registration in the various breed associations organized and maintained for the registration of cattle, horses, swine, sheep or goats, and having jurisdiction over the registration of such animals in the United States.
