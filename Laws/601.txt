(1) Any person engaged in the business of obtaining, by purchase or otherwise, the body, carcass or parts of animals, for the purpose of obtaining the hide, skin or grease from such body, carcass or parts of animals or for the purpose of disposing of such body, carcass or parts in any way whatsoever, is deemed to be engaged in the business of disposing of the bodies, carcasses or parts of animals, and is subject to all the provisions and penalties of this chapter.

      (2) However, ORS 601.010 to 601.130 do not apply to:

      (a) The slaughtering and handling of animals for human consumption or to the dissection of animals for scientific research.

      (b) Persons in cities and towns who gather up and dispose of the bodies of dead fowl, cats, dogs and other small animals, if they gather up and dispose of such bodies of small animals in the regular course of their garbage business.

 

      601.030 License required to engage in animal disposal business. Before any person shall engage in the business of disposing of the bodies, carcasses or parts of animals by rendering, burning, burying or any other means, the person shall procure from the State Department of Agriculture a license.

The application shall be upon a form furnished by the department and shall contain such information as the department may, by rule and regulation, prescribe.

      (2) At the time of filing, the applicant shall pay to the department a license fee of $50. All such fees shall be remitted by the department to the State Treasurer, who shall place all money so received in the Department of Agriculture Service Fund for the purpose of carrying into full force and effect ORS 601.010 to 601.130. [Amended by 1979 c.499 §15]

      (b) Whether the place where the business is to be conducted is a suitable and sanitary place in which to dispose of the bodies, carcasses and parts of animals.

      (1) All buildings on such premises shall be constructed as to allow them to be kept in a sanitary condition and shall be provided with properly drained concrete or cement floors. Such buildings shall be fly-tight and so constructed as to exclude rats, other rodents and vermin.

      (2) Such place shall be so situated, arranged and constructed as not to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by any of the residents of this state.

      (3) In case such dead bodies, carcasses or parts of animals are to be disposed of by rendering, the cooking vats or tanks shall be airtight except for proper escapes or vents for steam used in rendering or cooking. Such escaping steam shall be released through traps, or other means, in such manner as not to cause unnecessary annoyance or create a nuisance in its disposal.

      (4) All storing, skinning and dismembering of dead bodies, carcasses or parts of animals shall be done within a building on the premises in such a manner that no public annoyance or nuisance shall be caused by the unsightly appearance or stench of such bodies, carcasses or parts of animals.

Such assembly plant shall conform to such regulations by the department as shall keep it in sanitary condition. Each such assembly plant shall be subject to an annual license fee of $10.

      (3) Whole bodies of dead animals, the condition of which has not become obnoxious to human senses, and which cannot be placed in an ordinary wagon, truck bed or tank as described in subsection (1) of this section, may be transported in an open wagon or truck. In such case the body shall be suitably covered and concealed.
