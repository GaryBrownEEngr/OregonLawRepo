      603.015 Policy. The purpose and intent of ORS 599.205 and this chapter is to protect the livestock industry of this state against theft of meat animals and, giving cognition to the Federal Meat Inspection Act as defined in ORS chapter 619, to provide the State Department of Agriculture with the means to complement the enforcement of that Act by authorizing the department to take necessary and proper measures for the protection of the health and welfare of Oregon consumers. Such measures should include the prevention of sale and distribution of unwholesome meat and meat products, the exercising of quality controls and supervision, the establishment of general sanitary and safeguard provisions and the identification of meat animals and meat products. [1973 c.175 §2; 1981 c.248 §26]

 

      603.020 [Amended by 1955 c.724 §2; 1969 c.565 §2; repealed by 1973 c.175 §15]

 

      603.025 Licenses required; application; term; renewal; surety bond; fee; rules. (1) A person may not sell, offer to sell or expose for sale meat products or engage in any other activity described or identified in subsection (4) of this section without first obtaining and maintaining a license for that activity from the State Department of Agriculture. All such licenses shall expire on June 30 next following the date of issuance or on such date as may be specified by department rule. Renewal applications must be postmarked before the expiration date to be timely.

      (2) Application for a license required by this section shall be made to the department on forms prescribed by the department and shall contain any information the department deems necessary. The license is personal and nontransferable, with a separate license required for each establishment location. A new license is required each time there is a change in ownership, legal entity or establishment location.

      (3) In addition to other license requirements of this section, if an applicant for a license under subsection (4)(c) of this section has an average weekly dollar value of meat animal purchases that exceeds $10,000, the applicant shall submit with the application a surety bond with one or more corporate sureties authorized to do business in this state, or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008. The bond or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to twice the average daily value of meat animal purchases during the preceding calendar year, or the amount of $20,000, whichever amount is greater. The department shall prescribe the form for the bond or letter of credit. A bond or letter of credit is subject to department approval and must be conditioned upon faithful performance by the licensee of all obligations to the producers of meat animals arising from the sale of meat animals by producers to the licensee.

      (4) Each of the following activities must be licensed, and the fee established by the department paid with the license application:

      (a) Operation of a meat seller establishment. A license under this section allows only the meat products preparation described in ORS 603.010 (8).

      (b) Operation of a nonslaughtering processing establishment. A license under this section allows selling meat products at the same location without obtaining the license described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) Operation of a slaughterhouse. A license under this section allows selling meat products at the same location without obtaining the license described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (d) Operation of a custom slaughtering establishment or custom processing establishment. A license under this section does not allow selling meat products without first obtaining and maintaining the license described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (e) Operation of a slaughterhouse, custom slaughtering establishment or custom processing establishment wherein only poultry or rabbits are slaughtered or prepared. A license under this section allows selling only poultry or rabbit products at the same location without obtaining the license described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (5) The license required by this section shall be displayed at all times in a conspicuous manner at the address shown on the license.

      (6) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for establishments licensed under this section. The department may determine the license fee for an establishment based upon the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an establishment, the State Department of Agriculture shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by that establishment within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the establishment maintains sales and service records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the establishment applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales and services by the establishment. If an establishment whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales and services figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the establishment.

      (7) Except as provided in this subsection, the department may not adopt a rule under this section to establish a license fee that is more than three percent higher than the license fee charged during the preceding year for an establishment of the same type and having the same volume of gross sales and services. When adopting a rule establishing a license fee, notwithstanding the three percent limit, the department may round the fee amount to the next higher whole dollar amount. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year. [1973 c.175 §4; 1975 c.703 §1; 1982 s.s.1 c.4 §1; 1991 c.331 §92; 1991 c.632 §1; 1997 c.631 §505; 2005 c.735 §§1,2; 2007 c.768 §§19,20; 2012 c.64 §1]

Renewal applications must be postmarked before the expiration date to be timely.

      (2) Application for a license required by this section shall be made to the department on forms prescribed by the department and shall contain any information the department deems necessary.

The bond or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to twice the average daily value of meat animal purchases during the preceding calendar year, or the amount of $20,000, whichever amount is greater. The department shall prescribe the form for the bond or letter of credit. A bond or letter of credit is subject to department approval and must be conditioned upon faithful performance by the licensee of all obligations to the producers of meat animals arising from the sale of meat animals by producers to the licensee.

      (4) Each of the following activities must be licensed, and the fee established by the department paid with the license application:

      (a) Operation of a meat seller establishment. A license under this section allows only the meat products preparation described in ORS 603.010 (8).

      (5) The license required by this section shall be displayed at all times in a conspicuous manner at the address shown on the license.

      (6) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for establishments licensed under this section. The department may determine the license fee for an establishment based upon the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an establishment, the State Department of Agriculture shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by that establishment within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the establishment maintains sales and service records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the establishment applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales and services by the establishment. If an establishment whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales and services figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the establishment.

      (7) The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2018, for an establishment of the same type and having the same volume of gross sales and services. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

 

      603.027 Refund of license fee in specific instances; application; rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 603.025 (2), whenever any business licensed pursuant to the requirements of ORS 603.025 (4)(a) is transferred by sale or otherwise, the person to whom the license was issued may apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a refund of that portion of the license fee applicable to the then unexpired portion of the license period. The person to whom the business is transferred shall not be required to pay a license fee that exceeds the amount of any refund to which the transferor is entitled pursuant to this subsection.

      (2) Application for the refund referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be made at such time and in such manner as the department by rule may prescribe. [1975 c.188 §2]

 

      603.030 [Amended by 1953 c.692 §6; 1955 c.712 §20; 1955 c.724 §3; 1957 c.65 §1; 1961 c.425 §11; 1969 c.565 §3; repealed by 1973 c.175 §15]

 

      603.031 Additional users of establishment; fees; rules. (1) The State Department of Agriculture may issue licenses under this chapter to one or more additional users of a custom processing establishment, custom slaughtering establishment, meat seller establishment, nonslaughtering processing establishment or slaughterhouse that is licensed primarily for operation by another person. A license issued to an additional user of an establishment described in this subsection shall cover all operations at that establishment by the person licensed. Regardless of the number of persons licensed to use an establishment described in this subsection, the department may not recognize more than one person as the primary operator of the establishment.

      (2) The department may assess a license fee to an additional user of an establishment described in this section, calculated as provided in rules adopted under ORS 603.025. In calculating license fees as provided under ORS 603.025, the establishment’s annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for an additional user of the establishment is independent of the establishment’s annual gross dollar volume of sales for any other user or the primary operator of the establishment.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 603.025, the department may adopt rules to establish the license expiration, renewal and application dates for additional users of an establishment.

      (4) The department may adopt rules to determine the responsibilities of an establishment’s primary operator and additional users of the establishment under ORS 603.034, 603.045 (6), 603.055 and 603.059 and rules adopted under ORS 603.055 and 603.085.

      (5) A recognized primary operator of an establishment shall notify the department upon the expiration or termination of the rental or lease of the establishment by an additional user of the establishment. The renting or leasing of an establishment to a person licensed by the department as an additional user of the establishment or the expiration or termination of use by a person licensed as an additional user of the establishment does not, by itself, constitute the transfer of a business for purposes of ORS 603.027. [2007 c.645 §2; 2012 c.64 §19]

 

      603.033 [1955 c.724 §5; 1965 c.483 §7; 1967 c.392 §1; 1969 c.565 §4; repealed by 1973 c.175 §15]

 

      603.034 Denial, suspension or revocation of license; multiple activities; license exemption.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 183, upon conviction of a licensee of any violation of the State Meat Inspection Act, as defined in ORS chapter 619, or of any provisions of ORS 599.205 and this chapter, or of the rules promulgated thereunder, or upon determination by the department that a licensee has failed to maintain the surety bond or letter of credit required by ORS 603.025 (3), the department is authorized to forthwith suspend or revoke such license. The department shall, by certified mail addressed to such licensee at the address shown on the license, render notice that such license has been revoked or suspended.

      (3) Subject to ORS 603.025, authority to carry on more than one type of activity at the same establishment shall be approved by the department only if there is compliance with the laws and rules applicable to each separate activity.

      (4) ORS 599.205 and this chapter shall not require a person to obtain a license to slaughter on the person’s own premises a meat animal, owned by the person, for the person’s consumption or for consumption by members of the person’s household, nonpaying guests or employees. [1973 c.175 §5; 1975 c.703 §2; 1981 c.248 §27; 1991 c.331 §93; 2007 c.645 §3]

 

      603.035 [1953 c.692 §5; repealed by 1955 c.724 §17]

      (b) The person must slaughter the poultry at the business premises of the person in an establishment that meets the requirements in ORS 619.026 and any State Department of Agriculture rules adopted under ORS 619.046. The person may not allow other persons to use the establishment.

      (c) The person must comply with any federal limitations or prohibitions on introducing the poultry or products produced from the poultry into interstate commerce.

      (d) A person that claims exemption from ORS 603.025 and 616.706 under this section must maintain slaughtering, sales, sanitation and other records pertaining to the poultry as required by the department. The person shall allow the department to inspect the records and the slaughtering establishment upon request and as provided under ORS 576.024 and 619.036.

      (3) The exemption described in this section is in addition to any exemption that a person may claim under ORS 603.034 (4) for the slaughtering and processing of poultry for personal use. [2011 c.119 §1]

 

      Note: 603.038 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 603 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
