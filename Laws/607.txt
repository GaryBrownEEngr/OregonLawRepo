      (5) Upon receiving the notice of the owner described in subsection (4) of this section, the department shall furnish to the owner and the person taking up the animal the names of five arbitrators selected from the list of qualified persons maintained in accordance with subsection (10) of this section. No later than five days after receiving the list of arbitrators, the owner shall give written notice to the department and the person taking up the animal of the name of the arbitrator appointed by the owner from the list. No later than five days after receiving the list of arbitrators, the person taking up the animal shall give written notice to the department and to the owner of the name of the arbitrator appointed by the person from the list.

      (6) Upon receiving the notices of appointment of arbitrators, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the department shall give written notice to each appointed arbitrator of the arbitrator’s appointment.

      (7) Upon receiving notice as provided in subsection (6) of this section, each of the two arbitrators shall notify the department in writing whether the arbitrator accepts the appointment. Upon acceptance of appointment by an arbitrator appointed by the owner and an arbitrator appointed by the person taking up the animal, the department shall appoint a third arbitrator. An acceptance of appointment by the third arbitrator must be in writing. The department shall pay each appointed arbitrator $50 from the money paid to the department under subsection (4) of this section for arbitration services. The three arbitrators shall act as a board of arbitration and may hear witnesses, take testimony, inspect documents, the animal and premises and may issue a decision as to the amount allowable as costs. The decision shall be by majority vote and conclusive as to the owner and person taking up the animal upon receipt of the decision by the department. Written notice of the decision shall be given to the department, the owner and the person taking up the animal no later than 30 days after the appointment of the third arbitrator.

      (8)(a) If the owner gives the notice to the department and the person taking up the animal that the owner disagrees with the amount of the costs, but does not indicate in the notice a desire to arbitrate or a desire to have a list of arbitrators furnished to the owner, the owner’s right to arbitration is waived and the person taking up the animal shall deliver the animal to the department at a place designated by the department. The department shall then sell the animal in accordance with ORS 607.328.

      (b) If the person taking up the animal fails to give a notice of appointment required under subsection (5) of this section, the person waives the right to arbitration and the animal may not be sold. The owner shall be entitled to the immediate possession of the animal without payment of any of the costs described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (9) At any time during the arbitration provided for in this section, the owner of the animal may give written notice to the department and the person taking up the animal of the owner’s desire to regain immediate possession and custody of the animal. If the owner gives such notice, and at the same time deposits with the department a cash deposit in an amount equal to the accrued costs claimed by the person taking up the animal as of the date the notice is given, the animal shall be released to the owner or agent within 48 hours after the giving of notice and cash deposit. The department is authorized to pay the costs determined by the arbitrators under subsection (7) of this section to the person taking up the animal and return the balance, if any, to the owner.

      (10) The department shall establish and maintain a list of persons qualified by experience and knowledge to act as arbitrators in accordance with subsection (7) of this section. In furnishing the names of five arbitrators, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the department shall first determine that none of the listed persons:

      (a) Is related to either the owner or person taking up the animal;

      (b) Is, or has been, an agent, employee or business associate of the owner or the person taking up the animal; or

      (c) Has for any reason bias or prejudice toward the owner or the person taking up the animal.

      (11) If the owner or the person taking up the animal intentionally fails to disclose to the department that any of the five arbitrators on the list provided under subsection (5) of this section does not meet the criteria described in subsection (10) of this section, the department shall upon determining an intentional failure to disclose:

      (a) Declare the arbitrator disqualified and any arbitration decision previously rendered void and of no effect;

      (b) Select a person from the department’s list to replace the disqualified arbitrator; and

      (c) Direct that the arbitration be undertaken with the newly appointed arbitrator as a member of the board of arbitration. [1957 c.604 §25; 1971 c.579 §6; 1975 c.65 §1; 1981 c.413 §1; 2009 c.336 §4]

      (4) If the owner fails to establish the right of the owner to the proceeds of sale within one year, all right, title and claim thereto shall be transferred to the department to expend and use in carrying out this chapter and ORS chapter 604.

The two arbitrators shall give written notice of the appointment of the third arbitrator to the department and the person taking up the animal no later than five days after receiving the list.

The decision of the arbitrators shall be final. Written notice of the decision shall be given to the department and the person taking up the animal no later than 30 days after the appointment of the third arbitrator.

      607.355 Disposal of calves and colts wrongfully held. All animals held in violation of ORS 607.345 or 607.350 shall be considered estray animals.
