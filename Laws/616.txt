In order to more effectively utilize the agencies of the state in the public interest and without unnecessary duplication and expense, the relationship between the production, processing and distribution of food and the public health hereby is recognized.

      (3) Not less than 30 days after the completion of any such survey, the authority shall file with the Director of Agriculture a certified copy of its report. The report shall include the findings of the authority with respect to all matters covered thereby. Whenever the findings in the report of any survey, investigation or inquiry made by the authority show any hazard to public health existing incident to the production, processing or distribution of any agricultural commodity, the State Department of Agriculture shall take such action as may be necessary and within the scope of its resources to remove such hazards.

REGULATION OF SULFITE USE

      (a) Prohibiting the use of sulfites in fresh foods and foods to be consumed without cooking by any restaurant licensed under ORS 624.010 to 624.121 and 624.310 to 624.430; and

      616.225 Disposal of adulterated, misbranded, unsound or unsafe food or consumer commodity. (1) Whenever a duly authorized representative of the State Department of Agriculture finds, or has probable cause to believe, that any food or consumer commodity is adulterated, or so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent, within the meaning of ORS 616.205 to 616.295, the representative shall affix to such article a tag or other appropriate marking, giving notice that such article is, or is suspected of being adulterated or misbranded and has been detained, embargoed or seized, and warning all persons not to remove or dispose of such article by sale or otherwise until permission for removal or disposal is given by an authorized representative of the department. No person shall remove or dispose of such detained, embargoed or seized article by sale or otherwise without permission of the department.

      (2) Whenever the department or any of its authorized representatives finds in any room, building, vehicle of transportation, or other structure, any meat, fluid milk, dairy product, seafood, poultry, vegetable, fruit or other perishable articles which are unsound, or contain any filthy, decomposed or putrid substance, or that may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe, the same hereby being declared a nuisance, the department or its authorized representative forthwith shall condemn or destroy the same, or in any other manner render it unsalable as human food.

      (3) The department shall carry out the provisions of this section as provided in ORS 561.605 to 561.630. [Amended by 1973 c.227 §4]

 

      616.230 Definitions and standards; conformity to federal regulations; rules. (1) The State Department of Agriculture, by rule, shall establish definitions and standards of identity, quality and fill of container for the State of Oregon. In carrying out the provisions of this subsection, the department shall take into consideration definitions and standards established in other states and definitions and standards established pursuant to the federal Act.

      (2) Whenever in the judgment of the department such action will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, the department shall promulgate rules establishing definitions and standards of identity, quality and fill of container for foods for which no such definitions or standards have been established under the federal Act. In addition, the department may promulgate rules supplementing or amending any rule under the federal Act which sets definitions and standards of identity, quality and fill of container for foods.

      (3) Temporary permits for interstate shipment of experimental packs of food varying from the requirements of definitions and standards of identity under the federal Act are effective in this state under the conditions stated in such permits. In addition, the department may issue additional permits when such permits are determined by the department to be necessary to the completion or conclusiveness of an otherwise adequate investigation and when the interests of consumers are safeguarded. Such permits shall be subject to any terms and conditions the department may prescribe. [Amended by 1973 c.227 §5; 1975 c.304 §5]

 

      616.235 When food deemed adulterated; rules. A food shall be deemed to be adulterated:

      (1)(a) If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health. However, if the substance is not an added substance such food shall not be considered adulterated under this paragraph if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health.

      (b) If it bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance, other than a pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity and other than a food additive or color additive, which is unsafe within the meaning of ORS 616.245, or it is a raw agricultural commodity and it bears or contains a pesticide chemical which is unsafe within the meaning of ORS 616.341 or if it is, bears or contains any food additive which is declared unsafe by the State Department of Agriculture under ORS 616.350. However, when a pesticide chemical has been used in or on a raw agricultural commodity in conformity with an exemption granted or tolerance prescribed under ORS 616.341, and such raw agricultural commodity has been subjected to processing, such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydrating or milling, the residue of such pesticide chemical remaining in or on such processed food, notwithstanding ORS 616.341 and this section are not unsafe if such residue in or on the raw agricultural commodity has been removed to the extent possible in good manufacturing practice, and the concentration of such residue in the processed food when ready-to-eat, is not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity.

      (c) If it consists in whole or in part of a diseased, contaminated, filthy, putrid or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise unfit for food.

      (d) If it has been produced, prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered diseased, unwholesome or injurious to health.

      (e) If it is, in whole or in part, the product of a diseased animal or an animal which has died otherwise than by slaughter, or that has been fed upon the uncooked offal from a slaughterhouse.

      (f) If its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health.

      (2)(a) If any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom;

      (b) If any substance has been substituted wholly or in part therefor;

      (c) If damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or

      (d) If any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength or make it appear better or of greater value than it is.

      (3)(a) If it is confectionery and has partially or completely imbedded therein any nonnutritive object. This paragraph does not apply in the case of any nonnutritive object if, in the judgment of the department, such object is of some practical functional value to the confectionery product and would not render the product injurious or hazardous to health.

      (b) If it bears or contains any alcohol except alcohol not in excess of one-half of one percent by weight used solely as a flavoring.

      (c) If it bears or contains any nonnutritive substance. This paragraph does not apply to a nonnutritive substance which is in or on confectionery if, in the judgment of the department, its use is of some practical functional value in the manufacture, packaging or storing of such confectionery and if the use of such substance does not promote deception of the consumer or otherwise result in adulteration or misbranding in violation of any provision of ORS 616.205 to 616.215, 616.225 to 616.256, 616.286, 616.295, 616.310, 616.315, 616.325, 616.330, 616.341, 616.350 to 616.366, 616.790 and 616.992. The department, for the purpose of avoiding uncertainty in the application of this subsection, may promulgate rules allowing or prohibiting the use of particular nonnutritive objects or substances.

      (d) If it bears or contains any color additive which is determined unsafe pursuant to ORS 616.350. [Amended by 1959 c.301 §1; 1961 c.637 §2; 1973 c.227 §6; 1983 c.304 §1]

 

      616.240 [Repealed by 1965 c.501 §10]

 

      616.245 Adding poisonous or deleterious substance; rules. Any poisonous or deleterious substance, other than a pesticide, added to any food except when the substance is required in the production thereof or cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice shall be deemed to be unsafe for purposes of the application of ORS 616.235 (1)(b). When the substance is so required or cannot be so avoided, the State Department of Agriculture shall adopt rules limiting the quantity of the substance to the extent the department finds necessary for the protection of public health, and any quantity exceeding the limits so fixed shall also be deemed to be unsafe for purposes of the application of ORS 616.235 (1)(b). While such a rule is in effect limiting the quantity of any such substance in the case of any food, the food is not, by reason of bearing or containing any added amount of such substance, considered to be adulterated within the meaning of ORS 616.235 (1)(a). In determining the quantity of the added substance to be tolerated in or on different articles of food, the department shall take into account the extent to which the use of the substance is required or cannot be avoided in the production of each article and the other ways in which the consumer may be affected by the same or other poisonous or deleterious substances. [Amended by 1973 c.227 §7; 2005 c.22 §412]

      616.250 When food deemed misbranded; rules. A food shall be deemed to be misbranded:

      (1) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular, or fails to conform to ORS 616.325.

      (2) If it is offered for sale under the name of another food.

      (3) If it is an imitation of another food, unless its label bears in type of uniform size and prominence the word “imitation” and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.

      (4) If its container is so made, formed or filled as to be misleading.

      (5) If in package form:

      (a) Unless it bears a label containing:

      (A) The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor; and

      (B) An accurate statement of the net quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, volume or numerical count. The statement shall be separately and accurately stated upon the principal display panel of the label.

      (b) The same reasonable variations allowed in ORS chapter 618 shall be permitted.

      (c) Exemptions as to small packages shall be established by rules promulgated by the State Department of Agriculture.

      (6) If any word, statement or other information required by or under authority of ORS 616.205 to 616.295 to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness, as compared with other words, statements, designs or devices, in the labeling, and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.

      (7) If it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed by rule as provided by ORS 616.230, unless it conforms to such definition and standard and its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and standard, and, in so far as may be required by such rule, the common names of optional ingredients, other than spices, flavoring and coloring present in such food.

      (8) If it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a standard of quality has been prescribed by rule as provided by ORS 616.230 and its quality falls below the standards such rule specifies, a statement that it falls below such standard.

      (9) If it is a food for which a standard or standards of fill of container have been prescribed by rule as provided by ORS 616.230, and it falls below the standard of fill of container applicable thereto, unless its label bears, in such manner and form as such rule specifies, a statement that it falls below such standard.

      (10) If it is not subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, unless its label bears:

      (a) The common or usual name of the food, if any there be; and

      (b) In case it is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the common or usual name of each such ingredient.

 

However, spices, flavorings and colorings, other than those sold as such, may be designated as spices, flavorings and colorings, without naming them. To the extent that compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this subsection is impractical or results in deception or unfair competition, exemptions shall be established by rule promulgated by the department.

      (11) If it purports to be or is represented for special dietary uses, unless its label bears such information concerning its vitamin, mineral and other dietary properties as the department determines to be, and by rule prescribed as, necessary in order to fully inform purchasers as to its value for such uses.

      (12) If it bears or contains any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring or chemical preservative, unless it bears labeling stating that fact. To the extent that compliance with the requirements of this subsection is impracticable, exemptions shall be established by rule promulgated by the department. This subsection and subsections (7) and (10) of this section with respect to artificial coloring do not prohibit the use of harmless coloring matter in butter, cheese or ice cream. The provisions of this subsection with respect to chemical preservatives do not apply to a pesticide chemical when used in or on a raw agricultural commodity which is the product of the soil.

      (13) If it is a raw agricultural commodity which is the product of the soil, bearing or containing a pesticide chemical applied after harvest, unless the shipping container of such commodity bears labeling which declares the presence of such chemical in or on such commodity and the common or usual name and the function of such chemical. However, no such declaration is required while such commodity, having been removed from the shipping container, is being held or displayed for sale at retail out of such container in accordance with the custom of the trade.

      (14) If following the labeled directions or instructions on the product in using it as a food ingredient will result in the final food being adulterated or misbranded.

      (15) If it is a color additive, unless its packaging and labeling are in conformity with the packaging and labeling requirements applicable to such color additive prescribed under the provisions of the federal Act.

      (16) If it has been salvaged, unless it bears labeling or notification stating that fact. For the purposes of this subsection, “salvaged” means the reconditioning, repacking, relabeling, cleaning or culling of foods that have been damaged or adulterated as a result of fire, storm, flood, water, smoke, chemicals, radiation or commercial transit accident. [Amended by 1953 c.267 §2; 1973 c.227 §8; 1973 c.563 §1; 1983 c.740 §232; 1989 c.1025 §9; 2001 c.320 §4]

Such exemptions shall be conditioned upon the fact that such food is not adulterated or misbranded under the provisions of ORS 616.205 to 616.385, upon the removal from such processing, labeling or repacking establishment. [1973 c.227 §10 (enacted in lieu of 616.255); 2001 c.320 §5]

 

      616.260 [Repealed by 1973 c.227 §26]

 

      616.265 When advertisement deemed false. An advertisement of a food shall be deemed to be false if it is false or misleading in any particular.

 

      616.270 Determining when label or advertisement misleading. If any article is alleged to be misbranded because the labeling is misleading, or if any advertisement is alleged to be false because it is misleading, then in determining whether the labeling or advertisement is misleading, there shall be taken into account, among other things, not only representations made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, sound or in any combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or advertisement fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations or material with respect to consequences which may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or advertisement relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling or advertisement thereof or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.

 

      616.275 Liability for dissemination of false advertisement. No publisher, radio broadcast licensee or agency or medium for the dissemination of an advertisement, except the manufacturer, packer, distributor or seller of the article to which a false advertisement relates, is liable under this section by reason of the dissemination by the publisher, licensee or agency or medium of such false advertisement, unless the publisher, licensee or agency or medium has refused, on the request of the State Department of Agriculture, or its authorized representative, to furnish the department the name and post-office address of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, seller or advertising agency who caused the publisher, licensee or agency or medium to disseminate the advertisement.

      616.325 Consumer commodity labeling requirements; restrictions on consumer commodity distribution; rulemaking; conformance to federal standards. (1) All labels of consumer commodities shall conform to such requirements for the declaration of net quantity of contents as the State Department of Agriculture by rule may prescribe. In carrying out the provisions of this subsection, the department shall consider the requirements and exemptions provided in the federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1451, et seq., as amended, and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto.

      (2) The label of any package of a consumer commodity which bears a representation as to the number of servings of such commodity contained in such package shall bear a statement of the net quantity, in terms of weight, measure or numerical count, of each such serving.

      (3) No person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged consumer commodity if any qualifying words or phrases appear in conjunction with the separate statement of the net quantity of contents required by subsection (1) of this section, but nothing in this subsection prohibits supplemental statements, at other places on the package, describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents. Such supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the commodity contained in the package.

      (4) Whenever the department determines that rules containing prohibitions or requirements other than those prescribed by subsection (1) of this section are necessary to prevent the deception of consumers or to facilitate value comparisons as to any consumer commodity, the department shall promulgate rules with respect to that commodity which:

      (a) Establish and define standards for the characterization of the size of a package enclosing any consumer commodity, which may be used to supplement the label statement of net quantity of contents of packages containing such commodity. This paragraph shall not be construed as authorizing any limitation on the size, shape, weight, dimensions or number of packages which may be used to enclose any commodity;

      (b) Regulate the placement upon any package containing any consumer commodity or upon any label affixed to such commodity, of any printed matter stating or representing by implication that such commodity is offered for retail sale at a price lower than the ordinary and customary retail sale or that a retail sale price advantage is accorded to purchasers thereof by reason of the size of that package or the quantity of its contents;

      (c) Require that the label on each package of a consumer commodity bear the common or usual name of such consumer commodity, if any, and in case such consumer commodity consists of two or more ingredients, the common or usual name of each such ingredient listed in order of decreasing predominance. However, nothing in this paragraph requires that any trade secret be divulged; or

      (d) Prevent the nonfunctional slack-fill of packages containing consumer commodities.

      (5) For the purposes of subsection (4)(d) of this section, a package is nonfunctionally slack-filled if it is filled to substantially less than its capacity for reasons other than protection of the contents of such package or the requirements of machines used for enclosing the contents in such package. The department may adopt any rules promulgated by the federal government pursuant to the federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1451, et seq. [1973 c.227 §24; 1975 c.304 §15]

The State Department of Agriculture, for the protection of the health and life of animals or the people of this state, may take measures to control, limit or prohibit the use or intended use, or the presence of food additives. It may promulgate rules relating thereto. Such rules may prescribe for any reason as set forth in this section, that any food additive is unsafe within the meaning of ORS 616.235 (1)(b). In promulgating rules under the provisions of this section the authority of the department includes:

      (1) Providing for an exemption from the operation of ORS 616.335 to 616.385 of the use or intended use of a specific food additive.

      (2) Prescribing, with respect to one or more proposed uses of the food additive involved, the conditions under which such additive may be safely used including but not limited to, specifications as to the particular food or classes of food in or in which such additive may be used, the maximum quantity which may be used or permitted to remain in or on such food, the manner in which such additive may be added to or used in or on such food, and any directions or other labeling or packaging requirements for such additive deemed necessary to assure the safety of such use.

      (3) Establishing and prescribing tolerances, if appropriate, to assure that the proposed use of a food additive will be safe. The department shall not:

      (a) Fix such tolerance limitation at a level higher than it finds to be reasonably required to accomplish the physical or other technical effect for which such additive is intended.

      (b) Establish a rule for such proposed use if it finds upon a fair evaluation of the data before it, that such data does not establish that such use would accomplish the intended physical or other technical effect.

      (4) Prescribing for the exemption from the requirements of this section any food additive, and any food bearing or containing such additive, intended solely for investigational use by qualified experts when in the opinion of the department, such exemption is consistent with the public health. [1961 c.637 §8; 1973 c.227 §18]

The rules shall make an exception available only if compliance with ORS 616.565 or 616.570 would require the violation of local land use laws or sign ordinances, or is impracticable due to site-specific conditions. As used in this subsection, “drive-through area” means an area where customers place orders for and receive menu items while occupying motor vehicles.

      (3)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the following are the typical values for alcoholic beverages:

      (c) The authority:

      (A) May adopt rules to require total calorie disclosures for an alcoholic beverage or a menu item that contains an alcoholic beverage, only if the alcoholic beverage or menu item is offered by a chain restaurant for 90 or more days during a calendar year; and

      (B) May adopt rules that exempt containers or dispensers of alcoholic beverages from the use of food tags to state standard calorie values. [2009 c.314 §4; 2011 c.720 §211]

      616.580 Inspections; notice and opportunity to cure violation; penalties. (1) The Oregon Health Authority may inspect chain restaurants for compliance with ORS 616.560, 616.565 and 616.570 and authority rules adopted under ORS 616.575. The person operating the chain restaurant shall, upon request of the authority, permit access to all parts of the restaurant and any records in the possession of the restaurant regarding nutritional values or menu items and provide menu item samples for nutritional value testing by the authority.

      (2) If a chain restaurant violates a provision of ORS 616.560, 616.565 or 616.570 or a rule adopted under ORS 616.575, the authority shall provide the restaurant with written notice informing the restaurant of the violation and stating that the restaurant may avoid a civil penalty for the violation by curing the violation within 60 days. If the chain restaurant fails to cure the violation within 60 days, the authority may impose a civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more than $1,000 for the violation. For a continuing violation, each 30-day period that the violation continues after the preceding imposition of a civil penalty is a separate offense subject to a separate civil penalty. The authority is not required to provide the chain restaurant with an opportunity to cure the continuing violation before imposing a civil penalty for the continuing violation. [2009 c.314 §5; 2011 c.720 §212]

 

      Note: See note under 616.555.

 

      616.585 Local disclosure requirements prohibited. A local government may not adopt or enforce a local requirement for the determination or disclosure of nutritional information by a restaurant. [2009 c.314 §6]

 

      Note: See note under 616.555.

 

      616.590 Lack of cause of action or claim. ORS 616.555 to 616.585 do not create a cause of action and may not be asserted as the basis for a per se negligence claim. [2009 c.314 §7]

      616.705 [Repealed by 1965 c.501 §10]

 

      616.706 Licenses; sanctions; changes; posting; cancellation; fees; rules. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 616.695 to 616.755, a person may not operate a food establishment without first obtaining and thereafter maintaining a license under this section. A person shall make an application for a license to the State Department of Agriculture on forms prescribed by the department. Each license shall expire on June 30 next following the date of issuance or on such date as may be specified by department rule.

      (2) The department may, subject to the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, suspend, revoke or refuse to issue a license if the licensee has violated any of the provisions of ORS 616.695 to 616.755 or rules adopted under ORS 616.695 to 616.755.

      (3) A license is personal to the applicant and may not be transferred. A new license is necessary if the business entity of the licensee is changed, or if the membership of a partnership is changed, irrespective of whether or not the business name is changed.

      (4) The license shall cover all operations of the person licensed, under one entity or ownership. With prior approval of the department, the location of a licensed food establishment, or any part of a licensed food establishment, may be moved without the requirement of a new license if there is no change in the ownership or business entity.

      (5) The license shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the main office of the food establishment. Duplicate copies of the license shall be conspicuously posted in branch offices, warehouses and other places owned or operated by the licensee at locations other than the main office. A license is automatically canceled if the food establishment ceases or discontinues operations or business.

      (6) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for a food establishment:

      (a) That is part of a domestic kitchen;

      (b) That is a retail food store;

      (c) That is a warehouse; or

      (d) That is other than part of a domestic kitchen, retail food store or warehouse.

      (7) The department may determine the license fee for a food establishment described in subsection (6)(b) to (d) of this section based upon the gross sales by the applicant. In establishing the amount of a license fee based upon gross sales by an applicant, the department shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales of covered operations by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales of covered operations for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales of covered operations by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales of covered operations figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross dollar volume of sales of covered operations by the applicant.

      (8) Except as provided in this subsection, the department may not adopt a rule under this section to establish a license fee that is more than three percent higher than the license fee charged during the preceding year for a food establishment of the same type and having the same volume of gross sales. When adopting a rule establishing a license fee, notwithstanding the three percent limit, the department may round the fee amount to the next higher whole dollar amount. License fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year. [1965 c.501 §3; 1975 c.389 §3; 1979 c.183 §2; 1982 s.s.1 c.4 §4; 1991 c.632 §2; 2005 c.735 §§3,4; 2007 c.768 §§22,23; 2012 c.64 §3]

 

      Note: The amendments to 616.706 by section 37, chapter 64, Oregon Laws 2012, become operative July 1, 2026. See section 45, chapter 64, Oregon Laws 2012, as amended by section 10, chapter 386, Oregon Laws 2019. The text that is operative on and after July 1, 2026, including amendments by section 2, chapter 386, Oregon Laws 2019, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      616.706. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 616.695 to 616.755, a person may not operate a food establishment without first obtaining and thereafter maintaining a license under this section. A person shall make an application for a license to the State Department of Agriculture on forms prescribed by the department. Each license shall expire on June 30 next following the date of issuance or on such date as may be specified by department rule.

      (2) The department may, subject to the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, suspend, revoke or refuse to issue a license if the licensee has violated any of the provisions of ORS 616.695 to 616.755 or rules adopted under ORS 616.695 to 616.755.

      (3) A license is personal to the applicant and may not be transferred. A new license is necessary if the business entity of the licensee is changed, or if the membership of a partnership is changed, irrespective of whether or not the business name is changed.

      (4) The license shall cover all operations of the person licensed, under one entity or ownership. With prior approval of the department, the location of a licensed food establishment, or any part of a licensed food establishment, may be moved without the requirement of a new license if there is no change in the ownership or business entity.

      (5) The license shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the main office of the food establishment. Duplicate copies of the license shall be conspicuously posted in branch offices, warehouses and other places owned or operated by the licensee at locations other than the main office. A license is automatically canceled if the food establishment ceases or discontinues operations or business.

      (6) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for a food establishment:

      (a) That is part of a domestic kitchen;

      (b) That is a retail food store;

      (c) That is a warehouse; or

      (d) That is other than part of a domestic kitchen, retail food store or warehouse.

      (7) The department may determine the license fee for a food establishment described in subsection (6)(b) to (d) of this section based upon the gross sales by the applicant. In establishing the amount of a license fee based upon gross sales by an applicant, the department shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales of covered operations by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales of covered operations for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales of covered operations by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales of covered operations figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross dollar volume of sales of covered operations by the applicant.

      (8) The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2025, for an establishment of the same type and having the same volume of gross sales. License fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

 

      616.708 Additional users of establishment; fees; rules. (1) The State Department of Agriculture may issue licenses under ORS 616.695 to 616.755 to one or more additional users of a food establishment that is licensed primarily for operation by another person. A license issued to an additional user of the food establishment shall cover all operations at that establishment by the person licensed. Regardless of the number of persons licensed to use a food establishment, the department may not recognize more than one person as the primary operator of the establishment.

      (2) The department may assess a license fee to an additional user of a food establishment, calculated as provided in rules adopted under ORS 616.706. In calculating license fees as provided under ORS 616.706, the gross sales for an additional user of the food establishment are independent of the gross sales by any other user or the primary operator of the food establishment.
