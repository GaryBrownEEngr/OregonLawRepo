      619.020 [Repealed by 1973 c.174 §20]

 

      619.021 Purpose. The intent and purpose of ORS 576.024, 619.010 to 619.071, 619.370 and 619.993 is to give recognition to the Federal Meat Inspection Act presently being enforced in this state and at the same time recognize the responsibility of the State of Oregon to protect the public health of the citizens of this state. In furtherance of this responsibility the State Department of Agriculture is authorized to take all measures necessary and proper in its judgment to complement the enforcement of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and to prevent and prohibit the sale and distribution of unwholesome meat and meat food products dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of Oregon consumers. In this respect the department shall exercise general sanitary and quality control, and establish supervision and safeguards over meat establishments and meat products under its jurisdiction. [1973 c.174 §3]

 

      619.026 Meat preparation establishment sanitation requirements. (1) Every establishment, including all equipment therein or thereon, shall be kept in a clean, healthful and sanitary condition.

      (2) Unclean, unhealthful and insanitary conditions shall be deemed to exist if:

      (a) All the equipment utilized is not thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis, or more often as required by the State Department of Agriculture.

      (b) Meat and meat products being prepared, packed, stored, sold, distributed or transported are not securely protected from flies, dust, dirt and, as far as may be necessary, by all reasonable means from all other foreign or injurious contamination.

      (c) The persons and clothing of all employees or other persons therein are unclean.

      (d) The refuse, dirt and waste products, subject to decomposition or fermentation generated in the operation of the establishment, are not removed at least on a daily basis or as otherwise authorized by the department. [1973 c.174 §5]

(1) A person may not operate an animal food slaughtering establishment or processing establishment without first obtaining a license for the establishment from the State Department of Agriculture.

      (2) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for establishments licensed under this section. The department may determine the license fee for an establishment based upon the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an applicant, the department shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales and service records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales and services by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales and services figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant. The license shall expire on June 30 next following the date of issuance or on such date as may be specified by department rule.

      (3) Except as provided in this subsection, the department may not adopt a rule to establish a license fee that is more than three percent higher than the license fee charged during the preceding year for an establishment of the same type and having the same volume of gross sales and services. When adopting a rule establishing a license fee, notwithstanding the three percent limit, the department may round the fee amount to the next higher whole dollar amount. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

      (4) The provisions of ORS 603.025 (2) and (5), 603.034 (1) and (2), 603.045 (7) and 603.075 shall apply to animal food slaughtering establishments or processing establishments.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a person licensed by the department under ORS chapter 603 to slaughter meat animals and subject to federal meat inspection, or a person licensed by the department under ORS chapter 603 to slaughter only poultry and rabbits and subject to federal poultry inspection, or a person licensed by the department under ORS chapter 603 as a nonslaughtering processor may, without being required to obtain an additional license, also sell or dispose of meat products as animal food provided that such licensees also comply with the provisions of subsection (6) of this section, ORS 619.010 to 619.026 and 619.036 to 619.066.

The license shall expire on June 30 next following the date of issuance or on such date as may be specified by department rule.

      (3) The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2025, for an establishment of the same type and having the same volume of gross sales and services. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

      (4) The provisions of ORS 603.025 (2) and (5), 603.034 (1) and (2), 603.045 (7) and 603.075 shall apply to animal food slaughtering establishments or processing establishments.

IDENTIFICATION OF FRYERS

 

      619.350 “Fryer” defined. As used in ORS 619.350 to 619.380, unless the context requires otherwise, “fryer” means a chicken of any breed or variety, slaughtered under the age of six months, produced for sale for human consumption as a fryer, broiler or fryer-roaster, or the cut-up parts of such a chicken. [1959 c.385 §1; 1997 c.462 §1; 2009 c.367 §4]

 

      619.355 Identification required before sale for human consumption; exception. (1) All fryers and fryer parts that are exposed or offered for sale for human consumption in this state and that have been grown in Oregon must be conspicuously identified to the consumer or purchaser as fryers or fryer parts that are Oregon-grown.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to fryers that are exposed or offered for sale to ultimate consumers at the farm or ranch where the fryers were produced, if no fryers produced elsewhere are exposed or offered for sale to ultimate consumers at the farm or ranch. [1959 c.385 §§2,3; 1997 c.462 §2]

 

      619.360 Identification required before transporting for sale for human consumption. Except as provided in ORS 619.375, and except for a common carrier, no person shall transport any fryer for purposes of sale for human consumption unless the fryer is identified as required by ORS 619.355 (1) and 619.370. [1959 c.385 §7; 1997 c.462 §4]

 

      619.365 Misrepresentation concerning grower, state of origin or fresh condition. No person, by means of any representation, either verbal, printed or written, shall willfully represent or pretend that fryers or parts thereof:

      (1) Were grown by any person, or in any state, other than by the person and in the state where the fryers were in fact grown; or

      (2) Are fresh, if at any time after slaughter, they have ever been frozen. [1959 c.385 §4; 1967 c.301 §1; 1997 c.462 §3]

 

      619.370 Labeling concerning addition of chemical preservative. (1) No person shall sell or display, expose, offer or possess for sale for human consumption, a fryer to which a chemical preservative has been added, unless it is conspicuously labeled in legible letters or figures of not less than one-sixteenth of an inch in height with the words “preservatives added: (here insert a list of the preservatives, by their common or technical names).”

      (2) “Chemical preservative,” as used in this section, means any substance, including but not limited to antibiotics, which when added to fryers tends to prevent or retard deterioration of the fryer, but does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices or oils extracted from spices, or substances added to food by direct exposure to wood smoke.

      (3) Subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not apply to a fryer or immediate container which bears a label provided under section 81.120 of the United States Department of Agriculture Regulations issued pursuant to the Poultry Products Inspection Act (71 Stat. 441), as amended by the Wholesome Poultry Products Act of August 18, 1969, (82 Stat. 971; U.S.C. 451) et seq. [1959 c.385 §5; 1973 c.174 §14]

 

      619.375 Certain fryers excepted from provisions of ORS 619.350 to 619.380. The provisions of ORS 619.350 to 619.380 do not apply to fryers being transported from the grower’s residence or place of business to a warehouse for storage, or to any place for inspection, grading, packing or processing. [1959 c.385 §6]

 

      619.380 Enjoining violations. In addition to other penalties and enforcement provisions contained in ORS 619.350 to 619.380, circuit courts may, upon petition of the State Department of Agriculture, enjoin by temporary or permanent injunction any violation of the provisions of ORS 619.350 to 619.380. [1959 c.385 §8; 2009 c.367 §5]

LABELING OF LAMB

 

      619.411 Definitions for ORS 619.411 to 619.426. As used in ORS 619.411 to 619.426:

      (1) “Commission” means the Oregon Sheep Commission.

      (2) “Lamb” means animals defined as lamb by the United States Department of Agriculture grading standards.

      (3) “Immediate container” means the box, carton, bag or wrapper or other receptacle used by any person in transporting lamb, or in which lamb is offered for sale. “Immediate container” does not include package liners.

      (4) “Label” means the information required by ORS 619.411 to 619.426 to be placed on the lamb or on the immediate container by means of a stamp, stencil or printing by machine or by attaching to the immediate container, by means of glue or paste, a machine-printed label. [1989 c.616 §2]

 

      619.416 Labeling required before sale for human consumption; restriction on use of words “Grown in Oregon.” (1) Lamb, or the immediate container in which it is enclosed, which is produced and processed in Oregon and is offered for sale for human consumption, may be conspicuously labeled with a label not less than one inch in height and one and one-half inches in width in legible letters or figures of not less than three-sixteenths of an inch in height, with the words “Grown in Oregon.” If the immediate container is made of transparent material, the label may be placed inside the material if it is affixed so that it is easily readable by a consumer or purchaser. If the lamb is not enclosed in an immediate container, the label shall be placed on a tag securely fastened to the lamb.

      (2) Lamb that is produced in Oregon and processed out-of-state may carry the “Grown in Oregon” label if the producer, processor and retailer voluntarily develop a system of tracking and are able to prove that lamb sold for human consumption carrying the “Grown in Oregon” label was produced in Oregon.

      (3) Lamb that is not produced in Oregon may not carry the name Oregon, in any form, anywhere on the lamb or its immediate container. [1989 c.616 §3]

 

      619.420 [1957 c.104 §10; repealed by 1973 c.174 §20]

 

      619.421 Misrepresentation regarding grower, state of origin or fresh condition. No person, by means of any representation, either verbal, printed or written, or by improper use of labels, shall willfully represent or pretend that lamb:

      (1) Was grown by any person, or in any state or country other than by the person and in the state or country where the lamb was in fact grown.

      (2) Is fresh, if, at anytime after slaughter, it has ever been frozen. [1989 c.616 §4]

 

      619.426 Enjoining violations. Circuit courts hereby are authorized, upon petition of the Oregon Sheep Commission, to enjoin by temporary or permanent injunction any violations of the provisions of ORS 619.411 to 619.426. [1989 c.616 §5]
