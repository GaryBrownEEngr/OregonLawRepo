      621.070 License required to use grade designation. A person shall not use any grade designation on bottle caps, in advertising, on labels or in any other manner connected with the sale of fluid milk unless the State Department of Agriculture has licensed the person to use the grade designation. [Amended by 1999 c.197 §11]

 

      621.072 Issuance of license to use grade designation; grading by milk hauler; facility inspections; fees; rules. (1) The State Department of Agriculture shall issue a license to use a grade designation to any person who:

      (a) Makes written application for a license on forms provided by the department;

      (b) Pays the designated license fee;

      (c) Is engaged in the business of producing or distributing fluid milk; and

      (d) Meets the requirements of the particular grade designation for which application is made.

      (2) If a person carries on the activities of a producer and a producer-distributor, the person must obtain a separate license for each of those activities.

      (3) Licenses issued under this section shall be personal and not transferable.

      (4) Each milk hauler, milk receiver or other person who grades fluid milk as fit or unfit for processing as fluid milk due to quality, odor, flavor or wholesomeness must first obtain a license from the department authorizing that person to sample and grade fluid milk. Each applicant for a milk sampler’s and grader’s license shall, by written examination, demonstrate an adequate knowledge of milk sanitation as it relates to the sampling, grading and handling of fluid milk and cream for analysis. The department shall give examinations for licenses at such times and places as appears to be necessary and practicable.

      (5) Before and after issuing a license to a person as a producer, producer-distributor, distributor or nonprocessing distributor of fluid milk, the department shall, as it deems necessary, inspect the physical facilities of the applicant’s dairy, milk processing plant or distribution center and investigate other factors the department determines may relate to the production, processing or distribution of fluid milk.

      (6) Each license issued under this section expires on June 30 next following the date of its issuance unless sooner revoked and may be renewed upon application of the licensee. Each application for a license or annual renewal of a license shall be accompanied by a license fee.

      (7) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for:

      (a) Milk samplers and graders;

      (b) Producer-distributors, distributors and nonprocessing distributors; and

      (c) Producers.

      (8) The department may determine the license fee for a producer-distributor, distributor or nonprocessing distributor based upon the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an applicant under this subsection, the department shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales and service records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales and services by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales and services figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant.

      (9) The department may determine the license fee for a producer based upon the annual gross sales by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an applicant under this subsection, the department shall use the annual gross sales by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross sales for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross sales by the applicant.

      (10) Except as provided in this subsection, the department may not adopt a rule under this section to establish a license fee that is more than three percent higher than the fee charged during the preceding year for a milk sampler and grader, for a producer-distributor, distributor or nonprocessing distributor having the same volume of gross sales and services or for a producer having the same volume of gross sales. When adopting a rule establishing a license fee, notwithstanding the three percent limit, the department may round the fee amount to the next higher whole dollar amount. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

      (11) A distributor or producer-distributor must obtain a license and pay license fees for each physical facility used to produce, process or distribute fluid milk. A person is not required to obtain a distributor or producer-distributor license to act as a milk hauler or to operate receiving or transfer stations in conjunction with a milk processing plant.

      (12) The department may refuse to issue or renew, or may suspend or revoke, a license for any violation of this section or ORS 621.062, 621.070, 621.076, 621.084, 621.088, 621.117, 621.122 or 621.259 or processes or standards established under ORS 621.060 or 621.083.

      (5) Before and after issuing a license to a person as a producer, producer-distributor, distributor or nonprocessing distributor of fluid milk, the department shall, as it deems necessary, inspect the physical facilities of the applicant’s dairy, milk processing plant or distribution center and investigate other factors the department determines may relate to the production, processing or distribution of fluid milk.

      (6) Each license issued under this section expires on June 30 next following the date of its issuance unless sooner revoked and may be renewed upon application of the licensee. Each application for a license or annual renewal of a license shall be accompanied by a license fee.

      (7) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for:

      (a) Milk samplers and graders;

      (b) Producer-distributors, distributors and nonprocessing distributors; and

      (c) Producers.

      (8) The department may determine the license fee for a producer-distributor, distributor or nonprocessing distributor based upon the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an applicant under this subsection, the department shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales and service records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales and services by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales and services figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant.

      (9) The department may determine the license fee for a producer based upon the annual gross sales by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an applicant under this subsection, the department shall use the annual gross sales by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross sales for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross sales by the applicant.

      (10) The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee for a milk sampler and grader that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2025, for a milk sampler and grader. The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee for a producer-distributor, distributor or nonprocessing distributor that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2025, for a producer-distributor, distributor or nonprocessing distributor having the same volume of gross sales and services. The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee for a producer that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2025, for a producer having the same volume of gross sales. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

      (11) A distributor or producer-distributor must obtain a license and pay license fees for each physical facility used to produce, process or distribute fluid milk. A person is not required to obtain a distributor or producer-distributor license to act as a milk hauler or to operate receiving or transfer stations in conjunction with a milk processing plant.

      (12) The department may refuse to issue or renew, or may suspend or revoke, a license for any violation of this section or ORS 621.062, 621.070, 621.076, 621.084, 621.088, 621.117, 621.122 or 621.259 or processes or standards established under ORS 621.060 or 621.083.

The power of suspension may be exercised by the department for any violation of ORS 621.062, 621.070, 621.072, 621.076, 621.084, 621.088, 621.117, 621.122 (7), 621.226 or 621.259, standards adopted under ORS 621.060, 621.083 or 621.224 or any department rules.

      (2) A suspension shall not exceed 10 days except that, before lifting the suspension, the department shall ensure that the violation causing the suspension has been corrected.

      (3) The provisions of ORS 183.413 to 183.470 do not apply to suspensions imposed under authority of this section, although appeal shall be in the manner provided by ORS 183.484, 183.486, 183.490 and 183.497.

      621.078 Additional users of milk processing plant; fees; rules. (1) The State Department of Agriculture may issue a distributor or producer-distributor license under ORS 621.072 to one or more additional users of a milk processing plant that is primarily operated by another distributor or producer-distributor. A license issued to an additional user for activities at the milk processing plant may differ in activity type from the license issued to the primary operator of the plant. The physical facilities of the milk processing plant must conform to the requirements for all activity types for which the primary operator and the additional users of the plant are licensed. Regardless of the number of persons licensed to use a milk processing plant, the department may not recognize more than one distributor or producer-distributor as the primary operator of the plant.

      (2) The department may assess a distributor or producer-distributor license fee to an additional user of a milk processing plant, calculated as provided in rules adopted under ORS 621.072. In calculating license fees as provided under ORS 621.072, the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for an additional user of a milk processing plant is independent of the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for any other user or the primary operator of the plant.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 621.072, the department may adopt rules to establish the license expiration, renewal and application dates for distributors or producer-distributors that are additional users of a milk processing plant.

      (4) The department may adopt rules to determine the responsibilities of a milk processing plant’s primary operator and additional users of the milk processing plant under standards prescribed by ORS 621.176 and 621.181 and under ORS 621.183.

      (5) A recognized primary operator of a milk processing plant shall notify the department upon the expiration or termination of the rental or lease of the plant by an additional user of the plant. [2007 c.645 §7; 2012 c.64 §23; 2015 c.203 §23]

      (a) Mobile milk tankers; and

      (b) Dairy products plants.

      (5) The department may determine the license fee for a dairy products plant based upon the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant. In establishing the amount of the license fee for an applicant, the department shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales and service records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales or services for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales and services by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales and services figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant.

      (6) Except as provided in this subsection, the department may not adopt a rule under this section to establish a license fee that is more than three percent higher than the fee charged during the preceding year for an equivalent mobile milk tanker or for a dairy products plant having the same volume of gross sales and services. When adopting a rule establishing a license fee, notwithstanding the three percent limit, the department may round the fee amount to the next higher whole dollar amount. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

In establishing the amount of the license fee for an applicant, the department shall use the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services by that applicant within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the applicant maintains sales and service records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the applicant applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross dollar volume of sales or services for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales and services by the applicant. If an applicant whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales and services figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross dollar volume of sales and services by the applicant.

      (6) The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee for a mobile milk tanker that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2025, for an equivalent mobile milk tanker. The department may not adopt or enforce a rule under this section establishing a license fee for a dairy products plant that is higher than the license fee charged for the license year that began July 1, 2025, for a dairy products plant having the same volume of gross sales and services. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not change the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

A license issued to an additional user for activities at the dairy products plant shall cover all operations at that plant by the person licensed. Regardless of the number of persons licensed to use a dairy products plant, the department may not recognize more than one person as the primary operator of the plant.

      (2) The department may assess a license fee to an additional user of a dairy products plant described in subsection (1) of this section, calculated as provided in rules adopted under ORS 621.166. In calculating license fees as provided under ORS 621.166, the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for an additional user of the dairy products plant is independent of the annual gross dollar volume of sales and services for any other user or the primary operator of the plant.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 621.166, the department may adopt rules to establish the license expiration, renewal and application dates for additional users of a dairy products plant.

      (4) The department may adopt rules to determine the responsibilities of the dairy products plant’s primary operator and additional users of the dairy products plant’s under standards prescribed by ORS 621.176 and 621.181 and under ORS 621.183.

      (5) A recognized primary operator of a dairy products plant shall notify the department upon the expiration or termination of the rental or lease of the plant by an additional user of the plant. [2007 c.645 §8; 2012 c.64 §25]

      (2) The department may refuse to issue or renew or may revoke or suspend the license of any person who fails to comply with the provisions of ORS 621.056, 621.057, 621.092, 621.122, 621.183 and 621.198 and the regulations promulgated under ORS 621.096 or 621.261.

STATE FACILITIES FOR TESTING MILK FAT CONTENT

 

      621.720 Testing for milk fat content required. The State Department of Agriculture shall establish and maintain procedures, systems and plans to carry out and enforce the intent and purposes of ORS 621.730, 621.740 and 621.750. The department shall make department laboratory facilities, equipment, materials and services available to producers and other persons engaged in the milk industry for the official testing, retesting or duplicate testing of milk for milk fat content by means of the “Babcock Test” or any equally accurate and efficient test approved by the department. [1965 c.474 §2; 1999 c.197 §57]

 

      621.730 Department to provide testing; contracts of purchase not to be terminated; testing fees. (1) Within the availability of funds to be collected under ORS 621.740, the State Department of Agriculture shall maintain laboratory facilities and purchase necessary equipment and materials to carry out this section and ORS 621.720, 621.740 and 621.750.

      (2) Any producer or other person engaged in the milk industry is authorized to request the department to provide and furnish official testing, retesting or duplicate testing of milk.

      (3) A milk handler, dealer, licensee or purchaser of milk shall not terminate or threaten to terminate the purchase of milk from a producer or seller, or take or threaten to take other retaliatory action against a producer or seller of milk, because the producer or seller has exercised rights and privileges as authorized in this section. In addition to any action the department is authorized to take against any person taking retaliatory steps or procedures, the producer or seller of milk may also maintain an action for damages against the same person. The prevailing party in the action shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal.

      (4) The department may establish reasonable fees for enforcing and carrying out this section and ORS 621.720, 621.740 and 621.750, in amounts necessary to reimburse the department for the furnishing of services and materials as required thereunder. [1965 c.474 §3; 1979 c.499 §24; 1981 c.897 §73; 1999 c.197 §58]

 

      621.740 Liability for payment of fees. (1) The producer or person requesting official testing and related testing services from the State Department of Agriculture, as authorized under ORS 621.730 and 621.750 shall pay the fees established under ORS 621.730 as provided by rule of the department.

      (2) If the producer or person requesting the services is selling milk to a first handler, distributor, producer-distributor or dairy products plant licensee, the department may forward an itemized statement for services rendered to the person requesting the services and also to the first handler, distributor, producer-distributor or licensee. The first handler, distributor, producer-distributor or licensee shall pay the itemized amount to the department and shall deduct that amount from the amount paid to the producer or other person selling milk. Any first handler, distributor, producer-distributor or licensee who refuses to make the deduction shall pay the itemized amount to the department.

      (3) Subsection (2) of this section does not relieve the producer or person requesting the services from being primarily responsible for payment to the department. The department may take all actions necessary to collect the amount due against the producer or person requesting the services. [1965 c.474 §4; 1999 c.197 §59; 2013 c.85 §5]

 

      621.750 Sampling and testing; payment adjustments; rules. (1) The State Department of Agriculture shall promulgate rules including but not limited to rules providing that any producer may request the department to make an official milk fat content test of the milk the producer is selling to a dealer, milk handler or purchaser of milk. Official sample test periods used by the department shall correspond to the testing periods used by the dealer, handler or purchaser. At the time that the grader samples the milk, each sample shall be split. One portion of the split sample shall be placed in a separate container furnished and approved by the department. The container shall be sealed as required by the department and signed or initialed by both the producer and the grader. The split sample shall be forwarded by the dealer, handler or purchaser to the department at the expense of the producer and as prescribed by rules of the department. The department shall combine the samples for the period involved and make the official test requested of the composite group of samples. The department shall forward a copy of the test to the producer and a copy shall be mailed to the dealer, handler or purchaser submitting the sample. If the test performed and carried out by the department varies by more than one-tenth of one percent from the test made by the dealer, handler or purchaser, within the time prescribed by the department the dealer, handler or purchaser shall adjust and make proper payments to the producer based upon the official tests made by the department.

      (2) The department shall make official testing for milk fat similar to the testing described in subsection (1) of this section available to any other person subject to this chapter. [1965 c.474 §5; 1999 c.197 §60; 2013 c.85 §6]
