      624.073 Revocation, suspension or refusal of license; closure; sanitation score; inspection schedule; fees. (1) If the Director of the Oregon Health Authority determines that a critical violation of ORS 624.010 to 624.121, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, exists in a restaurant or bed and breakfast facility and the critical violation constitutes a potential danger to the public health, the director may revoke, suspend or refuse to issue the license required by ORS 624.020 if, after a reasonable time has been given for correction of the violation, but not longer than 14 days, the violation continues to exist. The director shall reinstate a license that has been revoked or suspended if the director determines that the violation has been corrected.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 624.020, if the director determines that a critical violation of ORS 624.010 to 624.121, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, exists in a restaurant or bed and breakfast facility and the critical violation constitutes an imminent or present danger to the public health, the director may order immediate correction, use of an approved alternative procedure or closure of the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility by written notice thereof to the operator. The inspection report carrying a statement ordering closure and specifying the reasons therefor signed by the director and delivered to the operator may serve as the written notice of the closure. The director shall use inspection forms that clearly display notice that procedures are available to the licensee under ORS chapter 183 for appeal of the closure order. A copy of the notice shall be filed with the records of the Oregon Health Authority. The closure order shall have the effect of an immediate revocation of the operator’s license. If requested, the director shall provide a prompt hearing after the closure in accordance with ORS chapter 183.

      (3) If the director determines that closure of the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility is necessary because failure to correct a critical violation or implement an approved alternative procedure constitutes a potential danger to the public health, or failure to correct a critical violation or implement an approved alternative procedure constitutes an imminent or present danger to the public health, the director shall:

      (a) Notify the owner or person in charge of the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility that such restaurant or bed and breakfast facility shall not be used for food service purposes until the critical violations specified in the inspection report have been corrected; and

      (b) Post a notice of closure upon the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility at the customary entrance to the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility in public view to the effect that the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility is closed for operation because a critical violation exists.

      (4)(a) No person shall remove a notice of closure from a restaurant or bed and breakfast facility until the violation which caused the notice to be posted has been corrected.

      (b) No person shall operate a restaurant or bed and breakfast facility upon which a notice of closure has been posted until the violation which caused the notice to be posted has been corrected and the notice has been removed.

      (5) The director shall define clearly the criteria and rules for conformance to acceptable food service practices used to determine the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility sanitation score to insure statewide uniformity in the inspection and licensing processes. Critical violations which constitute a potential danger to the public health and critical violations which constitute an imminent or present danger to the public health shall be clearly defined. Minimum acceptable food service standard procedures shall be clearly defined by setting a minimum acceptable sanitation score for a licensed restaurant or bed and breakfast facility.

      (6) If a restaurant or bed and breakfast facility obtains a sanitation score of less than the minimum acceptable standard, the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility operator or person in charge of the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility shall be notified of impending closure if, after reinspection within 30 days, the sanitation score does not meet minimum acceptable food service standards. If closure action is taken after reinspection, the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility may not be operated until the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility operator submits a plan for correction of the violations that receives the approval of the director and a subsequent inspection of the restaurant or bed and breakfast facility produces a sanitation score that meets minimum acceptable food service standards.

      (7) The authority may establish a more frequent inspection schedule for a restaurant licensed under ORS 624.020 that fails to meet specific minimum standards established by the authority. The authority may charge a fee for costs associated with the performance of additional inspections.

      (8) As used in this section, “imminent” means impending or likely to develop without delay. [Formerly 624.085; 2009 c.595 §1007]

      (2) A person who is affected with a communicable disease described in subsection (1) of this section or is a carrier of such disease may not work in any restaurant, bed and breakfast facility, intermittent temporary restaurant, seasonal temporary restaurant or single-event temporary restaurant. A restaurant, bed and breakfast facility, intermittent temporary restaurant, seasonal temporary restaurant or single-event temporary restaurant may not employ a person who is affected with, carries or is suspected of being affected with or carrying any communicable disease. If the restaurant, bed and breakfast facility, intermittent temporary restaurant, seasonal temporary restaurant or single-event temporary restaurant manager suspects that any employee has contracted any disease in a communicable form or has become a carrier of such disease, the manager shall notify the Director of the Oregon Health Authority immediately. A placard containing this subsection shall be posted in all toilet rooms.

      (3) When suspicion arises as to the possibility of transmission of infection from any restaurant, bed and breakfast facility, intermittent temporary restaurant, seasonal temporary restaurant or single-event temporary restaurant employee, the director may require any or all of the following measures:

      (a) The immediate exclusion of the employee from all restaurants, bed and breakfast facilities, intermittent temporary restaurants, seasonal temporary restaurants and single-event temporary restaurants; and

      (b) Adequate medical examinations of the employee and associates of the employee, with such laboratory examinations as may be indicated. [Amended by 1957 c.672 §5; 1973 c.825 §10; 1987 c.226 §6; 1999 c.59 §184; 2009 c.595 §1009; 2011 c.664 §7]

The fact that contributions to an organization do not qualify for a charitable deduction for tax purposes or that the organization is not otherwise exempt from payment of federal income taxes pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, constitutes prima facie evidence that the organization is not a bona fide benevolent organization. For purposes of this section, each subordinate lodge, chapter, council, grange, church, parish or other subdivision of an organization constitutes a separate organization. [Formerly 624.015]

      (b) Notwithstanding ORS 624.490 or 624.650, the authority, or a local public health authority as provided under ORS 624.510, may not charge a benevolent organization a license fee or inspection fee for a single-event temporary restaurant licensed under this subsection.

      (2) The authority shall issue a single-event temporary restaurant license to each restaurant service provider at a special event arranged by a benevolent organization. The license shall be provided without fee to each restaurant service provider who files with the benevolent organization a signed statement that the service provider receives no profit from restaurant services performed at the special event. The statement shall be subject to inspection by the authority at the time inspections are made pursuant to ORS 624.111. A benevolent organization may not arrange more than one special event per calendar year for which restaurant service providers are licensed without charge under this subsection.

The committee shall consist of volunteer representatives from a cross section of the food service industry, the general public, appropriate local and state groups, county environmental health specialists and other appropriate state agencies, including the State Department of Agriculture. In addition to such other duties as may be prescribed by the authority, the committee, not later than October 1 of each even-numbered year, shall submit to the authority and the Legislative Assembly recommendations regarding the implementation of ORS 624.020, 624.060, 624.073, 624.495 and 624.510.

      (3) The local public health authority may charge reasonable fees to cover actual expenses of providing the training and issuing verification of training.

      (4) The local public health authority may waive in writing the training requirements of this section in cases of undue hardship, or where the local authority determines that the employee’s assignment renders such training impracticable or unnecessary.

      (5) Civil or criminal liability to the restaurant or restaurant employees may not result from good faith application by a trained person of the first aid described under subsection (1) of this section. [1977 c.824 §1; 2001 c.975 §4a; 2003 c.309 §12]

The intergovernmental agreement must describe the powers, duties and functions of the local public health authority relating to fee collection, licensing, inspections, enforcement, civil penalties and issuance and revocation of permits and certificates, standards for enforcement by the local public health authority and the monitoring to be performed by the Oregon Health Authority. The Oregon Health Authority shall review the performance of the local public health authority under any expiring intergovernmental agreement. The review shall include criteria to determine if provisions of ORS 624.073 are uniformly applied to all licensees within the jurisdiction of the local public health authority. In accordance with ORS chapter 183, the director may suspend or rescind an intergovernmental agreement under this subsection. If the Oregon Health Authority suspends or rescinds an intergovernmental agreement, the unexpended portion of the fees collected under subsection (2) of this section shall be available to the Oregon Health Authority for carrying out the powers, duties and functions under this section.

      (2) A local public health authority shall collect fees on behalf of the Oregon Health Authority that are adequate to cover the administration and enforcement costs incurred by the local public health authority under this section and the cost of oversight by the Oregon Health Authority. If the fee collected by a local public health authority for a license or service is more than 20 percent above or below the fee for that license or service charged by the Oregon Health Authority, the Oregon Health Authority shall analyze the local public health authority fee process and determine whether the local public health authority used the proper cost elements in determining the fee and whether the amount of the fee is justified. Cost elements may include, but need not be limited to, expenses related to administration, program costs, salaries, travel expenses and Oregon Health Authority consultation fees. If the Oregon Health Authority determines that the local public health authority did not use the proper cost elements in determining the fee or that the amount of the fee is not justified, the Oregon Health Authority may order the local public health authority to reduce any fee to a level supported by the Oregon Health Authority’s analysis of the fee process.

      (3) The Oregon Health Authority, after consultation with groups representing local health officials in the state, shall by rule assess a remittance from each local public health authority to which health enforcement powers, duties or functions have been delegated under subsection (1) of this section. The amount of the remittance must be specified in the intergovernmental agreement. The remittance shall supplement existing funds for consultation services and development and maintenance of the statewide food service program. The Oregon Health Authority shall consult with groups representing local health officials in the state and statewide restaurant associations in developing the statewide food service program.

      (4) In any action, suit or proceeding arising out of local public health authority administration of functions pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and involving the validity of a rule adopted by the Oregon Health Authority, the Oregon Health Authority shall be made a party to the action, suit or proceeding.

      (1) Make recommendations to the local public health authority regarding the administration and enforcement by the local authority of powers, duties and functions under an existing or proposed intergovernmental agreement; and

      (2) Review and provide to the Oregon Health Authority an evaluation of the effectiveness of this chapter and any foodborne illness prevention program adopted by the Oregon Health Authority by rule under ORS 624.495. [1983 c.533 §8; 1985 c.519 §5; 2003 c.309 §17; 2009 c.595 §1032]
