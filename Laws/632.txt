Such marks, and the location thereof, shall conform to the rules and regulations established by the State Department of Agriculture when promulgating grades for horticultural products.

      (4) “Deceptive pack” means any arrangement of horticultural products which has in the outer layer or any exposed surface horticultural products which are so superior in quality, size, condition or in any other respect to those in the interior of the lot or the unexposed portion as to materially misrepresent the contents of the lot. A deceptive pack also means a container slackly filled so as to deceive the purchaser in regard to the total contents, or a container which has had a portion of the original contents removed and then offered for sale as a full pack. [Formerly 616.505; 2001 c.104 §245]

 

      632.455 Labeling container of horticultural products.

      (3) The use of grade standards authorized to be established by this section is not mandatory unless otherwise specifically provided by law. However, the deceptive use or misuse of any grade standards is unlawful. [Formerly 616.515; 1979 c.91 §2]

 

      632.465 Used packages or containers.

      (2) The possession for sale or transportation by such person of any such horticultural products so falsely marked, labeled or packed is prima facie evidence that such person has so falsely marked, labeled or packed such horticultural products.

      (3) The provisions of ORS 632.450 to 632.485 do not apply to the transportation of horticultural products by common carrier, except when the common carrier is issued a written notice by the State Department of Agriculture that the lot of horticultural products offered for shipments has been seized by the department for not meeting the requirements of ORS 632.450 to 632.485 and the notice is accompanied with a copy of the seizure notice. [Formerly 616.530]

 

      632.480 Shipment or sale of deceptive pack, load or display prohibited. No person shall prepare, deliver for shipment, ship, transport, offer for sale or sell a deceptive pack, or package, load, arrangement or display of horticultural products. [Formerly 616.535]

 

      632.485 Enforcement; entry and inspection; seizure. (1) The director and all authorized agents of the State Department of Agriculture shall enforce ORS 632.450 to 632.485 and to that end may enter any place or conveyance within this state where any fruit, nuts or vegetables are produced, stored, packed, delivered for shipment, loaded, shipped, being transported, or sold, and inspect all such fruit, nuts or vegetables and the containers thereof and take for inspection such representative samples of the fruit, nuts or vegetables and such containers, as may be necessary, to determine whether or not ORS 632.450 to 632.485 have been violated.

[Formerly 616.540]

 

      632.490 Labeling fruit or vegetables as Oregon grown or packed. All persons operating under their own private brand in Oregon in the business of packing or canning fruit or vegetables, either fresh, canned, evaporated or otherwise, shall plainly designate on such private brand that goods were Oregon grown or packed in Oregon. For the purpose of this section it is sufficient for the firms whose headquarters are in Oregon to either designate the local address of the cannery or to designate the location of their main office in Oregon. This section does not apply to sales to wholesalers, packers or others for reselling. [Formerly 616.545]

 

      632.495 Labeling of exported horticultural commodities and commodity packs; rules. (1) As used in this section:

      632.838 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that the regulation of egg production and of the sale of eggs and egg products, as described in ORS 632.835 to 632.850, is necessary to protect the health and welfare of consumers, to promote food safety, to advance animal welfare and to protect this state against the negative fiscal impacts associated with a lack of effective regulation of egg production and sales of eggs and egg products. [2019 c.686 §2]

 

      632.840 Manner of confining egg-laying hen; business plan for compliance; rules; inspections; fees; report; penalty. (1) The State Department of Agriculture shall adopt rules regulating the manner in which egg-laying hens may be confined in an enclosure for purposes of ORS 632.835 to 632.850. The rules must:

      (a) Be designed to promote humane welfare standards;

      (b) Be effective in protecting consumers from food-borne pathogens;

      (c) Require that enclosures constructed or otherwise acquired before January 1, 2012, meet standards equivalent to the requirements for certification established in the United Egg Producers’ Animal Husbandry Guidelines for U.S. Egg Laying Flocks; and

      (d) Require that enclosures constructed or otherwise acquired on or after January 1, 2012, meet standards equivalent to the requirements for certification of enriched colony facility systems established in the American Humane Association’s farm animal welfare certification program. In no event may the rules authorize confining an egg-laying hen in an enclosure that provides less than 116.3 square inches of individually usable floor space per hen.

      (2) The department may impose a civil penalty pursuant to ORS 183.745, not to exceed $2,500, for violation of a provision of ORS 632.835 to 632.850.

      (4) The department may fix, assess and collect, or cause to be collected, from commercial farm owners or operators fees for the inspections performed by employees or agents of the department under subsection (3) of this section. The fees must have a uniform basis and must be in an amount reasonably necessary to cover the costs of the inspections and related administrative duties under ORS 632.835 to 632.850. The department shall adjust the fees under this subsection to meet any expenses necessary to carry out subsection (3) of this section and may prescribe a different fee scale for different localities.

      (b) “Handler” means a person or the agent of the person who processes produce the person has purchased or otherwise acquired in this state from a grower.

      (c) “Produce” means any fruit or vegetable grown or produced by a grower and of which total sales by growers to handlers for the previous growing season totaled more than $1 million. The department shall determine and verify the application of this defined term, and the total sales value herein specified, and for this purpose shall be authorized to inspect books and records and require reports. [1973 c.587 §3]

 

      632.950 Termination of department inspection activities by grower vote; election procedure; costs. At any time before or after the State Department of Agriculture is conducting the inspection and classification of a particular fruit or vegetable at a particular plant of a handler, if 51 percent of the growers who produce 60 percent or more of that product vote against the department inspection and classification of that particular product, the department shall not inaugurate such inspection, or if already inspecting shall terminate such inspections.

The costs of the election and the method and time of voting shall be specified by the department and the petitioners for such election shall pay such costs prior to any vote. Once an election has been held to reject inspection no new election either to require inspection or to reject inspection shall be held in less than one year following the previous election. All subsequent elections shall require the same percentage of petitioners for the election and the same percentage vote of growers and volume of product as provided in this section. The costs of all elections shall be assessed to the petitioners for each election and shall be paid to the department prior to such election. [1973 c.587 §4]
