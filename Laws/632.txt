[1973 c.587 §3]

 

      632.950 Termination of department inspection activities by grower vote; election procedure; costs. At any time before or after the State Department of Agriculture is conducting the inspection and classification of a particular fruit or vegetable at a particular plant of a handler, if 51 percent of the growers who produce 60 percent or more of that product vote against the department inspection and classification of that particular product, the department shall not inaugurate such inspection, or if already inspecting shall terminate such inspections. To have such an election 20 percent of the growers shipping that product to the handler shall petition the department. If the department finds the petition in order it shall conduct an election. The costs of the election and the method and time of voting shall be specified by the department and the petitioners for such election shall pay such costs prior to any vote. Once an election has been held to reject inspection no new election either to require inspection or to reject inspection shall be held in less than one year following the previous election. All subsequent elections shall require the same percentage of petitioners for the election and the same percentage vote of growers and volume of product as provided in this section. The costs of all elections shall be assessed to the petitioners for each election and shall be paid to the department prior to such election. [1973 c.587 §4]

      632.960 Appeal to department for classification; fee. Whenever any quantity of any horticultural or agricultural product has been inspected under ORS 632.940 and 632.955 to 632.980 and a question arises as to whether the certificate issued therefor shows the true grade, classification, quality or condition of such product, any interested person, subject to such regulations as the State Department of Agriculture may prescribe, may appeal the question to the department.
