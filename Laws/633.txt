      633.362 Registration of fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral and lime products; application; fee; expiration; product contents; rules. (1) Each separately identifiable fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product, whether in package or in bulk, must be registered with the State Department of Agriculture. A person may not distribute a fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product in this state unless the fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product is registered with the department.

      (2) The application for registration must be made on a form or forms provided by the department. The application for registration must include the following information:

      (a) Product name and grade;

      (b) Product label;

      (c) Name and physical address of the registrant;

      (d) Mailing address of the registrant;

      (e) Product laboratory analysis;

      (g) Identification of the industry, industry process or industry processes and location of the facility that generated any waste-derived ingredient or ingredients; and

      (h) Other information required by the department by rule.

      (3) The application for registration shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable registration fee established by department rule, not to exceed $50 annually for each fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product. In addition, for a waste-derived product, the department shall charge an annual product evaluation fee. For a fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product, the department may charge a product evaluation fee if supplementary research and evaluation by the department is required in order to determine product compliance with ORS 633.311 to 633.479. The department shall establish product evaluation fees by rule, not to exceed $500. The department shall review the registration application form and product label for compliance with ORS 633.311 to 633.479. If the department finds that the application information and product label comply with ORS 633.311 to 633.479, the department shall issue a certificate of registration to the registrant.

      (4) Certificates of registration shall expire on December 31 of each year, except that the department may grant a certificate of registration for two years. Certificates of registration for two years shall expire on December 31 of the last year in the two-year period.

      (5) The department may assess a $50 late registration fee for a product if the registrant has not paid the registration fee prior to the 30th day following the expiration of the certificate of registration. A late registration fee assessed by the department under this subsection shall be added to the registration fee required under subsection (3) of this section and must be paid by the registrant before the department may issue a certificate of registration.

      (6) The department may require proof of label or labeling statements or claims of the efficacy and usefulness of an ingredient prior to issuing a certificate of registration or at any time deemed necessary by the department. As proof, the department may request data from the registrant to support the label or labeling claims. The department may also rely on other experimental data, data from agricultural experiment stations, product review evaluations and advice from other authoritative sources. The data must be from recognized, statistically designed and analyzed trials conducted by recognized experts in the field. All supporting data shall be representative of the soil, crops and climatic conditions found in the northwestern United States.

      (7) In evaluating a label or labeling statement, claim or guarantee, the department may require the submission of a written statement describing the methodology of the laboratory analysis used, the source of the ingredient material and any reference material relied on to support the label or labeling statement, claim or guarantee. Laboratory analyses submitted in support of an application for registration must comply with laboratory methods of analysis approved by the department.

      (8) Each registrant shall notify the department of any change that results in a laboratory analysis that differs from the laboratory analysis submitted in support of the related application for registration or any change in sources of product ingredients declared on the application form. The registrant must notify the department within 30 days following the change.

      (9) The registrant shall identify as “waste-derived” in the application for registration any fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product that is waste-derived and distributed as a single ingredient product or blended with other fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime products. The application for registration must identify the industry, the industry process or processes and the location of the facility that generated the waste and all ingredients of concern as identified by the department by rule.

      (10) The initial application for registration of a fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product must include a statement of the levels of metals in the product, including but not limited to arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) or other metals or substances identified by the department by rule. The registrant must provide a laboratory analysis report, in accordance with acceptable methods required by the department, to verify the levels of metals or other substances in the product. Subsequent to initial product registration, the registrant shall provide a laboratory analysis report for the product to the department upon request. An initial or subsequent laboratory analysis must have been conducted no more than 18 months prior to submission of that analysis to the department.

      (11) The department shall establish by rule the level of metals or other substances permitted in fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral and lime products registered with the department, including but not limited to the permitted levels of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) or other metals or substances identified by the department by rule for the purpose of protecting humans, animals, water, aquatic life, soil or beneficial plant life. The department shall review the permitted level of metals or other substances in fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral and lime products a minimum of once every five years.

      (12) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a custom mix is not required to be registered if all of the fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime products contained in the final product are registered in accordance with this section.

      (13) The department may refuse to register any fertilizer, agricultural amendment, agricultural mineral or lime product if distribution of the product would violate a provision of ORS 633.311 to 633.479. The registration of each product is a distinct and separate registration. The refusal of the department to register or reregister any product does not affect the registration of any other product by the same person. [2001 c.914 §10; 2009 c.97 §7; 2015 c.514 §8]

      (4) Any sample taken under those sections, and the report showing the results of the official test made on any such sample, shall be prima facie evidence in any court in this state of the true condition of the entire lot, in the examination of which the sample was taken.

      (c) Labeling of seeds, including such additional information as may be required in order to maintain uniformity with the laws and regulations of the federal government or of other states.

      (b) The economic benefits resulting from agricultural seed, flower seed, nursery seed and vegetable seed and seed product industries in this state make the protection, preservation and promotion of those industries a matter of statewide interest that warrants reserving exclusive regulatory power over agricultural seed, flower seed, nursery seed and vegetable seed and products of agricultural seed, flower seed, nursery seed and vegetable seed to the state; and

      (c) The agricultural seed, flower seed, nursery seed and vegetable seed and seed product industries in this state will be adversely affected if those industries are subject to a patchwork of local regulations. [2013 s.s. c.4 §2]
