GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

      634.005 Short title; policy statement. The purpose of this chapter, which shall be known as the State Pesticide Control Act and shall be enforced by the State Department of Agriculture, is to regulate in the public interest the formulation, distribution, storage, transportation, application and use of pesticides. Many materials have been discovered or synthesized which are necessary and valuable for the control of insects, plant diseases and weeds. Many more pesticides will be discovered and needed. Such materials, however, may injure health, property, wildlife or environment by being distributed, stored, transported, applied or used in an improper or careless manner. The pesticide industry of this state has achieved and maintained high standards in its formulation and use of pesticides while at the same time experiencing a minimum of injury to persons, property or the environment. Currently updating the law to maintain this achievement and to consider future new pesticides and problems is necessary for the protection of persons, property, wildlife and environment of this state.

STATEWIDE REGULATION OF PESTICIDES

 

      634.055 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly hereby determines that the citizens of this state benefit from a system of safe, effective and scientifically sound pesticide regulation. The Legislative Assembly further finds that a uniform, statewide system of pesticide regulation that is consistent, coordinated and comports with both federal and state technical expertise is essential to the public health, safety and welfare and that local regulation of pesticides does not materially assist in achieving these benefits. [1996 c.10 §4 (enacted in lieu of 634.007)]

 

      634.057 State preemption of local pesticide regulation. No city, town, county or other political subdivision of this state shall adopt or enforce any ordinance, rule or regulation regarding pesticide sale or use, including but not limited to:

      (12) Product composition. [1996 c.10 §6 (enacted in lieu of 634.009)]

 

      634.060 Actions allowed by city, town, county or other political subdivision. Notwithstanding ORS 634.057, a city, town, county or other political subdivision of this state may adopt a policy regarding the use of pesticides on property owned by the city, town, county or other political subdivision adopting the policy. [1996 c.10 §8 (enacted in lieu of 634.011)]

 

      634.063 Exceptions to state preemption of pesticide regulation. Nothing in ORS 634.057 shall limit the authority of a city, town, county or other political subdivision of this state to adopt or enforce a local ordinance, rule or regulation strictly necessary to comply with:

      (1) The Uniform Building Code published by the International Conference of Building Officials, as amended and adopted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services;

      (2) A uniform fire code; or

      (3) Any requirement of a state or federal statute or regulation pertaining to pesticides. [1996 c.10 §10 (enacted in lieu of 634.013)]

 

      634.065 Department consideration of concerns raised by city, town, county or political subdivision. In administering this chapter, the State Department of Agriculture shall consider any concern raised by a city, town, county or other political subdivision of the state regarding the regulation of pesticides. [1996 c.10 §12 (enacted in lieu of 634.015)]

      (4) At least one owner or part owner of the pest control or pesticide application business shall also obtain and maintain a pesticide applicator’s license if the pesticide operator is a sole proprietorship or a partnership. At least one officer or employee shall obtain and maintain a pesticide applicator’s license if the pesticide operator is a corporation. If a pesticide operator is found to be in violation of this subsection, the pesticide operator’s license, notwithstanding ORS chapter 183, is automatically suspended until the pesticide operator is in compliance. If the business is owned by one individual, the department shall make no charge for the pesticide applicator license issued to the individual under ORS 634.122.

      (5) The department shall not issue or renew a pesticide operator’s license until the applicant or licensee has furnished evidence to the department, in the form of a public liability policy issued by an insurance company qualified to do business in Oregon, protecting the applicant or licensee against liability for injury or death to persons and loss of or damage to property resulting from the application of pesticides, or in lieu of a policy, has furnished a deposit of cash, surety bond or other evidence of financial responsibility acceptable to the department that may be applied by the department to the payment of damages resulting from operator liability.

      (6) The financial responsibility required by subsection (5) of this section must be not less than $25,000 for bodily injury to one or more persons and not less than $25,000 for property damage.

      (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 183, if the licensed pesticide operator fails to maintain the financial responsibility required by subsections (5) and (6) of this section, the license is automatically suspended until the department again verifies the pesticide operator is in compliance with subsections (5) and (6) of this section. The liability insurance company shall notify the department in writing at least 30 days prior to any cancellation of an insurance policy required by this section.

      (8) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 105.810 and 105.815 or other laws to the contrary, the amount of damages for which a pesticide operator or pesticide applicator is liable as a result of use of pesticides, or financial responsibility for the same is limited to actual damages only.

      (f) A regional residential academy operated by the Oregon Youth Authority. [2009 c.501 §2; 2011 c.9 §82; 2013 c.241 §3]

 

      634.705 Adoption of integrated pest management plan and related provisions; exceptions; low-impact pesticide list. (1) The governing body responsible for a school shall adopt an integrated pest management plan for use on the campuses of the school. The governing body shall also adopt provisions for:

      (a) Designating an integrated pest management plan coordinator;

      (b) Identifying plan coordinator responsibilities;

      (c) Giving notices under ORS 634.740;

      (d) Retaining pesticide application records under ORS 634.750;

      (e) Providing a process for responding to inquiries and complaints about noncompliance with the integrated pest management plan; and

      (f) Conducting outreach to the school community about the school’s integrated pest management plan.

      (2) If a governing body has control over only part of a building, a structure or property where a campus is located, the governing body may limit an integrated pest management plan to those parts of the building, structure or property over which the governing body exerts substantial control.

      (3) A governing body is not required to adopt an integrated pest management plan for off-campus buildings, structures or property, notwithstanding any incidental use for instruction.

      (4) Unless a governing body expressly provides otherwise, the application of a germicide, disinfectant, sanitizer, deodorizer, antimicrobial agent or insecticidal soap at a campus is not subject to the requirements for a pesticide application under an integrated pest management plan. However, this subsection does not permit the application at a campus of a germicide, disinfectant, sanitizer, deodorizer, antimicrobial agent or insecticidal soap that is a pesticide in a manner that is inconsistent with the goal of the integrated pest management plan.

      (5) A governing body shall adopt a list of low-impact pesticides for use with the integrated pest management plan. The governing body may include any product on the list except products that:

      (a) Contain a pesticide product or active ingredient that has the signal words “warning” or “danger” on the label;

      (b) Contain a pesticide product classified as a human carcinogen or probable human carcinogen under the United States Environmental Protection Agency 1986 Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment; or

      (c) Contain a pesticide product classified as carcinogenic to humans or likely to be carcinogenic to humans under the United States Environmental Protection Agency 2003 Draft Final Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. [2009 c.501 §3]

 

      634.710 Plan selection. A governing body may adopt, improve or continue any integrated pest management plan that provides protection against pesticide exposure equal to or greater than the protection against pesticide exposure required by ORS 634.700 to 634.750. [2009 c.501 §9]

 

      634.720 Plan coordinators. (1) The governing body shall provide for the designation of one or more persons as integrated pest management plan coordinators for the governed schools. A plan coordinator must be an employee of the governed district, unit, school or entity, unless the governing body delegates pest management duties to an independent contractor. Each school shall have the services of at least one integrated pest management plan coordinator. A plan coordinator may serve more than one school. The responsibilities of the plan coordinator shall include, but need not be limited to:

      (a) Giving notice and posting warnings under ORS 634.740;

      (b) Overseeing pest prevention efforts;

      (c) Providing for the identification and evaluation of pest situations;

      (d) Determining the means of appropriately managing pest damage that will cause the least possible hazard to people, property and the environment;

      (e) Ensuring the proper and lawful performance of pesticide applications;

      (f) Evaluating pest management results; and

      (g) Keeping records as required by ORS 634.750.

      (2) A plan coordinator shall complete not less than six hours of training each year. The training shall include at least a general review of integrated pest management principles and the requirements of ORS 634.700 to 634.750. [2009 c.501 §4]

 

      634.725 Application of low-impact pesticide. If a school has followed the integrated pest management plan and nonchemical pest control measures were ineffective, subject to ORS 634.730 the integrated pest management plan coordinator may authorize the application of a low-impact pesticide. The low-impact pesticide application must be made by a pesticide applicator or by a public applicator. The use of a pesticide applicator or public applicator to make an application does not cancel, alter or reassign any of the duties imposed under ORS 634.740 or 634.750. [2009 c.501 §5]

 

      634.728 Pesticides used at community colleges for research or instruction. ORS 634.700 to 634.750 do not limit or prohibit the use of pesticides at a community college for purposes of scientific research or academic instruction. [2013 c.241 §2]

 

      634.730 Reentry into sprayed area; exception; declaration of pest emergency. (1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) If the labeling of a pesticide product specifies a reentry time, a pesticide may not be applied to an area of a campus where the school expects students to be present before expiration of that reentry time.

      (b) If the labeling of a pesticide product does not specify a reentry time, a pesticide may not be applied to an area of a campus where the school expects students to be present before expiration of a reentry time that the integrated pest management plan coordinator determines to be appropriate based on the times at which students would normally be expected to be in the area, area ventilation and whether the area will be cleaned before students are present.

      (2)(a) The application restrictions described in subsection (1) of this section do not apply if the pesticide is applied outdoors by a pesticide applicator or public applicator as a component of academic instruction in agriculture.

      (b) The application restrictions described in subsection (1)(b) of this section do not apply if the integrated pest management plan coordinator declares a pest emergency under subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) An integrated pest management plan coordinator, after consultation with school faculty and administration, may declare the existence of a pest emergency. If necessary, a pesticide other than a low-impact pesticide may be used to mitigate a declared pest emergency. If a pesticide is applied at a campus due to a pest emergency, the plan coordinator shall review the integrated pest management plan to determine whether modification of the plan might prevent future pest emergencies. The plan coordinator shall submit any recommendations for modification of the plan to the governing body. The governing body shall review and take formal action on the recommendations. [2009 c.501 §6]

 

      634.740 Written notice requirements; warning signs; failure to notify or warn. (1) The governing body responsible for a school shall adopt policies and processes for ensuring that the integrated pest management plan coordinator for the school, or a designee of the coordinator, gives written notice of a proposed pesticide application at the campus to, at a minimum, parents and guardians of minor students, adult students, school administrators, faculty members and staff members. The plan coordinator or designee may give a written notice described in this subsection by any reasonable means, including but not limited to, electronic mail.

      (2) In adopting policies and processes under subsection (1) of this section, the governing body shall consider the age of the students attending the school and consider which methods for transmitting notice are most likely to reach the intended recipients.

      (3) Except as provided in this subsection, the plan coordinator or designee must give a pesticide application notice in a manner reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient at least 24 hours before the pesticide application occurs. A notice must identify the name, trademark or type of pesticide products, the registration number assigned to each of the pesticide products, the expected area of application, the expected date of application and the reason for the application. If a pest emergency makes it impracticable to give a pesticide application notice at least 24 hours before the pesticide application occurs, the plan coordinator or designee shall send the notice no later than 24 hours after the application occurs.

      (4) Except as provided in this subsection, if a pesticide is applied at a campus, the plan coordinator or a designee of the coordinator shall place warning signs around pesticide application areas beginning no later than 24 hours before the application occurs and ending no earlier than 72 hours after the application occurs. A warning sign must bear the words “Warning: pesticide-treated area,” give the expected or actual date and time for the application and provide the telephone number of a contact person. If a pest emergency makes it impracticable to place the warning signs at least 24 hours before the pesticide application, the plan coordinator or designee shall place the signs as soon as practicable but no later than at the time the application occurs.

      (5) Failure to give notice or post warnings as required by this section does not create a cause of action for damages and may not be asserted as the basis for a per se negligence claim. [2009 c.501 §7]

 

      634.750 Pesticide application records. (1) If a pesticide is applied at a campus, the integrated pest management plan coordinator or a designee of the coordinator shall place the labeling information and material data safety sheet for the pesticide on file at a school on the campus. The plan coordinator or designee shall record and make available the following information:

      (a) The brand name or trademark of the pesticide product;

      (b) The United States Environmental Protection Agency registration number assigned to the pesticide product;

      (c) The pest condition that prompted the application;

      (d) A description of the area on campus where the application occurred;

      (e) The approximate amount and concentration of pesticide product applied;

      (f) The type of application and whether the application proved effective;

      (g) The pesticide applicator or public applicator license numbers and pesticide trainee or public trainee certificate numbers of the persons applying the pesticide;

      (h) The names of the persons applying the pesticide;

      (i) The dates on which the plan coordinator gave any notices required by ORS 634.740; and

      (j) The dates and times for the placement and removal of warning signs under ORS 634.740.

      (2) Pesticide application records must include copies of all notices given under ORS 634.740.

      (3) A school shall retain pesticide application records required by this section for at least four years following the application date. [2009 c.501 §8]
