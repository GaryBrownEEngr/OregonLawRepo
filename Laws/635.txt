      (1) “Department” means the State Department of Agriculture.

      (2) “Nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing business” or the “business of a nonalcoholic beverage manufacturer” means the operations and business of and the owner or operator thereof, who manufactures, makes, bottles, handles, distributes, holds for sale, or sells soda or soda waters, mineral waters, carbonated beverages and other nonalcoholic drinks or beverages otherwise known as soft drinks, except those that are exempt as not covered as provided in ORS 635.027 or those exempted by the department. [1967 c.154 §1]

 

      635.020 [Repealed by 1967 c.154 §9]

 

      635.025 Short title; enforcement by department. This chapter, which may be cited as the Oregon Nonalcoholic Beverage Plant Law, shall be enforced and carried out by the State Department of Agriculture. [1967 c.154 §2]

 

      635.027 License required for manufacture of nonalcoholic beverage; exceptions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall operate or engage in the business of a nonalcoholic beverage manufacturer without first obtaining and thereafter maintaining a license, or renewal thereof, from the State Department of Agriculture. No license is required of a person who:

      (a) Sells nonalcoholic drink or beverage products in or from their original containers at wholesale or retail.

      (b) Mixes or sells nonalcoholic products in the usual course of business at a soda fountain.

      (c) Engages in the nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing business in a building and uses machinery, equipment and all facilities that have been approved and licensed by the department for use in the processing of fluid milk to be labeled with “grade ‘A’ “ pursuant to ORS chapter 621.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not exempt any person, or the business of the person, from the application of any other provisions of this chapter. [1967 c.154 §3; 2005 c.22 §447]

 

      635.030 License application; fee; term; rules. (1) Any person desiring to or who does engage in the business of a nonalcoholic beverage manufacturer shall apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a license for each plant operated by such person. The application shall be in such form and contain such information as the department may prescribe.

      (2) The department may adopt rules establishing license fee schedules for nonalcoholic beverage manufacturers. The department may determine the license fee for a manufacturer based upon the annual gross sales by the manufacturer. In establishing the amount of the license fee for a manufacturer, the department shall use the annual gross sales by that manufacturer within Oregon during the prior calendar year or, if the manufacturer maintains sales records on a fiscal basis, the prior fiscal year. If the manufacturer applying for an original license or for a renewal license cannot provide the annual gross sales for a full calendar year, the department shall base the fee on estimated annual gross sales by the manufacturer. If a manufacturer whose previous year’s fee was determined using an estimated gross sales figure applies for renewal of that license, the fee for the previous license year shall be adjusted to reflect the actual gross sales by the manufacturer.

      (3) Except as provided in this subsection, the department may not adopt a rule under this section to establish a license fee that is more than three percent higher than the license fee charged during the preceding year for a manufacturer having the same volume of gross sales. When adopting a rule establishing a license fee, notwithstanding the three percent limit, the department may round the fee amount to the next higher whole dollar amount. Fee schedules adopted under this section may not increase the amount of the same license fee more frequently than once each year.

      (4) Licenses issued under this section shall expire on June 30 next following the date of issuance or on such date as may be specified by department rule. The department shall collect a license fee for each license and for each renewal of a license. The fee shall be remitted by the department to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall place all moneys received under this section in the Department of Agriculture Service Fund. Moneys from fees imposed under this section are continuously appropriated to the department for the purpose of administering and enforcing the provisions of this chapter. [Amended by 1955 c.666 §1; 1967 c.154 §4; 1979 c.183 §4; 1979 c.499 §35; 1985 c.353 §5; 1991 c.632 §10; 2005 c.735 §§15,16; 2005 c.755 §52; 2007 c.768 §§41,42; 2012 c.64 §17]
