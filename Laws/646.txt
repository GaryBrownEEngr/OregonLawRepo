PRICE DISCRIMINATION IN COMMERCE AND FOOD COMMERCE

 

      646.010 Designation and scope of ORS 646.010 to 646.180. ORS 646.010 to 646.180 shall be known and designated as the Anti-price Discrimination Law; and the inhibitions against discrimination in those sections shall embrace any scheme of special concessions or rebates, any collateral contracts or agreements or any device of any nature whereby discrimination is, in substance or fact, effected in violation of the spirit and intent of ORS 646.010 to 646.180.

 

      646.020 Definitions and explanations. (1) When used in ORS 646.010 to 646.180, unless the context otherwise requires:

      (a) “Commerce” means trade or commerce within this state, exclusive of food commerce.

      (b) “Food commerce” means trade or commerce within this state in articles of food for human consumption and such other articles as usually are sold in food stores in connection with articles of food for human consumption. In the case of persons selling items other than items of food commerce, the term “food commerce” is restricted solely to such items of food commerce as are defined in this paragraph.

      (c) “Person” means individual, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, business trust or unincorporated organization.

      (d) “Price” means the net price to the buyer after the deduction of all discounts, rebates, or other price concessions paid or allowed by the seller.

      (e) “Replacement cost” means the cost per unit at the retail outlet at which the merchandise sold or offered for sale could have been bought by the seller at any time within 10 days prior to the date of sale or the date upon which it is offered for sale by the seller, if bought in the same quantities as the seller’s usual or customary purchase of such merchandise, after deducting all discounts, rebates or other price concessions.

      (f) “Retailer in food commerce” means any person engaged in food commerce who sells directly to the consumer for use.

      (g) “Wholesaler in food commerce” means any person engaged in food commerce other than a retailer or producer, manufacturer or processor.

      (2) As used in ORS 646.010 to 646.180, “vendor” includes any person who performs work upon, renovates, alters or improves any personal property belonging to another person.

 

      646.030 Application to cooperative associations. ORS 646.010 to 646.180 shall not prevent a cooperative association from returning to its members, producers or consumers the whole, or any part of, the net earnings or surplus resulting from its trading operations, in proportion to their purchases or sales from, to or through the association.

 

      646.040 Price discrimination prohibited; price differentials. (1) It is unlawful for any person engaged in commerce or food commerce, or both, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities, or services or output of a service trade, of like grade and quality or to discriminate in price between different sections, communities or cities or portions thereof or between different locations in sections, communities, cities or portions thereof in this state, where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not prevent:

      (a) Differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale or delivery, resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which the commodities are sold or delivered to purchasers.

      (b) Persons engaged in selling goods, wares or merchandise, or service or output of a service trade, in commerce from selecting their own customers in bona fide transactions and not in restraint of trade.

      (c) Price changes from time to time where in response to changing conditions affecting the market for or marketability of the goods concerned, such as but not limited to actual or imminent deterioration of perishable goods, obsolescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under court process, or sales in good faith in discontinuance of business in the goods concerned.

 

      646.050 Establishing prima facie case of discrimination; justification of discrimination. Upon proof being made, in any suit or other proceeding in which any violation of ORS 646.010 to 646.180 is at issue, that there has been discrimination in price, or in services or facilities furnished, or in payment for services or facilities rendered or to be rendered, the burden of rebutting the prima facie case thus made by showing justification is upon the person charged with the violation; but this section does not prevent a seller rebutting the prima facie case so made by showing that the lower price of the seller, or the payment for or furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor.

 

      646.060 Commissions and allowances. No person engaged in commerce or food commerce, or both, in the course of such commerce, shall pay, grant, receive or accept anything of value as a commission, brokerage or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, service, or output of a service trade, or merchandise. In all such transactions of sale and purchase, neither party to the transaction shall pay or grant anything of value as a commission, brokerage or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, to the other party to the transaction or to any agent, representative or other intermediary therein, where such agent, representative or other intermediary is acting for or in behalf of or is subject to the direct or indirect control of the other party to the transaction.

 

      646.070 Special payments to customers. No person engaged in commerce or food commerce, or both, in the course of such commerce, shall pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any services or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale or offering for sale of any products or commodities manufactured, service or output of a service trade, sold or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or consideration is available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities, or service, or output of service trades.

 

      646.080 Special services to customers. No person engaged in commerce or food commerce, or both, in the course of such commerce, shall discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of a commodity, or service, or output of a service trade, bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the furnishing of any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale or offering for sale of such commodity, or service, or output of a service trade, purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms.

 

      646.090 Inducing or receiving price discrimination prohibited. No person engaged in commerce or food commerce, or both, in the course of such commerce, shall knowingly induce or receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited by ORS 646.040 to 646.080.

      646.120 [Repealed by 1975 c.255 §17]

 

      646.130 Cost surveys as evidence. Where a particular trade or industry, of which the person, firm or corporation complained against is a member, has an established cost survey for the locality and vicinity in which the offense is committed, such cost survey is competent evidence to be used in proving the costs of the person, firm or corporation complained against within the provisions of ORS 646.010 to 646.180.

 

      646.140 Enjoining violations; treble damages; attorney fees; limitation on commencement of actions. (1) Any person injured by any violation, or who will suffer injury from any threatened violation, of ORS 646.010 to 646.180 may maintain an action in any court of general equitable jurisdiction of this state, to prevent, restrain or enjoin the violation or threatened violation. If in such action, a violation or threatened violation of ORS 646.010 to 646.180 is established, the court shall enjoin and restrain or otherwise prohibit such violation or threatened violation, and the plaintiff in the action is entitled to recover three-fold the damages sustained by the plaintiff. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this section.

      (2) The court may not award attorney fees to a prevailing defendant under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section if the action under this section is maintained as a class action pursuant to ORCP 32.

      (3) Actions brought under this section shall be commenced within four years from the date of the injury. [Amended by 1981 c.897 §75; 1983 c.467 §2; 1995 c.696 §33]

 

      646.150 Action for damages. If no injunctive relief is sought or required, any person injured by any violation of ORS 646.010 to 646.180 may maintain an action for damages alone in any court of general jurisdiction in this state. The measure of damages in such action shall be the same as that prescribed by ORS 646.140.

 

      646.160 Presumption of damages. In any proceedings instituted or action brought in pursuance of the provisions of ORS 646.140 or 646.150, the plaintiff, upon proof that the plaintiff has been unlawfully discriminated against by the defendant, shall conclusively be presumed to have sustained damages equal to the monetary amount or equivalent of the unlawful discrimination; and, in addition thereto, may establish such further damages, if any, as the plaintiff may have sustained as a result of the discrimination.

 

      646.170 Requiring defendant to testify. Any defendant in an action brought under the provisions of ORS 646.140 to 646.160 may be required to testify under the provisions of ORCP 65 or by deposition. In addition, the books and records of any such defendant may be brought into court and introduced, by reference, into evidence. No information so obtained may be used against the defendant as a basis for a criminal prosecution under ORS 646.990 (1). [Amended by 1979 c.284 §184; 1981 c.898 §52]

 

      646.180 Illegal contracts. Any contract, express or implied, made by any person in violation of any of the provisions of ORS 646.010 to 646.180 is an illegal contract and no recovery thereon shall be had.

TRADE SECRETS

 

      646.461 Definitions for ORS 646.461 to 646.475. As used in ORS 646.461 to 646.475, unless the context otherwise requires:

      (1) “Improper means” includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy or espionage through electronic or other means. Reverse engineering and independent development alone shall not be considered improper means.

      (2) “Misappropriation” means:

      (a) Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means;

      (b) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret;

      (c) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who, before a material change of position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake; or

      (d) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person, who at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that the knowledge of the trade secret was:

      (A) Derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it;

      (B) Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or

      (C) Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.

      (3) “Person” means a natural person, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision or agency or any other legal or commercial entity.

      (4) “Trade secret” means information, including a drawing, cost data, customer list, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that:

      (a) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and

      (b) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. [1987 c.537 §2]

 

      646.463 Enjoining misappropriation; payment of royalties; affirmative acts. (1) Actual or threatened misappropriation may be temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoined. Upon application to the court, an injunction shall be vacated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.

      (2) In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of the misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.

      (3) In appropriate circumstances, the court may order affirmative acts to protect a trade secret. [1987 c.537 §3]

 

      646.465 Damages for misappropriation. (1) A complainant is entitled to recover damages adequate to compensate for misappropriation, unless a material and prejudicial change of position by a defendant prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of the misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable.

      (2) Damages may include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation, and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss, but shall not be less than a reasonable royalty for the unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.

      (3) Upon a finding of willful or malicious misappropriation, punitive damages may be awarded in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsections (1) and (2) of this section. [1987 c.537 §4]

 

      646.467 Attorney fees. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party if:

      (1) A claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith;

      (2) A motion to terminate an injunction is made or resisted in bad faith; or

      (3) Willful or malicious misappropriation is found by the court or jury. [1987 c.537 §5]

 

      646.469 Preservation of trade secret by court; methods. In any action brought under ORS 646.461 to 646.475, the court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means, which may include granting protective orders in connection with discovery proceedings, holding in camera hearings, sealing the records of the action or ordering any person involved in the litigation not to disclose an alleged trade secret without prior court approval. [1987 c.537 §6]

 

      646.471 Limitation on commencement of action. An action for misappropriation must be brought within three years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered. For the purposes of this section, a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim. [1987 c.537 §7]

 

      646.473 Conflicting tort, restitution or other law providing civil remedies; exclusions for certain other remedies; limited immunity for public bodies and officers, employees and agents. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, ORS 646.461 to 646.475 supersede conflicting tort, restitution or other law of Oregon providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret.

      (2) ORS 646.461 to 646.475 shall not affect:

      (a) Contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret;

      (b) Other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret;

      (c) Criminal remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; or

      (d) Any defense, immunity or limitation of liability afforded public bodies, their officers, employees or agents under ORS 30.260 to 30.300.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision in ORS 646.461 to 646.475, public bodies and their officers, employees and agents are immune from any claim or action for misappropriation of a trade secret that is based on the disclosure or release of information in obedience to or in good faith reliance on any order of disclosure issued pursuant to ORS 192.311 to 192.431 or on the advice of an attorney authorized to advise the public body, its officers, employees or agents. [1987 c.537 §8]

 

      646.475 Application and construction of ORS 646.461 to 646.475; short title; effect of invalidity. (1) ORS 646.461 to 646.475 shall be applied and construed to effectuate their general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of ORS 646.461 to 646.475 among states enacting them.

      (2) ORS 646.461 to 646.475 may be cited as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.

      (3) If any provision of ORS 646.461 to 646.475 or its application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of ORS 646.461 to 646.475 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of ORS 646.461 to 646.475 are severable.

      646.568 Findings and purpose. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Fraud committed by means of unwanted telephone solicitations causes economic harm to Oregonians and constitutes an invasion of privacy and a threat to the welfare of the people of this state.

      (b) Unwanted telephone solicitations cause Oregonians harm because:

      (A) Telephone solicitations have become a primary tool for the marketing of real estate, goods and services to parties. Telephone solicitors have engaged in the practice of cold calling, which is the initiation of calls to parties with whom the telephone solicitors have no prior business relationship, to market scams, fraudulent schemes and worthless goods and services to unsuspecting parties who often lose thousands of dollars as a result of the solicitations.

      (B) Telephone solicitors often make calls based on lists targeting the elderly or other vulnerable populations who are unable to assess the risks associated with engaging in sales transactions over the telephone.

      (C) Technologies designed to assist parties in avoiding unwanted telephone solicitations are not effective and place an additional financial burden on parties, effectively shifting the cost of unwanted telephone solicitations to parties. These technologies include:

      (i) Caller identification systems, for which parties bear the cost of the caller identification service and any related hardware, and for which technology exists that allows telephone solicitors to block caller identification data;

      (ii) Privacy manager services that, for a fee, intercept calls; and

      (iii) Unlisted telephone numbers, for which parties pay an additional fee.

      (D) Unwanted telephone solicitations tie up telephone lines and prevent legitimate telephone calls from being received or placed by parties. Predictive dialers utilized by telephone solicitors that automatically dial parties’ telephone numbers frequently result in abandoned telephone solicitations and silence when the party answers the phone. These solicitations constitute an intrusion on the property of parties and an invasion of privacy.

      (E) The growing practice of preacquired account telephone solicitation, in which a telephone solicitor acquires the party’s billing information prior to initiating a telephone solicitation, has increasingly resulted in unauthorized charges to parties’ financial accounts.

      (c) Existing state and federal laws are inadequate to prevent the harm to the public welfare that results from telephone solicitations.

      (d) Allowing parties to choose not to receive unwanted telephone solicitations by placing their telephone numbers on a “do not call” list provides a means by which parties can protect themselves from fraud related to telephone solicitations and from the resulting economic harm and invasion of privacy.

      (2) The purpose of ORS 646.567 to 646.578 is to prevent the harmful effects set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this section that result from telephone solicitations without inhibiting legitimate telephone solicitations to parties who choose to receive them. Prohibiting telephone solicitations to those Oregonians whose telephone numbers appear on the list described in ORS 646.574 enables Oregonians to choose whether to receive telephone solicitations. [2007 c.441 §2]

 

      646.569 Prohibition on telephone solicitation of party whose name is included on list described in ORS 646.574 or on federal registry designated under ORS 646.572. (1) A person may not engage in the telephone solicitation of a party at a telephone number included on the then current list:

      (a) Published by the administrator of the telephone solicitation program established under ORS 646.572 and 646.574; or

      (b) Maintained as part of the federal registry designated under ORS 646.572.

      (2) For purposes of this section:

      (a) “Predecessor of the business enterprise” means a financial institution as defined in 15 U.S.C. 6827 that has:

      (A) Merged with or been acquired by the business enterprise for which the person is calling; or

      (B) Sold or assigned an account of a party who has previously purchased from the business enterprise, to the business enterprise for which the person is calling.

      (b) “Telephone solicitation” does not include a person soliciting business from prospective purchasers who have previously purchased from:

      (A) The person making the solicitation;

      (B) The business enterprise for which the person is calling; or

      (C) A predecessor of the business enterprise for which the person is calling. [1989 c.451 §2; 1999 c.564 §1; 2001 c.503 §1; 2007 c.441 §5]

      (2) The Attorney General may include in a contract with the administrator any provision that the Attorney General determines is in the public interest.

      (3) If a party requests, the Attorney General shall instruct the party on how to register the party’s telephone number on the federal “do not call” registry designated under subsection (1)(b) of this section. [1999 c.564 §3; 2007 c.441 §6]

 

      646.574 List of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations; fee; disclosure of list; complaints. (1) If the Attorney General enters into a contract pursuant to ORS 646.572 (1)(a), the administrator of the telephone solicitation program shall create, maintain and distribute a database containing a list of telephone numbers of parties who do not wish to receive any telephone solicitation at the listed numbers. Beginning on the date specified in the contract between the administrator and the Attorney General and at least once each quarter thereafter, the administrator shall update the list by:

      (a) Adding the numbers of parties who have filed notice and paid the fee as required in this section; and

      (b) Removing the numbers of those parties who have requested that their numbers be removed or whose listing has expired without renewal.

      (2) A party may file notice together with a fee of $10 per listed number, or such lesser amount as may be specified in the contract, with the administrator indicating the party’s desire to place telephone numbers on the list described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (B) The names of the parties whose telephone numbers are on the list.

      (c) A qualified trade association that receives a list or the names of the parties whose telephone numbers are on the list under this subsection may make the list or the names available to its members on any terms the association and its members may impose.

      (d) Upon request of the Attorney General for the purpose of enforcing ORS 646.569, the administrator shall furnish the Attorney General with all requested information about a party or any person who the Attorney General believes has engaged in a solicitation prohibited by ORS 646.569. The administrator may not charge a fee for furnishing the information to the Attorney General.

      (e) Upon request of any party who has filed a notice and paid the fee as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the administrator shall furnish the party with all requested information about the party or any person who the party believes has engaged in a solicitation prohibited by ORS 646.569.

As used herein, “investment” means any acquisition, for a consideration other than personal services, of property, tangible or intangible, and includes without limitation, franchises, business opportunities and services. It does not include sales demonstration equipment and materials furnished at cost for use in making sales and not for resale. For the purpose of ORS 646.608 (1)(r), any person who organizes or induces or attempts to induce membership in a pyramid club is acting in the course of the person’s business, vocation or occupation.

      (a) Granting injunctive relief to restrain the person from engaging in conduct of any aspect of the trade or commerce that is involved in the alleged or suspected violation; or

      (b) Granting such other relief as may be required, until the person obeys the investigative demand.

      (2) Any disobedience of any final order of a court under this section shall be punished as a contempt of court. [1971 c.744 §16; 1973 c.235 §4; 1977 c.195 §7; 2005 c.22 §448]

 

      646.630 [Repealed by 1953 c.391 §2]

 

      646.632 Enjoining unlawful trade practices; assurance of voluntary compliance; attorney fees. (1) Except as provided in ORS 646.633, a prosecuting attorney who has probable cause to believe that a person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in an unlawful trade practice may bring suit in the name of the State of Oregon in the appropriate court to restrain such person from engaging in the alleged unlawful trade practice.

      (2) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, before filing a suit under subsection (1) of this section, the prosecuting attorney shall in writing notify the person charged of the alleged unlawful trade practice and the relief to be sought. Such notice shall be served in the manner set forth in ORS 646.622 for the service of investigative demands. The person charged thereupon shall have 10 days within which to execute and deliver to the prosecuting attorney an assurance of voluntary compliance. Such assurance shall set forth what actions, if any, the person charged intends to take with respect to the alleged unlawful trade practice. The assurance of voluntary compliance shall not be considered an admission of a violation for any purpose. If the prosecuting attorney is satisfied with the assurance of voluntary compliance, it may be submitted to an appropriate court for approval and if approved shall thereafter be filed with the clerk of the court. If an approved assurance of voluntary compliance provides for the payment of an amount of money, as restitution or otherwise, and if the amount is not paid within 90 days of the date the court approves the assurance, or, if the assurance of voluntary compliance requires periodic payments and if any periodic payment is not paid within 30 days of the date specified in the assurance of voluntary compliance for any periodic payment, then the prosecuting attorney may submit that portion of the assurance of voluntary compliance which provides for the payment of money to the court with a certificate stating the unpaid balance in a form which fully complies with the requirements of ORS 18.038 and 18.042. Upon submission of an assurance of voluntary compliance under this subsection, the court shall sign the assurance of voluntary compliance and it shall be entered in the register of the court and the clerk of the court shall note in the register that it creates a lien. The assurance of voluntary compliance shall thereupon constitute a judgment in favor of the State of Oregon and may be enforced as provided in ORS chapter 18. The notice of the prosecuting attorney under this subsection shall not be deemed a public record until the expiration of 10 days from the service of the notice.

      (3) The prosecuting attorney may reject as unsatisfactory any assurance:

      (a) Which does not contain a promise to make restitution in specific amounts or through arbitration for persons who suffered any ascertainable loss of money or property as a result of the alleged unlawful trade practice; or

      (b) Which does not contain any provision, including but not limited to the keeping of records, which the prosecuting attorney reasonably believes to be necessary to ensure the continued cessation of the alleged unlawful trade practice, if such provision was included in a proposed assurance attached to the notice served pursuant to this section.

      (4) Violation of any of the terms of an assurance of voluntary compliance which has been approved by and filed with the court shall constitute a contempt of court.

      (5) The prosecuting attorney need not serve notice pursuant to subsection (2) of this section before filing a suit if, within two years of the filing of such suit, the person charged with the alleged unfair trade practice submitted to any prosecuting attorney an assurance of voluntary compliance which was accepted by and filed with an appropriate court. The prosecuting attorney shall in such case serve notice on the defendant in the manner set forth in ORS 646.622 for the service of investigative demands, on the 10th or earlier day previous to the filing of suit.

      (6) If the prosecuting attorney alleges that the prosecuting attorney has reason to believe that the delay caused by complying with the provisions of subsection (2) or (5) of this section would cause immediate harm to the public health, safety or welfare, the prosecuting attorney may immediately institute a suit under subsection (1) of this section.

      (7) A temporary restraining order may be granted without prior notice to the person if the court finds there is a threat of immediate harm to the public health, safety or welfare. Such a temporary restraining order shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 10 days, as the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the person restrained consents that it may be extended for a longer period.

      (8) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this section. If the defendant prevails in such suit and the court finds that the defendant had in good faith submitted to the prosecuting attorney a satisfactory assurance of voluntary compliance prior to the institution of the suit or that the prosecuting attorney, in a suit brought under subsections (5) and (6) of this section, did not have reasonable grounds to proceed under those subsections, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal to the defendant. [1971 c.744 §11; 1975 c.437 §3; 1981 c.897 §77; 1989 c.745 §1; 1995 c.618 §97; 2003 c.576 §215; 2010 c.94 §4]

      (2) A prosecuting attorney may not take action under ORS 646.618 or 646.632 with respect to an alleged unlawful practice under ORS 646.607 or 646.608 when the conduct involves loans or extensions of credit and was engaged in by a state regulated lender unless requested to do so by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. In any action requested to be taken by the director under this subsection, the director may elect to be named as a party to the proceeding or suit.

      (3) The Attorney General may not adopt rules under ORS 646.608 (4) with respect to conduct involving loans or extensions of credit that is engaged in by a state regulated lender except with the prior review and approval of the proposed rules by the director. The Attorney General may not adopt rules under ORS 646.608 (4) with respect to conduct involving loans or extensions of credit that is engaged in by a state regulated lender except as provided in this subsection.

      (4) As soon as practicable upon receipt, the Attorney General shall provide the director with copies of any complaint or other initial pleading or any judgment received under ORS 646.638 when the action involves the conduct of a state regulated lender. [2010 c.94 §6]

 

      646.635 [1965 c.490 §§4, 5; 1967 c.599 §3; repealed by 1971 c.744 §27]

 

      646.636 Remedial power of court. The court may make such additional orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any moneys or property, real or personal, of which the person was deprived by means of any practice declared to be unlawful in ORS 646.607 or 646.608, or as may be necessary to ensure cessation of unlawful trade practices. [1971 c.744 §12; 1977 c.195 §8; 2005 c.22 §449]

 

      646.638 Civil action by private party; damages; attorney fees; effect of prior injunction; time for commencing action; counterclaim; class actions. (1) Except as provided in subsections (8) and (9) of this section, a person that suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of another person’s willful use or employment of a method, act or practice declared unlawful under ORS 646.608, may bring an individual action in an appropriate court to recover actual damages or statutory damages of $200, whichever is greater. The court or the jury may award punitive damages and the court may provide any equitable relief the court considers necessary or proper.

      (2) A person that brings an action under subsection (1) of this section shall mail a copy of the complaint or other initial pleading to the Attorney General at the time the action commences and, upon entry of any judgment in the action, shall mail a copy of the judgment to the Attorney General. Failure to mail a copy of the complaint is not a jurisdictional defect, but a court may not enter judgment for the plaintiff until proof of mailing is filed with the court. Proof of mailing may be by affidavit or by return receipt of mailing.

      (3) The court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs at trial and on appeal to a prevailing plaintiff in an action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs at trial and on appeal to a prevailing defendant only if the court finds that an objectively reasonable basis for bringing the action or asserting the ground for appeal did not exist.

      (4) The court may not award attorney fees to a prevailing defendant under the provisions of subsection (3) of this section if the action under this section is maintained as a class action pursuant to ORCP 32.

      (5) Any permanent injunction or final judgment or order the court makes under ORS 646.632 or 646.636 is prima facie evidence in an action brought under this section that the respondent used or employed a method, act or practice declared unlawful under ORS 646.608, but an assurance of voluntary compliance, whether or not approved by the court, is not evidence of the violation.

      (6) Actions brought under this section must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the unlawful method, act or practice. Notwithstanding this limitation, if a prosecuting attorney filed a complaint to prevent, restrain or punish a violation of ORS 646.608, the complaint tolls the statute of limitations with respect to every private right of action under this section that is based in whole or in part on any matter set forth in the prosecuting attorney’s complaint for the period of time in which the proceeding that the prosecuting attorney initiated is pending.

      (7) Notwithstanding subsection (6) of this section, in any action that a seller or lessor brings against a purchaser or lessee of real estate, goods or services, the purchaser or lessee may assert any counterclaim that the purchaser or lessee has arising out of a violation of ORS 336.184 and 646.605 to 646.652.

      (8) A class action may be maintained under this section. In any class action under this section:

      (a) Statutory damages under subsection (1) of this section may be recovered on behalf of class members only if the plaintiffs in the action establish that the members have sustained an ascertainable loss of money or property as a result of a reckless or knowing use or employment by the defendant of a method, act or practice declared unlawful by ORS 646.608;

      (b) The trier of fact may award punitive damages; and

      (c) The court may award appropriate equitable relief.

      (e) Uses any direct or indirect action, conduct or practice to violate a provision of this section or ORS 646A.670.

      646.745 Joint operation of Memorial Coliseum and Arena in Portland; definitions; legislative findings and goals; state supervision. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Affiliate” means an individual, or a corporation or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the owner or operator of the arena. For purposes of this subsection, the term “control” means ownership of more than 50 percent of the shares or other ownership interests in the owner or operator of the arena or having management power over the affairs of the owner or operator of the arena.

      (b) “Arena” means a multipurpose arena with a seating capacity of approximately 19,000 constructed or to be constructed on real property adjacent to the Coliseum.

      (c) “Coliseum” means the Memorial Coliseum in Portland.

      (d) “Coliseum agreement” means an operating agreement, management agreement, lease or any similar agreement between the City of Portland and any corporation, partnership, limited partnership or individual who owns or operates the arena or any affiliate of the owner or operator of the arena.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly finds that direct competition between the Arena and Coliseum may require the City of Portland to spend limited public resources to maintain the Coliseum, undermine the City of Portland’s goal of creating a world-class center for athletic events, conventions, trade shows and other events and otherwise result in economic rivalry injurious to the interests of the City of Portland and the citizens of this state.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly declares that it is the policy and intent of this state to displace competition between the Arena and Coliseum by allowing the City of Portland to enter agreements for the joint operation of the facilities by an owner or operator of the Arena in order to further the following goals:

      (a) To avoid economic rivalry which might undermine the continuing economic viability of the Coliseum and require the public to subsidize the operations of the Coliseum with funds which the City of Portland has allocated to other public needs;

      (b) To allow the joint operation of the Coliseum and Arena to avoid scheduling conflicts and other related problems which would unduly burden public safety resources and the transportation system of the City of Portland;

      (c) To encourage the joint marketing of the Arena and Coliseum to attract trade shows, conventions and other events which require multiple venues or could otherwise not be accommodated by the Coliseum or Arena;

      (d) To avoid duplication of management and other services and minimize the public funds necessary to operate the Coliseum;

      (e) To encourage development of the Arena adjacent to the Coliseum rather than in another location; and

      (f) To limit financing risk and provide for development of the Arena with private funding sources so that public funds may be used for other pressing needs.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly declares that the City of Portland is the political subdivision of the State of Oregon best suited to monitor and supervise the operation of the Coliseum Agreement. The Legislative Assembly therefore delegates to the City of Portland the power to supervise and review the activities of the owner or operator of the Arena under the Coliseum Agreement and declares that this review shall be equivalent to active supervision by the State of Oregon to the fullest possible extent under the federal or state antitrust laws. The City of Portland may, subject to any agreement with the owner or operator of the Arena, review and approve annually or more frequently certain practices under the Coliseum Agreement, including without limitation:

      (a) Prices charged for Coliseum events;

      (b) Decisions about event allocation between the Arena and Coliseum; and

      (c) Decisions to decline to accommodate events at either the Coliseum or the Arena, or both. [1993 c.183 §2]

 

      646.750 Investigative demand by Attorney General; petition to modify. (1) When it appears to the Attorney General that a person has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in any act or practice declared to be unlawful by ORS 646.725 or 646.730, the Attorney General may execute in writing and cause to be served an investigative demand upon any person who is believed to have documentary material or information relevant to the alleged or suspected violation. The investigative demand shall require such person to produce relevant documentary material for examination and copying or reproduction, to answer in writing written interrogatories, to give oral testimony concerning documentary material or information, or to furnish any combination of such material, answers or testimony under penalty of perjury, at such reasonable time and place as may be stated in the investigative demand.

      (2) At any time before the return day specified in the investigative demand, or within 20 days after the demand has been served whichever time is shorter, a petition to extend the return date, or to modify or set aside the demand, stating good cause, may be filed in the appropriate court.

      (3) The investigative demand shall state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged antitrust violation under investigation and the provisions of law believed to be applicable thereto. [1975 c.255 §13; 1977 c.729 §1]

 

      646.760 Civil penalties; attorney fees; mitigation. (1) The Attorney General may prosecute an action for appropriate injunctive relief and civil penalties in the name of the state for any violation of ORS 646.725 or 646.730. The court may assess for the benefit of the state a civil penalty of not more than $250,000 for each violation of ORS 136.617, 646.705 to 646.805 and 646.990. Any act or series of acts by one or more individual persons (officers, agents or partners) on behalf of a corporation or other business entity may be found to constitute a violation or violations by such individual person or persons as well as by the corporation or other business entity, and separate penalties may be imposed against each of such individual defendants and corporate or other business entity defendants for such a violation. The court may award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs of investigation to the Attorney General if the Attorney General prevails in an action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs of investigation to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the Attorney General had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

      (2) The complaint may also seek and the court may order, in an appropriate case, the forfeiture of any corporate franchise, professional or business license, right to do business or to use an assumed business name, where the court finds the use by any defendant of such franchise, license or right has been material to a violation of ORS 646.725 or 646.730.

      (3) The court shall take into consideration in mitigation of any penalty assessed under this section, any fine or penalty imposed against the defendant by a United States court in a final judgment under sections 1 to 45 of Title 15 of the United States Code, which the court finds to be based on the same or substantially the same acts of defendant. [1975 c.255 §8; 1981 c.897 §80; 1995 c.696 §36; 1999 c.370 §1]

 

      646.770 Equitable remedies; attorney fees. (1) Any person including the state or any municipal corporation or political subdivision threatened with injury in its business or property by a violation of ORS 646.725 or 646.730 may prosecute a suit for equitable relief, and in addition to such relief shall recover the costs of suit, including necessary reasonable investigative costs and reasonable experts’ fees.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, in an action brought under the provisions of this section by a person other than the state or any municipal corporation or political subdivision of the state, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, in a civil action brought under the provisions of this section by the state or any municipal corporation or political subdivision of the state:

      (a) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the state or political subdivision of the state if the state or political subdivision prevails in the action; and

      (b) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the state or any municipal corporation or political subdivision of the state had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

      (3) The court may not award attorney fees to a prevailing defendant under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section if the action under this section is maintained as a class action pursuant to ORCP 32. [1975 c.255 §9; 1981 c.897 §81; 1995 c.696 §37]

 

      646.775 Actions by Attorney General; damages; attorney fees. (1)(a) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the name of the State of Oregon, on behalf of a political subdivision in this state or as parens patriae on behalf of a natural person, in any circuit court in which venue is proper under ORS 646.790, to secure equitable and monetary relief as provided in this section for injury sustained by the natural person or political subdivision to the natural person’s or political subdivision’s property by reason of a violation of ORS 646.725 or 646.730. The Attorney General may bring the action authorized by this paragraph regardless of whether the natural person or political subdivision dealt directly or indirectly with the adverse party.

      (b) The court shall exclude from the amount of monetary relief awarded in an action pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection any amount of monetary relief:

      (A) That duplicates amounts that have been awarded for the same injury; or

      (B) That is properly allocable to natural persons who have excluded their claims pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this section, or to any business entity.

      (c)(A) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, the court shall award the state as monetary relief three times the total damages sustained by natural persons and political subdivisions and the costs the state incurs in the action.

      (B) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the Attorney General if the Attorney General prevails in an action under this section.

      (C) The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the Attorney General had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this subsection, the court shall award the state only the actual damages sustained by natural persons and political subdivisions in an action in which:

      (A) The Attorney General prevails solely on the basis of a judgment entered in a proceeding under 15 U.S.C. 1 to 45 or in another action by the state under ORS 646.760, 646.770 or 646.780, used as collateral estoppel against the defendant under ORS 646.805; or

      (B) The natural person or political subdivision dealt indirectly with the adverse party and the Attorney General establishes a violation other than a per se violation of ORS 646.725.

      (2)(a) In any action pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, the Attorney General shall, at the times, in the manner and with the content the court directs, give notice by publication. If the court finds that notice given solely by publication would deny due process of law to a natural person or political subdivision, the court may direct further notice to the natural person or political subdivision according to the circumstances of the case.

      (b) Any natural person or political subdivision on whose behalf an action is brought pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section may elect to exclude from adjudication the portion of the claim for monetary relief attributable to the natural person or political subdivision by filing notice of the election with the court within the time specified in the notice given pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) The final judgment in an action pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section shall be res judicata as to any claim under this section by any natural person or political subdivision on behalf of whom such action was brought and who fails to give the notice specified in paragraph (b) of this subsection within the period specified in the notice given pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (3) An action pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and the notice of any proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given in the manner the court directs.

      (4) In any action pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section in which there has been a determination that a defendant agreed to fix prices in violation of ORS 646.725, damages may be proved and assessed in the aggregate by statistical or sampling methods, by the computation and pro rata allocation of illegal overcharges, or by any other reasonable system of estimating aggregate damages as the court in its discretion may permit without the necessity of separately proving the individual claim of, or amount of damage to, natural persons or political subdivisions on whose behalf the suit was brought.

      (5)(a) Monetary relief recovered in an action pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section shall be distributed in the manner the court in its discretion may authorize, subject to the requirement that any distribution procedure adopted afford each natural person or political subdivision on whose behalf the suit was brought a reasonable opportunity to secure an appropriate portion of the net monetary relief.

      (b) The Attorney General shall deposit that portion of the monetary relief awarded by the court as costs of suit and a reasonable attorney fee in the Department of Justice Protection and Education Revolving Account established pursuant to ORS 180.095.

      (c) To the extent that the monetary relief awarded by the court is not exhausted by distribution pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, the remaining funds shall be deemed a civil penalty by the court and assessed as such for the benefit of the state pursuant to ORS 646.760.

      (6) The powers granted in this section are in addition to and not in derogation of the common law powers of the Attorney General to act as parens patriae, or the powers of the Attorney General to sue as a representative party on behalf of a class pursuant to ORCP 32. [1979 c.790 §3; 1981 c.897 §82; 1995 c.696 §38; 2001 c.393 §1; 2009 c.820 §4]

(1)(a) A person, the state or any political subdivision in the state injured in its business or property by a violation of ORS 646.725 or 646.730 may sue for the injury and shall recover three times the damages sustained. An action authorized by this paragraph may be brought regardless of whether the plaintiff dealt directly or indirectly with the adverse party.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the state may recover only the state’s actual damages sustained and any attorney fees, expert witness fees or investigative costs that the court may award under subsection (3) of this section, if the state:

      (A) Brings an action under ORS 646.760;

      (B) Commences a prosecution under ORS 646.815 and 646.990 (2); or

      (C) Brings an action for an injury that the state suffered by dealing indirectly with the adverse party and the state establishes a violation other than a per se violation of ORS 646.725.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, in any action under this section in which the plaintiff prevails solely on the basis of a judgment or decree entered in a proceeding under 15 U.S.C. 1 to 45 or in another action by the state under ORS 646.760, 646.770 or this section, used as collateral estoppel against a defendant pursuant to ORS 646.805, plaintiff’s recovery shall be limited to the actual damages sustained and any attorney fees, expert witness fees or investigative costs that may be awarded under subsection (3) of this section.

      (2) Unless there is a subsequent judgment that the court lacks jurisdiction, the taking of any testimony at the commencement of trial on a civil complaint for damages filed under the antitrust laws of the United States shall constitute an absolute bar and waiver of any right of a plaintiff in such action to recover damages from the same defendant under this section for the same or substantially the same acts of plaintiff.

      (3)(a) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, in an action brought under the provisions of this section by a person other than the state or any political subdivision in the state, the court may award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and investigative costs to the prevailing party.

      (b) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, in a civil action brought under the provisions of this section or under ORS 646.760 by the state or any political subdivision in the state:

      (A) The court may award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and investigative costs to the state or political subdivision if the state or political subdivision prevails in the action; and

      (B) The court may award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and investigative costs to a defendant who prevails in an action under this section if the court determines that the state or political subdivision had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.

      (4) The court may not award attorney fees, expert witness fees or investigative costs to a prevailing defendant under the provisions of this section if the action is maintained as a class action pursuant to ORCP 32.

      (5)(a) When the Attorney General files an action parens patriae under ORS 646.775 within 30 days of the date that a natural person files an action as a class action under this section and both the Attorney General and the natural person seek to represent the same class of natural persons, the action brought by the Attorney General must be deemed superior to the natural person’s action for the purposes of determining whether the natural person’s action under this section may not be maintained as a class action under ORCP 32.

      (b) Upon commencement of an action as a class action under this section by a natural person, the natural person shall mail a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General. Failure to mail a copy of the complaint is not a jurisdictional defect.

      (c) The Attorney General’s action shall be deemed superior to the natural person’s action brought as a class action as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection until the earlier of:

      (A) Thirty days after the natural person mails a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection; or

      (B) The date that a court finds that the natural person’s action is to be maintained as a class action.

      (d) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a natural person from filing an action as a class action if:

      (A) The Attorney General’s parens patriae action is dismissed prior to adjudication of the issues without damages paid to any natural person; or

      (B) A sufficient number of natural persons opt out of the parens patriae action to sustain a separate class action. [1975 c.255 §10; 1981 c.897 §83; 1983 c.467 §1; 1985 c.251 §27; 1995 c.696 §39; 2001 c.393 §2; 2009 c.304 §1]
