[Formerly 646.325; 2009 c.448 §2]

 

      646A.404 Consumer’s remedies; manufacturer’s affirmative defenses. (1) If the manufacturer or agents or authorized dealers of the manufacturer are unable to conform the motor vehicle to an applicable manufacturer’s express warranty by repairing or correcting a defect or condition that substantially impairs the use, market value or safety of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall:

      (2) A repair or correction for purposes of subsection (1) of this section includes a repair that must take place after the expiration of the earlier of either period.

      (3) The period ending on the date on which the mileage on the motor vehicle reaches 24,000 miles, the two-year period and the 30-day period shall be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of a war, invasion, strike, fire, flood or other natural disaster.

      (4) The presumption described in subsection (1) of this section does not apply against a manufacturer unless the manufacturer has received prior direct written notification from or on behalf of the consumer and has had an opportunity to cure the defect alleged.

A decision resulting from arbitration pursuant to the informal dispute settlement procedure is binding on the manufacturer but is not binding on the consumer. [Formerly 646.355; 2009 c.448 §5]

 

      646A.410 Informal dispute settlement procedure; recordkeeping; review by Department of Justice. A manufacturer which has established or participates in an informal dispute settlement procedure shall keep records of all cases submitted to the procedure under ORS 646A.408 and shall make the records available to the Department of Justice if the department requests them. The department may review all case records kept under this section to determine whether or not the arbitrators are complying with the provisions of ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418 in reaching their decisions. [Formerly 646.357]

 

      646A.412 Action in court; damages if manufacturer does not act in good faith; attorney fees; expert witness fees; costs.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the court may award reasonable attorney fees, fees for expert witnesses and costs to a consumer who prevails in an appeal or action under ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418. If a court finds that a consumer brought an action under ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418 in bad faith or solely for the purposes of harassment, the court may award a prevailing manufacturer reasonable attorney fees.

      (3) The court may award reasonable attorney fees, fees for expert witnesses and costs to the prevailing party in an appeal or action under ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418 that involves a motor home. [Formerly 646.359; 2009 c.448 §6]

 

      646A.414 Limitations on actions against dealers. (1) Except as provided in ORS 646A.405, nothing in ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418 creates a cause of action by a consumer against a vehicle dealer.

      (2) A manufacturer may not join a dealer as a party in a proceeding brought under ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418, nor may the manufacturer try to collect from a dealer damages assessed against the manufacturer in a proceeding brought under ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418. [Formerly 646.361; 2009 c.448 §7]

 

      646A.416 Limitation on commencement of action. An action brought under ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418 must be commenced within one year after whichever of the following periods ends earlier:

      (1) The period ending on the date on which the mileage on the motor vehicle reaches 24,000 miles;

      (2) The two-year period following the date of the original delivery of the motor vehicle to the consumer; or

      (3) The period that ends after an extension of time provided under ORS 646A.406 (3). [Formerly 646.365; 2009 c.448 §8]

 

      646A.418 Remedies supplementary to existing statutory or common law remedies; election of remedies. Nothing in ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418 is intended in any way to limit the rights or remedies that are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law. However, if the consumer elects to pursue any other remedy in state or federal court, the remedy available under ORS 646A.400 to 646A.418 shall not be available insofar as it would result in recovery in excess of the recovery authorized by ORS 646A.404 without proof of fault resulting in damages in excess of such recovery.

      (2) If the consumer or protected consumer is the victim of identity theft or has reported a theft of personal information to a law enforcement agency, the consumer or representative may include a copy of the police report, incident report or identity theft declaration.

      (3)(a) The consumer or representative must provide proper identification.

      (b)(A) In addition to the information described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a representative who seeks to place a security freeze on a protected consumer’s consumer report or protective record shall provide sufficient proof of the representative’s authority to act on the protected consumer’s behalf.

      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, sufficient proof of authority consists of:

      (i) A court order that identifies or describes the relationship between the representative and the protected consumer;

      (ii) A valid and lawfully executed power of attorney that permits the representative to act on the protected consumer’s behalf; or

      (iii) A written affidavit that the representative signs and has notarized in which the representative expressly describes the relationship between the representative and the protected consumer and the representative’s authority to act on the protected consumer’s behalf.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in ORS 646A.614, if a security freeze is in place for a consumer report, information from the consumer report may not be released without prior express authorization from the consumer.

      (b) Information from a protective record may not be released until the protected consumer for whom the consumer reporting agency created the protective record, or a representative of the protected consumer, removes the security freeze.

      (5) This section does not prevent a consumer reporting agency from advising a third party that a security freeze is in effect with respect to the consumer report or protective record. [2007 c.759 §4; 2013 c.415 §2; 2018 c.10 §3]

      (A) The request described in ORS 646A.606 (1); and

      (B) Proper identification.

      (b) If a consumer report does not exist for a protected consumer on behalf of whom a representative seeks to place a security freeze, a consumer reporting agency shall create a protective record after receiving from the representative the request described in ORS 646A.606 (1), proper identification for both the representative and the protected consumer and sufficient proof of authority, as described in ORS 646A.606 (3)(b). After creating a protective record for a protected consumer under this paragraph, the consumer reporting agency shall place the security freeze that the representative requested on the protected consumer’s protective record.

      (c) The protective record that the consumer reporting agency creates under paragraph (b) of this subsection does not need to contain any information other than the protected consumer’s personal information, if other information for the protected consumer is not available. Except as provided in ORS 646A.614, a consumer reporting agency may not use or release to another person the information in a protective record for the purpose of assessing a protected consumer’s eligibility or capacity for an extension of credit, as a basis for evaluating a protected consumer’s character, reputation or personal characteristics or for other purposes that are not related to protecting the protected consumer from identity theft.

      (2)(a) A consumer reporting agency shall send a written confirmation of a security freeze on a consumer’s consumer report to the consumer at the last known address for the consumer shown in the consumer report that the consumer reporting agency maintains, within 10 business days after placing the security freeze and, with the confirmation, shall provide the consumer with a unique personal identification number or password or similar device the consumer must use to authorize the consumer reporting agency to release the consumer’s consumer report for a specific period of time or to permanently remove the security freeze. The consumer reporting agency shall include with the written confirmation information that describes how to remove a security freeze and how to temporarily lift a security freeze on a consumer report, other than a consumer report for a protected consumer, in order to allow access to information from the consumer’s consumer report for a period of time while the security freeze is in place.

      (b) This subsection does not require a consumer reporting agency to provide a consumer or representative with a personal identification number or password for the consumer or representative to use to authorize the consumer reporting agency to release information from a protective record.

      (3)(a) If a consumer wishes to allow the consumer’s consumer report to be accessed for a specific period of time while a security freeze is in effect, the consumer shall contact the consumer reporting agency using a point of contact the consumer reporting agency designates, request that the security freeze be temporarily lifted and provide the following:

      (A) Proper identification;

      (B) The unique personal identification number or password or similar device the consumer reporting agency provided under subsection (2) of this section; and

      (b) A protective record is not subject to a temporary lift of a security freeze.

      (c) Except as provided in ORS 646A.612 (2)(a), a consumer report for a protected consumer is not subject to a temporary lift of a security freeze.

      (4) A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a security freeze on a consumer report, other than a consumer report for a protected consumer, under subsection (3) of this section shall comply with the request not later than three business days after receiving from the consumer:

      (a) Proper identification;

      (b) The unique personal identification number or password or similar device the consumer reporting agency provided under subsection (2) of this section; and

      (c) An indication of the period of time during which the consumer report must be available to users of the consumer report.

      (5)(a) A security freeze for a consumer report must remain in place until the consumer requests, using a point of contact the consumer reporting agency designates, that the security freeze be removed. A consumer reporting agency shall remove a security freeze within three business days after receiving a request for removal from the consumer, who provides:

      (A) Proper identification; and

      (B) The unique personal identification number or password or similar device the consumer reporting agency provided under subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) A security freeze for a protective record must remain in place until the protected consumer or a representative requests, using a point of contact the consumer reporting agency designates, that the security freeze be removed or that the protective record be deleted. The consumer reporting agency does not have an affirmative duty to notify the protected consumer or the representative that a security freeze is in place or to remove the security freeze or delete the protective record once the protected consumer is no longer a protected consumer. A protected consumer or a representative has the affirmative duty to request that the consumer reporting agency remove the security freeze or delete the protective record. A consumer reporting agency shall remove a security freeze or delete a protective record within 30 business days after receiving a request for removal or deletion from the protected consumer or a representative, who provides:

      (A) Proper identification;

      (B) Sufficient proof of authority, as described in ORS 646A.606 (3)(b), if the representative seeks to remove the security freeze or delete the protective record; and

      (C) Proof that the representative’s authority to act on the protected consumer’s behalf is no longer valid or applicable, if the protected consumer seeks to remove the security freeze or delete the protective record. [2007 c.759 §5; 2013 c.415 §3; 2018 c.10 §4]

      646A.612 Conditions for lifting or removing security freeze.

      (b) A consumer reporting agency shall remove a security freeze from a protected consumer’s consumer report or protective record or delete a protective record only if the protected consumer or a representative requests that the consumer reporting agency remove the security freeze from the consumer report or protective record or delete the protective record in accordance with ORS 646A.608.

      (2)(a) A consumer reporting agency may temporarily lift or remove a security freeze placed on a consumer report if the security freeze was placed because of a consumer’s, a protected consumer’s or a representative’s material misrepresentation of fact.
