      (2) As part of the application, the Secretary of State may require the applicant to:

      (a) State whether the applicant or a predecessor in interest has filed an application to register the mark or portions or a composite of the mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and, if so, provide:

      (3) The applicant, a member of the firm applying or an officer of the corporation, limited liability company or association applying to register the mark shall sign and verify the application by oath, affirmation or declaration under penalty of perjury.

      (4) The applicant as part of the application shall submit one specimen of the mark as actually used. [1961 c.497 §3; 1965 c.511 §2; 1971 c.318 §2; 1985 c.728 §84; 1991 c.132 §20; 2009 c.459 §5]

 

      647.017 When mark is in use; abandonment of mark. (1) For purposes of this chapter, a mark is in use:

      (a) On goods that are sold or transported in commerce in this state when the mark is placed in any manner on:

      (A) Goods, other containers or displays associated with the goods or tags or labels affixed to the goods; or

      (B) Documents associated with the goods or the sale of the goods, if the nature of the goods makes placing the mark on the items identified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph impractical.

      (b) On services that are rendered in this state when the mark is used or displayed in selling or advertising the services.

      (2) A mark is abandoned if either of the following occurs:

      (a) Use of the mark has been discontinued with intent not to resume the use. Intent not to resume use may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for two consecutive years is prima facie evidence of abandonment.

      (b) A course of conduct of the owner, including a failure to act, causes the mark to lose significance as a mark.

      (3) A title, character name that a person uses and other distinctive features of a radio or television program may be registered as a service mark notwithstanding that the title, name or feature or the program may advertise the goods of the sponsor. [2009 c.459 §3]

 

      647.020 [Repealed by 1961 c.497 §16]

 

      647.024 Rules for classes of goods and services. (1) The Secretary of State by rule may establish classes of goods and services for convenience in the administration of this chapter. The classes that the Secretary of State establishes may not limit or extend an applicant’s or registrant’s rights and shall conform to the classes the United States Patent and Trademark Office has adopted to the extent practicable.

      (2) A single application to register a mark may include any or all goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is actually being used.

      (3) If an application includes more than one class, the Secretary of State may collect a fee under ORS 56.140 for each class. [1985 c.728 §84b (enacted in lieu of 647.025); 2009 c.459 §6]

 

      647.025 [1961 c.497 §9; 1965 c.511 §3; repealed by 1985 c.728 §§84a,110 (647.024 enacted in lieu of 647.025)]

 

      647.029 Examination of application by Secretary of State; amendment of application; refusal to register mark; priority of concurrent applications. (1) The Secretary of State, at the Secretary of State’s sole discretion, may examine an application filed under ORS 647.015 for conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This section does not require the Secretary of State to conduct an examination or investigation in connection with an application for registration.

      (2) An applicant shall provide additional pertinent information the Secretary of State requests, including a description of a design that is used as a mark. The applicant or, with the applicant’s authorization, the Secretary of State may amend the application to conform with the Secretary of State’s requirements or as the applicant deems advisable to respond to a rejection or objection. The Secretary of State may require the applicant to submit a new application.

      (3) The Secretary of State may require the applicant to disclaim an unregisterable component of a mark that is otherwise registerable. The applicant may voluntarily disclaim a component of a mark that the applicant has applied to register. An applicant’s disclaimer does not prejudice or affect the applicant’s or a registrant’s rights that exist or arise in the matter the applicant disclaimed or the applicant’s or a registrant’s rights of registration on another application if the matter the applicant disclaimed is or has become distinctive of the applicant’s or registrant’s goods or services.

      (4) If the Secretary of State finds that an applicant is not entitled to register a mark, the Secretary of State shall notify the applicant and provide the Secretary of State’s reasons for the finding. The Secretary of State shall provide the applicant with a reasonable time in which to reply or amend the application and shall examine the amended application in accordance with the provisions of this section. The applicant may continue to amend the application until:

      (a) The Secretary of State in a final order refuses to register the mark; or

      (b) The applicant abandons the application by failing to reply to the Secretary of State’s notice or amend the application within the time the Secretary of State specifies.

      (5) If the Secretary of State in a final order refuses to register a mark, the applicant may seek a writ of mandamus under ORS 34.105 to 34.240 to compel the Secretary of State to register the mark. The court may grant the writ if the applicant proves that the statements in the application are true and that the mark is otherwise entitled to registration. The court may not assess costs or award damages against the Secretary of State in an action for a writ of mandamus brought under this section.

      (6) If the Secretary of State is concurrently processing applications that seek to register the same mark or a mark that is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive when used on or in connection with goods or services identified in the applications, the Secretary of State shall grant priority to the applications in the order in which they were filed. If the Secretary of State grants a registration for a mark on the basis of an application filed prior to other applications, the Secretary of State shall reject the other applications. A rejected applicant may bring an action to cancel the registration the Secretary of State granted on the basis that the rejected applicant had prior or superior rights to the mark. [1985 c.728 §85b; 1987 c.94 §104; 2009 c.459 §7]

 

      647.030 [Repealed by 1961 c.497 §16]

 

      647.035 Marks ineligible for registration. (1) A mark that an applicant submits for registration may not be registered if the mark consists of or comprises:

      (e) A mark that so resembles a mark registered in this state, or a mark or trade name previously used and not abandoned by another person, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive when used on or in connection with the applicant’s goods or services.

      (2)(a) A mark may not be registered if the mark is:

      (A) Merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the applicant’s goods or services;

      (B) Primarily geographically descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the applicant’s goods or services; or

      (C) Primarily merely a surname.

      (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection do not prevent the Secretary of State from registering a mark used by the applicant that has become distinctive of the applicant’s goods or services. The Secretary of State may accept as evidence that the mark has become distinctive, when used on or in connection with the applicant’s goods or services, proof that the applicant has used the mark continuously in this state for five years before the date on which the applicant made the claim that the mark has become distinctive of the applicant’s goods or services.

If the registrant is a limited liability company, the certificate must show the state in which the limited liability company was formed.

      (b) The date the applicant claimed as the first use of the mark anywhere and the date claimed as the first use of the mark in this state.

      (e) The registration date and the term of registration.

      (3) A certificate of registration issued by the Secretary of State under this chapter, or a copy of the certificate duly certified by the Secretary of State, is competent and sufficient proof of the registration of the mark in an action or proceeding brought in a court in this state. [1961 c.497 §4; 1965 c.511 §5; 1971 c.318 §4; 1985 c.728 §86; 2009 c.459 §9]

      (2) A registration that is effective on June 23, 2009, shall remain in effect for the remainder of the term of registration. The registration may be renewed as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The Secretary of State, before the term of registration expires, shall notify the registrant in writing at the mailing address shown for the registrant in the current records of the Secretary of State that the registrant must renew the registration. [1961 c.497 §§5,7; 1965 c.511 §6; 1971 c.318 §5; 1981 c.633 §72; 1985 c.728 §86a; 1989 c.931 §2; 1991 c.132 §21; 2009 c.459 §10]

      647.065 Assignment; filing with Secretary of State; legal and evidentiary effect; public record of registrations. (1) A mark and the registration for the mark under this chapter are assignable with the goodwill of the business in which the mark is used, or with the part of the goodwill of the business that is connected with the use of and symbolized by the mark.

After filing the instrument, the Secretary of State may issue to the assignee a certificate of registration that is effective for the remainder of the term of registration.

      (3) An assignment of registration under this section is void as against a subsequent purchaser that purchases the registration for valuable consideration and without notice of the assignment unless the assignment is submitted to the Secretary of State of State for filing within 90 days after the assignment or before the subsequent purchase, whichever is later.

      (4) A registrant or applicant for registration may submit for filing with the Secretary of State a change of name for the registration or the application. The Secretary of State may issue a certificate of registration for an assigned application in the assignee’s name or may issue a certificate of registration in the assignee’s name for the remainder of the term of registration.

      (5) The Secretary of State, at the Secretary of State’s sole discretion, may receive for filing other signed written instruments related to a mark that is registered or an application that is pending, such as licenses, security interests or mortgages.

      (6) Acknowledgment is prima facie evidence of the execution of an assignment or other instrument. If the Secretary of State accepts an instrument for filing, the Secretary of State’s record is prima facie evidence of the execution.

      (7) The Secretary of State may accept for filing a photocopy of an instrument if a party to the instrument or a successor to the party certifies that the photocopy is a true and correct copy of the original instrument.

      (8) The Secretary of State shall keep for public examination a record of all marks registered or renewed under this chapter and all documents submitted for filing under this section.

      (b) The registration has not been renewed in accordance with the provisions of ORS 647.055.

      (c) A court of competent jurisdiction either orders cancellation of the registration or makes any of the following findings:

      (A) The registered mark has been abandoned.

      (B) The registrant is not the owner of the mark.

      (C) The registration was granted improperly.

      (D) The registration was obtained fraudulently.

      (E) The registered mark is the generic name for the goods or services or a portion of the goods or services for which the mark has been registered.

      (F) The registered mark is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive because of the registered mark’s similarity to a mark registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and not abandoned before the application for the registered mark was filed under ORS 647.015.

      (2) If the registrant proves that the registrant has a concurrent registration in the United States Patent and Trademark Office that covers an area that includes this state, the Secretary of State may not cancel the registration for the area covered by the concurrent registration notwithstanding a court’s finding under subsection (1)(c)(F) of this section. [1961 c.497 §8; 1965 c.511 §8; 1971 c.318 §7; 1981 c.633 §73; 1985 c.728 §88; 2009 c.459 §12]

 

      647.077 Action to cancel mark or compel registration; Secretary of State not a party.

      (2) A person that violates subsection (1) of this section is liable to pay all damages sustained in consequence of the filing or registration.

[1961 c.497 §11; 1965 c.511 §10; 1985 c.566 §1; 2009 c.459 §14]

 

      647.100 [Repealed by 1961 c.497 §16]

 

      647.105 Remedies for infringement. (1) An owner of a mark registered under this chapter may proceed in a civil action to seek an injunction against the manufacture, use, display or sale of a counterfeit or imitation of the mark. A court of competent jurisdiction may:

      (a) Grant injunctions to restrain the manufacture, use, display or sale as the court deems just and reasonable;

      (b) Require the defendant to pay to the owner all profits the defendant derived and all damages the owner suffered from the manufacture, use, display or sale; and

      (c) Order counterfeits or imitations in the defendant’s possession or under the defendant’s control to be delivered to an officer of the court or the owner to be destroyed.

      (2) If the court finds that the defendant acted in bad faith, with knowledge or otherwise according to the circumstances of the case, the court in the court’s discretion may enter a judgment in an amount not to exceed three times the sum of the defendant’s profits and the owner’s damages and reasonable attorney fees. If the court finds that the plaintiff acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons, the court in the court’s discretion may award reasonable attorney fees to the defendant. [1961 c.497 §12; 1965 c.511 §11; 1985 c.566 §2; 2009 c.459 §15]

 

      647.107 Grounds for injunctive relief; famous marks. (1) Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a mark that is famous and distinctive in this state, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, is entitled to an injunction against another person’s commercial use of the mark if:

      (a) The other person’s use began after the mark became famous; and

      (b) The use is likely to cause dilution of the famous mark.

      (2) A mark is famous if the general consuming public of this state or of a geographic area within this state widely recognizes the mark as a designation of the source of the mark owner’s goods or services. In determining whether a mark is famous, a court may consider factors such as:

      (a) The duration, extent and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark in this state by the owner or by other persons;
