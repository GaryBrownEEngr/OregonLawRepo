      (2) An application for registration of a real and true name shall be treated in the same manner as an application to register an assumed business name under this chapter.

      648.010 Registration of assumed business name; contents of application; designation of representative; effect. (1) Each person who will carry on, conduct or transact business under an assumed business name shall sign an application to register the assumed business name and shall submit the application to the Office of the Secretary of State, with the fee prescribed by this chapter.

      (2) The application shall state:

      (a) The assumed business name to be registered. The applicant shall write the assumed business name in the alphabet used to write the English language. The assumed business name may include numerals and incidental punctuation.

      (c) The principal address at which the applicant intends to carry on, conduct or transact business and a listing of each county in which the applicant intends to carry on, conduct or transact business to the extent that ORS 648.007 would require the applicant to register the assumed business name for that county.

      (d) The name and the mailing address of the person whom the applicant authorizes to represent the applicant in transactions with the Office of the Secretary of State with respect to the registration. All of the registrants of an assumed business name for a single business shall designate the same person under this subsection.

      (e) The applicant’s primary business activity.

      (f) Any other information that the Secretary of State by rule may require.

      (3) The person named in the application to be authorized to represent the applicant is authorized to receive notices under this chapter and to perform any duty that this chapter requires of the registrant of the assumed business name, but is not by the application or registration made the registrant’s agent for the service of process. [Amended by 1961 c.355 §1; 1963 c.551 §2; 1969 c.154 §1; 1971 c.194 §2; 1985 c.728 §94; 1987 c.843 §21; 1995 c.454 §4; 2007 c.186 §18]

 

      648.012 Registration duty of Secretary of State. (1) If an application delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing satisfies the requirements of ORS 648.010, the Secretary of State shall register it.

      (2) The Secretary of State registers an application by indicating thereon that it has been filed by the Secretary of State and the date of registration.

      (3) If the Secretary of State refuses to register an assumed business name, the Secretary of State shall return the application to the applicant within 10 business days after the application was delivered together with a brief written explanation of the reason for the refusal.

      (4) The duty of the Secretary of State to register assumed business names under this section is ministerial. The Secretary of State is not required to verify or inquire into the legality or truth of any matter included in any application delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State’s registering or refusing to register an assumed business name does not:

      (a) Affect the validity or invalidity of the application in whole or part; or

      (b) Relate to the correctness or incorrectness of information contained in the application.

      (5) The Secretary of State’s refusal to register an assumed business name does not create a presumption that the application is invalid or that information contained in the application is incorrect. [1995 c.454 §13]

 

      648.014 Forms; rules. (1) Upon request, the Secretary of State may furnish forms for documents required or permitted to be filed by this chapter.

      (2) The Secretary of State may by rule require the use of the forms. [1995 c.454 §14]

      648.017 Renewal of registration; fee; contents of application; rules; effect of failure to renew; notice. (1) A registrant must apply to renew a registration of an assumed business name within 30 days before the second anniversary of the date that the Secretary of State registered the assumed business name and each second anniversary thereafter. The registrant must apply to the Office of the Secretary of State for renewal of the registration and submit with the renewal a renewal fee. The application for renewal must include all identifying information required by rule of the Secretary of State. Failure to apply for renewal and pay the required fee is grounds for administrative cancellation of the registration.

      (2) Not less than 30 days before the application for renewal is due, the Secretary of State shall notify each authorized representative of the requirement to apply for renewal. The notice shall indicate the date by which the renewal application must be submitted, and shall include the renewal application. The notice shall state that if the registrant fails to submit the renewal application and renewal fee on or before the renewal deadline, the registration of the assumed business name will be canceled without further notice.

      (3) If the Secretary of State finds that the application for renewal conforms to the requirements of this section, and all fees have been paid, the Secretary of State shall renew the registration. [1969 c.154 §6; 1977 c.78 §6; 1981 c.633 §75; 1985 c.728 §98; 1987 c.94 §161]

 

      648.018 Reactivation of assumed business name; application; notification of denial; appeal. (1) A registrant, within five years after the date on which the Secretary of State administratively canceled an assumed business name under ORS 648.017, may apply to the Secretary of State to reactivate the assumed business name.

      (2) The application must:

      (a) State the assumed business name and the date on which the Secretary of State administratively canceled the registration for the assumed business name; and

      (b) State that the grounds for the cancellation do not exist or have been eliminated.

      (3) The registrant or an authorized representative of the registrant shall sign and deliver the application described in subsection (1) of this section to the office of the Secretary of State for filing.

      (4) If the Secretary of State determines that the application described in subsection (1) of this section contains the information required under subsection (2) of this section, that the information is correct, that the application otherwise complies with the requirements of ORS 648.010 and that the registrant has paid all fees and charges due since the date of cancellation, the Secretary of State shall reactivate the assumed business name. The reactivation is effective when the Secretary of State files the application.

      (5) If the Secretary of State denies a registrant’s application for reactivation under this section, the Secretary of State shall notify the registrant in writing and explain the reason for the denial.

      (6) A registrant may appeal the Secretary of State’s decision to deny an application the registrant submitted under this section. The registrant’s appeal is subject to the provisions of ORS chapter 183. [2011 c.147 §31]

      (b) A registrant or an authorized representative of the registrant shall deliver an application to amend an assumed business name to the office of the Secretary of State for filing within 60 days after any of the following occurs:

      (A) The identity, name or address of a person that carries on, conducts or transacts the business for which the assumed business name is registered changes;

      (B) The identity, name or address of the person authorized to represent the registrant or registrants changes;

      (C) The registrant commences to carry on, conduct or transact business under the assumed business name in a county or counties other than the county or counties where the registrant’s application stated that the registrant intended to carry on, conduct or transact business under the assumed business name; or

      (D) The address of the principal place of business changes.

      (2) Except as provided in this subsection, the application required by subsection (1) of this section must be signed by the registrant, if the registrant is an individual, by the officer of a foreign or domestic corporation who is authorized to sign, if the registrant is a foreign or domestic corporation, by a general partner of a foreign or domestic limited partnership, if the registrant is a foreign or domestic limited partnership, by a manager of a foreign or domestic limited liability company, or by a member of a foreign or domestic member-managed limited liability company, if the registrant is a foreign or domestic limited liability company, or by a trustee of a foreign or domestic business trust, if the registrant is a foreign or domestic business trust. The authorized representative, instead of the registrant or registrants, may sign an application required under subsection (1) of this section if:

      (a) The address of a person under subsection (1)(b)(A) or (B) of this section changes.

      (4) Amending the registration of an assumed business name supersedes the original registration of the assumed business name on all matters amended but does not renew the registration as required under ORS 648.017.

      (5) The Secretary of State may designate a new authorized representative by rule if the authorized representative withdraws and a new authorized representative is not appointed within the time period prescribed in this section. [1963 c.551 §6; 1969 c.154 §3; 1981 c.633 §76; 1985 c.728 §99; 1987 c.94 §162; 1995 c.454 §6; 2011 c.147 §29]

 

      648.029 Alteration of registration to reflect corporate structure change. Where a domestic corporation is the registrant of an assumed business name and the corporation merges or amends its articles of incorporation to change its corporate name or a foreign corporation procures an amended certificate of authority, the Secretary of State may alter the assumed business name registration to indicate the surviving or changed corporate name. [1969 c.154 §8; 1995 c.454 §7]

 

      Note: 648.029 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 648 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (c) That the affiant believes that the facts stated are sufficient to establish either:

      (B) That the character of business that the applicant intends to carry on, conduct or transact under the assumed business name will not so resemble the character of business, if any, that the person who filed, reserved or registered the assumed business name or the name of the person identified under subsection (2) of this section conducts under the name in the county or any of the counties listed in the application as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.

The service shall be sufficient and valid personal service upon the persons not domiciled in this state to whom ORS 648.061 applies if the plaintiff immediately sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by certified mail to the principal office of the persons against whom the process or pleadings are directed, and the return receipt of the latter and plaintiff’s affidavit of compliance with this section are appended to the process and entered as a part of the return thereof. The defendant persons against whom the process or pleadings are directed shall have 30 days after the date of mailing of the process or pleadings in which to appear and plead.
