      (2) It shall be an affirmative defense to any action for legal or equitable remedies brought under subsection (1) of this section if the franchisee knew of the untruth or omission.

The court may award appropriate relief to the franchisee or such other persons if the court finds that enforcement of the right of the franchisee or other persons by private civil action or suit, whether by class action or otherwise, would be so burdensome or expensive as to be impractical.

      (b) Prohibited methods for coercing or attempting to coerce a dealer include, but are not limited to:

      (A) Stating to a dealer that the dealer’s failure to advertise, promote, offer or sell the products or services described in paragraph (a) of this subsection will substantially and adversely affect the dealer’s business or the dealer’s relationship with the manufacturer, distributor or importer;

      (B) Requiring the dealer in a franchise agreement to advertise, promote, offer or sell the products or services described in paragraph (a) of this subsection;

      (2) The prohibition in subsection (1) of this section does not affect a manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s right or ability to:

      (a) Provide incentives to a dealer that voluntarily decides to advertise, promote, offer or sell the products or services described in subsection (1)(a) of this section; or

      (b) Require a dealer that sells a product or service that is similar to the products or services described in subsection (1)(a) of this section, but that the manufacturer, distributor or importer does not provide, originate, sponsor or endorse, to notify a customer in writing, and to obtain the customer’s acknowledgment, that the manufacturer, distributor or importer does not provide, originate, sponsor or endorse the product or service.

      (b) A manufacturer, distributor or importer may require a dealer to construct a new dealer facility or materially alter or remodel an existing dealer facility within seven years after the dealer constructed, materially altered or remodeled the existing dealer facility:

      (ii) Existing and reasonably foreseeable economic conditions;

      (iii) Financial expectations;

      (c) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not prohibit a dealer from voluntarily agreeing with a manufacturer, distributor or importer to construct a new dealer facility or materially alter or remodel an existing dealer facility in return for separate and valuable consideration. For the purposes of this paragraph, renewing a dealer’s franchise is not separate and valuable consideration.

      (d) For purposes of this subsection:

      (A) “Materially alter” means a significant architectural or structural modification to a dealer facility that is directly related to effectively selling or servicing motor vehicles of the type that the dealer’s franchise agreement or license permits the dealer to sell or service.

      (B) “Materially alter” does not include routine maintenance, such as interior painting, that is reasonably necessary to keep a dealer facility in attractive condition.

      (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a manufacturer, distributor or importer may not require a dealer to purchase goods or services for constructing, materially altering or remodeling a dealer facility from a vendor that the manufacturer, distributor or importer selects, identifies or designates without giving the dealer an option to obtain goods or services of substantially similar quality and design from a vendor that the dealer chooses, subject to the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s approval in advance. The manufacturer, distributor or importer may not withhold approval unreasonably.

      (b) A dealer may not select a vendor from which to obtain goods and services for constructing a new dealer facility or materially altering or remodeling an existing dealer facility if a manufacturer, distributor or importer provides money, credit, an allowance or a reimbursement to compensate for all or a substantial portion of the cost of upgrading or improving a dealer facility or for using a specific material, good or service to upgrade or improve a dealer facility.

      (c) This subsection does not permit a dealer or vendor to:

      (2) In determining if good cause exists pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the court shall consider such factors as:

      (a) The amount of business transacted by the dealer as compared to the amount of business available to the dealer.

      (b) The investment necessarily made and obligations necessarily incurred by the franchisee in performance of the franchise.

      (c) The permanency of the investment.

      (d) The adequacy of the franchisee’s new motor vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment and parts.

      (e) The qualifications of the management, sales and service personnel to provide the consumer with reasonably good service and care of new motor vehicles.

      (f) The failure of the franchisee to substantially comply in good faith with those requirements of the franchise that are reasonable.

      (3) Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise or other agreement, a franchisor shall give a franchisee 60 days’ written notice stating the specific reasons for cancellation, termination or noncontinuance of a franchise, provided that a franchisor need only give 30 days’ written notice concerning the following reasons:

      (a) Misrepresentation by the franchisee in applying for the franchise.

      (b) Insolvency of the franchisee, or filing of any petition by or against the franchisee, under any bankruptcy or receivership law.

      (c) Conviction of a felony, provided that conviction after a plea nolo contendere shall be considered a conviction for purposes of this subsection.

      (d) Failure of the dealer to maintain its operation open for business for seven consecutive business days or for eight business days out of any 15-business-day period.

      (4) Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise or other agreement, a franchisee’s unwillingness to agree to a site-control agreement does not constitute good cause under this section.

      (b) The information required by paragraph (a) of this subsection must include the criteria and data used in making the determination to cancel, terminate or not continue, or to retain or renew, the franchise, and must be provided within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 30 days after the manufacturer, distributor or importer gives notice of the cancellation, termination or refusal to continue.

      (3) This section does not modify a manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s contractual right of setoff.

      (4) In addition to any other payments required under this section, a manufacturer, distributor or importer, after terminating, canceling, failing to renew or discontinuing a dealer’s franchise, shall pay to the dealer a sum equal to the current, fair rental value of the dealer’s established place of business for a period of one year after the effective date of termination, cancellation, nonrenewal or discontinuance, or a sum equal to the current, fair rental value for the remaining period of the dealer’s lease, whichever is less.

      (5) Subsection (4) of this section applies only to the extent that a dealer uses the dealer’s established place of business to perform sales and service obligations under the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s franchise agreement.

      (6) A manufacturer, distributor or importer need not make the payment described in subsection (4) of this section if the dealer terminates, cancels, fails to renew or discontinues the franchise.

      (7) This section does not relieve a new motor vehicle dealer, lessor or other owner of an established place of business from an obligation to mitigate damages.

For the purposes of this section, “relevant market area” has the meaning given that term in ORS 650.120, but other factors such as actual sales and service area must be considered.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, when good cause exists as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a dealer or former dealer may enjoin a manufacturer, distributor or importer, or the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s successor in interest, under this subsection within five years of the expiration or termination of the former franchise without regard to when the franchising of the replacement dealer took place or will take place.

      (4) In determining whether good cause exists pursuant to subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section, the court may consider all factors that the court considers relevant, but in any case shall consider the following factors:

      (b) Whether the dealer is asked to terminate one franchise in order to keep another franchise.

      (c) Whether the manufacturer, distributor or importer, or the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s successor in interest, breached the terms or provisions of a franchise.

      (f) Whether there will be an unjustifiable adverse effect upon existing dealers because of the grant of the new franchise or the relocation of an existing franchise. For purposes of this paragraph, the court may consider all factors that the court determines relevant, but in any case shall consider the following factors:

      (A) The extent, nature and permanency of the investment of the existing motor vehicle dealers and the proposed motor vehicle dealer.

      (B) The effect on the retail motor vehicle business in the relevant market area.

      (C) The growth or decline in population and in new motor vehicle registrations in the relevant market area.

      (g) The effect on consumers in the relevant market area. For purposes of this paragraph, the court may consider all factors that the court determines relevant, but in any case shall consider the following factors in the relevant market area:

      (A) The adequacy and convenience of existing motor vehicle sales facilities and service facilities.

      (B) The supply of motor vehicle parts and qualified service personnel.

      (C) The existence of competition among existing dealers.

      (5)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, good cause as used in this section shall be deemed to exist without consideration of any other factors when a dealer or former dealer’s franchise was canceled, terminated or not continued for any reason other than good cause pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement or as a result of the manufacturer, distributor or importer, or the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s successor in interest, having breached the terms of the franchise agreement.

      (b) A manufacturer, distributor or importer, or a manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s successor in interest, enjoined for good cause under this subsection shall offer the franchise sought to be granted or relocated to the dealer or former dealer whose franchise was canceled, terminated or not continued. The dealer or former dealer shall have 60 days within which to accept or reject the offer required under this paragraph. Only after a dealer or former dealer has declined, rejected or failed to respond to the offer required under this paragraph, may the manufacturer, distributor or importer, or the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s successor in interest, offer to grant the franchise to another dealer or replacement dealer or relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership.

      (6) A manufacturer, distributor or importer must give a dealer or former dealer at least 60 days’ written notice prior to franchising a new dealership of the same line-make or authorizing the relocation of another dealership of the same line-make within the relevant market area of the dealer’s or former dealer’s dealership. Notice under this subsection must be given to all dealers and former dealers of the same line-make within the relevant market area of the site of the proposed new or relocated dealership.

      (7) If a dealer or former dealer enjoins or files an action to enforce rights arising under this section against a manufacturer, distributor or importer, or a manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s successor in interest, the manufacturer, distributor or importer, or the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s successor in interest, shall pay the dealer’s or former dealer’s court costs and attorney fees if the dealer or former dealer prevails regardless of whether a new dealership was actually established.

      650.153 Liability of franchisor for repair of motor vehicle that becomes inoperative prior to sale to consumer. (1) If a new motor vehicle becomes inoperative prior to being sold to a consumer, the franchisor is liable for the repair of the motor vehicle if the motor vehicle is inoperative due to a mechanical failure that is not the result of negligence on the part of the franchisee.

      (2) Whenever a new motor vehicle becomes inoperative, the franchisee shall notify the franchisor and request authorization from the franchisor to repair the vehicle.

      (3) If the franchisor refuses or fails to authorize repair of the inoperative motor vehicle within 30 business days after receiving notice under subsection (2) of this section, ownership of the new motor vehicle shall revert back to the franchisor, and the franchisee shall have no obligation, financial or otherwise, with respect to the motor vehicle.

      (4) If the franchisor is unable to deliver to the franchisee the parts needed to repair an inoperative new motor vehicle within 30 business days after receiving notice under subsection (2) of this section, ownership of the new motor vehicle shall revert to the franchisor, and the franchisee shall have no obligation, financial or otherwise, with respect to the motor vehicle. [1999 c.660 §8; 2005 c.22 §453]

 

      650.155 Liability of manufacturer for damages to vehicles before delivery to carrier. (1) Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise, the manufacturer is liable for any and all damage to new motor vehicles before delivery to a carrier or transporter.

      (2) Whenever a new motor vehicle is damaged in transit, the dealer shall:

      (a) Notify the manufacturer of the damage within three business days from the date of delivery to the dealer or within any additional time as specified in the franchise; and

      (b) Request from the manufacturer authorization to replace the components, parts and accessories damaged or to otherwise repair the damage.

      (3) If the manufacturer refuses or fails to authorize repair of any damage within 10 days after receipt of notification under subsection (2) of this section, or within any additional time as specified in the franchise, ownership of the new motor vehicle shall revert to the manufacturer, and the new motor vehicle dealer shall have no obligation, financial or otherwise, with respect to the motor vehicle.

      (4) A manufacturer shall disclose in writing to a dealer, at the time of delivery of a new motor vehicle, the nature and extent of any and all damage and post-manufacturing repairs.

      (5) If the total value of repairs to a new motor vehicle by the manufacturer’s authorized agent and a dealer equals or exceeds the amount specified under subsection (6) of this section, the manufacturer may either repurchase the motor vehicle from the dealer, or provide reasonable and adequate compensation to the dealer to assist in sale or disposition of the new motor vehicle, as long as the dealer has complied with all other contractual agreements with regard to damaged vehicles. If the manufacturer repurchases the motor vehicle, the dealer shall have no obligation, financial or otherwise, with respect to the motor vehicle.

      (6) A dealer shall disclose, in writing, to a purchaser of the new motor vehicle prior to entering into a sales contract that the new motor vehicle has been damaged and repaired if the damage to the new motor vehicle exceeds $1,000, as calculated at the rate of the dealer’s authorized warranty rate for labor and parts. Replacement of glass, tires, bumpers or any comparable nonwelded component is not considered damage and repair for purposes of this section. For purposes of this subsection, “comparable nonwelded component” does not include a fender, hood, trunk lid or door. [1989 c.716 §3; 1999 c.660 §4; 2003 c.411 §3; 2009 c.627 §2]

 

      650.158 Predelivery preparation and warranty service; notice to dealers; schedule of compensation; determination; claims by dealers. (1) Each manufacturer, distributor or importer shall specify in writing to each of the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s dealers in this state:

      (B) A manufacturer, distributor or importer may contest the dealer’s proposal with evidence that the dealer’s proposal is not accurate or on the basis that the dealer’s proposal does not reasonably conform with the hourly rate or the amount for parts that other dealers charge nonwarranty customers in the same line-make in market areas that are contiguous to the dealer’s market area or with other relevant evidence. In contesting a dealer’s proposal based on evidence from other dealers in the contiguous market area, a manufacturer, distributor or importer shall rely on evidence from at least three other dealers in the contiguous market area or three dealers in an economically similar market within the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s region.

      (C) A dealer may not include in the dealer’s proposal:

      (i) Repairs for a manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s specials, special events or promotional discounts for retail customer repairs;

      (ii) Parts sold at wholesale;

      (iii) Routine maintenance that a retail customer warranty does not cover, such as fluids, filters and belts that a dealer uses in performing work other than repairs;

      (iv) Nuts, bolts, fasteners and similar items that do not have an individual part number; and

      (v) Vehicle reconditioning.

      (c) The hourly rate or the amount for parts that a dealer charges nonwarranty customers that the dealer proposes under paragraph (b)(A) of this subsection becomes effective 30 days after the manufacturer, distributor or importer approves the hourly rate or the amount for parts. For purposes of this paragraph, a manufacturer, distributor or importer approves the dealer’s proposal if the manufacturer, distributor or importer does not contest the proposed hourly rate or amount for parts within 30 days after the dealer submits the proposal.

      (d) If a manufacturer, distributor or importer contests a dealer’s proposal, the manufacturer, distributor or importer shall propose an adjustment to the dealer’s proposal not later than 30 days after the dealer submits the dealer’s proposal.

      (e) Once per year, a manufacturer, distributor or importer may verify the dealer’s hourly rate or the amount for parts the dealer charges nonwarranty customers. If the manufacturer, distributor or importer finds that the dealer’s hourly rate or the amount for parts has decreased, the manufacturer, distributor or importer may reduce the dealer’s compensation under this subsection prospectively.

      (3) A manufacturer, distributor or importer shall include, in written notices of vehicle recalls to motor vehicle owners and dealers, the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to the dealers to correct the defect or defects. A manufacturer, distributor or importer shall adequately compensate a dealer for repair service the dealer performs under the recall.

      (4) A manufacturer, distributor or importer shall:

      (a) Pay or credit a dealer for labor or parts the dealer claims under this section within 30 days after approving the dealer’s claim;

      (b) Approve or disapprove, in the manner the manufacturer, distributor or importer specifies, all claims that a dealer makes for labor or parts within 30 days after receiving the claim;

      (c) Treat as approved any claim that a manufacturer, distributor or importer did not approve or disapprove within 30 days after the manufacturer, distributor or importer received the claim and pay or credit the dealer for the claim within 60 days after receiving the claim; and

      (d) Notify the dealer in writing of the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s grounds for disapproving a claim.

      (5) A manufacturer, distributor or importer may not:

      (a) Recover all or a portion of cost of compensating a dealer for warranty parts or service by reducing the amount due a dealer or by imposing a separate charge, surcharge, administrative fee or other fee.

      (b) Deny or charge back a dealer’s claim solely because a dealer failed to comply with a specific claim processing procedure because of a clerical or administrative error that does not affect the legitimacy of the dealer’s claim, if the dealer resubmits the claim in compliance with the manufacturer’s, distributor’s or importer’s claim processing procedure within 45 days after the manufacturer, distributor or importer initially denies or charges back the claim.
