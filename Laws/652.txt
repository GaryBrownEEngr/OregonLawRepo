(1) It is the public policy of this state that no person shall be hired, nor permitted to work for wages, under any conditions or terms, for longer hours or days of service than is consistent with the person’s health and physical well-being and ability to promote the general welfare by the person’s increasing usefulness as a healthy and intelligent citizen.

      (2) It hereby is declared that the working of any person more than 10 hours in one day in any mill, factory or other manufacturing establishment or the working of any person more than eight hours, exclusive of one hour, more or less, in one day, or more than 48 hours in one workweek, as defined in ORS 652.020, in sawmills, planing mills, shingle mills and logging camps is injurious to the physical health and well-being of such person, and tends to prevent the person from acquiring that degree of intelligence that is necessary to make the person a useful and desirable citizen of the state. [Amended by 2017 c.685 §13]

 

      652.020 Maximum working hours in certain industries; overtime hours and pay; exemptions; penalties. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Machinery” means material-handling equipment and power-driven machines powered by electricity, nuclear or fossil fuels, hydroelectric power, geothermal power or another power source other than by human hand, foot or breath.

      (b) “Manufacturing” means the process of using machinery to transform materials, substances or components into new products.

      (c) “Manufacturing establishment” means an establishment engaged in manufacturing.

      (d) “Perishable product” means any product that may spoil, deteriorate or undergo other material changes that render it unsuitable for the use for which it was produced. “Perishable product” includes agricultural crops, meat and fish.

      (e) “Undue hardship period” means the period of time during which perishable product must be processed after harvesting, slaughter or catch.

      (f) “Workweek” means a fixed period of time established by an employer that reflects a regularly recurring period of 168 hours or seven consecutive 24-hour periods. A workweek may begin on any day of the week and any hour of the day and need not coincide with a calendar week. The beginning of the workweek may be changed if the change is intended to be permanent and is not designed to evade overtime requirements.

      (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection and subsection (3) of this section, an employer may not require or permit an employee employed in any mill, factory or other manufacturing establishment in this state to work more than:

      (A) 10 hours in any one day; or

      (B) 55 hours in any one workweek.

      (b) An employer may permit an employee described in paragraph (a) of this subsection to work up to 60 hours in one workweek if the employee requests or consents in writing to work more than 55 hours in the workweek.

      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, during the period of time that an employer is eligible for an undue hardship period exemption under subsection (4) of this section, an employer may permit an employee described in paragraph (a) of this subsection to work:

      (A) Up to 84 hours per workweek for four workweeks; and

      (B) Up to 80 hours per workweek for the remainder of the undue hardship period.

      (A) Eight hours, exclusive of one hour, more or less, in one day; or

      (B) 48 hours in one workweek.

      (3)(a) An employee may work overtime up to three hours more than the applicable limit for the maximum allowable hours of employment in one day as described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) An employer shall compensate an employee who works overtime hours described in paragraph (a) of this subsection at one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay for each overtime hour or portion of an hour the employee works.

      (c) An employer shall calculate an employee’s overtime compensation on a daily basis under paragraph (b) of this subsection and on a weekly basis under ORS 653.261 (1) and pay the greater of the two amounts if, during the same workweek, the employee works more than:

      (A) The applicable limit for the maximum allowable hours of employment in one day as described in subsection (2) of this section; and

      (B) Forty hours in one workweek as described in ORS 653.261 (1).

      (d) An employer that makes an overtime payment to an employee pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection satisfies the overtime compensation requirements under this subsection and ORS 653.261 (1).

      (4)(a) An employer is eligible for an undue hardship period exemption from the restrictions on maximum workweek hours under subsection (2)(a) of this section if the employer, in the ordinary course of the employer’s business, processes perishable products. The undue hardship period exemption shall be effective only during an undue hardship period. An employer may be eligible for more than one undue hardship period exemption in a calendar year. However, the combined total duration of the employer’s undue hardship period exemptions may not exceed 21 workweeks in a calendar year.

      (b) To claim an undue hardship period exemption, an employer must provide notice of the undue hardship period to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries and obtain written consent from each employee whom the employer will request to work more than 55 hours in any workweek during the undue hardship period.

      (c)(A) The notice the employer sends to the commissioner under paragraph (b) of this subsection must be in a form prescribed by the commissioner by rule and include a description of the reasons for the undue hardship period, the start and expected end dates of the undue hardship period and any other information required by the commissioner.

      (B) The employee’s written consent shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner by rule and include:

      (5) An employer may not:

      (a) Require any employee employed in a mill, factory or other manufacturing establishment in this state to begin a work shift less than 10 hours after the end of the employee’s previous work shift if the employee’s previous work shift totaled eight or more hours, unless the employer requires the employee to work additional hours due to disruptions in business operations caused by a power outage, major equipment breakdown, severe weather or similar emergency outside the employer’s control;

      (b) Require or permit any employee to work in any place described in this section for more hours than the hours provided for in this section during any day of 24 hours;

      (e) An employee employed in a mill, factory or other manufacturing establishment whose principal duties are administrative in nature or who is not otherwise engaged in the direct processing of goods in the usual course of the employee’s duties.

      (7) Subsections (2) to (5) of this section do not apply to employees who are represented by a labor organization for purposes of collective bargaining with their employer, provided limits on the required hours of work and overtime payment have been agreed to between the employer and labor organization, or if no agreement is reached, then, for the purposes of this subsection, such limits and payments shall not be deemed to be changed from the previous collective bargaining agreement between the employer and labor organization unless the employees have been locked out or are engaged in a strike or the employer has unilaterally implemented new terms and conditions of employment.

      (8)(a) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, an employee has a private cause of action against an employer if the employer violates subsection (2) or (3) of this section by requiring the employee to work more than:

      (B) Equitable relief; and

      (c) In an action brought under this section, the court may award to the prevailing plaintiff costs, disbursements and reasonable attorney fees. Any attorney fee agreement is subject to approval by the court.

      (9)(a) Notwithstanding ORS 652.900, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, the commissioner may assess the following civil penalties against an employer that the commissioner determines has coerced an employee into consenting to work more than 55 hours in one workweek:

      (B) $3,000 per violation if the employer coerced an employee into consenting under subsection (4) of this section to work more than 55 hours per workweek in any given workweek during an undue hardship period.

      (b) Each violation described in paragraph (a) of this subsection is a separate and distinct offense. In the case of a continuing violation, each workweek’s continuance is a separate and distinct violation.

      (4) Civil penalties authorized by this section shall be imposed in the manner provided in ORS 183.745.

      (5) An employer may not retaliate or in any way discriminate against an individual with respect to hire or tenure or any other term or condition of employment because the individual has inquired about the provisions of this section or ORS 652.020, 653.261 or 653.265 or has reported a violation to, or filed a complaint with, the Bureau of Labor and Industries.

However, any affected incorporated city, municipality or fire district shall be deemed to have complied with this paragraph and ORS 652.070 if the hours of regular duty required of firefighters employed by it average not more than 72 hours a week over each quarter of the fiscal year of the employing city, municipality or fire district.

Any affected incorporated city, municipality or fire district failing so to do shall pay to every regularly employed firefighter as additional pay for every hour of regular duty required of and performed by the firefighter over and above the average hours established by ORS 652.060 a sum equivalent to one and one-half times the regular hourly rate of pay at the time of such default. However, in the case of replacement for any authorized leave, vacation or temporary vacancy, regularly employed firefighters in a department employing four or more persons on a full-time basis as firefighters may elect to work in excess of 56 hours a week at not less than their regular hourly rate of pay.

      (2) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section requires payment of one and one-half times the hourly rate of pay to a volunteer firefighter for hours of duty performed in excess of the average hours established by ORS 652.060. [Amended by 1959 c.402 §2; 1969 c.581 §2; 1983 c.319 §2]

The court may award actual damages or $1,000 for each violation, whichever is greater, injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs. The court shall count each pay period in which a violation occurs or continues as a separate violation.

      (3) In addition to any other relief provided by law, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may assess a civil penalty under ORS 183.745 not to exceed $1,000 for each violation of subsection (1) of this section.

      652.120 Establishing regular payday; pay intervals; agreement to pay wages at future date. (1) Every employer shall establish and maintain a regular payday, at which date the employer shall pay all employees the wages due and owing to them.

      (2) Payday may not extend beyond a period of 35 days from the time that the employees entered upon their work, or from the date of the last regular payday.

      (3) This section does not prevent the employer from establishing and maintaining paydays at more frequent intervals.

      (4) This section does not prevent any employer from entering into a written agreement, prior to the rendering of any services, and mutually satisfactory with the employer’s employees, as to the payment of wages at a future date.

      (5) When an employer has notice that an employee has not been paid the full amount the employee is owed on a regular payday and there is no dispute between the employer and the employee regarding the amount of the unpaid wages:

      (a) If the unpaid amount is less than five percent of the employee’s gross wages due on the regular payday, the employer shall pay the employee the unpaid amount no later than the next regular payday; or

      (b) If the unpaid amount is five percent or more of the employee’s gross wages due on the regular payday, the employer shall pay the employee the unpaid amount within three days after the employer has notice of the unpaid amount, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

      652.125 Bond required when failure to make timely wage payment occurs; court to enjoin business of employer failing to provide bond. (1) If, upon complaint by an employee, and after investigation, it appears to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries that an employer is failing to pay wages within five days of a payday scheduled by the employer, the commissioner may require the employer to give a bond in such amount as the commissioner determines necessary, with sufficient surety, to assure timely payment of wages due employees for such future period as the commissioner considers appropriate. In lieu of a bond, the commissioner may accept a letter of credit from an issuer approved by the commissioner, upon such terms and conditions and for such amount as the commissioner determines necessary to assure timely payment of wages for such future period as the commissioner determines appropriate.

      (2) If, within 10 days after demand for such bond, the employer fails to provide the same, the commissioner may commence court action against the employer in the circuit court of appropriate jurisdiction to compel the employer to furnish such bond or cease doing business until the employer has done so. The employer shall have the burden of proving the amount thereof to be excessive.

      (3) If the court finds that there is just cause for requiring such bond and that the same is reasonably necessary or appropriate to secure the prompt payment of the wages of the employees of such employer, the court shall enjoin such employer from doing business in this state until the requirement is met, or shall make other, and may make further, orders appropriate to compel compliance with the requirement.

(1) When an employer discharges an employee or when employment is terminated by mutual agreement, all wages earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge or termination become due and payable not later than the end of the first business day after the discharge or termination.

      (2)(a) When an employee who does not have a contract for a definite period quits employment, all wages earned and unpaid at the time of quitting become due and payable immediately if the employee has given to the employer not less than 48 hours’ notice, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, of intention to quit employment.

      (c) If the employee has not given to the employer the notice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection and if the employee is regularly required to submit time records to the employer to enable the employer to determine the wages due the employee, within five days after the employee has quit the employer shall pay the employee the wages the employer estimates are due and payable.

      (5) This section does not apply to employment for which a collective bargaining agreement otherwise provides for the payment of wages upon termination of employment.

      (6) When a termination of employment results from the sale of a business or business property and the purchaser employs or continues the employment of an individual employed at the business, this section does not apply to the payment to such an individual of wages for earned but unused accrued holiday leave, sick leave, vacation leave or other leave benefits payable upon termination of employment pursuant to a collective bargaining or other employment agreement or employer policy, if the following conditions are met:

      652.145 Payment of wages for seasonal farmworkers. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 652.140, if an employee has worked for an employer as a seasonal farmworker, whenever the employment terminates, all wages earned and unpaid become due and payable immediately except:

      (a) Wages are due and payable by noon on the day after termination of the employment of the seasonal farmworker if:

      (A) The termination occurs at the end of the harvest season;

      (B) The employer is a farmworker camp operator described in ORS 658.715 (1)(b) or (c); and

      (C) The farmworker is provided housing that complies with ORS 658.705 to 658.850 at no cost to the worker from the termination of work until wages due are paid.

      (b) If the employee quits without giving the employer at least 48 hours’ notice, wages earned and unpaid are due and payable within 48 hours after the employee has quit, or at the next regularly scheduled payday after the employee has quit, whichever event first occurs.

      (2) As used in this section, “seasonal farmworker” means an individual who, for an agreed remuneration or rate of pay, performs temporary labor for another in the production of farm products or in the planting, cultivating or harvesting of seasonal agricultural crops or in the forestation or reforestation of lands including, but not limited to, the planting, transplanting, tubing, precommercial thinning and thinning of trees and seedlings, the clearing, piling and disposal of brush and slash and other related activities.

      652.150 Penalty wage for failure to pay wages on termination of employment. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if an employer willfully fails to pay any wages or compensation of any employee whose employment ceases, as provided in ORS 652.140 and 652.145, then, as a penalty for the nonpayment, the wages or compensation of the employee shall continue from the due date thereof at the same hourly rate for eight hours per day until paid or until action therefor is commenced. However:

      (a) In no case shall the penalty wages or compensation continue for more than 30 days from the due date; and

      (b) A penalty may not be assessed under this section when an employer pays an employee the wages the employer estimates are due and payable under ORS 652.140 (2)(c) and the estimated amount of wages paid is less than the actual amount of earned and unpaid wages, as long as the employer pays the employee all wages earned and unpaid within five days after the employee submits the time records.

      (2)(a) If the employee or a person on behalf of the employee submits a written notice of nonpayment, the penalty may not exceed 100 percent of the employee’s unpaid wages or compensation unless the employer fails to pay the full amount of the employee’s unpaid wages or compensation within 12 days after receiving the notice.

      (b) If the employee or a person on behalf of the employee fails to submit a written notice of nonpayment, the penalty may not exceed 100 percent of the employee’s unpaid wages or compensation.

      (c) A written notice of nonpayment must include the estimated amount of wages or compensation alleged to be owed or an allegation of facts sufficient to estimate the amount owed. Submission of a written notice of nonpayment that fails to include the estimated amount of wages or compensation alleged to be owed or an allegation of facts sufficient to estimate the amount owed does not satisfy the requirement for written notice under this subsection unless the employer has violated ORS 652.610, 652.640 or 653.045.

      (d) For purposes of determining when an employer has paid wages or compensation under this subsection, payment occurs on the date the employer delivers the payment to the employee or sends the payment by first class mail, express mail or courier service.

      (3)(a) For purposes of this section, a commission owed to an employee by a business that primarily sells motor vehicles or farm implements is not due until all of the terms and conditions of an agreement between the employer and employee concerning the method of payment of commissions are fulfilled. If no such agreement exists, the commission is due with all other earned and unpaid wages or compensation as provided in ORS 652.140.

      (b) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, when there is a dispute between an employer and an employee concerning the amount of commission due under paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the amount of unpaid commission is found to be less than 20 percent of the amount of unpaid commission claimed by the employee, the penalty may not exceed the amount of the unpaid commission or $200, whichever is greater.

      (4) Subsections (2) and (3)(b) of this section do not apply when:

      (a) The employer has violated ORS 652.140 or 652.145 one or more times in the year before the employee’s employment ceased; or

      (b) The employer terminated one or more other employees on the same date that the employee’s employment ceased.

      (5) The employer may avoid liability for the penalty described in this section by showing financial inability to pay the wages or compensation at the time the wages or compensation accrued. [Amended by 1957 c.244 §1; 1991 c.966 §2; 1995 c.501 §1; 2001 c.690 §1; 2003 c.779 §1; 2005 c.664 §2; 2011 c.348 §2]

 

      652.160 Payment in case of dispute over wages. In case of dispute over wages, the employer must pay, without condition, and within the time set by ORS 652.140, all wages conceded by the employer to be due, leaving the employee all remedies the employee might otherwise have or be entitled to as to any balance the employee might claim.

 

      652.165 Rules for wage collection and payment. In accordance with any applicable provision of ORS chapter 183, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may adopt rules to carry out the provisions of ORS 652.140 to 652.160. [1995 c.501 §3]

 

      652.170 Payment of wages in case of strikes. When any number of employees enter upon a strike, the wages due such striking employees at the time of entering upon such strike shall not become due and payable until the next regular payday after the commencement of such strike, if the time between the commencement of the strike and the next regular payday does not exceed a period of 30 days. If the intervening time does exceed the period of 30 days, then the wages shall be due and payable 30 days after the commencement of the strike.

 

      652.180 [Repealed by 1953 c.515 §2]

 

      652.190 Payment of wages to surviving spouse or dependent children. All wages earned by an employee, not exceeding $10,000, shall, upon the employee’s death, become due and payable to the employee’s surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, the dependent children, or their guardians or the conservators of their estates, in equal shares, to the same extent as if the wages had been earned by such surviving spouse or dependent children. As used in this section, “wages” means compensation of employees based on time worked or output of production and includes every form of remuneration payable for a given period to an individual for personal services.

      652.195 Liability for dishonored check for payment of wages; penalties. (1) An employer that issues to an employee a dishonored check for payment of wages due is liable to the employee for the remedies provided in ORS 30.701.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may assess a civil penalty in an amount equal to the statutory damages provided by ORS 30.701 against an employer that issues a dishonored check to an employee for payment of wages due.

      (3) The commissioner may not assess a civil penalty under this section against an employer that has issued a dishonored check for payment of wages due to an employee if the employee has commenced an action under ORS 30.701 against the employer for the same dishonored check.

      (4) If the commissioner has assessed a civil penalty under subsection (2) of this section, an employee may not bring an action under ORS 30.701 against the employer for the same dishonored check.

      (5) All sums collected as penalties under this section shall be paid to the employee to whom the employer issued the dishonored check. [2011 c.238 §2]

 

      652.200 Attorney fee in action for wages. (1) In any action for the collection of any order, check, memorandum or other instrument of indebtedness referred to in ORS 652.110, if it is shown that the order, check, memorandum or other instrument of indebtedness was not paid for a period of 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after presentation and demand for the payment thereof, the court shall, upon entering judgment for the plaintiff, include in the judgment, in addition to the costs and disbursements otherwise prescribed by statute, a reasonable sum for attorney fees at trial and on appeal for prosecuting the action, unless it appears that the employee has willfully violated the contract of employment.

      (2) In any action for the collection of wages, if it is shown that the wages were not paid for a period of 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the wages became due and payable, the court shall, upon entering judgment for the plaintiff, include in the judgment, in addition to the costs and disbursements otherwise prescribed by statute, a reasonable sum for attorney fees at trial and on appeal for prosecuting the action, unless it appears that the employee has willfully violated the contract of employment or unless the court finds that the plaintiff’s attorney unreasonably failed to give written notice of the wage claim to the employer before filing the action.

      (a) Completed, within three years before the date that the employee filed the action, an equal-pay analysis of the employer’s pay practices in good faith that was:

      (A) Reasonable in detail and in scope in light of the size of the employer; and

      (B) Related to the protected class asserted by the plaintiff in the action; and

      (b) Eliminated the wage differentials for the plaintiff and has made reasonable and substantial progress toward eliminating wage differentials for the protected class asserted by the plaintiff.

      (2) If the court grants the motion filed under this section, the court may award back pay only for the two-year period immediately preceding the filing of the action and may allow the prevailing plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney fees, but may not award compensatory or punitive damages.

      (3) Evidence of an equal-pay analysis undertaken in accordance with subsection (1) of this section is inadmissible in any other proceeding.

      (4) Information that an employer has not completed an equal-pay analysis may not be used as evidence of a violation of ORS 652.220 in an action under ORS 652.230 or 659A.885 alleging a violation of ORS 652.220. [2017 c.197 §12]

      652.330 Powers and duties of commissioner in enforcing wage claims; parties to wage claim action. (1) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall enforce ORS 652.310 to 652.414 and to that end may:

      (b) Take assignments, in trust, of wage claims or judgments thereon, liens and other instruments of security for payment of wages from the assigning employees, spouses, parents or legal guardians, having a right to the wages of such employees.

The commissioner is entitled to recover, in addition to costs, such sum as the court or judge may adjudge reasonable as attorney fees at trial and on appeal.

      (2) An assigning wage claimant shall not be regarded as a party to any court action brought by the commissioner under this section for any purpose. [Amended by 1957 c.465 §6; 1963 c.258 §2; 1967 c.218 §1; 1979 c.695 §2; 1981 c.897 §88]

 

      652.332 Administrative proceeding for wage claim collection; court enforcement and review; rules. (1) In any case when the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries has received a wage claim complaint which the commissioner could seek to collect through court action, the commissioner may instead elect to seek collection of such claim through administrative proceedings in the manner provided in this section, subject to the employer’s right to request a trial in a court of law. The commissioner may join in a single administrative proceeding any number of wage claims against the same employer. Upon making such election, the commissioner shall serve upon the employer and the wage claimant an order of determination directing the employer to pay to the commissioner the amount of the wage claim and any penalty amounts under ORS 279C.855 (1), 652.150 and 653.055 (1) determined to be owed the wage claimant. Service shall be made in the same manner as service of summons or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The order of determination shall include:

      (a) A reference to the particular sections of the statutes or rules involved;

      (b) A short and concise statement of the basis for the amounts determined to be owed to each wage claimant;

      (c) A statement of the party’s right to request a contested case hearing and to be represented by counsel at such a hearing, and of the employer’s right to a trial in a court of law, provided that any request for a contested case hearing or trial in a court of law must be received by the commissioner in writing within 20 days after receipt by the party of the order of determination;

      (d) A statement that the employer must, within 20 days after receipt of the order of determination, either pay in full the wage claim and any penalties assessed, or present to the commissioner a written request for a contested case hearing or a trial in a court of law as provided in this section;

      (e) A statement that failure to make a written request to the commissioner for a contested case hearing or a trial of the claim in a court of law within the time specified shall constitute a waiver of the right thereto and a waiver of the right to a trial by jury; and

      (f) A statement that unless the written requests provided for in paragraph (c) of this subsection are received by the commissioner within the time specified for making such requests, the order of determination shall become final.

      (2) Upon failure of the employer to pay the amount specified in the order of determination or to request a trial in a court of law within the time specified, and upon failure of any party to request a contested case hearing within the time specified, the order of determination shall become final.

      (3) If a party makes a timely request for a contested case hearing, a hearing shall be held in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS 183.415 to 183.500 by the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee. The commissioner shall adopt rules for such hearing. In any hearing before the commissioner’s designee, the designee is authorized to issue the final order in the case. If the employer makes a timely request for a trial in a court of law, the commissioner may proceed against the employer as provided in ORS 652.330 (1)(b).

      (4) Final administrative orders issued in a wage claim proceeding are subject to review by the Court of Appeals as provided in ORS 183.480 and 183.482.

      (5) When an order issued under this section becomes final, it may be recorded in the County Clerk Lien Record in any county of this state. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, recording an order in the County Clerk Lien Record pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect provided for in ORS 205.125 and 205.126, and the order may be enforced as provided in ORS 205.125 and 205.126.

      (6) Where the wage claim arose out of work performed by the claimant for the employer on any public works project to which ORS 279C.830 or 279C.840 applies, and a state agency holds sufficient funds as retainage on such project to pay such claim or any portion thereof, the state agency may, at the request of the commissioner, pay to the commissioner from the retainage all or part of the amount due on the claim under the final order. [1979 c.695 §4; 1981 c.594 §3; 1989 c.706 §19; 1995 c.82 §1; 1997 c.387 §6; 2003 c.794 §309]

 

      652.335 Liability of liquor dispenser licensee for wage claims of certain individuals. (1) A person operating a commercial establishment where food is cooked and served who holds a full on-premises sales license issued under ORS 471.175 is liable for all valid wage claims of individuals employed in the kitchen facilities and dining space of such establishment who are not employed by such person, if the wage claims cannot be enforced against the employer of such individuals. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may in such a case proceed under ORS 652.310 to 652.414 against the person operating the establishment as if that person had employed the individuals assigning the wage claims.

      (2) This section does not impose any liability not otherwise imposed by law for compensation for the performance of an individual’s personal services in excess of a period of 60 days, nor does it subject the person operating an establishment described in this section to criminal penalties for violation of any law providing for payment of wages. [1961 c.475 §2; 1999 c.351 §40]

 

      652.340 Requiring bond of employer. (1) If upon investigation by the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries, after taking assignments of any wage claims under ORS 652.330, it appears to the commissioner that the employer is representing to employees that the employer is able to pay wages for their services and that the employees are not being paid for their services, the commissioner may require the employer to give a bond in such sum as the commissioner deems reasonable and adequate in the circumstances, with sufficient surety, conditioned that the employer will for a definite future period not exceeding six months conduct business and pay employees in accordance with the laws of Oregon.

      (2) If within 10 days after demand for such bond the employer fails to provide the same, the commissioner may commence a suit against the employer in the circuit court of appropriate jurisdiction to compel the employer to furnish such bond or cease doing business until the employer has done so. The employer shall have the burden of proving the amount thereof to be excessive.

      (3) If the court finds that there is just cause for requiring such bond and that the same is reasonably necessary or appropriate to secure the prompt payment of the wages of the employees of such employer and the employer’s compliance with ORS 652.310 to 652.414, the court shall enjoin such employer from doing business in this state until the requirement is met, or shall make other, and may make further, orders appropriate to compel compliance with the requirement. [Amended by 1975 c.488 §5; 1991 c.331 §95; 1997 c.631 §515; 1999 c.69 §2]

The commissioner may not give approval unless the commissioner finds that such contract or arrangement will not prejudicially affect the interest of the public or of the employees involved, and the commissioner may at any time retract such approval, first giving the employer not less than 30 days’ notice in writing.

      (2) A settlement between an employer and an employee of a known and identified claim arising under ORS 652.310 to 652.414 or any statute relating to the payment of wages does not require the commissioner’s approval if the settlement does not provide for the employee to relinquish a claim for additional or future violations. [Amended by 2001 c.116 §1]

 

      652.370 Jurisdiction of courts; proceedings in name of state. (1) Justice courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction with circuit courts over all cases mentioned in ORS 652.330 or 652.340.

      652.380 Remedies cumulative; effect of payment or tender by employer after proceeding commenced. (1) The remedies provided by ORS 652.310 to 652.414 shall be additional to and not in substitution for and in no manner impair other remedies and may be enforced simultaneously or consecutively so far as not inconsistent with each other.

      (2) No payment or tender after the filing of a criminal complaint or commencement of any proceeding by the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall affect the liability therein of an employer for expenses, or prevent such employer from being subject to fine or forfeitures, or to the giving of bond under ORS 652.340.

 

      652.390 Deduction of costs from wage claims; collection fees; assignment of wage claims. (1) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may deduct and retain any moneys collected on each wage claim as costs, attorney fees or commissioner’s penalties.

      (2) The commissioner shall pay the unpaid amount of wages earned as provided in subsection (1) of this section only to the extent of $4,000 from such funds as may be available pursuant to ORS 652.409 (2).

      (3) The commissioner may commence an appropriate action, suit or proceeding to recover from the employer, or other persons or property liable for the unpaid wages, amounts paid from the Wage Security Fund under subsection (1) of this section. In addition to costs and disbursements, the commissioner is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal, together with a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of wages paid from the Wage Security Fund or $200, whichever amount is the greater. All amounts recovered by the commissioner under this subsection and subsection (4) of this section are appropriated continuously to the commissioner to carry out the provisions of this section.

      (4) The commissioner has a lien on the personal property of the employer for the benefit of the fund when the claim is paid under subsection (1) of this section for the amount so paid and the penalty referred to in subsection (3) of this section. The commissioner may cause to be filed a verified written notice of claim of lien with the recording officer of the county in which the employer has its principal place of business no later than 30 days after the date the claim was paid under subsection (1) of this section. The notice of claim of lien shall contain:

      (a) A true statement of the sums paid to wage claimants and the amount of the penalty provided for in subsection (3) of this section;

      (b) The name of the owner of the personal property to be charged with the lien;

      (c) A description of the personal property to be charged with the lien sufficient for identification. If a lien is being claimed against all personal property of the employer, the description is sufficient if it states that all personal property of the employer is covered; and

      (d) The date the wage claim was paid.

      (5) Liens created by subsection (4) of this section shall be recorded in the same manner as provided for in ORS 87.246 and may be foreclosed in the manner provided for in ORS 87.262.

      (6) Liens created by subsection (4) of this section shall have priority over any other liens or security interests perfected after the date the notice of claim is filed with the county recording officer under subsections (4) and (5) of this section.

      (7) The commissioner shall promulgate rules to carry out the provisions of this section that include, but are not limited to, prescribing procedures for a timely and cost efficient method for the payment of wage claims from the Wage Security Fund and procedures for prorating wage claims if insufficient funds are available for payment.

      (8) Nothing in this section is intended to require the commissioner to pay wage claims for which moneys are not available under ORS 652.409 (2). [1985 c.409 §7; 1987 c.412 §1; 1989 c.554 §3; 1999 c.374 §1]

PRIORITY OF WAGE CLAIMS

 

      652.500 Receiver to pay accrued wages; payment of employees; receiver’s certificates. Whenever the business or property of any person, company or corporation in this state shall be placed by any court in this state in the hands of a receiver, whether upon foreclosure or creditor’s bill, the receiver shall report immediately to the court appointing the receiver the amount due by the person, company or corporation, at the date of the receiver’s appointment, to employees and laborers of the person, company or corporation. The court shall order the receiver to pay out of the first receipts and earnings of such person, company or corporation, after paying current operating expenses under the administration of the receiver, the wages of all employees and laborers that had accrued within six months prior to the appointment of the receiver. The court also shall order the receiver to pay the wages of all employees and laborers employed by the receiver, at least once every 30 days, out of the first receipts and earnings of the person, company or corporation while under the management of the receiver. However, should the receiver not take in sufficient money from receipts and earnings to pay the employees and laborers at least once every 30 days, the receiver shall issue and deliver to each of the employees and laborers, upon demand, a receiver’s certificate, showing the amount due the employee or laborer in money, which certificate will draw interest at the rate of eight percent per annum from the date of issuance until paid. The receiver shall thereafter pay such certificates, in the order of their issuance, out of the first money coming into the receiver’s hands from the receipts and earnings of the properties under the charge of the receiver.

Whenever any claim has been excepted to under ORS 652.540 and the claim is established by judgment and the court rendering the judgment is satisfied that the exceptions were made without probable cause or that the person so excepting could have ascertained with reasonable diligence that such claim was true and just, the claimant in such action shall be entitled to have the costs of such action, and such sum as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorney fees at trial and on appeal, enforced by execution against the person objecting as a judgment debtor in the first instance. However, if the court does not so find, or if execution, when issued, is returned nulla bona, then in either case such costs and attorney fees shall be ordered paid out of the proceeds of the property sold next after the payment of all claims presented under ORS 652.510 to 652.570.
