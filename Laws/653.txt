      (2) Employers may include commission payments to employees as part of the applicable minimum wage for any pay period in which the combined wage and commission earnings of the employee will comply with ORS 653.010 to 653.261.

      (2) Any agreement between an employee and an employer to work at less than the wage rate required by ORS 653.010 to 653.261 is no defense to an action under subsection (1) of this section.

      653.070 Student-learners special wage; conditions; rules; penalties. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Bona fide professional training program” includes any professional training program approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to rules of the State Board of Education which provides for part-time employment training which may be scheduled for a part of the workday or workweek, for alternating weeks or for other limited periods during the year, supplemented by and integrated with a definitely organized plan of instruction designed to teach technical knowledge and related information given as a regular part of the student-learner’s course by an accredited school, college or university.

      (b) “Student-learner” means a student who is receiving instruction in an accredited school, college or university and who is employed on a part-time basis, pursuant to a bona fide professional training program.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 653.025, employers shall pay student-learners at least 75 percent of the minimum wage prescribed by ORS 653.025.

      (3) The number of hours of employment training for a student-learner at subminimum wages, when added to the hours of school instruction, shall not exceed eight hours on any day or 40 hours in any week.

      (4) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may adopt rules prescribing the procedures and requirements for application and issuance of special certificates authorizing the employment of student-learners at subminimum wages. The rules shall require that the following conditions be satisfied before the issuance of such special certificates:

      (a) The employment of the student-learner at subminimum wages authorized by the special certificate must be necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment.

      (b) The occupation for which the student-learner is receiving preparatory training must require a sufficient degree of skill to necessitate a substantial learning period.

      (c) The training must not be for the purpose of acquiring manual dexterity and high production speed in repetitive operations.

      (d) The employment of a student-learner must not have the effect of displacing a worker employed in the establishment.

      (e) The employment of the student-learners at subminimum wages must not tend to impair or depress the wage rates or working standards established for experienced workers for work of a like or comparable character.

      (f) The occupational needs of the community or industry warrant the training of student-learners.

      (g) There are no serious outstanding violations of the provisions of a student-learner certificate previously issued to the employer, or serious violations of any other provisions of law by the employer which provide reasonable grounds to conclude that the terms of the certificate would not be complied with, if issued.

      (h) The issuance of such a certificate would not tend to prevent the development of apprenticeship under ORS 660.002 to 660.210 or would not impair established apprenticeship standards in the occupation or industry involved.

      (i) The number of student-learners to be employed in one establishment must not be more than a small proportion of its working force.

      (5) Failure to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section shall subject the employer to a penalty of 75 percent of the minimum wage prescribed by ORS 653.025 for each hour of work time that the student-learner is gainfully employed. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall have a cause of action against the employer for the recovery of the penalty. [1979 c.886 §5; 1981 c.850 §3; 1989 c.491 §62; 1995 c.343 §50]

      653.075 Legislative findings on breast-feeding. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Women with infants and toddlers are the fastest growing sector of today’s labor force, with at least 50 percent of pregnant women who are employed returning to work by the time their children are three months old.

      (2) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that every child be breast-fed for at least the first 12 months of life and urges that arrangements be made for expressing breast milk if the mother and child are separated.

      (3) Women who wish to continue breast-feeding after returning to work have relatively simple needs. These needs include a clean, convenient, private location to express milk at the work site and adequate break time in which to do so. [2005 c.466 §1]

 

      653.077 Expressing milk in workplace; rules. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Reasonable efforts” means efforts that do not impose an undue hardship on the operation of an employer’s business.

      (b) “Undue hardship” means significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to the size, financial resources, nature or structure of the employer’s business.

      (2)(a) An employer shall provide reasonable unpaid rest periods to accommodate an employee who needs to express milk for the employee’s child.

      (b) When possible, an employee shall provide reasonable notice to the employer that the employee intends to express milk upon returning to work after the child’s birth. Failure to give notice under this subsection is not grounds for discipline.

      (c) The employer shall provide the employee a reasonable rest period to express milk each time the employee has a need to express milk.

      (d) The employee shall, if feasible, take the rest periods to express milk at the same time as the rest periods or meal periods that are otherwise provided to the employee.

      (e) If the employer is required by law or contract to provide the employee with paid rest periods, the employer shall treat the rest periods used by the employee for expressing milk as paid rest periods, up to the amount of time the employer is required to provide as paid rest periods. If an employee takes unpaid rest periods, the employer may allow the employee to work before or after the employee’s normal shift to make up the amount of time used during the unpaid rest periods. If the employee does not work to make up the amount of time used during the unpaid rest periods, the employer is not required to compensate the employee for that time.

      (3) When an employer’s contribution to an employee’s health insurance is influenced by the number of hours the employee works, the employer shall treat any unpaid rest periods used by the employee to express milk as paid work time for the purpose of measuring the number of hours the employee works.

      (4) An employer with 10 or fewer employees is not required to provide rest periods under this section if to do so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business.

      (5)(a) An employer shall make reasonable efforts to provide a location, other than a public restroom or toilet stall, in close proximity to the employee’s work area for the employee to express milk in private.

      (b) The location may include, but is not limited to:

      (A) The employee’s work area if the work area meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection;

      (B) A room connected to a public restroom, such as a lounge, if the room allows the employee to express milk in private; or

      (C) A child care facility in close proximity to the employee’s work location where the employee can express milk in private.

      (6) An employer may allow an employee to temporarily change job duties if the employee’s regular job duties do not allow the employee to express milk.

      (7) This section applies only to an employer whose employee is expressing milk for the employee’s child 18 months of age or younger.

      (8) Notwithstanding ORS 653.020 (3), this section applies to individuals engaged in administrative, executive or professional work as described in ORS 653.020 (3).

      (9)(a) In addition to, and not in lieu of, any other requirement under this section, each school district board shall adopt a policy regarding breast-feeding in the workplace to accommodate an employee who needs to express milk for the employee’s child.

      (b) Each policy must, at a minimum, designate a location at the school facility, other than a public restroom or toilet stall, in close proximity to the employee’s work area for the employee to express milk in private.

      (c) A policy adopted under this subsection, including the designated locations where an employee may express milk, must be published in an employee handbook. In addition, a list of the designated locations must be readily available, upon request, in the central office of each school facility and in the central administrative office for each school district.

      (10) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall adopt rules to implement and enforce this section. [2005 c.466 §2; 2007 c.144 §1; 2019 c.118 §1]

 

      653.079 Advisory committee on expressing milk in workplace; membership; duties. (1) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall appoint an advisory committee. The advisory committee must include equal representation of members from labor and management.

      (2) Upon request by a particular industry or profession, the advisory committee shall:

      (a) Determine when the ordinary course of the requesting industry or profession makes compliance with ORS 653.077 difficult for an employer in that industry or profession; and

      (b) Submit to the commissioner recommendations for rules that address compliance difficulties in that industry or profession.

      (3) The commissioner shall determine the terms and organization of the advisory committee.

      (4) All agencies of state government, as defined in ORS 174.111, are directed to assist the advisory committee in the performance of its duties and, to the extent permitted by laws relating to confidentiality, to furnish such information and advice as the members of the advisory committee consider necessary to perform their duties. [2007 c.144 §4]

      (4)(a) All sums collected as penalties under this section shall be first applied toward reimbursement of costs incurred in determining the violations, conducting hearings under this section and addressing and collecting the penalties.

      (b) The remainder, if any, of the sums collected as penalties under subsection (1) of this section shall be paid over by the commissioner to the Department of State Lands for the benefit of the Common School Fund of this state. The department shall issue a receipt for the money to the commissioner.

      (c) The remainder, if any, of the sums collected as penalties under subsection (2) of this section shall be paid over by the commissioner to the Department of Human Services for the benefit of the Breastfeeding Mother Friendly Employer Project.

      653.326 Employment of professionally trained minors allowed with permit. (1) The Bureau of Labor and Industries may by special permit authorize a child under 18 years of age to engage in employment otherwise prohibited by law if the child has successfully completed professional training for such employment conducted by any school district, or training that the bureau considers equivalent thereto, and the child:

      653.345 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that the crops of berry and bean growers in Oregon are imperiled by the federal law prohibiting the employment of youthful agricultural workers. Since suitable replacements for such workers are not available, the long established use of youthful berry and bean pickers must be permitted to the extent that it does not interfere with interstate commerce and federal law. The Legislative Assembly further finds that such agricultural employment is healthful, a good introduction to the work ethic and develops an understanding of the role of agriculture in society. [1975 c.422 §1]

 

      653.350 Employment of children under 12 years for certain agricultural labor; conditions. (1) An individual who is less than 12 years of age but not less than nine years of age may be employed to pick berries and beans in this state outside of school hours if:

      (a) The individual is employed with the consent of the child’s parent or guardian;

      (b) The berries and beans picked are sold within the state only and not transported out of this state in any form;

      (c) The Director of the Employment Department or the designee of the director certifies that there are not sufficient workers available in the immediate area to harvest the berry or bean crop without the employment of youthful pickers; and

      (12) If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location of the employer but remains employed by that same employer, the employee is entitled to use all sick time accrued while working at the former division, entity or location of the employer and is entitled to retain or use all sick time as provided by ORS 653.601 to 653.661.
