      (2) Employers may include commission payments to employees as part of the applicable minimum wage for any pay period in which the combined wage and commission earnings of the employee will comply with ORS 653.010 to 653.261. In any pay period where the combined wage and commission payments to the employee do not add up to the applicable minimum wage under ORS 653.010 to 653.261, the employer shall pay the minimum rate as prescribed in ORS 653.010 to 653.261.

      (a) The name, address and occupation of each of the employer’s employees.

      (b) The actual hours worked each week and each pay period by each employee.

      (c) Such other information as the commissioner prescribes by the commissioner’s rules if necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of ORS 653.010 to 653.261 or of the rules and orders issued thereunder.

      (2) Each employer shall keep the records required by subsection (1) of this section open for inspection or transcription by the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee at any reasonable time.

      (3) Every employer of one or more employees covered by ORS 653.010 to 653.261 shall supply each of the employer’s employees with itemized statements of amounts and purposes of deductions in the manner provided in ORS 652.610. [1967 c.596 §9; 1985 c.99 §5]

      (2) Any agreement between an employee and an employer to work at less than the wage rate required by ORS 653.010 to 653.261 is no defense to an action under subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries has the same powers and duties in connection with a wage claim based on ORS 653.010 to 653.261 as the commissioner has under ORS 652.310 to 652.445 and in addition the commissioner may, without the necessity of assignments of wage claims from employees, initiate suits against employers to enjoin future failures to pay required minimum wages or overtime pay and to require the payment of minimum wages and overtime pay due employees but not paid as of the time of the filing of suit. The commissioner may join in a single proceeding and in one cause of suit any number of wage claims against the same employer. If the commissioner does not prevail in such action, the commissioner shall pay all costs and disbursements from the Bureau of Labor and Industries Account.

      653.070 Student-learners special wage; conditions; rules; penalties. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Bona fide professional training program” includes any professional training program approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to rules of the State Board of Education which provides for part-time employment training which may be scheduled for a part of the workday or workweek, for alternating weeks or for other limited periods during the year, supplemented by and integrated with a definitely organized plan of instruction designed to teach technical knowledge and related information given as a regular part of the student-learner’s course by an accredited school, college or university.

      (b) “Student-learner” means a student who is receiving instruction in an accredited school, college or university and who is employed on a part-time basis, pursuant to a bona fide professional training program.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 653.025, employers shall pay student-learners at least 75 percent of the minimum wage prescribed by ORS 653.025.

      (3) The number of hours of employment training for a student-learner at subminimum wages, when added to the hours of school instruction, shall not exceed eight hours on any day or 40 hours in any week.

      (4) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may adopt rules prescribing the procedures and requirements for application and issuance of special certificates authorizing the employment of student-learners at subminimum wages. The rules shall require that the following conditions be satisfied before the issuance of such special certificates:

      (a) The employment of the student-learner at subminimum wages authorized by the special certificate must be necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment.

      (b) The occupation for which the student-learner is receiving preparatory training must require a sufficient degree of skill to necessitate a substantial learning period.

      (c) The training must not be for the purpose of acquiring manual dexterity and high production speed in repetitive operations.

      (d) The employment of a student-learner must not have the effect of displacing a worker employed in the establishment.

      (e) The employment of the student-learners at subminimum wages must not tend to impair or depress the wage rates or working standards established for experienced workers for work of a like or comparable character.

      (f) The occupational needs of the community or industry warrant the training of student-learners.

      (g) There are no serious outstanding violations of the provisions of a student-learner certificate previously issued to the employer, or serious violations of any other provisions of law by the employer which provide reasonable grounds to conclude that the terms of the certificate would not be complied with, if issued.

      (h) The issuance of such a certificate would not tend to prevent the development of apprenticeship under ORS 660.002 to 660.210 or would not impair established apprenticeship standards in the occupation or industry involved.

      (i) The number of student-learners to be employed in one establishment must not be more than a small proportion of its working force.

      (5) Failure to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section shall subject the employer to a penalty of 75 percent of the minimum wage prescribed by ORS 653.025 for each hour of work time that the student-learner is gainfully employed. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall have a cause of action against the employer for the recovery of the penalty.

      653.075 Legislative findings on breast-feeding. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Women with infants and toddlers are the fastest growing sector of today’s labor force, with at least 50 percent of pregnant women who are employed returning to work by the time their children are three months old.

      (2) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that every child be breast-fed for at least the first 12 months of life and urges that arrangements be made for expressing breast milk if the mother and child are separated.

      (3) Women who wish to continue breast-feeding after returning to work have relatively simple needs. These needs include a clean, convenient, private location to express milk at the work site and adequate break time in which to do so. [2005 c.466 §1]

 

      653.077 Expressing milk in workplace; rules. (1) As used in this section:

      (b) The employee shall provide reasonable notice to the employer that the employee intends to express milk upon returning to work.

      (c) Unless otherwise agreed to by the employer and the employee, the employer shall provide the employee a 30-minute rest period to express milk during each four-hour work period, or the major part of a four-hour work period, to be taken by the employee approximately in the middle of the work period.

      (d) The employee shall, if feasible, take the rest periods to express milk at the same time as the rest periods or meal periods that are otherwise provided to the employee.

      (e) If the employer is required by law or contract to provide the employee with paid rest periods, the employer shall treat the rest periods used by the employee for expressing milk as paid rest periods, up to the amount of time the employer is required to provide as paid rest periods. If an employee takes unpaid rest periods, the employer may allow the employee to work before or after her normal shift to make up the amount of time used during the unpaid rest periods. If the employee does not work to make up the amount of time used during the unpaid rest periods, the employer is not required to compensate the employee for that time.

      (3) When an employer’s contribution to an employee’s health insurance is influenced by the number of hours the employee works, the employer shall treat any unpaid rest periods used by the employee to express milk as paid work time for the purpose of measuring the number of hours the employee works.

      (4) An employer is not required to provide rest periods under this section if to do so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business.

      (5)(a) An employer shall make reasonable efforts to provide a location, other than a public restroom or toilet stall, in close proximity to the employee’s work area for the employee to express milk in private.

      (A) The employee’s work area if the work area meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection;

      (B) A room connected to a public restroom, such as a lounge, if the room allows the employee to express milk in private; or

      (C) A child care facility in close proximity to the employee’s work location where the employee can express milk in private.

      (6) An employer may allow an employee to temporarily change job duties if the employee’s regular job duties do not allow her to express milk.

      (7) This section applies only to an employer whose employee is expressing milk for her child 18 months of age or younger.

      (8) This section applies only to employers who employ 25 or more employees in the State of Oregon for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the year in which the rest periods are to be taken or in the year immediately preceding the year in which the rest periods are to be taken.

      (9) Notwithstanding ORS 653.020 (3), this section applies to individuals engaged in administrative, executive or professional work as described in ORS 653.020 (3).

      (10)(a) In addition to, and not in lieu of, any other requirement under this section, each school district board shall adopt a policy regarding breast-feeding in the workplace to accommodate an employee who needs to express milk for her child.

      (b) Each policy must, at a minimum, designate a location at the school facility, other than a public restroom or toilet stall, in close proximity to the employee’s work area for the employee to express milk in private.

      (c) A policy adopted under this subsection, including the designated locations where an employee may express milk, must be published in an employee handbook. In addition, a list of the designated locations must be readily available, upon request, in the central office of each school facility and in the central administrative office for each school district.

      (11) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall adopt rules to implement and enforce this section. [2005 c.466 §2; 2007 c.144 §1]

 

      653.079 Advisory committee on expressing milk in workplace; membership; duties. (1) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall appoint an advisory committee. The advisory committee must include equal representation of members from labor and management.

      (2) Upon request by a particular industry or profession, the advisory committee shall:

      (a) Determine when the ordinary course of the requesting industry or profession makes compliance with ORS 653.077 difficult for an employer in that industry or profession; and

      (b) Submit to the commissioner recommendations for rules that address compliance difficulties in that industry or profession.

      (3) The commissioner shall determine the terms and organization of the advisory committee.

      (4) All agencies of state government, as defined in ORS 174.111, are directed to assist the advisory committee in the performance of its duties and, to the extent permitted by laws relating to confidentiality, to furnish such information and advice as the members of the advisory committee consider necessary to perform their duties.

      653.326 Employment of professionally trained minors allowed with permit. (1) The Bureau of Labor and Industries may by special permit authorize a child under 18 years of age to engage in employment otherwise prohibited by law if the child has successfully completed professional training for such employment conducted by any school district, or training that the bureau considers equivalent thereto, and the child:

      653.345 Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds that the crops of berry and bean growers in Oregon are imperiled by the federal law prohibiting the employment of youthful agricultural workers. Since suitable replacements for such workers are not available, the long established use of youthful berry and bean pickers must be permitted to the extent that it does not interfere with interstate commerce and federal law. The Legislative Assembly further finds that such agricultural employment is healthful, a good introduction to the work ethic and develops an understanding of the role of agriculture in society. [1975 c.422 §1]

 

      653.350 Employment of children under 12 years for certain agricultural labor; conditions. (1) An individual who is less than 12 years of age but not less than nine years of age may be employed to pick berries and beans in this state outside of school hours if:

      (c) The Director of the Employment Department or the designee of the director certifies that there are not sufficient workers available in the immediate area to harvest the berry or bean crop without the employment of youthful pickers; and

      (d) The individual is paid at the same rate as other employees of the employer who are 12 years of age or older and are engaged in picking berries or beans.

      (2) Each basket or container holding berries, berry products, beans or bean products picked by individuals who are less than 12 years of age must be distinctively marked so as to prevent the berries, berry products, beans or bean products from entering interstate commerce. [1975 c.422 §2]

 

      653.355 Exemption of certain employers. Nothing in ORS 653.345, 653.350 and 653.355 shall apply to employers which are exempt from the child labor provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. [1975 c.422 §3]

      653.365 Civil penalty exemption for unlawful employment of minors by parents or persons standing in place of parents. The provisions of ORS 653.370 do not apply when minors under 18 years of age are employed under the following circumstances:

      (1) The minor is employed by the parent of the minor; or

      (2) The minor is employed by a person standing in the place of the parent of the minor and who has custody of the minor. [1981 c.820 §3; 1997 c.103 §1]

      (12) If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location of the employer but remains employed by that same employer, the employee is entitled to use all sick time accrued while working at the former division, entity or location of the employer and is entitled to retain or use all sick time as provided by ORS 653.601 to 653.661.

      (a) The employer may require reasonable advance notice of the employee’s intention to use sick time, not to exceed 10 days prior to the date the sick time is to begin or as soon as otherwise practicable; and

      (b) The employee shall make a reasonable attempt to schedule the use of sick time in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.
