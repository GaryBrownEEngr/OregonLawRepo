      (4) “Department” means the Oregon Department of Administrative Services.

      (5) “Injury” means:

      (a) An accidental injury or accidental injury to prosthetic devices occurring in the course of, and caused in major part by, an authorized work or occupational training assignment requiring medical services and resulting in disability or death; or

      (b) Any disease or infection that:

      (A) Arises out of, and in the course of, an authorized work or occupational training assignment;

      (B) Is caused in major part by ingestion, absorption or inhalation of, or contact with, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, radiation or other substances to which a worker who is not an adult in custody is not ordinarily subjected or exposed while working;

      (C) Requires medical services; and

      (D) Results in disability or death.

      (6) “Medical services” means reasonable and necessary services prescribed by an attending practitioner for conditions resulting from injury for a period that the nature of the injury or the process of recovery requires. “Medical services” includes medical, surgical, hospital, nursing, ambulance and other related services, drugs, medicine, crutches and prosthetic appliances, braces and supports and, when necessary, physical restorative services.

      (7) “Medically stationary” means that no further material improvement would reasonably be expected from medical treatment or the passage of time.

      (8) The terms “beneficiary,” “child” and “dependent” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 656.005. [1963 c.527 §1; 1967 c.504 §10; 1969 c.247 §6; 1969 c.597 §63; 1975 c.631 §1; 1987 c.320 §241; 1991 c.566 §7; 1993 c.500 §50; 1995 c.384 §18; 1997 c.851 §14; 2013 c.229 §13; 2015 c.342 §3; 2017 c.409 §18; 2019 c.213 §105]

 

      655.510 Benefits for injuries in authorized employment; establishing injury claim; exclusive remedy. (1) Every adult in custody shall receive benefits as provided in ORS 655.505 to 655.555 for injury sustained in an authorized work or occupational training assignment if the injury:

      (a) Is proximately caused by or received in the course of the authorized work or occupational training assignment, with or without negligence of the adult in custody;

      (b) Is not intentionally self-inflicted;

      (c) Is not a result of a willful violation of work rules or rules regulating adult in custody conduct or premises security; and

      (d) Does not occur to an active participant in an assault or combat that is not connected to the job assignment and that constitutes a deviation from customary duties.

      (2) An injury must be established by medical evidence supported by objective findings. The medical evidence must be substantiated by verifiable pathological indication of injury that includes, but is not limited to, range of motion, atrophy, muscle strength, palpable muscle spasm and diagnostic evidence substantiated by clinical findings. Objective findings do not include physical findings or subjective responses to physical examinations that are not consistently reproducible, measurable or observable, or do not fit an anatomical pattern and that cannot be demonstrated after reasonable medical evaluation. A claimant’s statement to a physician or other party does not constitute objective medical evidence sufficient to substantiate an injury.

      (3) The following circumstances do not constitute a basis for establishing an injury:

      (a) Compulsion to participate in employment or training;

      (b) Disciplinary action taken by the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Youth Authority;

      (c) Action taken by the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Youth Authority, to protect the safety of persons or to maintain order; or

      (d) Actions of other adults in custody or youth offenders as defined in ORS 419A.004.

      (4) The filing of claims for benefits under ORS 655.505 to 655.555 is the exclusive remedy of an adult in custody or beneficiary of the adult in custody for injuries compensable under ORS 655.505 to 655.555 against the state or its political subdivisions or any person or entity that contracts with the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Youth Authority for the services of adult in custody labor, any person or entity that employs an adult in custody in a work release program established under ORS 144.420 or 420.240 or any owner or manager of premises where authorized work or occupational training assignments occur, regardless of negligence. This section applies to any work-related injury to, or conditions of, an adult in custody whether or not the injury or conditions are determined to be compensable under ORS 655.505 to 655.555. [1963 c.527 §§2,4; 1995 c.384 §19; 2013 c.229 §14; 2019 c.213 §106]

 

      655.515 Benefits, training and medical services under ORS 655.505 to 655.555; rules. If an adult in custody sustains an injury as described in ORS 655.510, benefits shall be delivered in a manner similar to that provided for injured workers under the workers’ compensation laws of this state, except that:

      (1) No benefits, except medical services and any occupational training or rehabilitation services provided by the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Youth Authority, shall accrue to the adult in custody until the date of release from confinement and shall be based upon the condition of the adult in custody at that time.

      (2) Benefits shall be discontinued during any subsequent period of reconfinement in a penal institution.

      (3) Costs of rehabilitation services to adults in custody with disabilities shall be paid out of the Insurance Fund established under ORS 278.425 in an amount approved by the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, which shall be the reasonable and necessary cost of such services.

      (4) Medical services when the adult in custody is confined in a Department of Corrections facility shall be those provided by the Department of Corrections, and medical services when the adult in custody is confined in a youth correction facility as defined in ORS 420.005 shall be those provided by the Oregon Youth Authority. After release, medical services shall be paid only if necessary to the process of recovery and as prescribed by the attending practitioner. No medical services may be paid after the attending practitioner has determined that the adult in custody is medically stationary other than for reasonable, periodic repair or replacement of prosthetic appliances. The department, by rule, may require that medical and rehabilitation services after release must be provided directly by the state or its contracted coordinated care organization. [1963 c.527 §3; 1991 c.566 §8; 1995 c.384 §20; 2007 c.70 §284; 2011 c.602 §55; 2013 c.229 §15; 2019 c.213 §107]

 

      655.520 Filing claim for benefits; rules; initial award; limitations. (1) Claims for entitlement to benefits under ORS 655.505 to 655.555 shall be filed by application with the Oregon Department of Administrative Services as provided by rules adopted by the department, to the extent not inconsistent with ORS 655.505 to 655.555. Such claims shall be filed within the required periods after the injury even though actual benefits may not accrue until release of the adult in custody from confinement. The department may, before acting upon a claim, require further information for determination of eligibility under ORS 655.505 to 655.555.

      (2) When a claim is approved, the department shall make an initial estimate of award conditioned as provided in ORS 655.515. Upon release of the adult in custody from confinement, the adult in custody shall apply for an award and the department shall reaffirm or modify its initial award in a manner appropriate to the condition of the adult in custody upon release.

      (3) The rights to benefits under ORS 655.505 to 655.555 shall be barred unless written claim is filed with the department within 90 days after the injury, or if death results therefrom, within 90 days after death. However, if death occurs more than one year after the injury, the right shall be barred unless prior written claim based on the injury has been timely filed. The adult in custody must make written application for an award no later than 180 days following the release of the adult in custody from confinement. The requirements of this subsection may be waived by the department on the ground that, for good and sufficient reason, the claim could not be filed on time. [1963 c.527 §5; 1965 c.285 §79d; 1991 c.566 §9; 1995 c.384 §21; 2019 c.213 §108]

 

      655.525 Procedure for review of claims. Except as otherwise provided by rule of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, an adult in custody or the beneficiary of the adult in custody may obtain review of action taken on the claim as provided in ORS 656.283 to 656.304. [1963 c.527 §6; 1965 c.285 §79e; 1983 c.740 §241a; 1995 c.384 §22; 2019 c.213 §109]

 

      655.530 Assignment of benefits under ORS 655.505 to 655.555. No benefits payable under ORS 655.505 to 655.555 are subject to assignment prior to their receipt by the person entitled thereto, nor shall they pass by operation of law. These benefits and the right to receive them are also exempt from seizure on execution, attachment or garnishment, or by the process of any court. [1963 c.527 §7]

 

      655.535 Charging claims costs. Claims payments and administrative costs of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall be charged by the department to the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Youth Authority pursuant to ORS 278.435. [1963 c.527 §§8,12; 1981 c.211 §1; 1987 c.320 §242; 1991 c.566 §10; 2013 c.229 §16]

 

      655.540 Disposition and use of assessments. (1) The assessments paid to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services by the Department of Corrections or the Oregon Youth Authority shall be credited as a component of the Insurance Fund pursuant to ORS 278.425 and 278.435.

      (2) Funds credited to the adult in custody injury component of the Insurance Fund for the purposes of ORS 655.505 to 655.555 may be used to effect insurance or reinsurance with any authority or instrumentality, public or private, or otherwise to distribute the liability for compensation payable to persons entitled to recover under ORS 655.505 to 655.555. [1963 c.527 §§9,11; 1967 c.335 §54; 1967 c.637 §§25,25a; 1989 c.966 §66; 1991 c.566 §11; 2013 c.229 §17; 2019 c.213 §110]

 

      655.545 Liability for payment of benefits; precedence of expenses; priority among claimants. Liability of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services or the Insurance Fund for the payment of benefits under ORS 655.505 to 655.555 is contingent upon and limited by the availability of reserves in the adult in custody injury component of the Insurance Fund. In the event that the reserves in the adult in custody injury component of the Insurance Fund are not sufficient to meet the benefit payments and administration cost for a given period, the expenses of the department shall have precedence over all other claims. Thereafter, priority among claimants is determined according to the time of filing of the claim. [1963 c.527 §10; 1991 c.566 §12; 2019 c.213 §111]

 

      655.550 Assessment of Oregon Department of Administrative Services for costs of Workers’ Compensation Board. The Workers’ Compensation Board may from time to time assess the Oregon Department of Administrative Services for the reasonable cost of services provided by the board under ORS 655.505 to 655.555. [1965 c.285 §79g; 1991 c.566 §13]

 

      655.555 Rules for administration of fund for injuries of adults in custody. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services, with the approval of the Department of Corrections and the Oregon Youth Authority, shall adopt rules necessary to administer the adult in custody injury fund. The rules may provide for procedures, benefits and coverage that vary from the workers’ compensation system. [1995 c.384 §24; 1997 c.851 §15; 2013 c.229 §18; 2019 c.213 §112]

      (4) The department shall maintain a separate list of the names of those enrolled in its work evaluation or work experience program; and shall, upon request, furnish or make such list available to the corporation.
