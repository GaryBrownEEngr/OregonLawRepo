However, the director may, by rule, waive or alter either or both of the requirements of this subsection as to individuals attached to regular jobs and as to such other types of cases or situations with respect to which the director finds that compliance with such requirements would be oppressive, or would be inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter; provided, that no such rule conflicts with ORS 657.255.

      (b) The presumption described in paragraph (a) of this subsection may be overcome if the individual establishes to the satisfaction of the director that the individual:

      (A) Has conducted a bona fide search for work and has been reasonably accessible to suitable work in the labor market area in which the individual spent the major portion of the week to which the presumption applies; or

      (B) Was required to be outside the individual’s normal labor market area to apply for suitable employment within the individual’s normal labor market.

      (3) The director shall either promptly allow credit or pay benefits for any week for which benefits are claimed or promptly give notice of denial thereof in the manner provided in ORS 657.267 and 657.268.

Such services may include job search assistance, job placement services, counseling, testing, providing occupational and labor market information, assessment and referrals to employers.

      (2) An eligible unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week only if the individual participates in reemployment services including but not limited to job search assistance services, if the individual has been determined to be likely to exhaust regular benefits and to need reemployment services pursuant to a profiling system established by the Director of the Employment Department, unless the director determines that:

      (a) The individual has completed such services; or

      (b) There is justifiable cause for the individual’s failure to participate in such services.

      (3) In adopting rules to carry out the provisions of this section, the director, insofar as practicable, shall comply with rules and policies of the United States Department of Labor. [1995 c.193 §2]

The authorized representative may address issues raised by information before the authorized representative, including but not limited to the nature of the separation, notwithstanding the way the parties characterize those issues.

      (2) An individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of benefits until the individual has performed service in employment subject to this chapter or the equivalent law of another state or Canada or as defined in ORS 657.030 (2) or as an employee of the federal government, for which remuneration is received that equals or exceeds four times the individual’s weekly benefit amount subsequent to the week in which the act causing the disqualification occurred, if the authorized representative designated by the director finds that the individual:

      (b) Has been suspended from work for misconduct connected with work;

      (c) Voluntarily left work without good cause;

      (h) Has committed a disqualifying act described in subsection (9) or (10) of this section.

      (3) If the authorized representative designated by the director finds that an individual was discharged for misconduct because of the individual’s commission of a felony or theft in connection with the individual’s work, all benefit rights based on wages earned prior to the date of the discharge shall be canceled if the individual’s employer notifies the director of the discharge within 10 days following issuance of the notice provided for in ORS 657.265 or 30 days following issuance of the notice provided for in ORS 657.266, and:

      (a) The individual has admitted commission of the felony or theft to an authorized representative of the director;

      (b) The individual has signed a written admission of the felony or theft and the written admission has been presented to an authorized representative of the director; or

      (5) An individual may not be disqualified from receiving benefits under subsection (2)(c) or (e) of this section or under ORS 657.200 if the individual ceases work or fails to accept work when a collective bargaining agreement between the individual’s bargaining unit and the individual’s employer is in effect and the employer unilaterally modifies the amount of wages payable under the agreement, in breach of the agreement.

      (b) The individual voluntarily left work without good cause prior to the date of the impending good cause voluntary leaving date; and

      (c) The actual voluntary leaving of work occurred no more than 15 days prior to the planned date of voluntary leaving,

 

then the separation from work shall be adjudicated as if the actual voluntary leaving had not occurred and the planned voluntary leaving had occurred.

      (b) The individual voluntarily left work without good cause prior to the date of the impending discharge; and

      (c) The voluntary leaving of work occurred no more than 15 days prior to the date of the impending discharge,

      (8) For purposes of applying subsection (2) of this section, when an individual has notified an employer that the individual will leave work on a specific date and it is determined that:

      (a) The voluntary leaving would be for reasons that do not constitute good cause;

      (b) The employer discharged the individual, but not for misconduct connected with work, prior to the date of the planned voluntary leaving; and

      (c) The actual discharge occurred no more than 15 days prior to the planned voluntary leaving,

 

then the separation from work shall be adjudicated as if the discharge had not occurred and the planned voluntary leaving had occurred. However, the individual shall be eligible for benefits for the period including the week in which the actual discharge occurred through the week prior to the week of the planned voluntary leaving date.

      (9)(a) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, an individual is considered to have committed a disqualifying act when the individual:

      657.315 Recovery or deduction of benefits paid erroneously. (1) If the Director of the Employment Department decides that an individual has been paid benefits to which the individual is not entitled because of an error not due to the individual providing a false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact or not disclosing a material fact, or because an initial decision to pay benefits is subsequently reversed by a decision finding the individual is not eligible for the benefits, the individual is liable to have the amount deducted from any future benefits otherwise payable to the individual under this chapter or the equivalent law of another state for any week or weeks within five years following the week in which the decision establishing the erroneous payment became final.

      (2) A decision of the director under this section does not authorize the recovery of the amount of any benefits paid to an individual until the decision is final and the decision specifies that the individual is liable to have the amount deducted from any future benefits otherwise payable under this chapter or the equivalent law of another state for any week or weeks within five years following the week in which the decision establishing the erroneous payment became final.

      (3) Amounts paid to an individual in excess of the maximum benefits allowable pursuant to this chapter may be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the director for such purpose.

      (2) The director may waive recovery of benefits under ORS 657.315 if the director finds that recovery of benefits would be against equity and good conscience.

      (3) If the United States Secretary of Labor serves notice that the provisions of subsection (1) or (2) of this section fail to meet the requirements of the Social Security Act or the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, the nonconforming subsection is no longer of any force or effect.

      (4) The director may waive establishment and recovery of overpaid benefits when no decision has been issued under ORS 657.310 or 657.315 and the amount of the overpayment is less than one-half of the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect at the time the overpayment is discovered. [1983 c.528 §§6,7; 1995 c.105 §7; 2011 c.514 §1]

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the overpayment may not be canceled if the debt is being recovered by payments or deductions that were received within the last three months or if repayment of the overpayment is required under ORS 657.213.

      (2) If an amount paid to an individual as benefits, for which the individual has been found liable under the provisions of ORS 657.315 (1) to have deducted from benefits payable, has not been waived under ORS 657.317, paid or deducted from benefits otherwise payable to the individual for any week or weeks within five years following the week in which the decision establishing the overpayment became final, the overpayment together with the record of the overpayment and the resulting shortage, shall be canceled and the overpayment, excluding any amount chargeable to reimbursable employers, shall be permanently charged to the fund.

      (3) When in the judgment of the director the best interests of the Employment Department are served in an effort to settle accounts, the director may waive, reduce or compromise any part or all of the interest or penalty charged pursuant to ORS 657.310. The director may determine that the amount of interest or penalty due and unpaid is uncollectible, and write the amount off. In making the determination that interest or a penalty is uncollectible, the director shall consider, among other factors:

      (a) The administrative costs of continued collection efforts in relation to the amount due;

      (b) The accessibility of the debtor for effective collection actions; and

      (c) The debtor’s financial condition and ability to pay the amount due, both current and projected. [Amended by 1977 c.294 §5; 1983 c.146 §1; 1997 c.372 §3; 2007 c.87 §3; 2011 c.514 §2; 2013 c.703 §3; 2015 c.530 §2]

      (b) “Additional benefit period” means a period not within an extended benefit period that:

      (A) Begins with the third week after a week for which there is a state additional benefits “on” indicator; and

      (3) There is a state additional benefit “on” indicator for any week for which the Director of the Employment Department determines that for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks, the rate of insured unemployment (not seasonally adjusted) equaled or exceeded 4.5 percent.

      (4) There is a state additional benefits “off” indicator for any week for which the director determines that, for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks, the rate of insured unemployment (not seasonally adjusted) was less than 4.5 percent.

      (5) For purposes of this section, “rate of insured unemployment” has the same meaning as provided in ORS 657.321 (6). [1983 c.818 §§4,5; 1985 c.194 §2; 2003 c.14 §402; 2007 c.71 §211]

[1983 c.818 §7; 2001 c.572 §10; 2003 c.14 §403]

The benefit payment under ORS 657.370 to 657.390, if not a multiple of one dollar, shall be rounded to the nearest dollar, and an even one-half dollar shall be rounded to the next higher multiple of one dollar.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 657.150 (6) shall not apply to earnings from the shared work employer of an individual eligible for payments under ORS 657.370 to 657.390 unless the resulting payment would be less than the regular benefit payment for which the individual would otherwise be eligible under ORS 657.150 (6) without regard to shared work unemployment insurance benefits.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided by ORS 657.370 to 657.390, all provisions of this chapter and rules adopted by the Director of the Employment Department apply to ORS 657.370 to 657.390.

RECOVERY OF BENEFITS OBTAINED BY FRAUD

 

      657.392 Benefits subject to recovery as lien on real or personal property. (1) If an individual is liable to repay benefits under ORS 657.310, the amount liable to be repaid, interest and penalties due shall be a lien in favor of the Director of the Employment Department upon all property, whether real or personal, belonging to such individual.

      (2) The lien shall be perfected and attach:

      (a) To real and personal property located within the county, upon the recording of a warrant, as provided in ORS 657.396, with the clerk of the county in which the property is located.

      (b) To personal property wherever located within the state, upon:

      (A) The recording of a warrant, as provided in ORS 657.396, with the clerk of any county; and

      (B) The filing of a copy of the warrant with the Secretary of State as provided in ORS 657.394.

      (3) The lien created by this section may be foreclosed by a suit in the circuit court in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of other liens on real or personal property. [1997 c.372 §5]

 

      657.394 Filing of lien statement or warrant. (1) Any warrant attaching the lien under ORS 657.392 may also be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Filing in the office of the Secretary of State shall have no effect until a copy of the statement of lien or the warrant has been recorded with the county clerk.

      (2) When a copy of the statement of lien or the warrant is filed with the Secretary of State in compliance with subsection (1) of this section, such filing shall have the same effect with respect to personal property as if the copy of the statement of lien or the warrant had been duly recorded with the county clerk in each county of this state.

      (3) A copy of the statement of lien or the warrant so filed with the Secretary of State shall be filed and indexed by the Secretary of State in the same manner as is provided in ORS 79.0501 for the filing and indexing of financing statements. [1997 c.372 §6; 2001 c.445 §178]

      (a) Assess a collection charge of $5 if the amount liable to be repaid, the interest then due or the penalty exceeds $10.

      (b) Issue a warrant for the amount liable to be repaid with the added interest, penalty, collection charge and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed or delivered to the debtor by the department at the debtor’s last-known address.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the debtor found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the debtor found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect amounts under this section, and in the execution of the warrant the agent has all of the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (4) Interest upon the amounts liable to be repaid and the penalty as set forth in the warrant shall be paid and collected at the rate prescribed in ORS 657.310. [1997 c.372 §7; 2003 c.576 §216; 2007 c.87 §4; 2011 c.661 §10]

[1997 c.372 §8]

 

      657.400 Employment Department Special Fraud Control Fund.

      (b) All gifts to, interest on or profits earned by the Employment Department Special Fraud Control Fund.

All such moneys shall be paid and collected in the same manner and at the same time as unemployment compensation taxes under this chapter, unless the Director of the Employment Department prescribes otherwise. After deduction of the actual shared costs of the department in collecting the amounts under this paragraph, all such moneys shall be paid into the Wage Security Fund. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, moneys due pursuant to this section but not received by the department for payment to the Wage Security Fund by June 30 of each odd-numbered year shall be paid into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund; and

      (b) Nine one-hundredths of a percent of wages subject to tax under this chapter for that calendar quarter. All such moneys shall be paid and collected in the same manner and at the same time as unemployment compensation taxes under this chapter, unless the director prescribes otherwise. After deduction of the actual shared costs of the department in collecting the amounts under this paragraph, all such moneys shall be paid into the Supplemental Employment Department Administration Fund.

      657.457 Penalty when employer fails to file contribution reports and pay contributions when due; notice of failure; waiver; rules. (1) For each year after December 31, 1993, an employer shall pay a penalty equal to one percent of the employer’s taxable payroll in the preceding calendar year if the employer has failed prior to September 1 to:

      (a) File all tax reports as required by the Director of the Employment Department; or

      (b) Pay all taxes due.

      (2)(a) On or before June 30, the director shall send a written notice to each employer that has failed to file all required tax reports or pay all taxes due, warning the employer about the penalty provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) On or before October 20, the director shall assess the penalty provided in subsection (1) of this section and send written notification thereof to the employer’s last known address.

      (c) An employer that is assessed a penalty under this section may submit a written request that the penalty be waived. Such request must be filed with the director on or before November 10 following the penalty assessment and contain the specific reasons for the failure to file the required reports or payments prior to September 1.

      (d) The director may waive the penalty for good cause if the employer has filed the required reports and payments.

      (3)(a) If the request for waiver of the penalty is denied, the director shall so notify the employer in writing. The decision denying the request shall become final, unless within 20 days from the date the decision is sent to the employer’s last known address, the employer files a request for a hearing. The request for a hearing must be in writing and state the reasons therefor.

      (b) Hearings, decisions and reconsiderations under this section shall be conducted in accordance with rules adopted by the director.

      (c) Judicial review of an order assessing a penalty under this section shall be as provided for review of orders in contested cases under ORS chapter 183, except that the petition shall be filed within 20 days after the issuance of the order of the director or a designated representative.

[1957 c.699 §8(1),(2); 1967 c.435 §4; 1977 c.538 §2; 1993 c.778 §19; 1995 c.173 §2]

 

      657.458 Definitions for employer tax rate computations. As used in this chapter unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Adjusted average weekly check amount” means the average weekly check amount in a calendar year plus one-half of the increase in the maximum weekly benefit amount plus one-half of the increase in the minimum weekly benefit amount from the week including July 4 immediately preceding such calendar year to the week including July 4 immediately following such calendar year.

      (2) “Average monthly employment” means the total number of persons employed in each month for 12 consecutive months, as reported by employers subject to the tax under this chapter, divided by 12.

      (3) “Average weekly check amount” means the gross amount of benefit payments, excluding extended benefits, made during a 12 consecutive month period, divided by the number of such weekly payments made to all individuals receiving benefits under this chapter during that period. The number and amount of payments made under section 11, chapter 2, Oregon Laws 1982 (first special session), shall be excluded from the computation under this subsection.

      (4) “High benefit cost period” means the 12 consecutive month period in the last 10 completed calendar years in which the benefit cost rate was the highest. The benefit cost rate is determined by dividing the amount of benefits paid attributable to employers subject to the tax, during any 12 consecutive months within the 10-year period by total wages, as defined in ORS 657.105, reported by all employers subject to the tax for the four consecutive calendar quarters that include the quarter in which the 12 consecutive month period ended. All benefits paid from the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund attributable to employers subject to the tax, including but not limited to the Oregon share of extended benefits and any special state additional benefits, shall be included in the amount of benefits under this subsection. [1969 c.157 §2 (657.458 and 657.459 enacted in lieu of 657.461); 1971 c.463 §15; 1977 c.538 §3; 1983 c.508 §9; 2007 c.71 §213]

 

      657.459 Computation of Fund Adequacy Percentage Ratio. (1) For the purpose of computing employer tax rates, the Director of the Employment Department, or the director’s authorized representative, shall compute a “Fund Adequacy Percentage Ratio.” This computation shall be made in September of each year and shall be the ratio of the amount in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, as of August 31 preceding the computation, to a calculated amount of benefits that would be paid during the following calendar year if high unemployment were to occur. The calculated amount of benefits shall be determined as follows:

      (a) Average monthly employment in the calendar year preceding the calculation shall be divided by the average monthly employment in the high benefit cost period with the resulting quotient carried to the fourth decimal place.

      (b) The adjusted average weekly check amount for the calendar year preceding the calculation shall be divided by the average weekly check amount in the high benefit cost period with the resulting quotient carried to the fourth decimal place.

      (c) The amount of benefits paid during the high benefit cost period and attributable to employers subject to the tax shall be multiplied by the quotient determined in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The resulting product shall be multiplied by the quotient determined in paragraph (b) of this subsection. All benefits paid from the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund attributable to employers subject to the tax, including but not limited to the Oregon share of extended benefits and any special state additional benefits, shall be included in the amount of benefits under this subsection.

      (2) The amount in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, as of August 31 preceding the computation, shall be divided by the final product determined in subsection (1)(c) of this section. The quotient obtained shall be expressed as a percentage and is the “Fund Adequacy Percentage Ratio” used to determine the applicable schedule of Table A of ORS 657.462 to be in effect for the succeeding calendar year.

      (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, if the product obtained by multiplying 3.0 times the average monthly employment in the calendar year preceding the calculation times the adjusted average weekly check amount for the calendar year preceding the computation exceeds the amount determined in subsection (1)(c) of this section, such product shall be used in lieu of the amount determined in subsection (1)(c) of this section in the Trust Fund Adequacy Ratio calculation in subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) Products obtained in subsections (1) and (3) of this section shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. [1969 c.157 §3 (657.458 and 657.459 enacted in lieu of 657.461); 1971 c.463 §16; 1975 c.354 §2; 1977 c.538 §4; 1983 c.508 §10; 2005 c.22 §462; 2005 c.183 §7]

 

      657.460 [Repealed by 1959 c.606 §4]

 

      657.461 [1967 c.434 §5 (enacted in lieu of 657.464) repealed by 1969 c.157 §1 (657.458 and 657.459 enacted in lieu of 657.461)]

 

      657.462 Computation of benefit ratio; grouping employers within cumulative taxable payroll percentage limits; assignment of rates. (1) The Director of the Employment Department or the director’s authorized representative shall, for each calendar year, compute a benefit ratio for each employer who meets the requirements of this section. For an employer whose record has been chargeable with benefits throughout the 12 preceding calendar quarters ending on the computation date, the benefit ratio shall be a quotient obtained by dividing the total benefit charges to the employer’s record in the 12 calendar quarters by the total of the employer’s taxable payrolls for the same 12 calendar quarters. For an employer whose record has been chargeable with benefits for at least four or more consecutive calendar quarters but less than 12 consecutive calendar quarters and ending on the computation date, the benefit ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total benefits charged to the employer’s record for the consecutive calendar quarters by the total of the employer’s taxable payrolls for the same period. Benefit ratios shall be carried out to the sixth decimal place.

      (2) A listing shall be prepared of all employers meeting the requirements of this section and whose account is open according to Employment Department records as of August 31 following the computation date. This listing shall start with the employer having the lowest benefit ratio and progress through the employer having the highest benefit ratio. The listing shall show for each employer:

      (a) The benefit ratio;

      (b) The taxable payroll for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the computation date; and

      (c) A cumulative total consisting of the sum of the employer’s taxable payroll and the taxable payroll of all other preceding employers on the list.

      (3) The department shall group all employers in accordance with the cumulative taxable payroll percentage limits for the schedule in effect under Table A. All employers who fall within the same group will be assigned the tax rate for that group. However, if the grouping results in the taxable payroll of an employer falling in two groups, the employer and any other employer with the same benefit ratio shall be assigned the lower of the two applicable rates. Fractions of a cent will be dropped in computing taxable payroll limits used in Table A. The schedule in effect shall be in accordance with the Fund Adequacy Percentage Ratios set forth in Table A.

      (2) Notwithstanding the tax rate imposed by ORS 657.462, each employer subject to this chapter, other than employers whose assigned tax rate is 5.4 percent, shall pay to the Employment Department for each calendar quarter an amount equal to nine one-hundredths of a percent of wages subject to tax under this chapter for that calendar quarter. All such moneys shall be paid and collected in the same manner and at the same time as unemployment compensation taxes under this chapter, unless the Director of the Employment Department prescribes otherwise. After deduction of the actual shared costs of the Employment Department in collecting the amounts under this subsection, all such moneys shall be paid into the Supplemental Employment Department Administration Fund. [2005 c.183 §2]

      657.467 Amounts included in fund adequacy percentage ratio computations. Notwithstanding the payment of regular and extended unemployment insurance benefits to employees of employing units which reimburse the fund in lieu of taxes from moneys in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, such moneys shall be included with the balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund in any computation of a fund adequacy percentage ratio under this chapter as though said moneys had been reimbursed to the fund as provided in ORS 657.505. Should advance payments made by reimbursing employers exceed the amount of benefit payments, the excess amount shall be excluded from the fund balance. [1965 c.359 §3; subsection (2) enacted

      657.471 Manner of charging benefits to employer; request for relief from charges. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, benefits paid to an eligible individual shall be charged to each of the individual’s employers during the base year in the same proportion that the wages paid by each employer to the individual during the base year bear to the wages paid by all employers to that individual during that year.

      (2) The account of an employer, other than a political subdivision electing to pay taxes under ORS 657.509, may not be charged with benefits paid an unemployed individual in excess of one-third of the base year wages paid that individual while in the employ of the employer.

      (3) Benefits paid to an individual for unemployment immediately after the expiration of a period of disqualification for having left the employment of an employer voluntarily without good cause may not be charged to the employer.

      (4) Benefits paid to an individual for unemployment immediately after the expiration of a period of disqualification for having been discharged by an employer for misconduct may not be charged to the employer.

      (5) Benefits paid without any disqualification to an individual may not be charged to an employer of the individual for the immediate period of unemployment if:

      (a) The individual left the employment of the employer voluntarily for good cause not attributable to the employer; or

      (b) The employer discharged the individual because the individual was unable to satisfy a job prerequisite required by law or administrative rule.

      (6) If it is determined under the provisions of subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section that benefits paid to an individual may not be charged to an employer, the employer’s account may not be charged for any benefits paid for any subsequent period or periods of unemployment during the individual’s affected benefit year or during any benefit year beginning within 52 weeks subsequent to the affected benefit year.

      (7)(a) A base-year employer that is not otherwise eligible for relief of charges for benefits under this section and that receives notification of an initial valid determination of a claim may request relief of charges if the claim is made by an individual who:

      (A) Left the employment of the employer voluntarily and not for reasons attributable to the employer;

      (B) Was disqualified for the individual’s most recent separation from the employer by a determination of the Director of the Employment Department that the individual has been discharged for misconduct connected with the employment for the employer; or

      (C) Was discharged for reasons that would be disqualifying under ORS 657.176 (2)(a), (b), (f), (g) or (h).

      (b)(A) A request under paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection:

      (i) Must advise the director in writing of the date on which the individual left employment, state that the individual left voluntarily and not for reasons attributable to the employer and give the reason for which the individual left employment.

      (ii) May not be granted if the individual was reemployed by the employer prior to the filing of the initial valid claim.

      (B) A request under paragraph (a)(C) of this subsection must specify the date of the discharge and the reasons why the employer believes the discharge was for reasons that would be disqualifying under ORS 657.176 (2)(a), (b), (f), (g) or (h).

      (c) A request for relief under this subsection must be sent to the department within 30 days after the date on which the notice provided for under ORS 657.266 is mailed or delivered to the employer.

      (d) Upon receipt of the request from the employer, the director shall review the information provided by the employer and determine whether the employer is entitled to relief of charges for benefits paid to the individual during the benefit year. If the director determines that the employer is entitled to relief of charges, the director shall grant the relief.

      (e)(A) The determination of the director under paragraph (a)(A) and (C) of this subsection is final in all cases unless an application for hearing is filed within 20 days after delivery of the determination, or, if mailed, within 20 days after the determination was mailed to the employer’s last-known address.

      (B) When a request for hearing has been timely filed, an administrative law judge shall be assigned to conduct a hearing.

      (C) After the administrative law judge has afforded all parties an opportunity for a fair hearing, the administrative law judge shall affirm or reverse the determination and promptly notify all parties entitled to notice of the decision and the reasons for the decision.

      (D) Decisions of the administrative law judge under this subsection are final and may be judicially reviewed as provided in ORS 657.684 to the extent applicable.

      (8)(a) If the director finds that an employer or the employer’s agent, in submitting facts under subsection (7) of this section, willfully makes a false statement or representation or willfully fails to report a material fact concerning the termination of an individual’s employment, the director shall make a determination charging the employer’s reserve account not less than two nor more than 10 times the weekly benefit amount of the claimant or claimants.

      (b) The director shall give notice to the employer of the determination under this subsection and the determination of the director is final unless an application for hearing is filed in the manner provided for in subsection (7)(e) of this section.

      (9) Benefits paid to an individual may not be charged to a base-year employer if:

      (a) The employer furnished part-time work to the individual during the base year;

      (b) The individual has become eligible for benefits because of loss of employment with one or more other employers;

      (c) The employer has continued to furnish part-time work to the individual in substantially the same amount as during the individual’s base year; and

      (d) The employer requests relief of charges within 30 days of the date the notice provided for in ORS 657.266 is mailed or delivered to the employer.

      (10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, benefits paid to an individual shall be charged to an employer’s account if:

      (a) The employer or the employer’s agent fails to respond timely or adequately to a request from the Employment Department for information relating to the claim for benefits;

      (b) The failure to respond causes an overpayment of benefits to the claimant; and

      (c) The employer or the employer’s agent has a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately to requests from the department for information relating to claims for benefits. [Formerly 657.466; 1967 c.435 §5; 1973 c.300 §12; 1975 c.257 §10; 1977 c.294 §6; 1983 c.518 §1; 1993 c.778 §22; 1995 c.79 §332; 1995 c.683 §1; 1997 c.59 §2; 1999 c.416 §1; 1999 c.849 §130; 1999 c.970 §1; 2003 c.75 §102; 2003 c.792 §3; 2013 c.704 §1]

      657.473 Statement of benefits charged to employer’s account. Employers subject to this chapter may be furnished, upon written request, a statement of benefits charged to their accounts at such times and in such form as may be determined by the Director of the Employment Department. Nothing in this section shall in any way be construed as to relieve an employer’s account from benefit charges nor to grant any appeal therefrom. [1967 c.435 §2]

 

      657.475 Where a number of the same workers are normally employed by several employers; records; contributions; charging benefits. (1) Where a number of workers are normally employed in employment in the course of a year by several employers, such employers, with the approval of the Director of the Employment Department, may appoint an agent who shall maintain such records and prepare and file such returns and reports as are required under this chapter in respect to such workers, including returns and reports of wages paid and payable to such workers, and may pay the employers’ contributions levied under this chapter in respect to wages paid and payable to such workers and shall perform such other acts on behalf of such employers as the director may authorize, all in the same manner as though such agent were the employer of such workers.

      (2) The director may, by regulation, provide for the manner of crediting to each such employer the employment experience of such group of employers who have appointed such agent with respect to such workers, for the purpose of any classification of employers made pursuant to this chapter for the determination of future rates of employers’ contributions.

      (3) Any of such employers who operate or do business in more than one place may, with the approval of the director, appoint a separate agent in each such place.

      (4) This section shall not be construed to make such agent the employer of such workers, or relieve any employer of obligations to comply with the terms of this chapter, except to the extent that such obligations are discharged by such agent.

 

      657.477 Related corporations as common paymaster; treatment of compensation for services. For purposes of this chapter, if two or more related corporations concurrently employ the same individual and compensate such individual through a common paymaster which is one of such corporations, each such corporation shall be considered to have paid as remuneration to such individual only the amounts actually disbursed by it to such individual, and shall not be considered to have paid as remuneration to such individual amounts actually disbursed to such individual by another of such corporations. [1979 c.255 §2]

 

      657.480 Effect of transfer of trade or business; partial transfer; penalties; rules. (1) If an employer transfers its trade or business or a portion of its trade or business to another employer, the portion of unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the acquiring employer.

      (2)(a) If a person is not an employer when the person acquires a trade or business or a portion of a trade or business of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired trade or business shall be transferred to the person unless the Director of the Employment Department finds that the person acquired the trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower tax rate.

      (b) The person described in paragraph (a) of this subsection is not entitled to a tax rate of less than the tax rate assigned under ORS 657.435 unless and until the person, based upon the person’s unemployment experience and the unemployment experience of the trade or business transferred, has throughout the 12 consecutive months preceding the computation date had its account chargeable with benefits.

      (c) If the director finds that a person acquired a trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower tax rate, the director shall deny a transfer of unemployment experience. In determining whether a person acquired a trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower tax rate, the director shall use objective factors that may include:

      (A) The cost of acquiring the trade or business;

      (B) Whether the person continued the business activities of the transferred trade or business;

      (C) How long the person continued the business activities of the transferred trade or business; or

      (D) Whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for the performance of duties unrelated to the business activities of the trade or business that were conducted before the transfer.

      (3)(a) A person may not engage in activity to transfer or acquire, or to attempt to transfer or acquire, a trade or business or any portion of a trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower tax rate. If a person knowingly engages in activity to transfer or acquire, or to attempt to transfer or acquire, a trade or business or any portion of a trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower tax rate, the director shall assign the person the highest tax rate designated under this chapter for the rate year during which the activity occurred and for the next three rate years. However, if the person is already subject to the highest tax rate for a year, or if the amount of increase in the person’s tax rate would be less than two percentage points for the year, the director shall impose an additional penalty tax rate of two percentage points added to the calculated tax rate.

      (b) A person may not advise another person to engage in activity to transfer or acquire, or to attempt to transfer or acquire, a trade or business or any portion of a trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower tax rate. In addition to any other penalty provided by law, the director may assess a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 against a person that knowingly advises another person to engage in activity to transfer or acquire, or to attempt to transfer or acquire, a trade or business or any portion of a trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower tax rate. The director shall deposit all sums collected as civil penalties under this paragraph into the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund. An assessment under this paragraph is final unless within 20 days after the mailing of the notice of assessment the person files an application for a hearing under ORS 657.683.

      (c) As used in this subsection, “knowingly” means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the law.

      (4) The director shall adopt necessary rules and procedures regarding the transfer of unemployment experience for purposes of establishing employer tax rates under this chapter to ensure that higher tax rates are not avoided through the transfer or acquisition of a trade or business or a portion of a trade or business. In adopting rules under this section, the director shall consider and strive to meet the minimum requirements in any guidance or regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor. [Amended by 1977 c.538 §6; 1999 c.513 §1; 2005 c.35 §2]

 

      657.485 Notice of rate; request for hearing; procedure for redetermination. (1) An employer, when notified that the employer has been determined an employer subject to this chapter, shall also be notified of the tax rate for the employer as determined pursuant to this chapter. Such tax rate shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer unless within 20 days after the mailing of the notice to the last-known address of the employer as shown on the records of the Director of the Employment Department, or in the absence of mailing, within 20 days after the delivery of such notice, the employer files a request for hearing with the director, setting forth the reason therefor.

      (2) An employer whose rate has been determined in accordance with the provisions of ORS 657.462, shall be notified of the tax rate for the employer not later than November 15 of the year preceding the calendar year for which the rate is applicable. An employer whose account is open according to the Employment Department records as of November 15 but whose tax rate was not determined under ORS 657.462 shall be notified of the tax rate for the following calendar year by November 15 or as soon as possible thereafter. Such tax rate shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer unless, within 20 days after the mailing of the notice to the last-known address of the employer as shown by the records of the director or, in the absence of mailing, within 20 days after the delivery of such notice, the employer files a written application for review and redetermination with the director, setting forth the reasons therefor.

      (3) If a valid application is filed within the time provided in subsection (2) of this section, an authorized representative of the director shall review the determination and notify the employer in writing thereof. If the review results in a change in either the employer’s tax rate or information included on the original tax rate notice, an amended notice shall be provided the employer.

      (4) The decision of the authorized representative reflecting the result of the review provided for in subsection (3) of this section shall become final and conclusive and binding upon the employer unless the employer, within 20 days after delivery of the notice, or if mailed, within 20 days after the same was mailed to the last-known address of the employer, files a request for hearing with the director. The request shall be in writing and shall state that the decision of the authorized representative is incorrect and the reasons therefor.

      (5) When a valid request for hearing has been filed, as provided in subsections (1) and (4) of this section, a hearing shall be conducted by an administrative law judge assigned from the Office of Administrative Hearings established under ORS 183.605 unless a hearing has previously been afforded the employer on the same grounds as set forth in the request. The administrative law judge shall give notice of the time and place of hearing to the director or authorized representative of the director and shall also give notice to the employer by mail directed to the last-known address of record with the director. Hearings under this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with this chapter. The filing of a request for hearing with respect to a disputed tax rate shall not affect the right of the director or authorized representative of the director to perfect any liens provided by this chapter.

      (6) After hearing, the administrative law judge shall enter findings of fact and decision either affirming or modifying the tax rate notice. The employer and the director shall be promptly notified of the decision of the administrative law judge. All testimony at any hearing held before an administrative law judge under this section shall be recorded but need not be transcribed unless a petition for judicial review from the decision of the administrative law judge is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed in ORS 657.487.

      (7) A decision of the administrative law judge is final on the date of notification or the mailing thereof to the director and to the employer at the last-known address of record with the director, and shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer and the director unless a petition for judicial review is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed in ORS 657.487.

      (8) No employer shall have any standing, in any proceeding involving tax rate or tax liability, to contest the chargeability to the account of the employer of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination or decision pursuant to ORS 657.265, 657.266 to 657.269 and 657.270 to 657.290, except upon the ground that the services on the basis of which such benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in employment for the employer or for a predecessor employer and only in the event that the employer or the predecessor was not a party to such determination, redetermination or decision or to any other proceeding under this chapter in which the character of such service was determined. At any hearing under this section the tax rate determined by the director or authorized representative of the director shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the protesting employer to prove it is incorrect. [Amended by 1959 c.583 §22; 1965 c.210 §5; 1971 c.734 §95; 1977 c.538 §7; 1993 c.778 §16; 1999 c.849 §§132,133; 2003 c.75 §51]

 

      657.487 Judicial review of decisions under ORS 657.485. Judicial review of decisions or orders under ORS 657.485 shall be as provided for review of orders in contested cases in ORS chapter 183, except that the petition shall be filed within 20 days after the order is final. The Director of the Employment Department may file petition for judicial review in accordance with this section from decisions of the administrative law judge. [1971 c.734 §97; 1977 c.538 §8; 1999 c.849 §135; 2003 c.75 §103]

 

      657.490 Employer or employee has no prior right to employer’s contributions. This chapter shall not be construed to grant any employer or any individual in the service of the employer prior claims or rights to the amount paid by the employer into the fund.

 

      657.495 Fraud in lowering contributions. No person shall willfully make a false statement or misrepresentation to lower contributions paid to the fund.

 

COLLECTION OF TAXES

 

      657.504 Applicability of noncharging provisions. (1) The noncharging provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to ORS 657.327, 657.360, 657.471 and 657.770, do not apply to employers making reimbursement payments or payments in lieu of taxes in accordance with ORS 657.505.

      (2) The noncharging provisions of this chapter apply to taxpaying Indian tribes, except that, notwithstanding ORS 657.327, one-half of extended benefits applicable to an Indian tribe paying taxes under ORS 657.505 shall be charged to the Indian tribe. [1973 c.118 §4; subsection (2) of 2005 Edition enacted as 2005 c.181 §2]

 

      657.505 Payment of and liability for taxes; rules. (1) On and after January 1, 1936, taxes shall be payable by each employer then subject to this chapter. Taxes shall become payable by any other employer on and after the date on which the employer becomes subject to this chapter.

      (2) An employer shall be liable for taxes on all wages paid for services performed on or after the first day of a calendar quarter.

      (3) Taxes of an employer shall not become payable until this chapter has been approved by the Secretary of Labor, and notice of such approval has been given to the Governor as provided in section 3304 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.

      (4) All taxes shall be paid to and collected by the Director of the Employment Department at such times and in such manner as the director may prescribe and upon collection, shall be deposited in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund.

      (5) In lieu of taxes required of all other employers subject to this chapter, the state shall pay into the fund an amount equivalent to the amount of all regular benefits and all extended benefits paid out to claimants who during the applicable base year were paid wages by the state. Payments required under this section shall be payable from the General Fund of the state, except that if a claimant was paid wages by the state during the base year from a special or administrative fund provided for by law, the payment into the fund shall be made from such special or administrative fund with the approval of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services.

      (6) Any political subdivision subject to this chapter shall, in lieu of taxes required of other employers subject to this chapter, pay into the fund an amount equivalent to the amount of all regular benefits and all extended benefits paid out to claimants who during the applicable base year were paid wages by the political subdivision.

      (7)(a) Any nonprofit employing unit or any Indian tribe subject to or electing coverage under this chapter shall pay taxes under the provisions of ORS 657.475 and 657.480. However:

      (A) Such nonprofit employing unit may elect to make reimbursement payments into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund in an amount equivalent to the amount of regular benefits and one-half of extended benefits paid out to claimants who during the applicable base period were paid wages by such nonprofit employing unit. Such reimbursement payments shall be deemed to be taxes for all purposes of this chapter.

      (B) Such Indian tribe may elect to make reimbursement payments into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund in an amount equivalent to the amount of regular benefits and all extended benefits paid out to claimants who during the applicable base period were paid wages by the Indian tribe. Such reimbursement payments shall be deemed to be taxes for all purposes of this chapter.

      (b) A nonprofit employing unit or an Indian tribe may elect to make reimbursement payments by filing with the director a written notice to this effect within the 30-day period following the close of the calendar quarter in which the nonprofit employing unit or Indian tribe became an employer, or may make a timely election within 30 days after the director finds the nonprofit employing unit or Indian tribe in default with respect to payment of taxes if the director has not found the default to be due to an intent to postpone or avoid either payment of taxes due the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund or the election to make reimbursement payments pursuant to this paragraph. A nonprofit employing unit or an Indian tribe failing to submit a timely notice of election of reimbursement shall be liable for taxes on any wages paid for services performed for such nonprofit employing unit or Indian tribe for two calendar years. Such nonprofit employing unit or Indian tribe will remain liable for taxes for any calendar year thereafter unless a written notice of election of reimbursement is filed with the director by January 31 of such calendar year. The director shall for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election of reimbursement must be filed for an additional 30 days.

      (c) Elections of reimbursement shall continue until canceled but shall be for a period of not less than two calendar years. Any nonprofit employing unit or Indian tribe may cancel such election, and pay taxes as any other employer, by filing with the director a written notice of its intention to cancel such election by January 31 of the year in which the cancellation is to be effective. The director may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of cancellation may be filed for an additional 30 days. Once a cancellation is effective the nonprofit employing unit or Indian tribe must pay taxes for two calendar years before it is again eligible for election of reimbursement. An employer whose election of reimbursement has been canceled shall thereafter be liable for taxes at the rate assigned an employer in accordance with ORS 657.435 until such employer is eligible for a rate based on the experience of the employer in accordance with the provisions of ORS 657.475 and 657.480.

      (d) Each nonprofit employing unit that elects to reimburse the fund shall, within 30 days after the effective date of its election, either execute and file with the director a surety bond or deposit with the director money, an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 or other security as approved by the director. The amount of the bond or deposit shall be two percent of the nonprofit employing unit’s total wages paid for employment covered by this chapter for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the effective date of the election. If the nonprofit employing unit did not pay wages in each of such four calendar quarters, the amount of the bond or deposit shall be as determined by the director. The amount of the bond or deposit shall not exceed the amount of taxes the nonprofit employing unit would have been assessed at the maximum tax rate for the same period had not the nonprofit employing unit elected to make reimbursement payments. However, no surety bond or deposit shall be required of an institution of higher education, unless in the discretion of the director the director determines that a surety bond or deposit shall be required of such an institution.

      (A) Any bond or letter of credit deposited under this paragraph shall be in force for a period of not less than two calendar years and shall be renewed with the approval of the director, at such times as the director may prescribe, but not less frequently than at two year intervals as long as the nonprofit employing unit continues to be liable for reimbursement payments. The director shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond or letter of credit as the director deems appropriate. If the bond or letter of credit is to be increased, the bond or letter of credit shall be filed by the nonprofit employing unit within 30 days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any nonprofit employing unit covered by such bond or letter of credit to pay the full amount of reimbursements when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties, shall render the surety liable on said bond or the issuer liable on the letter of credit to the extent of the amount thereof including interest and penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter.

      (B) Any deposit of money or security in accordance with this paragraph shall be retained by the director. Money shall be deposited in the Employment Tax Guarantee Fund. When liability under the election is terminated the deposit shall be returned to the nonprofit employing unit, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The director may transfer moneys from the Employment Tax Guarantee Fund or sell securities deposited as necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid reimbursements and any applicable interest and penalties. The director shall require the nonprofit employing unit within 30 days following transfer of a money deposit or sale of securities to deposit sufficient additional money or securities to restore the original deposit in full. The director may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any nonprofit employing unit. If, as a result of such review, the director determines that an adjustment is necessary, the director shall require the nonprofit employing unit to make an additional deposit within 30 days of written notice of the determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as the director no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate.

      (C) If any nonprofit employing unit fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided in this section, the director may terminate such nonprofit employing unit’s election to make reimbursement payments. The director may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than 30 days. A nonprofit employing unit having its election terminated under this section shall pay taxes for a period of two calendar years before it is again eligible for election to reimburse.

      (8)(a) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as prescribed by the director, the director shall determine the amount of payments in lieu of taxes or reimbursement payments required, under subsections (5), (6) and (7) of this section, and shall bill each employer for such amount. If a claimant during a base year was employed by an employer liable for payments in lieu of taxes or reimbursement payments and other employers subject to the tax rate provisions of this chapter, the amount to be paid into the fund by employers liable for payments in lieu of taxes or reimbursement payments shall be an amount that is in the same proportion that the wages paid by each employer to the individual during the base year bear to the wages paid by all employers to that individual during that year.

      (b) In determining the amount of payments in lieu of taxes or reimbursement payments, benefits paid for any reason shall be included if such benefits or any portion thereof were paid as a result of wages earned in the employ of an employer required to make reimbursing payments or payments in lieu of taxes. Such benefits paid include but are not limited to payments made as a result of a determination or payments erroneously or incorrectly paid or paid as a result of a determination of eligibility that is subsequently reversed. Any benefit payments described in this paragraph that are subsequently recovered by the Employment Department will be credited on a pro rata basis to the account of the employer that reimbursed the fund for such benefits.

      (c) Payment of any bill rendered under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be made not later than the last day of the month immediately following the month in which such bill was mailed to the last-known address of the employer or was otherwise delivered to it. The director may assess a nonprofit employing unit or an Indian tribe for past due taxes and such assessment shall be subject to the same interest, penalties, enforcement, appeal and any other provisions of this chapter that apply to taxes assessed pursuant to ORS 657.681.

      (d) If a nonprofit employing unit is delinquent in making reimbursement payments as required under this section, the director may terminate the nonprofit employing unit’s election and the nonprofit employing unit must pay taxes for two calendar years before it is again eligible for election of reimbursement. Any employer whose election is terminated under provisions of this subsection shall remain liable for reimbursement payments for any benefits paid based on wages received prior to the effective date of termination of the election.

      (e)(A) If an Indian tribe fails to make reimbursement payments as required under this section, including assessments of interest and penalties, within 90 days of receipt of the delinquency or bill, the director shall terminate the Indian tribe’s election and the Indian tribe must pay taxes for two calendar years before it is again eligible for election of reimbursement. Any employer whose election is terminated under the provisions of this subsection remains liable for reimbursement payments for any benefits paid based on wages received before the effective date of termination of the election.

      (B) Services performed for an Indian tribe may not be treated as employment for purposes of this chapter if, after all collection activities considered necessary by the director have been exhausted, the Indian tribe or any unit of the Indian tribe fails to make required payments, including contributions, reimbursement payments and assessments of interest and penalties.

      (C) Services performed for an Indian tribe that has lost coverage under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may be treated as employment for purposes of this chapter if the Indian tribe makes all required payments, including contributions, reimbursement payments and assessments of interest and penalties.

      (D) For purposes of this section, an Indian tribe and any units of the Indian tribe that separately elect coverage are jointly and severally liable for all required payments, including contributions, reimbursement payments and assessments of interest and penalties.

      (E) The director shall notify the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor if an Indian tribe fails to make payments required under this section, including assessments of interest and penalties, within 90 days of receipt of a final notice of assessment.

      (9) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8) of this section, each employing unit that is required to make payments in lieu of taxes or has elected to make reimbursement payments may request permission to make advance or budget payments in accordance with rules adopted by the director.

      (10) Two or more employers that have become liable for payments in lieu of taxes or reimbursement payments, in accordance with the provisions of subsections (5), (6) and (7) of this section, may file a joint application to the director for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group’s agent for the purpose of this subsection. Upon the approval of the director of the application, the director shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the director receives the application and shall notify the group’s agent of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the director or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The director shall prescribe such rules as the director deems necessary with respect to application for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts. This subsection shall not be construed to make such agent the employer of such workers, or relieve any employer of the obligations of the employer to comply with the terms of this chapter, except to the extent that such obligations are discharged by such agent as provided thereunder.

      657.507 Employer’s security for payment of contributions. (1) If upon satisfactory evidence the Director of the Employment Department finds it necessary for the protection of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, the director may require any employer subject to this chapter, except the state, including every state officer, board, commission, department, institution, branch, agency or political subdivision, to deposit and keep on deposit, with the director, a sum equal to the contributions due the director upon the employer’s payroll or estimated payroll covering a period of three calendar quarters.

      (2) The director may, at the discretion of the director and in lieu of such deposit, accept a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 in a form acceptable to the director to secure payment of contributions to become due the fund. The deposit or posting of the bond or letter of credit shall not relieve the employer from making contributions to the fund based on the payroll of the employer as provided by this chapter. The director may, at the discretion of the director, at any time apply such deposit or bond or letter of credit or part thereof to the delinquencies or indebtedness of the employer arising under any provision of this chapter.

      (3) Any deposit, letter of credit or bond shall be deemed for all purposes to become the sole property of the Director of the Employment Department and shall be deposited in the Employment Tax Guarantee Fund and held for the sole benefit of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund, subject only to subsection (4) of this section. The deposit, letter of credit or bond shall be prior to all other liens, claims or encumbrances and shall be exempt from any process, attachment, garnishment or execution whatsoever and shall be for the sole benefit of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund except as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) If an employer ceases to be an employer subject to this chapter, the Director of the Employment Department shall, upon receipt of all payments due the fund based on the employer’s payroll, refund to the employer all deposits remaining to the employer’s credit and shall cancel any bond or letter of credit given under this section. Such sums as are on deposit in the Employment Tax Guarantee Fund or bonds held for the benefit of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund shall first be applied to any indebtedness or deficiencies due from the employer to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund under any provisions of this chapter before any return is made to the employer. The employer shall have no interest in such deposit, letter of credit or bond prior to full compliance with this section and all provisions of this chapter. [1959 c.598 §7; 1967 c.435 §6; 1991 c.331 §97; 1997 c.631 §517; 1999 c.59 §197]

 

      657.508 Failure to comply with ORS 657.507. (1) If an employer fails to comply with ORS 657.507, the circuit court of the county in which the employer resides or in which the employer engages in business shall, upon the commencement of a suit by the Director of the Employment Department for that purpose, enjoin the employer from further employing individuals in this state or continuing in business therein until the employer has complied with ORS 657.507.

      (2) Upon filing of a suit for such purpose by the director, the court shall set a day for hearing and shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the employer. The hearing shall be not less than five days from the service of the notice. [1959 c.598 §8; 1967 c.435 §7; 1983 c.508 §11]

 

      657.509 Taxes from political subdivisions and people’s utility districts; election; effect of canceling election; applicability of noncharging provisions. (1) Instead of the amount to be paid into the fund under provisions of ORS 657.505 (6), a political subdivision may elect to pay taxes in accordance with the provisions of ORS 657.430 and 657.480. The election shall be on forms prescribed by the Director of the Employment Department and must be filed within the 30-day period following the close of the calendar quarter in which the political subdivision became an employer. An employer failing to submit a timely notice of election under this section shall be liable under provisions of ORS 657.505 (6) for a minimum of two calendar years. Thereafter such employer may file a written election to pay taxes. Such election must be filed by January 31 of the calendar year for which the election is to be effective. The director may for good cause extend the period within which an election must be filed for an additional 30 days.

      (2) An election shall continue until canceled but shall be for a period of not less than two calendar years. An employer may cancel such election by filing with the director a written notice of its intention to cancel by January 31 of the year in which the cancellation is to be effective. The director may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of cancellation may be filed for an additional 30 days. Once a cancellation is effective, the political subdivision must pay amounts in accordance with ORS 657.505 (6) for two calendar years before it is again eligible to elect payment under this section.

      (3) All noncharging provisions of this chapter shall apply to political subdivisions electing to pay taxes under this section, except that with respect to ORS 657.327, one-half of extended benefits applicable to a political subdivision paying taxes under this section shall be charged to the political subdivision.

      (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, any political subdivision may elect to pay taxes or cancel a tax election effective January 1, 1978, if such election or notice of cancellation is filed by January 31, 1978. The director may for good cause extend the period for filing an election for an additional 30 days. [1973 c.715 §5; 1975 c.156 §3; 1977 c.446 §8; 1989 c.609 §4]

 

      657.510 Refunds. If not later than three years after the date on which any contributions, interest, fines or penalties were paid pursuant to this 1965 Act, an employer who has paid such contributions, interest, fines or penalties makes application for an adjustment thereof in connection with subsequent contributions, interest, fine or penalty payments, or for a refund thereof because such adjustment cannot be made, and the Director of the Employment Department determines that such contributions, interest, fines or penalties, or any portion thereof were collected erroneously, the director shall allow such employer to make an adjustment of the amount erroneously paid, without interest, in connection with subsequent contributions, interest, fine or penalty payments by the employer or, if such adjustment cannot be made, the director shall refund said amount, without interest, from the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund or from the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund, as applicable; provided that the director shall not allow any adjustment in connection with subsequent contributions for amounts of interest, fines or penalty payments collected or received subsequent to July 1, 1965, nor shall the director refund any such payment from the fund except that the director may refund any such payment from the interest, fine and penalty collected after such date which are temporarily in the fund for clearance pending transfer to the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund. For like cause and within the same period, adjustment or refund from the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund, as appropriate, may be so made on the director’s own initiative. Refunds of contributions pursuant to ORS 657.065 (1) shall be refunded by the director from the fund without application. When refunds of contributions are made pursuant to ORS 657.065 (1), refunds of fines, penalties and interest, if any, shall be made from the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund without application.

      657.513 Political subdivision contribution payments from Local Government Employer Benefit Trust Fund. (1) A political subdivision required to make payments into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund under ORS 657.505 may request the Director of the Employment Department to pay on behalf of the political subdivision such amounts as the political subdivision is required to pay into the fund. The employer may request the director to pay on its behalf such amounts as the political subdivision is required to pay into the fund. This request must be filed with the director by January 31 of any year in order to be effective July 1 of that year.

      (2) A request shall continue until canceled but shall be for a period of not less than two years. A political subdivision may cancel its request by filing a written notice of its intention to cancel with the director by January 31 of the year in which the cancellation is to be effective. A cancellation shall be effective only on June 30 of a year. The political subdivision shall be responsible for paying into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund any amounts paid out to claimants after the effective date of a cancellation and attributable to base period wages paid by the political subdivision during a period it was subject to the provisions of ORS 293.701, 294.725 to 294.755, 657.505 or this section.

      (3) The director may for good cause extend the period within which a request or cancellation of a request must be filed for an additional 30 days.

      (4) The director shall pay into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund from the Local Government Employer Benefit Trust Fund such amounts of benefits that are paid to claimants during the period the political subdivision is a participant in the Local Government Employer Benefit Trust Fund created by ORS 294.730. Benefits paid to claimants during a period when the political subdivision is not a participant shall be reimbursed directly to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund by the political subdivision.

      657.515 Delinquent taxes; interest; civil penalties; collection by civil action; settlement. (1) If an employer defaults with respect to any payment required to be made by the employer to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, the taxes at any time due, together with interest thereon and penalties, shall be collected by the Director of the Employment Department in a civil action against such employer brought in the name of the director and judgment rendered thereon shall bear interest at the rate provided in subsection (2) of this section. Such employer’s compliance with this chapter, requiring payments to be made to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, shall date from the time said money was collected. The amount of taxes collected shall be paid into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund. The amount of interest and penalties collected pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund in accordance with the provisions of ORS 657.830 (3).

      (2) Interest upon the amount due from an employer shall be paid and shall be collected, at the same time payment of taxes is required to be made by such employer to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from the date prescribed for the payment to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund. In computing such interest, a fraction of a month shall be counted as a full month.

      (3) If any employer fails to make payment of taxes required by this chapter at the time prescribed by the director for the payment thereof, such employer shall be in default.

      (4) If any employer who is in default with respect to payment of any taxes fails to make payment thereof within 10 days after written demand therefor has been made by the director, such employer shall be subject, in the discretion of the director, to a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of such taxes. A demand for payment shall be deemed to have been made when deposited in the mail addressed to such employer at the employer’s last-known address as shown by the records of the director.

      (5) If any part of any deficiency is due to fraud with intent to avoid payment of taxes to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, then 50 percent of the total amount of the deficiency, in addition to such deficiency, shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as if it were a deficiency and shall be paid into the Employment Department Special Administrative Fund pursuant to this section and ORS 657.822.

      (6) Civil actions brought in the name of the director under this section to collect taxes, interest or penalties from an employer, shall be entitled to preference upon the calendar over all civil cases which involve only private parties.

      (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if the director finds that the total interest collectible on any delinquent account is in excess of 25 percent of the principal and that an employer or former employer, who no longer conducts an active business, has insufficient net assets to pay the full amount of all taxes, interest or penalties that may be due and where such employer or former employer can pay some but not all of such amount, the director may agree to accept any amount the director finds reasonable under the circumstances, as consideration for the settlement of the full amount of taxes, interest or penalties due. Whenever such an agreement is made a written record signed by the director shall be maintained in the files of the director. Such records shall set forth:

      (a) The name of the taxpayer against whom the liability was assessed;

      (b) The amount of the assessed liability;

      (c) The amount of the liability paid;

      (d) The amount of the liability canceled or waived;

      (e) A sworn statement of the taxpayer or personal representative setting forth the complete financial responsibility of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s estate, and containing a full disclosure of all matters bearing upon the ability of the taxpayer or estate to pay the full amount of the liability assessed; and

      (f) The written recommendation of an assistant to the Attorney General assigned to the director that the liability be reduced in the amount shown by the record.

      (8) A full and true copy of the record of each such agreement and settlement as provided in subsection (7) of this section shall be filed by the director with the Secretary of State as a public record.

      (9) The amount of any settlement reached pursuant to this section shall be first credited to the taxes due from such employer until the principal amount of taxes due has been satisfied and shall be deposited in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund.

      (a) Waive, reduce or compromise any tax balance of $10 or less;

      (b) Retain any tax overpayment of $10 or less; or

      (c) Waive, reduce or compromise any part or all of the tax interest and tax penalties provided by this chapter.

      (2) The director may determine that the amount of tax, interest and penalty due and unpaid on a delinquent tax account is uncollectible, and write such amount off, if:

      (a) The delinquent amount has been reduced to the status of a lien or judgment under the provisions of this chapter and such lien or judgment has expired; or

      (b) The taxpayer no longer has an active business in Oregon and has not had an active business within the three most recently completed calendar years, and there is little or no likelihood of recovering the amount due.

      (3) In making the determination that an account is uncollectible, the director shall consider, among other factors:

      (a) The administrative costs of continued collection efforts in relation to the amount due;

      (b) The accessibility of the taxpayer for effective collection actions; and

      (c) The taxpayer’s financial condition and ability to pay the amount due, both current and projected.

      (4) A record shall be made showing the reasons for waiving, reducing, compromising or writing off amounts under this section. Such record shall be retained for a period of seven years from the date the account was written off. [1969 c.57 §2; 1981 c.5 §5; 1983 c.54 §1]

 

      657.520 Claims for contribution preferred. All contributions, interest charges, penalties or amounts due the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund from any employer under this chapter and all judgments recovered by the Director of the Employment Department against any employer under this chapter shall be given the same priority as taxes and shall be deemed preferred to all general claims in all bankruptcy proceedings, trustee proceedings, proceedings for the administration of estates, receiverships and assignments for the benefits of creditors involving the employer liable therefor or the property of such employer.

      (a) A person that is solely a minority shareholder in a corporation;

      (b) A member of a manager-managed limited liability company; and

      (c) Has one or more of the same:

(1) An application for hearing under ORS 657.480, 657.679, 657.681 or 657.682 shall be in writing and shall state that a determination or assessment of the Director of the Employment Department or authorized representative is unjust or incorrect and that the employing unit requests a hearing. The application shall set forth the objections of the employing unit to the determination or assessment and the amount of contributions, if any, that the applicant admits to be due to the Employment Department. An application for a hearing to review an assessment made under ORS 657.681 (4) that was accompanied by a demand for a bond or deposit is not valid unless the bond or deposit is filed with the application in a form acceptable to the director or authorized representative.

      (2) If a valid application for hearing is filed within the time provided by ORS 657.480, 657.679, 657.681 or 657.682, an administrative law judge shall review the determination or assessment and if requested by the employing unit shall grant a hearing unless a hearing has previously been afforded the employing unit on the same grounds as set forth in the application. The administrative law judge shall give notice of the time and place of the hearing to the director or authorized representative and shall also give notice to the employing unit by mail directed to the last-known address of the employing unit of record with the director.

      (3) Hearings under ORS 657.480, 657.679, 657.681 or 657.682 shall be conducted in accordance with this chapter. The filing of an application for hearing with respect to a disputed assessment does not affect the right of the director or authorized representative to perfect any liens provided by this chapter.

      (4) All testimony at any hearing held under ORS 657.480, 657.679, 657.681 or 657.682 shall be recorded but need not be transcribed unless a petition for judicial review from the decision of the administrative law judge is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed. At any hearing held as provided in ORS 657.480, 657.679, 657.681 or 657.682, the determination or assessment of the director or authorized representative shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the protesting employing unit to prove that it is incorrect. Thereafter the administrative law judge shall enter the findings of fact and decision, either affirming, modifying, or setting aside the determination or assessment of the director or authorized representative and in the case of an assessment, the administrative law judge may increase or decrease the amount of the assessment. The employing unit and the director shall be promptly notified of the decision of the administrative law judge.

      (5) A decision of the administrative law judge becomes final on the date of notification or the mailing of the decision to the director and to the employing unit at the last-known address of record with the director unless, within the time specified in ORS 183.480 (2), the administrative law judge on the administrative law judge’s own motion reviews the decision and issues an amended decision in which case the amended decision becomes the final decision. [1963 c.354 §4 (657.552, 657.652, 657.679, 657.681 and 657.683 enacted in lieu of 657.472, 657.512, 657.550 and 657.672); 1967 c.435 §9; 1971 c.734 §98; 1999 c.849 §§150,151; 2003 c.75 §55; 2005 c.214 §3; 2007 c.49 §1]

Judicial review of decisions under ORS 657.683 shall be as provided for review of orders in contested cases in ORS chapter 183, except that the petition shall be filed within 20 days after the order is final. The Director of the Employment Department may file petition for judicial review in accordance with this section from decision of the administrative law judge. When judicial review is upon an assessment or assessments made pursuant to ORS 657.681 and the court determines the assessment or assessments are valid, judgment shall be given in favor of the director for the amount due as determined by the court.

Whenever the unemployment insurance laws of other states provide for inclusion of out-of-state payment of wages in computing wages paid in like manner as provided in ORS 657.095 (2), the Director of the Employment Department may enter into agreements with those empowered to administer the unemployment insurance laws of such other states for the purpose of:

      (1) Waiving the further collection of payroll taxes in all the states when the aggregate amount of said wages is in excess of “payroll” as defined in ORS 657.095 (1); and

      (2) Securing uniformity for payroll reporting on such out-of-state work. [Amended by 1955 c.655 §24; 1973 c.300 §13; 1973 c.810 §3]

 

      657.770 Reciprocal agreements concerning wages used as basis for benefits. (1) The Director of the Employment Department may enter into reciprocal arrangements with appropriate and duly authorized agencies of other states or of the federal government, or both, whereby wages, upon the basis of which an individual may become entitled to benefits under an employment security law of another state or of the federal government, shall be deemed to be wages for insured work for the purpose of determining benefits under this chapter. Wages for insured work, on the basis of which an individual may become entitled to benefits under this chapter, shall be deemed to be wages on the basis of which unemployment insurance is payable under such law of another state or of the federal government.

      (2) No such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains provision for reimbursement to the fund for such of the benefits paid under this chapter on the basis of such wages and provision for reimbursement from the fund for such benefits paid under such other law on the basis of wages for insured work, as the director finds will be fair and reasonable to all affected interests.

      (3) Reimbursements paid from the fund pursuant to this section are deemed to be benefits for the purposes of this chapter. However, no charge shall be made to an employer’s account under ORS 657.471 in excess of the maximum benefits payable under ORS 657.150 or when no benefits would have been payable to an individual but for this section, because of the lack of wages for insured work necessary to qualify for benefits.

      (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the director shall participate in any arrangements for the payment of compensation on the basis of combining an individual’s wages and employment covered under this chapter with wages and employment covered under the unemployment insurance laws of other states that are approved by the United States Secretary of Labor in consultation with the state unemployment insurance agencies as reasonably calculated to ensure the prompt and full payment of compensation in such situations and that include provisions for:

      (a) Applying the base period of a single state law to a claim involving the combining of an individual’s wages and employment covered under two or more state unemployment insurance laws; and

      (b) Avoiding the duplicate use of wages and employment by reason of such combining. [Amended by 1957 c.699 §11; 1971 c.463 §19; 2005 c.22 §463]

 

      657.775 Cooperation with other states on reciprocal basis for collection of contributions. (1) The courts of the State of Oregon shall recognize and enforce the liability for unemployment insurance contributions imposed by other states which extend a like comity to this state, and officials of such other states may initiate civil proceedings in the courts of this state to enforce the collection of such contributions. The certificate of the Secretary of State of such other states that such officials have the authority to collect the contributions is conclusive evidence of such authority.

      (2) The Attorney General is empowered to initiate and prosecute civil proceedings in the courts of other states by and in the name of the Director of the Employment Department to enforce the liability for unemployment insurance contributions imposed by the State of Oregon, and may also initiate and prosecute civil proceedings in this state as agent for and on behalf of any other state to enforce liability for unemployment insurance contributions due such state if the state extends a like comity to the State of Oregon. The compensation for the services of the Attorney General rendered on behalf of other states under this section shall be paid from moneys appropriated to the Employment Department for administrative expenditures. The compensation for similar officers of other states for services rendered on behalf of this state under this section shall be paid by such other state. However, all other expenses of civil proceedings under this section shall be paid by the state, officer or agency thereof at whose request such proceedings were initiated.

      (3) The Attorney General, with the approval of the director, may employ a special assistant under ORS 180.140 (5) to initiate and prosecute civil proceedings in other states to enforce liability for unemployment contributions imposed by the State of Oregon and nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the officials of other states from employing any member of the Oregon State Bar to initiate and prosecute civil proceedings in this state to enforce liability for unemployment insurance imposed by such other states.

      (4) As used in this section, “contributions” includes interest and penalties imposed pursuant to an unemployment insurance statute. [1963 c.453 §2; 1983 c.740 §247]

 

      657.780 Agreements with governmental agencies to withhold benefits for child support obligations; rules. (1) As used in this section, “appropriate agency” means an agency authorized to enforce child support obligations pursuant to a plan approved under part D of title IV of the Social Security Act.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 657.855, the Director of the Employment Department may enter into agreements with the appropriate agency of this state whereby child support obligations which are being enforced pursuant to a plan approved under section 454 of the Social Security Act and owed by an individual who is eligible for unemployment compensation may be met, in whole or in part, by withholding from the unemployment compensation due the individual the amount specified by the individual to the appropriate agency to be withheld or the amount determined pursuant to an agreement with the individual submitted to the appropriate agency or any amount otherwise required to be withheld pursuant to ORS 25.378 and 25.414 and forwarding of the amount so withheld to the appropriate agency.

      (3) Any amount deducted and withheld under subsection (2) of this section shall for all purposes be treated as if it were paid to the individual as unemployment compensation.

      (4) This section shall apply only if appropriate arrangements have been made for reimbursement, by the appropriate agency or agencies involved, for the administrative costs incurred by the Employment Department under this section.

      (5) The director shall prescribe such rules as are deemed necessary with respect to implementation and administration of procedures to comply with the provisions of this section. [1982 s.s.1 c.30 §9; 1991 c.115 §1; 1993 c.798 §49]
