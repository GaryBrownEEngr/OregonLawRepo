PURPOSE AND POLICY

 

      659A.003 Purpose of ORS chapter 659A. The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the fullest utilization of the available workforce by removing arbitrary standards of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age or disability as a barrier to employment of the inhabitants of this state, and to ensure the human dignity of all people within this state and protect their health, safety and morals from the consequences of intergroup hostility, tensions and practices of unlawful discrimination of any kind based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age, disability or familial status. To accomplish this purpose, the Legislative Assembly intends by this chapter to provide:

      (1) A program of public education calculated to eliminate attitudes upon which practices of unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age, disability or familial status are based.

      (2) An adequate remedy for persons aggrieved by certain acts of unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, disability or familial status, or unreasonable acts of discrimination in employment based upon age.

      (3) An adequate administrative machinery for the orderly resolution of complaints of unlawful discrimination through a procedure involving investigation, conference, conciliation and persuasion, to encourage the use in good faith of the machinery by all parties to a complaint of unlawful discrimination and to discourage unilateral action that makes moot the outcome of final administrative or judicial determination on the merits of the complaint. [Formerly 659.022; 2005 c.22 §467; 2007 c.100 §2; 2007 c.903 §1a]

      659A.006 Declaration of policy against unlawful discrimination; opportunity to obtain employment without unlawful discrimination recognized as a civil right; exception of religious group. (1) It is declared to be the public policy of Oregon that practices of unlawful discrimination against any of its inhabitants because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age, disability or familial status are a matter of state concern and that this discrimination not only threatens the rights and privileges of its inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state.

      (2) The opportunity to obtain employment or housing or to use and enjoy places of public accommodation without unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age or disability hereby is recognized as and declared to be a civil right.

      (3) It is not an unlawful practice for a bona fide church or other religious institution to take any action with respect to housing or the use of facilities based on a bona fide religious belief about sexual orientation as long as the housing or the use of facilities is closely connected with or related to the primary purposes of the church or institution and is not connected with a commercial or business activity that has no necessary relationship to the church or institution.

      (4) It is not an unlawful employment practice for a bona fide church or other religious institution, including but not limited to a school, hospital or church camp, to prefer an employee, or an applicant for employment, of one religious sect or persuasion over another if:

      (a) The religious sect or persuasion to which the employee or applicant belongs is the same as that of the church or institution;

      (b) In the opinion of the church or institution, the preference will best serve the purposes of the church or institution; and

      (a) In employment positions directly related to the operation of a church or other place of worship, such as clergy, religious instructors and support staff;

      (b) In employment positions in a nonprofit religious school, nonprofit religious camp, nonprofit religious day care center, nonprofit religious thrift store, nonprofit religious bookstore, nonprofit religious radio station or nonprofit religious shelter; or

      (c) In other employment positions that involve religious activities, as long as the employment involved is closely connected with or related to the primary purposes of the church or institution and is not connected with a commercial or business activity that has no necessary relationship to the church or institution. [Formerly 659.020; 2007 c.100 §3; 2007 c.903 §2]

 

      659A.009 Declaration of policy against discrimination in employment because of age. It is declared to be the public policy of Oregon that the available workforce should be utilized to the fullest extent possible. To this end, the abilities of an individual, and not any arbitrary standards that discriminate against an individual solely because of age, should be the measure of the individual’s fitness and qualification for employment. [Formerly 659.015; 2005 c.22 §468]

 

      659A.012 State agencies to carry out policy against discrimination in employment; evaluation of supervisors; affirmative action reports. (1) To achieve the public policy of the State of Oregon for persons in the state to attain employment and advancement without discrimination because of race, religion, color, sex, marital status, national origin, disability or age, every state agency shall be required to include in the evaluation of all management personnel the manager’s or supervisor’s effectiveness in achieving affirmative action objectives as a key consideration of the manager’s or supervisor’s performance.

      (2) To achieve the public policy of the State of Oregon for persons in the state to attain employment and advancement without discrimination because of race, religion, color, sex, marital status, national origin, age or disability, every state agency shall be required to present the affirmative action objectives and performance of that agency of the current biennium and those for the following biennium to the Governor of the State of Oregon and to the Legislative Assembly. These plans shall be reviewed as part of the budget review process. [Formerly 659.025]

 

      659A.015 Affirmative action reports to include information on contracts to minority businesses. In carrying out the policy of affirmative action, every state agency shall include in its affirmative action reports under ORS 659A.012 information concerning its awards of construction, service and personal service contracts awarded to minority businesses. [Formerly 659.027]

 

UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, NATIONAL ORIGIN, MARITAL STATUS OR AGE

 

      659A.029 “Because of sex” defined for ORS 659A.030. For purposes of ORS 659A.030, the phrase “because of sex” includes, but is not limited to, because of pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions or occurrences. Women affected by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions or occurrences shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work by reason of physical condition, and nothing in this section shall be interpreted to permit otherwise. [Formerly 659.029]

 

      659A.030 Discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age or expunged juvenile record prohibited. (1) It is an unlawful employment practice:

      (a) For an employer, because of an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older, or because of the race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age of any other person with whom the individual associates, or because of an individual’s juvenile record that has been expunged pursuant to ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262, to refuse to hire or employ the individual or to bar or discharge the individual from employment. However, discrimination is not an unlawful employment practice if the discrimination results from a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the employer’s business.

      (b) For an employer, because of an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older, or because of the race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age of any other person with whom the individual associates, or because of an individual’s juvenile record that has been expunged pursuant to ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262, to discriminate against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.

      (c) For a labor organization, because of an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older, or because of an individual’s juvenile record that has been expunged pursuant to ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262, to exclude or to expel from its membership the individual or to discriminate in any way against the individual or any other person.

      (d) For any employer or employment agency to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publication, or to use any form of application for employment or to make any inquiry in connection with prospective employment that expresses directly or indirectly any limitation, specification or discrimination as to an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older, or on the basis of an expunged juvenile record, or any intent to make any such limitation, specification or discrimination, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification. Identification of prospective employees according to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age does not violate this section unless the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries, after a hearing conducted pursuant to ORS 659A.805, determines that the designation expresses an intent to limit, specify or discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age.

      (e) For an employment agency, because of an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older, or because of the race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age of any other person with whom the individual associates, or because of an individual’s juvenile record that has been expunged pursuant to ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262, to classify or refer for employment, or to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate against the individual. However, it is not an unlawful employment practice for an employment agency to classify or refer for employment an individual when the classification or referral results from a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the employer’s business.

      (f) For any person to discharge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any other person because that other person has opposed any unlawful practice, or because that other person has filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under this chapter or has attempted to do so.

The commissioner shall administer this section with respect to apprentices under ORS 660.002 to 660.210 equally with regard to all employees and labor organizations.

      (3) The compulsory retirement of employees required by law at any age is not an unlawful employment practice if lawful under federal law.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “responsible for a minor child” means having custody or legal guardianship of a minor child or acting in loco parentis to the child.

      (5) This section does not prohibit an employer from enforcing an otherwise valid dress code or policy, as long as the employer provides, on a case-by-case basis, for reasonable accommodation of an individual based on the health and safety needs of the individual.

      (a) The employer does not allow an employee to use vacation leave, or other leave available to the employee, for the purpose of allowing the employee to engage in the religious observance or practices of the employee; and

      (b) Reasonably accommodating use of the leave by the employee will not impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.

      (a) The employer imposes an occupational requirement that restricts the ability of an employee to wear religious clothing in accordance with the employee’s sincerely held religious beliefs, to take time off for a holy day or to take time off to participate in a religious observance or practice;

      (b) Reasonably accommodating those activities does not impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section; and

      (c) The activities have only a temporary or tangential impact on the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the employee’s job.

      (4) A reasonable accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer for the purposes of this section if the accommodation requires significant difficulty or expense. For the purpose of determining whether an accommodation requires significant difficulty or expense, the following factors shall be considered:

      (a) The nature and the cost of the accommodation needed.

      (f) The degree to which an accommodation may constrain the obligation of a school district, education service district or public charter school to maintain a religiously neutral work environment.

      (5) A reasonable accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer for the purposes of this section if the accommodation would constrain the legal obligation of a school district, education service district or public charter school to:

      (a) Maintain religious neutrality in the school environment; or

      (b) Refrain from endorsing religion. [2009 c.744 §2; 2010 c.105 §1]

UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

 

      659A.103 Policy. (1) It is declared to be the public policy of Oregon to guarantee individuals the fullest possible participation in the social and economic life of the state, to engage in remunerative employment, to use and enjoy places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, to participate in and receive the benefits of the services, programs and activities of state government and to secure housing accommodations of their choice, without discrimination on the basis of disability.

      (2) The guarantees expressed in subsection (1) of this section are hereby declared to be the policy of the State of Oregon to protect, and ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145 shall be construed to effectuate such policy. [Formerly 659.405; 2003 c.254 §2; 2007 c.70 §290; 2009 c.508 §4]

 

      659A.104 Description of disability for purposes of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145. (1) An individual has a disability for the purposes of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145 if the individual meets any one of the following criteria:

      (a) The individual has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual.

      (b) The individual has a record of having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual. For the purposes of this paragraph, an individual has a record of having a physical or mental impairment if the individual has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual.

      (c) The individual is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual. For the purposes of this paragraph:

      (A) An individual is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment if the individual has been subjected to an action prohibited under ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity of the individual.

      (B) An individual is not regarded as having a physical or mental impairment if the individual has an impairment that is minor and that has an actual or expected duration of six months or less.

      (2) Activities and functions that are considered major life activities for the purpose of determining if an individual has a disability include but are not limited to:

      (a) Caring for oneself;

      (b) Performing manual tasks;

      (c) Seeing;

      (d) Hearing;

      (e) Eating;

      (f) Sleeping;

      (g) Walking;

      (h) Standing;

      (i) Lifting;

      (j) Bending;

      (k) Speaking;

      (L) Breathing;

      (m) Learning;

      (n) Reading;

      (o) Concentrating;

      (p) Thinking;

      (q) Communicating;

      (r) Working;

      (s) Socializing;

      (t) Sitting;

      (u) Reaching;

      (v) Interacting with others;

      (w) Employment;

      (x) Ambulation;

      (y) Transportation;

      (z) Operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to:

      (A) Functions of the immune system;

      (B) Normal cell growth; and

      (C) Digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine and reproductive functions; and

      (aa) Ability to acquire, rent or maintain property.

      (3) An individual is substantially limited in a major life activity if the individual has an impairment, had an impairment or is perceived as having an impairment that restricts one or more major life activities of the individual as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity of the individual need not limit other major life activities of the individual. An impairment that is episodic or in remission is considered to substantially limit a major life activity of the individual if the impairment would substantially limit a major life activity of the individual when the impairment is active. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section.

      (4) When determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity of an individual, the determination shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, including:

      (a) Medication;

      (b) Medical supplies, equipment or appliances;

      (c) Low vision devices or other devices that magnify, enhance or otherwise augment a visual image, except that ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses or other similar lenses that are intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error may be considered when determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity of an individual;

      (d) Prosthetics, including limbs and devices;

      (e) Hearing aids, cochlear implants or other implantable hearing devices;

      (f) Mobility devices;

      (g) Oxygen therapy equipment or supplies;

      (h) Assistive technology;

      (i) Reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids or services; or

      (j) Learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications.

      (5) Nothing in subsection (4)(c) of this section authorizes an employer to use qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria based on an individual’s uncorrected vision unless the standard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the employer, are shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. [2009 c.508 §2; 2013 c.105 §1]

 

      659A.106 Employers to whom ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 apply. The requirements of ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 apply only to employers who employ six or more persons. The requirements of ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 do not apply to the Oregon National Guard. [2001 c.621 §23; 2011 c.210 §1]

 

      659A.109 Discrimination against individual for using procedures in ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145 prohibited. It is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an individual with respect to hire or tenure or any term or condition of employment because the individual has applied for benefits or invoked or used the procedures provided for in ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145 or has given testimony under the provisions of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145. [Formerly 659.410; 2009 c.508 §5]

 

      659A.112 Employment discrimination. (1) It is an unlawful employment practice for any employer to refuse to hire, employ or promote, to bar or discharge from employment or to discriminate in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis of disability.

      (2) An employer violates subsection (1) of this section if the employer does any of the following:

      (a) The employer limits, segregates or classifies a job applicant or employee in a way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of the applicant or employee because the applicant or employee has a disability.

      (b) The employer participates in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting a qualified job applicant or employee with a disability to the discrimination prohibited by ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139, including but not limited to participating in a relationship with an employment or referral agency, a labor union, an organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the employer, or an organization providing training and apprenticeship programs.

      (c) The employer utilizes standards, criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability, or that perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative control.

      (d) The employer excludes or otherwise denies equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because the individual is known to have a relationship or association with an individual with a disability.

      (e) The employer does not make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability who is a job applicant or employee, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer.

      (f) The employer denies employment opportunities to a job applicant or employee who is a qualified individual with a disability, if the denial is based on the need of the employer to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental impairments of the employee or applicant.

      (g) The employer uses qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria, including those based on an individual’s uncorrected vision or unaided hearing, that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities unless the standard, test or other selection criterion, as used by the employer, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.

      (h) The employer fails to select and administer tests relating to employment in the most effective manner to ensure that when the test is administered to a job applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the skills, aptitude or other characteristics of the applicant or employee that the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills of the employee or applicant. The provisions of this paragraph do not limit the ability of an employer to select or administer tests designed to measure sensory, manual or speaking skills of an employee or job applicant. [Formerly 659.436; 2007 c.70 §291; 2009 c.508 §6]

 

      659A.115 Qualification for position. For the purposes of ORS 659A.112, an individual is qualified for a position if the individual, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. For the purpose of determining the essential functions of the position, due consideration shall be given to the employer’s determination as to the essential functions of a position. If an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for a job, the position description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job. [Formerly 659.437; 2007 c.70 §292; 2009 c.508 §7]

 

      659A.118 Reasonable accommodation. (1) For the purposes of ORS 659A.112, reasonable accommodation may include:

      (a) Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.

      (b) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules or reassignment to a vacant position.

      (c) Acquisition or modification of equipment or devices.

      (d) Appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, training materials or policies.

      (e) The provision of qualified readers or interpreters.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145, an employer may not be found to have engaged in an unlawful employment practice solely because the employer fails to provide reasonable accommodation to an individual with a disability arising out of transsexualism.

      (3) An employer is not required to provide a reasonable accommodation to an individual who satisfies the criteria for being an individual with a disability for the purposes of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145 solely because the individual meets the criterion described in ORS 659A.104 (1)(c). [Formerly 659.439; 2007 c.70 §293; 2009 c.508 §8]

 

      659A.121 Undue hardship. (1) For the purposes of ORS 659A.112, an accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer if the accommodation requires significant difficulty or expense.

      (2) For the purpose of determining whether an accommodation requires significant difficulty or expense, the following factors shall be considered:

      (a) The nature and the cost of the accommodation needed.

      (b) The overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the accommodation, the number of persons employed at the facility and the effect on expenses and resources or other impacts on the operation of the facility caused by the accommodation.

      (c) The overall financial resources of the employer, the overall size of the business of the employer with respect to the number of its employees and the number, type and location of the employer’s facilities.

      (d) The type of operations conducted by the employer, including the composition, structure and functions of the workforce of the employer and the geographic separateness and administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the employer. [Formerly 659.440]

 

      659A.122 Definitions for ORS 659A.124, 659A.127 and 659A.130. As used in this section and ORS 659A.124, 659A.127 and 659A.130:

[Formerly 659A.100]

 

      Note: 659A.122 was made a part of 659A.103 to 659A.145 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      659A.124 Illegal use of drugs. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, the protections of ORS 659A.112 do not apply to any job applicant or employee who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs if the employer takes action based on that conduct.

[Formerly 659.442; 2009 c.508 §9]

 

      659A.127 Permitted employer action. ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 do not affect the ability of an employer to do any of the following:

      (6) An employer may require that employees comply with all federal and state statutes and regulations regarding alcohol and the illegal use of drugs. [Formerly 659.444]

 

      659A.130 Conditions that do not constitute impairment. (1) For the purposes of ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139, homosexuality and bisexuality are not physical or mental impairments. An individual who is homosexual or bisexual does not have a disability for the purposes of ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 solely by reason of being homosexual or bisexual.

      (2) For the purposes of ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139, the following conditions are not physical or mental impairments, and an individual with one or more of the following conditions does not have a disability for the purposes of ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 solely by reason of that condition:

      659A.133 Medical examinations and inquiries of job applicants. (1) Except as provided in this section, an employer violates ORS 659A.112 if the employer conducts a medical examination of a job applicant, makes inquiries of a job applicant as to whether the applicant has a disability or makes inquiries as to the nature or severity of any disability of the applicant.

      (2) An employer may make inquiries into the ability of a job applicant to perform job-related functions.

      (3) An employer may require a medical examination after an offer of employment has been made to a job applicant and before the commencement of the employment duties of the applicant, and condition the employment on the results of the examination, if the following conditions are met:

      (a) All individuals entering the employ of the employer must be subject to the examination regardless of disability.

      (c) The results of an examination authorized under this subsection may only be used in the manner provided for in ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139. [Formerly 659.447; 2007 c.70 §295; 2009 c.508 §11]

 

      659A.136 Medical examinations and inquiries of employees. (1) Except as provided in this section, an employer may not require that an employee submit to a medical examination, may not make inquiries of an employee as to whether the employee has a disability, and may not make inquiries of an employee as to the nature or severity of any disability of the employee, unless the examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.

      (2) An employer may conduct voluntary medical examinations, including voluntary medical histories, that are part of an employee health program available to employees at that work site. An employer may make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.

      (3) Information obtained under subsection (2) of this section relating to the medical condition or history of any employee is subject to the same restrictions applicable to information acquired from medical examinations authorized under ORS 659A.133. [Formerly 659.448; 2007 c.70 §296; 2009 c.508 §12]

 

      659A.139 Construction of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145. (1) ORS 659A.103 to 659A.144 shall be construed to the extent possible in a manner that is consistent with any similar provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the federal ADA Amendments Act of 2008 and as otherwise amended.

      (2) The determination of whether an individual has a disability as provided in ORS 659A.104 (1) shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145. [Formerly 659.449; 2009 c.508 §13; 2013 c.740 §12]

 

      659A.141 Damages recoverable for harm or theft of assistance animal. (1) In addition to and not in lieu of any other penalty provided by state law, a person with a disability who uses an assistance animal or the owner of an assistance animal may bring an action for economic and noneconomic damages against any person who steals or, without provocation, attacks the assistance animal. The person with a disability or the owner may also bring an action for such damages against the owner of any animal that, without provocation, attacks an assistance animal. The action authorized by this subsection may be brought by the person with a disability or the owner even if the assistance animal was in the custody or under the supervision of another person when the theft or attack occurred.

      (2) If the theft of or unprovoked attack on an assistance animal described in subsection (1) of this section results in the death of the animal or the animal is not returned or if injuries sustained in the theft or attack prevent the animal from returning to service as an assistance animal, the measure of economic damages shall include, but need not be limited to, the replacement value of an equally trained assistance animal, without any differentiation for the age or the experience of the animal. In addition, the person with a disability or the owner may recover any other costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, costs of temporary replacement assistance services, whether provided by another assistance animal or a person, incurred as a result of the theft of or injury to the animal.

      (3) If the theft of or unprovoked attack on an assistance animal described in subsection (1) of this section results in injuries from which the animal recovers and returns to service, or if the animal is stolen but is recovered and returns to service, the measure of economic damages shall include, but need not be limited to, the veterinary medical expenses, costs of temporary replacement assistance services, whether provided by another assistance animal or a person, and any other costs and expenses incurred by the person with a disability or the owner as a result of the theft of or injury to the animal.

      (4) A cause of action does not arise under this section if the person with a disability, the owner or the person having custody or supervision of the assistance animal was committing a criminal or civil trespass at the time of the theft of or attack on the assistance animal.

      (5) The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff in an action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees and expert witness fees incurred by a defendant who prevails in the action if the court determines that the plaintiff had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting a claim or no objectively reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of a trial court.

      (6) As used in this section, “assistance animal” has the meaning given that term in ORS 659A.143. [Formerly 346.687]

 

      Note: 659A.141 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 659 by legislative action but was not added to ORS chapter 659A or any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      659A.142 Discrimination against individual with disability by employment agency, labor organization, place of public accommodation or state government prohibited; mental disorder treatment not evidence of inability to manage property. (1) As used in this section, “state government” has the meaning given that term in ORS 174.111.

      (2) It is an unlawful employment practice for an employment agency to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise discriminate against, any individual because that individual has a disability, or to classify or refer for employment any individual because that individual has a disability.

Any medical verification required under this subsection must be paid for by the covered employer. An employer may not require an employee to obtain the opinion of a second health care provider for the purpose of medical verification required under this subsection.

      (3) Subject to the approval of the health care provider, the employee taking family leave for a serious health condition of the employee or a family member of the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment or supervision at times that will minimize disruption of the employer’s operations. [Formerly 659.482]

      (a) Any accrual of seniority or employment benefits during a period of family leave; or

      (b) Any right, benefit or position of employment other than the rights, benefits and position that the employee would have been entitled to had the employee not taken the family leave.

      (4)(a) Before restoring an employee to a position under subsection (1) of this section, an employer may require that the employee receive certification from the employee’s health care provider that the employee is able to resume work.
