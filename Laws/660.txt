APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING

 

      660.002 Declaration of policy. It is the policy of the State of Oregon:

      (1) To encourage the development of an apprenticeship and training system through the voluntary cooperation of management, labor and interested state agencies, and in cooperation with other states and the federal government.

      (2) To provide for the establishment and promotion of standards of apprenticeship and training to safeguard the welfare of apprentices and trainees and ensure proper training of an adequate, skilled labor force.

      (3) To encourage the preparation of persons with skills that will enable them to find gainful employment in an ever-changing society and ensure the continued growth and development of the economy of Oregon by contributing to the maintenance of an adequate supply of skilled workers. [1957 c.270 §2; 1967 c.6 §2; 2007 c.620 §1]

 

      660.006 Application. (1) ORS 660.002 to 660.210 shall apply to persons, political subdivisions, employer associations, and organizations of employees that agree to conform to its provisions.

      (2) Nothing in ORS 660.002 to 660.210 is intended to supersede the civil service or merit systems applicable to state agencies and political subdivisions. Employees of state agencies and political subdivisions may be recognized and registered as apprentices, and may serve on apprenticeship committees when approved by the State Apprenticeship and Training Council in conformity with ORS 660.002 to 660.210. If an individual apprentice who is employed by a state agency or political subdivision wishes to participate in an apprenticeship and training program, the council may approve program standards that set forth a progressive wage within the salary structure range for journeyworker, employed by the state agency or political subdivision. [1957 c.270 §10(1); 1963 c.151 §3; 1967 c.6 §3; 1977 c.490 §1; 1981 c.764 §1; 2011 c.140 §1]

 

      660.010 Definitions for ORS 660.002 to 660.210. As used in ORS 660.002 to 660.210, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Apprentice” means a worker who is at least 16 years of age, except when a higher minimum age is otherwise required by law, and who is employed to learn an apprenticeable occupation under standards of apprenticeship approved by the State Apprenticeship and Training Council and under an apprenticeship agreement recognized by the council.

      (2) “Apprenticeable occupation” means a skilled trade that:

      (a) Is customarily learned in a practical way through a structured, systematic program of on-the-job supervised training;

      (b) Is clearly identified and commonly recognized throughout an industry;

      (c) Involves manual, mechanical or technical skills and knowledge that require a minimum of 2,000 hours of on-the-job supervised training; and

      (d) Requires related instruction to supplement the on-the-job training.

      (3) “Apprenticeship agreement” means a written agreement between an apprentice and either the apprentice’s program sponsor or the local joint committee acting as the agent for the program sponsor that contains the minimum terms and conditions of the employment and training of the apprentice.

      (4) “Course of study” means a course of study for the instruction of apprentices or trainees established in accordance with ORS 660.157.

      (5) “District school board” includes the boards of community college service districts, education service districts, common school districts and community college districts.

      (6) “Employer” means any person employing the services of an apprentice, regardless of whether the person is a party to an apprenticeship agreement with the apprentice.

      (7) “Journeyworker” means a worker who has attained a level of skill, abilities and competencies recognized within an industry as having mastered the skills and competencies required for the occupation.

      (8) “Local joint committee” includes local joint apprenticeship committees, local joint training committees and trade committees.

      (9) “Program” means the total system of apprenticeship as operated by a particular local joint committee, including the committee’s registered standards and all other terms and conditions for the qualification, recruitment, selection, employment and training of apprentices in that apprenticeable occupation.

      (10) “Trainee” means a worker who is at least 16 years of age, except when a higher minimum age is otherwise required by law, and who is to receive, in part consideration for services, complete instruction in an occupation that meets all the requirements of an apprenticeable occupation, except that such occupation requires, in the opinion of the council, less than 2,000 but not less than 1,000 hours of on-the-job supervised training.

      (11) “Training agent” means an employer that is registered with a local joint committee and the Apprenticeship and Training Division of the Bureau of Labor and Industries. [Amended by 1957 c.270 §3; 1963 c.151 §4; 1967 c.6 §1; 1971 c.271 §1; 1977 c.490 §2; 1981 c.764 §2; 2007 c.71 §215; 2007 c.620 §2; 2011 c.140 §2]

      660.020 Necessity for written agreement; transfer of agreement to another employer. (1) Every apprentice and either the apprentice’s program sponsor or the local joint committee shall sign a written apprenticeship agreement on a form approved by the State Apprenticeship and Training Council or on a form to which the council chairperson may grant interim approval. The agreement shall be signed and registered with the council as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the start of the apprenticeship.

      (2) When a training agent is unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations under an apprenticeship agreement, the local joint committee may approve the transfer of the training agent’s obligation under the program standards to a subsequent approved training agent under the same program, with the consent of the apprentice. In such cases, it is not necessary to sign and register a new apprenticeship agreement, notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (1) of this section. [Amended by 1955 c.719 §1; 1957 c.270 §4; 1967 c.6 §7; 1981 c.764 §3; 2007 c.620 §3; 2011 c.140 §3]

      (6) A statement that there is a probationary period of up to one year or 25 percent of the length of the program, whichever period is shorter, during which the apprenticeship agreement may be terminated by either party to the agreement upon written notice to the Apprenticeship and Training Division of the Bureau of Labor and Industries;

      (7) A statement that after the probationary period the apprenticeship agreement may be canceled at the request of the apprentice or may be suspended, canceled or terminated by the committee for good cause, which includes but is not limited to failure to report to work, nonattendance at related training, failure to submit work progress reports and lack of response to committee citations, with prior written notice to the apprentice, and with written notice to the apprentice and to the Apprenticeship and Training Division of the Bureau of Labor and Industries of the final action taken by the committee;

      (8) A statement that the transfer of an apprentice between apprenticeship programs or within an apprenticeship program must be based on an agreement between the transferring apprentice and the affected apprenticeship committees or program sponsors that includes requirements that:

      (a) The transferring apprentice must be provided a transcript of records of related instruction and on-the-job learning by the transferring apprenticeship committee or program sponsor;

      (10) A waiver by the apprentice granting permission for the release of related training school records to the appropriate joint apprenticeship committee for the purpose of evaluation. [Amended by 1955 c.719 §3; 1957 c.270 §6; 1967 c.6 §9; 1981 c.764 §4; 1985 c.98 §2; 2007 c.620 §4; 2011 c.140 §4]

      (b) A minimum of four years of experience in workforce development or investment activities, vocational training or education, apprenticeship program administration or a related discipline.

      (3)(a) Each member shall be appointed for a term of four years and shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified. When the term of a member expires, the Governor shall appoint a successor within 90 days after the term expiration date. A member may not automatically be removed from the council in midterm should the member’s industry withdraw from the program for economic reasons.

      (b) Any vacancy occurring among the appointed members shall be filled by appointment, as provided in this section, for the unexpired portion of the term.

      (c) All appointments of members of the council by the Governor are subject to confirmation by the Senate pursuant to section 4, Article III, Oregon Constitution.

      (4) The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries shall serve as the chairperson of the council with the power to cast the deciding vote in case of a tie. The council shall choose from among its members a vice chairperson to preside at meetings and perform other functions of the chairperson when the commissioner is absent.

      (5) Each member of the council is entitled to compensation and expenses as provided in ORS 292.495. [Amended by 1955 c.719 §6; 1967 c.6 §10; 1969 c.314 §71; 1973 c.792 §31; 1981 c.764 §5; 1983 c.318 §1; 1985 c.98 §3; 2007 c.620 §5]

      660.115 [1963 c.645 §3; 1967 c.6 §12; repealed by 1981 c.764 §20]

 

      660.120 Duties and powers of council and division; rules. (1) The State Apprenticeship and Training Council, under the direction of the Apprenticeship and Training Division of the Bureau of Labor and Industries, shall enforce the provisions of ORS 660.002 to 660.210 in order to carry out the intent and purposes of those provisions. The State Director of Apprenticeship and Training, the division and the council may conduct investigations, issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, obtain evidence, administer oaths and take testimony in all matters relating to the council’s duties and functions as set forth in ORS 660.002 to 660.210 when the information sought is relevant to a lawful investigative purpose and is reasonable in scope. The council and the division shall adopt rules for gathering information through subpoenas or testimony. The rules must include procedures through which a party may object to providing information. After being served with a subpoena, if a person refuses, without reasonable cause, to be examined, to answer any question or to produce any document or other thing as required by the subpoena, the director, the division or the council may petition the circuit court in the county in which the investigation is pending for an order directing the person to show cause why the person has not complied with the subpoena and should not be held in contempt. The director, division or council shall serve the court’s order upon the person in the manner provided by ORCP 55 D. If the person fails to show cause for the noncompliance, the court shall order the person to comply with the subpoena within such time as the court shall direct and may hold the person in contempt.

      (2) The division, on behalf of the council, may bring suit in a court of proper jurisdiction in the name of the Bureau of Labor and Industries, or in the name of an apprentice on behalf of the apprentice, through the district attorney or the Attorney General.

      (3) The council and the division may adopt rules that are reasonably necessary to enforce and administer ORS 660.002 to 660.210. In adopting the rules, the council and the division shall comply with ORS chapter 183. In addition, if the council and the division find that it would be impractical for a number or all of the local joint committees in the state to develop criteria concerning a particular matter, the council and the division may adopt rules on the matter. The rules shall govern on that matter except to the extent that a local joint committee’s approved standards contain exceptions.

      (4) The council and the division also shall:

      (a) Establish policy of the program so as to encourage the promotion, expansion and improvement of programs of apprenticeship and training;

      (b) Approve and register program standards and modifications to program standards that are submitted by appropriate local joint committees as provided in ORS 660.126, if the standards and modifications are in substantial conformity with the statewide standards approved under ORS 660.155;

      (c) Establish committees and approve nominations of members and alternates to local joint committees and state joint committees to ensure balanced representation of employer and employee groups;

      (d) Deregister standards and terminate entire programs, and remove any or all members of any committee, for inactivity or inadequate activity, or for failure to abide by the provisions of ORS 660.002 to 660.210 or by the rules and policies of the council and the division;

      (e) Cooperate with interested state and federal agencies, including the Department of Education, the State Workforce and Talent Development Board and other providers of related training and curriculum such as community college districts, community college service districts, education service districts and recognized industry programs; and

      (f) Perform such other functions and duties as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of ORS 660.002 to 660.210.

      (5) The council shall hold at least four regular public meetings each year. Executive sessions shall be held on call of the chairperson, or at the written request of a majority of the members of the council. [Amended by 1955 c.719 §7; 1957 c.270 §7; 1967 c.6 §13; 1971 c.271 §2; 1975 c.605 §32; 1981 c.764 §6; 2007 c.277 §5; 2011 c.140 §5; 2017 c.185 §22; 2017 c.297 §27]

 

      Note: ORCP 55 was repealed and replaced by the Council on Court Procedures Amendments promulgated on December 8, 2018, and effective January 1, 2020. The text of 660.120 was not amended by enactment of the Legislative Assembly to reflect the repeal. Editorial adjustment of 660.120 for the repeal of ORCP 55 has not been made. See the ORCP 55 Cross-Reference Chart available from the Council on Court Procedures.

 

      660.122 [1963 c.645 §4; 1967 c.6 §14; repealed by 1985 c.98 §5]

 

      660.125 [1955 c.719 §5; 1957 c.270 §8; 1967 c.6 §15; 1977 c.299 §1; 1979 c.831 §1; repealed by 1981 c.764 §§7,20 (660.126 enacted in lieu of 660.125)]

 

      660.126 Apprenticeship standards; rules. (1) Apprenticeship standards shall contain statements of:

      (a) The apprenticeable occupation to be taught and a designation of the geographical area or areas in which the standards will apply;

      (b) The qualifications required of apprentice applicants and the minimum eligible starting age, which is at least 16 years unless a higher age is required by law;

      (c) The outline of work processes in which the apprentice will receive supervised work experience and training on the job, and the allocation of the approximate time to be spent in each major process;

      (d) The term required for completion of apprenticeship, which shall be consistent with requirements established by industry practice for the development of requisite skills, but in no event shall be less than 2,000 hours of reasonably continuous work experience;

      (e) The approximate number of hours to be spent by the apprentice at work and the approximate number of hours to be spent in related and supplemental instruction;

      (f) The minimum numeric ratio of journeyworkers to apprentices consistent with proper supervision, training, safety and continuity of employment, which shall be specifically and clearly stated as to application in terms of job site, workforce, department or plant;

      (g) A probationary period of up to one year or 25 percent of the length of the program, whichever is shorter, with full credit given for the probationary period toward completion of apprenticeship and with provision that during the probationary period, the apprenticeship agreement may be terminated without cause;

      (h) A progressively increasing schedule, showing the percentages of the journeyworker hourly wage to be paid the apprentice at each level of apprenticeship achieved;

      (i) Any additional provisions that the State Apprenticeship and Training Council and the Apprenticeship and Training Division of the Bureau of Labor and Industries may, by rule, deem necessary or advisable to effectuate the policies and duties prescribed and imposed by ORS 660.002 to 660.210; and

      (j) The content of related training with training objectives.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the council and the division may approve the inclusion of standards of additional provisions, or of provisions that depart from the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, when such standards or provisions have been submitted by joint employer and employee groups, or may be part of legitimate bargaining agreements between an employer and employees. In making the decision, the council and the division shall consider the following factors:

      (a) The possibility that the provision might result in curtailment of opportunities for apprentices to receive training or continuity of employment;

      (b) The possibility that the provision might result in the diversion of needed qualified applicants for apprenticeship, and particularly of qualified applicants of protected classes, into unskilled or semiskilled jobs for which an adequate supply of labor already exists;

      (c) The possibility that the provision might result in disputes among the participants in the programs that might curtail the cooperation necessary to build an adequate, skilled labor force in the State of Oregon;

      (d) The need to safeguard the health, safety, continuity of employment and welfare of the apprentices and to ensure the public welfare;

      (e) The need to raise the level of skill in each apprenticeable occupation to provide to the public quality goods and services at a fair price and an adequate and skilled workforce for the defense of the nation; and

      (f) The need to provide training in the licensed occupations for the protection of the apprentices and of the general public.

      (3) The council and the division shall adopt rules to allow a local committee to determine the circumstances under which an electrical apprentice, who is working under ORS 479.510 to 479.945 and has completed 6,500 hours of apprenticeship training for licenses requiring 8,000 hours of apprenticeship training or who has completed 5,000 hours of apprenticeship training for licenses requiring 6,000 hours of apprenticeship training, may work without direct supervision during the remainder of the apprenticeship.

      660.135 Local joint committees; members; meetings; authority of individual employed to assist committees. (1) In each locality where apprentices are employed, the State Apprenticeship and Training Council may approve as many local joint committees as are necessary to serve the needs of the various apprenticeable occupations. Local joint committees in building and construction trades occupations may be approved by the council only as group programs serving multiple employers.

      (2) Each local joint committee shall have no more than eight principal members, all actively participating in apprenticeship programs, and shall consist of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees. One alternate member may be selected for each principal committee member. Committee members and the alternate members shall be selected pursuant to procedures established by the council. The alternate members may attend all committee meetings, participate in discussions and perform such duties as may be delegated to them by the committee, but may not vote at committee meetings except when actually substituting for an absent principal committee member for their respective employer or employee.

      (3) To qualify as a local joint committee member representing employees, a prospective employee representative must be a member of the collective bargaining unit if a collective bargaining agreement exists for the trade or occupation that is the subject of the apprenticeship or training program administered by the committee. If no collective bargaining agreement exists, the prospective employee representative must be, or have been, a skilled practitioner of the particular trade or occupation that is the subject of the apprenticeship or training program administered by the committee.

      (4) Each local joint committee shall select a chairperson and a secretary, for such terms and with such powers and duties necessary for the performance of the functions of those offices as the committee determines. A quorum for the transaction of committee business consists of two representatives of employers and two representatives of employees. Each local joint committee shall meet as often as is necessary to transact business. Meetings may be called by the chairperson or at the request of the majority of the members of the committee.

      (5) When an individual is employed by a joint industry group, association or trust to assist local joint apprenticeship or training committees, trade committees or state joint committees in the performance of their statutory duties, the individual is authorized to perform any clerical, ministerial or other functions as the committees may direct.

      660.137 Duties of local apprenticeship and training programs. Every local apprenticeship or training program administered by a local joint committee, or by a trade committee functioning as a local joint committee, shall:

      (1) Propose to the State Apprenticeship and Training Council and the Apprenticeship and Training Division of the Bureau of Labor and Industries standards for the local program that are in substantial conformity with ORS 660.126 and with the uniform standards, if any, adopted by the state joint committee for that occupation, and recommend to the council and the division modifications of the standards.

      (2) Administer its program in conformity with its approved standards, with the provisions of ORS 660.002 to 660.210, and with the rules and policies of the council and the division. Particularly, the local joint committee shall:

      (a) Maintain records of all apprentices in its program, with respect to work experience, instruction on the job, attendance at related instruction and progress, and such other records as may be appropriate or required, and shall submit such reports as the council, division or other appropriate governmental agencies may require;

      (b) Submit to the state joint committee appropriate requests for changes in courses of study for the instruction of apprentices; and

      (c) Be responsible for apprentices receiving necessary on-the-job and related instruction, and for all apprenticeship agreements being promptly registered with the council.

      (3) Be responsible for the recruitment, qualification, selection, approval and registration of apprentices entering the program, including the evaluation of previous creditable work experience, education and training for which advanced credit must be given, provided that advanced credit may be given for such creditable experience, education and training.

      (4) Review and evaluate, at least semiannually, the progress of each apprentice, as to job performance and related instruction, and consistent with the skill acquired, accordingly advance the apprentice to the next level of apprenticeship or hold the apprentice at the same level for a reasonable period, and with reasonable opportunity for corrective action, or terminate the apprentice from the program for serious or continued inadequate progress and notify the council and the division of the action taken. The council, the division and the appropriate training agent shall also be notified of each rerating and of the apprentice’s new level on the wage schedule. Recognition for successful completion of apprenticeship shall be evidenced by an appropriate certificate issued by the council.

      (5)(a) Determine the qualifications, minimum facilities and training conditions required of an employer to serve as an approved training agent, and approve training agents accordingly;

      (b) Make periodic checks of approved training agents to ensure that there are qualified training personnel and that there is adequate supervision on the job, adequate and safe equipment and facilities for training and supervision, and safety training for apprentices on the job and in related instruction; and

      (c) Withdraw approval of training agents when the qualifications are no longer met or when it appears to the committee that the training agent is in violation of the terms of an apprenticeship agreement, standards, provisions of ORS 660.002 to 660.210 or the rules and policies of the council and the division.

      (6) Determine and redetermine at least annually the average journeyworker hourly rate of wage for the purposes of ORS 660.142 and submit the rate to the State Director of Apprenticeship and Training, along with a statement explaining how the determination was made. Training agents that fail or refuse to provide their committees with information shall be terminated as approved training agents. The council and the division may withhold approval of a new program or terminate an existing program for failure or refusal by the committee or its training agents to keep the established journeyworker hourly rate of wage current and correct. The committee shall retain all records from which a wage determination was made for inspection by the council and division, as required by law. [1981 c.764 §13 (enacted in lieu of 660.141); 2007 c.620 §8; 2011 c.140 §7]

 

      660.139 Applicant indentured to family business or current employer. (1) Unless the State Apprenticeship and Training Council determines there is an adverse impact on apprenticeship opportunities based on an individual’s race, sex, sexual orientation or ethnic group, an applicant who is otherwise eligible for selection as an apprentice under the selection method used by the local joint committee may, with the consent of the applicant, be indentured to a family business or the applicant’s current employer without regard to whether another employer would otherwise be entitled to indenture the apprentice under the selection method used by the local joint committee.

      (2) As used in this section:

      (a) “Current employer” means the employer with whom the applicant has been a full-time, regular employee for at least six months before the applicant is selected into the apprenticeship program.

      (b) “Family business” means a business owned in whole or in part by a parent or grandparent of the applicant. [1999 c.755 §2; 2007 c.100 §30]

      660.142 Pay rates for apprentices and journeyworkers; exception. (1) A training agent may not pay an apprentice at a rate less than that obtained by applying the schedule, set forth in the applicable standards, at the apprentice’s level of apprenticeship, to the journeyworker hourly rate of wage currently in effect for journeyworkers in the occupation for which the apprentice is being trained, as determined by the appropriate local joint committee.

      (2) The journeyworker hourly wage rate shall be the average hourly wage currently being paid by the training agents participating in a program to their skilled workers, that is, to those employees with demonstrated knowledge, experience and proficiency in that trade or occupation who are currently performing the type of work for which the apprentice is to be trained. Upon receipt of a committee’s determination of its current journeyworker hourly rate of wage, the State Director of Apprenticeship and Training shall cause notice of the determination to be promptly mailed to all apprentices and training agents participating in the program. The determination shall be in effect from the date set forth in the determination or, lacking such date, from the first of the month following the mailing of the determination. However, neither the wage determination nor the effective date alters the terms or effect of an existing collective bargaining agreement.

      (3) If a higher journeyworker hourly wage rate is prescribed by federal or state law for work on a particular project, the higher rate is controlling for purposes of determining apprentice wages applicable to that particular project.

      (4) Nothing stated in ORS 660.002 to 660.210 shall be construed to supersede the minimum wage or overtime provisions of ORS chapters 652 and 653, or the rules adopted under ORS chapter 652 or 653. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, the entry wage (that wage derived by applying the lowest percentage on the schedule to the current journeyworker hourly wage rate) may not be less than the federal or state minimum wage rate, whichever is higher.

      (5) The State Apprenticeship and Training Council may make such exceptions to the apprentice wage schedule or journeyworker hourly wage rate, and to the minimum numeric ratio of journeyworkers to apprentices, as it deems necessary or advisable to further the operation of apprenticeship and training programs in Department of Corrections and Oregon Youth Authority institutions.

      660.145 Trade apprenticeship and training committees. In an area where it is not practicable to establish a local joint apprenticeship committee or a local joint training committee, a trade committee for apprenticeship and training may be formed to administer the standards of various separate programs approved by the State Apprenticeship and Training Council. Members shall consist of one training agent and one employee representing each occupation affected, who shall be selected pursuant to the procedures established by the council. A trade committee for apprenticeship or training shall function in the manner prescribed for a local joint committee as to all occupations affected, except that recommendations to the council for amendments or modifications to the standards of a particular occupation may be made only by the members from that occupation. [1967 c.6 §21; 1981 c.764 §14; 2007 c.620 §10]

      (4) To evaluate completion rates under this section, the division shall compare the completion rate of the program under review with the national average for completion rates. Based on the completion rate review, the division shall provide technical assistance to promote higher completion rates to programs with a completion rate lower than the national average.

      (5) Cancellation of an apprenticeship agreement during the probationary period shall not have an impact on the completion rate of the program. [2011 c.140 §14]
