LABOR ORGANIZATIONS; COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

 

      661.010 Lawfulness of labor unions. Working men and women may organize themselves into, or carry on labor unions for the purpose of lessening the hours of labor, increasing the wages, bettering the conditions of the members of such organizations or carrying out their legitimate purposes as freely as they could do if acting singly.

 

      661.020 Labor not a commodity; employment rights are personal. (1) The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.

      (2) The right to enter into the relation of employer and employee, to change that relation, to assume and create a new relation for employer and employee or to work and labor as an employee, shall be held and construed to be a personal and not a property right.

 

      661.030 Collective bargaining for lawful purposes is legal. No person shall be indicted, prosecuted or tried in any court of this state for entering into or carrying on any arrangement, agreement or combination between themselves made with a view of lessening the number of hours of labor or increasing wages, bettering the conditions of working men and women or for any act done in pursuance thereof, unless such act is in itself forbidden by law if done by a single individual.

 

      661.040 Limitations on fees charged laborers by collective bargaining agents; access to and inspection of records; accounting. (1) No organization, association or person, legally authorized to act as collective bargaining agent or representative of laboring people, shall make any charge or exaction for initiation fees, dues, fines or other exactions, which will create a fund in excess of the legitimate requirements of such organization, association or person, in carrying out the lawful purpose or activities of such organization, association or person.

      (2) Every such organization, association and person shall keep accurate books itemizing all receipts and expenditures and the purpose of such expenditures.

      (3) Any member of any labor organization or association is entitled at all reasonable times to inspect the books, records and accounts of such association or organization, or any agent or representative thereof, and to have an accounting of all money and property thereof.

      (4) The circuit courts of this state, and the judges thereof, have jurisdiction to enforce this section, including full power to issue restraining orders and temporary and permanent injunctions, and such other and further orders as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out and enforce this section.

 

      661.045 Policy; union security agreements. (1) To encourage labor peace, it is the policy of the State of Oregon to allow private sector labor organizations and employers to enter into union security agreements to the full extent allowed by federal law.

      (2) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly in enacting ORS 663.127 to exercise the limited authority reserved to states under section 14(b) of the National Labor Relations Act. [2017 c.369 §1]

 

      Note: 661.045 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 661 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
