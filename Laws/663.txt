      (10) “Unfair labor practice” means any unfair labor practice listed in ORS 663.120 to 663.165. [Formerly 662.505; 1975 c.147 §12; 1975 c.163 §2; 2003 c.14 §408]

 

      663.010 “Collective bargaining” defined. For the purposes of this chapter, “collective bargaining” is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party. However, this obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. [Formerly 662.515]

 

      663.015 Designated collective bargaining representatives to be exclusive; grievances excepted. Representatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining, by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes, are the exclusive representatives of all the employees in that unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions of employment. However, an individual employee or a group of employees may at any time present grievances to their employer and have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, if:

      (1) The adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective-bargaining contract or agreement then in effect; and

      (2) The bargaining representative has been given opportunity to be present at the adjustment. [Formerly 662.525]

 

      663.020 Determination of appropriate unit for purposes of collective bargaining. (1) The Employment Relations Board shall decide in each case whether the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining is the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof. However, the board shall not decide that:

      (a) A unit is appropriate for such purposes if the unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit;

      (b) A craft unit is inappropriate for such purposes on the ground that a different unit has been established by a prior determination of the board unless a majority of the employees in the proposed craft unit vote against separate representation; or

      (c) A unit is appropriate for such purposes if it includes, together with other employees, an individual employed as a guard to enforce against employees and other persons rules to protect property of the employer or to protect the safety of persons on the employer’s premises. However, no labor organization shall be certified as the representative of employees in a bargaining unit of guards if such organization admits to membership, or is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which admits to membership, employees other than guards.

      (2) In determining whether a unit is appropriate for the purposes specified in subsection (1) of this section, the extent to which the employees have organized is not controlling. [Formerly 662.545]

 

      663.025 Filing of representation petition; investigation; hearing; election. (1) A petition may be filed with the Employment Relations Board, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board:

      (a) By an employee or group of employees, or any individual or labor organization acting in their behalf, alleging that a substantial number of employees:

      (A) Wish to be represented for collective bargaining and that their employer declines to recognize their representative as the representative defined in ORS 663.015; or

      (B) Assert that the individual or labor organization that has been certified or is being currently recognized by their employer as the bargaining representative is no longer a representative as defined in ORS 663.015; or

      (b) By an employer, alleging that one or more individuals or labor organizations have presented to the employer a claim to be recognized as the representative defined in ORS 663.015.

      (2) The board shall investigate the petition and if, upon the basis of its findings, the board has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide for an appropriate hearing before the board itself, a member thereof or its agent appointed for that purpose. Written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by certified mail to the parties named in the petition not less than seven days before the hearing. If the board finds upon the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, it shall conduct an election by secret ballot marked at the place of election and certify the results thereof.

      (3) In determining whether or not a question of representation exists, the same regulations and rules of decision apply irrespective of the identity of the persons filing the petition or the kind of relief sought.

      (4) Nothing in this chapter prohibits the waiving of hearings by stipulation for the purpose of a consent election in conformity with regulations and rules of decision of the board. [Formerly 662.555; 1975 c.147 §13; 2003 c.14 §409]

 

      663.030 Conduct of representation election. No election shall be directed in any bargaining unit or any subdivision within which, in the preceding 12 months, a valid election has been held. Employees engaged in an economic strike who are not entitled to reinstatement are eligible to vote, under regulations of the Employment Relations Board consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter, in any election conducted within 12 months after the commencement of the strike. In any election where none of the choices on the ballot receives a majority, a run-off shall be conducted by the board, the ballot providing for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest and second largest number of valid votes cast in the election. [Formerly 662.565; 1975 c.147 §13a]

 

      663.035 Filing of deauthorization petition; election; limitation. (1) Upon the filing with the Employment Relations Board by 40 percent or more of the employees in a bargaining unit covered by an agreement between their employer and a labor organization requiring membership as a condition of employment, of a petition alleging that they desire that the authority of the labor organization to make such an agreement be rescinded, the board shall direct the conciliator to take a secret ballot, marked at the place of election, of the employees in the unit and to certify the results thereof to the labor organization and to the employer.

      (2) No election shall be conducted pursuant to this section in a bargaining unit or a subdivision within which, in the preceding 12 months, a valid election has been held. [Formerly 662.575]

 

      663.040 Filing charge of illegal election practice; investigation; new election. Any person may file with the Employment Relations Board a charge that employees eligible to vote in an election under this chapter have been coerced or restrained in the exercise of this right. The board shall investigate the charge. If, upon the basis of its findings, the board concludes that employees eligible to vote in the election were so coerced or restrained, the board may order another election. [Formerly 662.585; 1975 c.147 §14]

 

      663.045 Obtaining advisory opinions on assertion of federal jurisdiction; findings of board to be public records. (1) In carrying out this chapter, the Employment Relations Board may, pursuant to any applicable federal law, rule or regulation, petition the National Labor Relations Board for an advisory opinion as to whether that agency will assert jurisdiction over a labor dispute which is the subject of a proceeding then pending before the board.

      (2) All findings, conclusions, and determinations of the board under this chapter shall be public records. [Formerly 662.595]

 

UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES

 

      663.100 Determination of agent. For the purposes of this chapter, in determining whether a person is acting as an “agent” of a second person so as to make the second person responsible for the acts of the first person, the question of whether the specific acts performed were actually authorized or subsequently ratified is not controlling. [1971 c.729 §3; 1987 c.158 §133]

 

      663.105 Supervisory personnel as union members. Nothing in this chapter prohibits an individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization, but no employer subject to this chapter is compelled to treat as employees, for the purpose of collective bargaining, individuals defined as supervisors in ORS 663.005. [1971 c.729 §4]

 

      663.110 Employee organization, bargaining rights; union security agreements; payments to charitable institutions in lieu of union dues and other fees. Employees have the right to self-organization; to form, join or assist labor organizations; to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing; and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. Employees also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that this right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized by ORS 663.125. However, agreements involving union security including an all-union agreement or agency agreement must safeguard the rights of nonassociation of employees, based on bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a church or religious body of which such employee is a member. Such employee must pay an amount of money equivalent to regular union dues and initiation fees and assessments, if any, to a nonreligious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the representative of the labor organization to which such employee would otherwise pay dues. The employee shall furnish written proof that this has been done. If the employee and representative of the labor organization do not reach agreement on the matter, the Employment Relations Board shall designate such organization. [1971 c.729 §5; 2003 c.14 §410]

 

      663.115 Right to strike. Nothing in this chapter, except as specifically provided for therein, either interferes with, impedes or diminishes in any way the right to strike, or affects the limitations or qualifications on that right. [1971 c.729 §6]

 

      663.120 Employer unfair labor practices. It is an unfair labor practice for an employer:

      (1) To interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in ORS 663.110;

      (2) To dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it. However, subject to rules published by the Employment Relations Board pursuant to ORS chapter 183, an employer may permit employees to confer with the employer during working hours without loss of time or pay;

      (3) To discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed charges or given testimony under this chapter; or

      (4) To refuse to bargain collectively with the employees’ exclusive representative, as defined in ORS 663.015. [1971 c.729 §7; 1975 c.83 §1]

 

      663.125 Other employer unfair labor practices. It is an unfair labor practice for an employer, by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment, to encourage or discourage membership in a labor organization. However:

      (1) Nothing in this chapter or in any other statute of this state precludes an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained or assisted by any action defined in this section or in ORS 663.120 as an unfair labor practice) to require as a condition of employment membership therein on or after the 30th day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of such agreement, whichever is the later:

      (a) If the labor organization is the representative of the majority of the employees in the appropriate collective-bargaining unit covered by the agreement when made; and

      (b) Unless following an election held within one year preceding the effective date of the agreement, at least a majority of the employees eligible to vote in the election have voted to rescind the authority of the labor organization to make such an agreement.

      (2) No employer shall justify any discrimination against an employee for nonmembership in a labor organization if the employer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was:

      (a) Not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members; or

      (b) Denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership. [1971 c.729 §8]

 

      663.127 Union security agreements. An employer or labor organization anywhere in this state may execute and apply an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment to the full extent allowed by federal law. [2017 c.369 §3]

 

      Note: 663.127 was added to and made a part of ORS chapters 661 to 663 by legislative action but was not added to ORS chapter 663 or any series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      663.130 Union unfair labor practices. It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents:

      (1) To cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of ORS 663.125 or to discriminate against an employee with respect to whom membership in such organization has been denied or terminated on some ground other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership;

      (2) To refuse to bargain collectively with an employer, if it is the elected and certified representative of the employees;

      (3) To cause or attempt to cause an employer to pay or deliver, or agree to pay or deliver, any money or other thing of value, in the nature of an exaction, for services which are not performed or not to be performed; or

      (4) To restrain or coerce:

      (a) An employer in the selection of representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances; or

      (b) Employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in ORS 663.110. However, this paragraph does not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein. [1971 c.729 §9]

 

      663.135 Excessive membership fee. It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to require of employees covered by an agreement authorized under ORS 663.125 the payment, as a condition precedent to becoming a member of the organization, of a fee in an amount which the Employment Relations Board finds excessive or discriminatory under all the circumstances. In making such a finding the board shall consider, among other relevant factors, the practices and customs of labor organizations in the particular industry, and the wages currently paid to the employees affected. [1971 c.729 §10]

 

      663.140 Encouraging certain strikes; refusals to handle products. It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of employment to use, manufacture, process, transport or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials or commodities or to perform any services; or to threaten, coerce or restrain any person, where in either case an object thereof is forcing or requiring:

      (1) An employer or self-employed person to join a labor or employer organization or to enter into an agreement that is prohibited by ORS 663.155;

      (2) A person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person, or forcing or requiring any other employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of employees of the employer unless such labor organization has been certified as the elected representative of such employees. However, nothing in this subsection makes unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing;

      (3) An employer to recognize or bargain with a particular labor organization as the representative of employees of the employer if another labor organization has been certified as the elected representative of such employees; or

      (4) An employer to assign particular work to employees in a particular labor organization or in a particular trade, craft or class rather than to employees in another labor organization or in another trade, craft or class, unless the employer is failing to conform to an order of the Employment Relations Board or certification of the conciliator determining the bargaining representative for employees performing the work. [1971 c.729 §11; 2005 c.22 §473]

 

      663.145 Refusal to enter upon premises where strike in progress; truthful strike publicity not prohibited. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 663.140, nothing in ORS 663.130 to 663.150 makes unlawful a refusal by any person to enter upon the premises of an employer (other than the person’s own employer), if the employees of that employer are engaged in a strike ratified or approved by an elected and certified representative of the employees whom the employer is required to recognize.

      (2) For the purposes of ORS 663.140 only, nothing in that section prohibits publicity, other than picketing, for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers and members of a labor organization, that a product is produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute and is distributed by another employer, as long as such publicity does not have an effect of inducing an individual employed by any person other than the primary employer in the course of employment to refuse to pick up, deliver or transport any goods, or not to perform any services, at the establishment of the employer engaged in such distribution. [1971 c.729 §12]

 

      663.150 Picketing to force recognition of or bargaining with union. (1) It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to picket or cause to be picketed, or threaten to picket or cause to be picketed, any employer when an object thereof is forcing or requiring an employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of the employees, or forcing or requiring the employees of an employer to accept or select such labor organization as their collective-bargaining representative, unless such labor organization is currently certified as the representative of such employees:

      (a) Where the employer has lawfully recognized in accordance with this chapter any other labor organization and a petition for a representation election may not appropriately be filed;

      (b) Where, within the preceding 12 months, a valid election has been conducted; or

      (c) Where the picketing has been conducted without a petition for an election and certification having been filed.

 

However:

      (A) When such a petition has been filed the Employment Relations Board forthwith, without regard to the absence of a showing of a substantial interest on the part of the labor organization and without an investigation or hearing, shall conduct an election by secret ballot, marked at the place of election, in such unit as the board finds to be appropriate, and to certify the results thereof.

      (B) Nothing in this section prohibits any picketing or other publicity for the purpose of truthfully advising the public (including consumers) that an employer does not employ members of, or have a contract with, a labor organization, unless an effect of the picketing is to induce an individual employed by any other person in the course of employment, not to pick up, deliver or transport any goods or not to perform any services.

      (2) Nothing in this section permits any act that otherwise would be an unfair labor practice under ORS 663.130 to 663.150. [1971 c.729 §13; 1975 c.147 §14a; 2007 c.71 §218]

 

      663.155 Contract with employer to refrain from dealing in products of another employer. It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization and an employer to enter into a contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby the employer ceases or refrains, or agrees to cease or refrain, from handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person. Any contract or agreement entered into after January 1, 1972, containing such an agreement is to such extent unenforceable and void. [1971 c.729 §15]

 

      663.160 Expression of views not containing threats or promises of benefit not unfair labor practice. The expressing of any views, argument or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic or visual form, does not constitute evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this chapter, if the expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit. [1971 c.729 §16]

 

      663.165 Procedure for terminating or modifying existing collective bargaining contract; notice; negotiation meetings. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 663.010, if there is in effect a collective-bargaining contract covering employees in an industry, the duty to bargain collectively also means that no party to the contract shall terminate or modify the contract, unless the party desiring termination or modification:

      (a) Serves a written notice upon the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification 60 days before the expiration date thereof, or in the event the contract contains no expiration date, 60 days before the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification;

      (2) On the filing of such a petition the court:

      (2) The Employment Relations Board shall not apply for a restraining order under ORS 663.235 if a charge against the employer under ORS 663.120 (2) has been filed and, after the preliminary investigation, the board has reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true and that a complaint should issue.

      (2) Within five days after the service of a subpoena on a person requiring the production of any evidence in possession or under the control of the person, the board on petition of that person shall revoke the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation, or any matter in question in the proceedings, or if in its opinion the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence whose production is required.

      (3) The board or its agent designated by it for such purposes, may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and receive evidence. Attendance of witnesses and the production of such evidence may be required at any designated place of hearing. [1971 c.729 §38; 1975 c.147 §18]

 

      663.275 Refusal to obey subpoenas punished as contempt of court.

However, no individual shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which the individual is compelled, after having claimed privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, except that the individual so testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.

The verified return by the individual so serving setting forth the manner of service is proof of service. The return post-office receipt or telegraph receipt therefor, when registered and mailed or telegraphed, is proof of service.

      (2) Witnesses summoned before the board or its designated agent under this chapter shall be paid the fees and mileage provided for witnesses in ORS 44.415 (2). Witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the same are severally entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of this state.
