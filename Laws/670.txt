Any state board or commission that examines applicants for license or certification to practice a profession or engage in a trade or calling may, in its discretion, waive the educational requirement for admission to such examination, provided that the applicant furnishes evidence satisfactory to such state board or commission that the applicant is currently enrolled in a school, college or university approved by such state board or commission and will satisfy the educational requirement for admission to such examination on satisfactory completion of courses for which the applicant is currently enrolled and that this educational requirement will be met not later than four calendar months from the first day of the month following the month in which the examination is given.

LICENSING ADMINISTRATION

 

(Generally)

 

      670.275 Policy statement. In enacting chapter 753, Oregon Laws 1971, it is the intention of the Legislative Assembly to provide for the more effective coordination of the administrative functions of boards charged with responsibility for protecting the public through the licensing and regulating of certain professions practiced in this state. Further, it is the intention of the Legislative Assembly to retain responsibility for decisions on qualifications, standards of practice, licensing, discipline and other discretionary functions relating to professional activities in the professional licensing boards, members of which are qualified by education, training and experience to make the necessary judgments. [Formerly 184.575]

 

      Note: Legislative Counsel has substituted “chapter 753, Oregon Laws 1971,” for the words “this Act” in section 1, chapter 753, Oregon Laws 1971, compiled as 670.275 [Formerly 184.575]. Specific ORS references have not been substituted pursuant to 173.160. These sections may be determined by referring to the 1971 Comparative Section Table located in Volume 20 of ORS.

 

      670.280 Denial, suspension or revocation of license based on criminal conviction; denial of license or imposition of discipline for conduct substantially related to fitness and ability of applicant or licensee. (1) As used in this section:

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 342.143 (3) or 342.175 (3), a licensing board, commission or agency may not deny, suspend or revoke an occupational or professional license solely for the reason that the applicant or licensee has been convicted of a crime, but it may consider the relationship of the facts which support the conviction and all intervening circumstances to the specific occupational or professional standards in determining the fitness of the person to receive or hold the license.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 342.143 (3) and 342.175 (3), a licensing board, commission or agency may deny an occupational or professional license or impose discipline on a licensee based on conduct that is not undertaken directly in the course of the licensed activity, but that is substantially related to the fitness and ability of the applicant or licensee to engage in the activity for which the license is required. In determining whether the conduct is substantially related to the fitness and ability of the applicant or licensee to engage in the activity for which the license is required, the licensing board, commission or agency shall consider the relationship of the facts with respect to the conduct and all intervening circumstances to the specific occupational or professional standards. [1973 c.359 §1; 1991 c.662 §6a; 2003 c.749 §13; 2009 c.386 §5]

 

      670.283 Power of state agency to suspend license includes power to reinstate. If a state agency, board or commission has the power to issue any license, certification or registration necessary to practice any profession or engage in any trade or calling, any statute granting the state agency, board or commission the power to suspend the license, certification or registration includes the power to reinstate:

      (1) At a time certain; or

      (2) Bar or discharge from employment or refuse to hire or employ such individual because of the existence or contents of a juvenile record that has been expunged pursuant to ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262; or

      (3) Deny, revoke or suspend a license because of the existence or contents of a juvenile record that has been expunged pursuant to ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262. [1977 c.801 §2; 1983 c.820 §16; 1993 c.33 §360]

      (4) Members of the board are entitled to compensation and expenses as provided in ORS 292.495. [1971 c.753 §8; 1987 c.414 §95]
