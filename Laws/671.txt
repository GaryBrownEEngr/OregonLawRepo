      (7) “Practice of architecture” means the planning, designing or observing of the erection, enlargement or alteration of any building or of any appurtenance thereto other than exempted buildings.

      (8) “Registered professional engineer” has the meaning given that term in ORS 672.002.

      (9) “State building code” has the meaning given that term in ORS 455.010. [Amended by 1957 c.408 §1; 1961 c.585 §1; 1977 c.803 §1; 2003 c.763 §1; 2013 c.196 §1]

A shareholder, director or officer may also be held liable for negligent or wrongful acts or misconduct in participation with such acts or misconduct of another shareholder, director or officer of the corporation. The corporation is jointly and severally liable up to the full value of its assets for such acts or misconduct. However, the shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents of the corporation are not personally liable for the debts or other contractual obligations of the corporation. [1969 c.596 §3; 1977 c.803 §5; 1991 c.910 §4; 1997 c.249 §203]

      (2) A person who seeks to practice architecture in this state and meets the requirements for certification in subsection (1) of this section may offer to render architectural services without being issued a certificate of registration by the board, if the architect advises the prospective client and the board in writing and submits an application for registration in this state. The person may use the title of “Architect” while offering to render architectural services, but may not represent that the person is qualified to practice under ORS 671.010 to 671.220. [1977 c.803 §9; 2003 c.763 §4]

 

      671.070 [Repealed by 1977 c.803 §18 and 1977 c.842 §14]

(1) Each registrant who desires to continue as an architect in this state shall submit to the State Board of Architect Examiners, on or before the renewal deadline established by board rule, a renewal application and the renewal fee authorized under ORS 671.085. The registrant shall also furnish evidence satisfactory to the board that the registrant has complied with any continuing education requirements adopted by the board under ORS 671.125, unless those requirements have been waived. Upon payment and, if required, the furnishing of satisfactory evidence, the board shall issue to the registrant a certificate of renewal of registration.

      (2) If a registrant fails to have a certificate renewed on or before the renewal deadline established by board rule, the registrant is delinquent.

(1) If a claim is filed with the State Landscape Contractors Board against a licensed landscape contracting business for payment from the bond, letter of credit or deposit required of the business under ORS 671.690, the board may resolve the dispute involving the landscape contracting business.

      (2) A person having a claim against a landscape contracting business shall give the board notice of the claim in writing 90 days before any action on the bond, letter of credit or deposit is commenced.

      (3) The board may not accept a claim against a landscape contracting business for processing if the claim is not filed with the board within one year after the business substantially completed work. The board may not issue an order for the payment of a court judgment or arbitration award from the bond, letter of credit or deposit of a landscape contracting business unless the person has timely filed with the board a claim against the business regarding the same matter that resulted in the judgment or award. [1973 c.832 §29c; 1983 c.452 §16; 1987 c.461 §3; 2007 c.149 §6; 2007 c.541 §36a]

 

      671.701 Claims against business holding dual licensing. (1) A person may file complaints against a licensed landscape contracting business with both the Construction Contractors Board and the State Landscape Contractors Board regarding the same work if:

      (a) The landscape contracting business holds a license as a construction contractor issued under ORS chapter 701; and

      (b) The complaint to the Construction Contractors Board qualifies for filing under ORS chapter 701 and the complaint to the State Landscape Contractors Board qualifies for filing under ORS 671.510 to 671.760.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not expand the authority of the Construction Contractors Board or State Landscape Contractors Board to resolve a complaint or pay a claim. A determination by either board regarding a complaint or claim is not binding on the other board. The total amount paid to a person described in subsection (1) of this section by the boards may not exceed the damages sustained by the person. The State Landscape Contractors Board may require a person who files a complaint against a landscape contracting business to inform the board of any complaint the person files with the Construction Contractors Board against the business. [2015 c.672 §3]

 

      671.703 Investigation of claim; resolution processes; dismissal of claim; rules. (1) Upon acceptance of a claim described in ORS 671.695, the State Landscape Contractors Board shall initiate an investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, if the board determines that facts exist supporting an order for payment, the board may order the landscape contracting business to pay the claim. A party to the claim may request a hearing on the order issued by the board.

      (2) Subject to subsection (5) of this section, if the resolution of the claim requires a hearing, the board may require that the hearing be conducted as a binding arbitration under rules adopted by the board under subsection (4) of this section.

      (3) The board may use arbitration, mediation or other forms of dispute resolution to resolve a landscaping dispute between any parties who agree to follow the rules of the board, including parties to a dispute that is not a claim described in ORS 671.695.

      (4) Except as provided in this subsection, rules adopted by the board to regulate arbitration under subsections (2) and (3) of this section must substantially conform with the provisions of ORS 36.600, 36.610 to 36.630, 36.635 (2), 36.640, 36.645 (2), 36.650 to 36.680, 36.685 (1) and 36.690 to 36.740. The rules may:

      (a) Require that a hearing under ORS 183.413 to 183.470 be conducted for issues for which a petition could be filed under ORS 36.615, 36.620, 36.625 and 36.640;

      (b) Limit orders and awards made by the arbitrator as necessary to comply with ORS 671.510 to 671.760;

      (c) Require that a request that an arbitrator modify or correct an award under ORS 36.690 be submitted in a form specified by the rule;

      (d) Require that a petition under ORS 36.705 (2) or 36.710 (1) be filed in a shorter period of time than provided by ORS 36.705 and 36.760; and

      (e) Include any other provision necessary to conform the arbitration to ORS 671.510 to 671.760.

      (5) A party to a claim that is subject to a board order of binding arbitration under subsection (2) of this section may avoid the arbitration if the party requests to have the claim resolved through a contested case hearing or files a complaint in a court. A party making a request or filing a complaint under this subsection is subject to the following provisions:

      (a) If the party requests to have a claim resolved through a contested case hearing, the party must, within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this subsection, deliver the request in writing to the board and to all parties entitled by board rule to receive a copy of the request.

      (b) If the party files a complaint in a court, the party must, within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this subsection, deliver a copy of the complaint to the board and to all parties entitled by the board rule to receive a copy of the complaint. If the party filing the complaint is the claimant, the claimant must allege all elements of the claim in the complaint. If the complaint is filed by the licensed landscape contracting business against whom a claim is alleged, the complaint may be a complaint for damages, a complaint for declaratory judgment or other complaint that allows the claimant to file a response alleging the elements of the claim. The claimant has the burden of proving the elements of the claim in any action described in this paragraph.

      (c) A party that is subject to paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection must deliver a request or complaint to the board as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection no later than the 30th day after the board sends notice that an arbitration hearing has been scheduled. Failure to timely deliver a request or complaint under this paragraph constitutes consent to the binding arbitration.

      (d) If a party makes a timely request under paragraph (a) of this subsection for a contested case hearing and another party timely files a complaint in compliance with paragraph (b) of this subsection, the filing of the complaint supersedes the request for a contested case hearing.

      (e) A party may not withdraw a request made in compliance with paragraph (a) of this subsection unless all parties agree to the withdrawal.

      (f) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this subsection are in addition to any other requirements imposed by law regarding the filing of a complaint.

      (6) An arbitration conducted under subsection (2) or (3) of this section must be held before an administrative law judge acting as arbitrator. The administrative law judge assigned to act as arbitrator of the case on behalf of the board must be from the Office of Administrative Hearings established under ORS 183.605. The assignment of an administrative law judge to act as arbitrator is subject to a request for a different arbitrator under ORS 183.645 or a rule adopted pursuant to ORS 183.645.

      (7) If a party to a claim described in ORS 671.695 requests a contested case hearing, the board shall schedule the hearing. If a party files a court action to determine the matter described in the claim, the board shall suspend further processing of the claim until the action is resolved by an appropriate court.

      (8) If the matter described in a claim is submitted for determination by a court, the board may require that the claimant provide status reports on the pending action. The board may dismiss or close a claim described in ORS 671.695 as established by rule of the board if the claimant fails to submit status reports on a pending action.

      (9) If a final order or arbitration award is issued under this section and the landscape contracting business does not pay the claim on or before the 30th day after receiving the order, the board shall order the claim paid out of the bond, letter of credit or deposit filed under ORS 671.690.

      (10) The board may dismiss or close a claim as established by rule of the board if:

      (a) The claimant does not permit the person against whom the claim is filed to be present at any on-site investigation made by the board; or

      (b) The board determines that the person against whom the claim is filed is capable of complying with recommendations made by the board relative to the claim, but the claimant does not permit the person to comply with the recommendations. The board may dismiss or close a claim under this paragraph only if the person was licensed at the time the work was first performed and is licensed at the time the board makes its recommendations.

      (11) The board may suspend processing a claim if the board determines that the nature or complexity of the claim is such that a court is the appropriate forum for the adjudication of the claim. [1979 c.840 §8; 1983 c.452 §17; 1987 c.461 §4; 1989 c.153 §1; 1991 c.533 §2; 1995 c.645 §4; 2001 c.198 §§3,4; 2003 c.75 §56; 2003 c.598 §§48,49; 2007 c.149 §7; 2007 c.541 §37a]

 

      671.705 [1979 c.840 §9; 1981 c.897 §99; 1983 c.452 §18; repealed by 1995 c.645 §6]

 

      671.707 Actions following final order of board. (1) If a final order of the State Landscape Contractors Board is not paid by the landscape contracting business, the board shall notify the surety on the business’s bond.

      (2) An order of the board that determines a claim under ORS 671.703 that becomes final by operation of law or on appeal and remains unpaid for 20 days after the order becomes final is an order in favor of the claimant against the landscape contracting business and may be recorded with the county clerk in any county of this state.

      (3) Upon receipt, the clerk shall record the order in the County Clerk Lien Record. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, recording an order in the County Clerk Lien Record pursuant to this section has the effect provided for in ORS 205.125 and 205.126, and the order may be enforced as provided in ORS 205.125 and 205.126. [1979 c.840 §10; 1999 c.153 §1; 2007 c.149 §8; 2007 c.541 §38a]

 

      671.710 Priority on satisfaction of claims. (1) Determinations by the State Landscape Contractors Board or judgments against the surety bond, letter of credit or deposit of a landscape contracting business for claims filed during a 90-day period shall be satisfied in the priority listed in subsections (2) to (4) of this section. The payment of a claim filed during a 90-day period has priority over any claim filed during a subsequent 90-day period. A 90-day period begins on the date the first claim is filed with the board. A subsequent 90-day period begins on the date the first claim is filed with the board after the close of the preceding 90-day period.

      (2) Determinations and judgments as a result of claims filed within a 90-day period against a landscape contracting business by owners of property upon which landscaping work was performed or was contracted to perform, or by the agents of the owner, have payment priority to the full extent of the bond, letter of credit or deposit over all other claims filed within the same 90-day period.

      (3) If the total of all claims filed against a landscape contracting business by property owners or their agents under subsection (2) of this section within a 90-day period does not exhaust the bond, letter of credit or deposit, amounts due as a result of all other claims filed within the same 90-day period may be satisfied from the remainder of the bond, letter of credit or deposit, except that the total amount paid from any one bond to nonowner claimants may not exceed $3,000.

      (4) If the total of all claims against a landscape contracting business within a single 90-day period exceeds the amount of the bond, letter of credit or deposit available for payment of those claims, payment from the bond, letter of credit or deposit shall be apportioned as the board determines, subject to the claim payment priorities established under this section.

      (5) The total amount paid from any one bond for recovery of dispute resolution costs, interest and attorney fees may not exceed $3,000. [1973 c.832 §29d; 1979 c.840 §11; 1983 c.452 §19; 1999 c.34 §1; 2005 c.609 §19; 2007 c.149 §9; 2007 c.541 §39]

(Local Business Licenses)

 

      671.750 Portland metropolitan area business licenses. The Legislative Assembly intends to reduce the number of city business licenses that a landscape contracting business must obtain to conduct business in the Portland metropolitan area. The purpose of this section and ORS 671.755 is to enable a landscape contracting business to secure from the metropolitan service district one business license that will permit the landscape contracting business to conduct business in cities in which the landscape contracting business performs a limited amount of work and in which it does not have a principal place of business. The Legislative Assembly also intends that this section and ORS 671.755 apply only to landscape contracting businesses without regard to any subsequent expansion of the jurisdiction of the State Landscape Contractors Board over other businesses. It is the policy of this state that, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the requirements of this section and ORS 671.755, the cities within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district be allowed to control the imposition of business license taxes and to maintain the level of revenues obtained from those taxes. The amount and trends of revenue produced or distributed to each city is intended to reflect the landscape contracting business activity within the participating cities. [2007 c.541 §46]

 

      671.755 Issuance of business license by metropolitan service district; city business license tax. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Business license tax” means any fee paid by a person to a city or county for any form of license that is required by the city or county in order to conduct business in that city or county. “Business license tax” does not mean a franchise fee or privilege tax imposed by a city upon a public utility under ORS 221.420 or 221.450 or under a city charter.

      (b) “Conducting business” means engaging directly, or through officers, agents and employees, in an activity in pursuit of gain.

      (c) “Principal place of business” means the location in this state of the central administrative office of a person conducting business in this state.

      (d) “Within a metropolitan service district” means that city limits are wholly or partially inside district boundaries.

      (2) A landscape contracting business shall pay directly to any city within a metropolitan service district any business license tax imposed by the city if:

      (a) The landscape contracting business has its principal place of business within the city; or

      (b) The landscape contracting business does not have its principal place of business within the city but derives gross receipts of $250,000 or more from conducting business within the city during the calendar year for which the tax is owed.

      (3) A landscape contracting business may apply for a business license from a metropolitan service district if the business conducts business in a city that is within the district but that is not a city to which the business directly pays a business license tax for that year.

      (4) The metropolitan service district shall issue a business license to a landscape contracting business if:

      (a) The business proves to the district that the business has directly paid the business license tax imposed by each city within the district to which the business must directly pay a business license tax; and

      (b) The business pays a license fee to the district.

      (5) The license fee charged under subsection (4) of this section shall be twice the average business license tax charged to landscape contracting businesses by cities located within the metropolitan service district plus an amount that is sufficient to reimburse the district for the administrative expenses of the district incurred in carrying out its duties under this section.

      (6) If a landscape contracting business is issued a business license by the metropolitan service district under subsection (4) of this section, and a city within the district other than a city described in subsection (2) of this section demands that the business pay a business license tax, the demanding city shall waive payment of the tax if the business proves by possession or otherwise that the business has a business license issued by the metropolitan service district for the calendar year for which the tax is owed.

      (7) The metropolitan service district shall distribute the business license fees collected by the district under this section, less administrative expenses, to the cities within the district that collect a business license tax. In any year, each of the cities shall receive a share of the license fees based upon the proportion that the number of residential building permits the city issued during the year bears to the total number of residential building permits issued during the year by all of the cities within the district. The district shall determine the number of residential building permits issued by cities within the district from statistics. A district shall distribute moneys under this subsection at least once each year. [2007 c.541 §47; 2015 c.180 §48]

 

      671.760 Business income tax. (1) As used in this section, “business license tax” has the meaning given that term in ORS 671.755.

      (2) A city that imposes a business license tax based on or measured by adjusted net income earned by conducting business within the city is exempt from ORS 671.755. [2007 c.541 §48]

 

      671.950 [Formerly 671.435; 2003 c.14 §425; renumbered 671.995 in 2005]

 

      671.955 [Formerly 671.720; 2005 c.609 §20; renumbered 671.997 in 2005]

      (b) The economic benefit to the violator resulting from the violation;

      (c) Whether the violator has previously committed violations; and

      (d) Other factors that the board finds appropriate. [Formerly 671.950]

 

      671.997 Civil penalties for violations of ORS 671.510 to 671.760.

The board shall determine the amount of the civil penalty, not to exceed $2,000 for each offense.

      (2) The board shall impose civil penalties under this section as provided in ORS 183.745.

      (3) The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of any other penalty or sanction provided by law.

      (4)(a) If a landscape contracting business commits an act described under ORS 671.610 (5), the board may assess civil penalties or impose license sanctions under this subsection on the landscape contracting business to which the contract is awarded, the landscape contracting business that awards the contract, or both.

      (b) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a civil penalty imposed on a landscape contracting business for a first offense of committing an act described under ORS 671.610 (5) may not exceed $1,000.

      (c) In addition to any civil penalty assessed by the board, if a landscape contracting business has two or more prior offenses for committing acts described under ORS 671.610 (5), the board may impose license sanctions on the landscape contracting business. The license sanctions:
