      (4) “Practice of psychology” means rendering or offering to render supervision, consultation, evaluation or therapy services to individuals, groups or organizations for the purpose of diagnosing or treating behavioral, emotional or mental disorders. “Practice of psychology” also includes delegating the administration and scoring of tests to technicians qualified by and under the direct supervision of a licensed psychologist.

      (5) “State” means any state or territory of the United States and the District of Columbia. [1963 c.396 §1; 1973 c.777 §1; 1981 c.892 §96; 1991 c.490 §1; 1993 c.585 §1; 1995 c.810 §1; 1999 c.443 §1; 2003 c.630 §3; 2017 c.6 §3]

 

      675.020 Practice or representation as psychologist prohibited without license; use of business name or designation. (1) To safeguard the people of the State of Oregon from the dangers of unqualified and improper practice of psychology, no person shall, unless exempted from the provisions of ORS 675.010 to 675.150 by ORS 675.090:

      (a) Practice psychology in this state without first being licensed under ORS 675.010 to 675.150; or

      (b) Represent oneself to be a psychologist without first being licensed under ORS 675.010 to 675.150.

      (2) As used in subsection (1)(b) of this section, “represent oneself to be a psychologist” means to use any title or description of services incorporating the words “psychology,” “psychological,” “psychotherapy” or “psychologist,” or to offer or render to individuals or to groups of individuals services included in the practice of psychology.

      (3) A psychologist licensed under ORS 675.010 to 675.150 shall practice under the name of the psychologist only, but nothing in ORS 675.010 to 675.150 or rules adopted thereunder shall be deemed to prevent a licensed psychologist from using an assumed business name or other designation to describe a place, institution, organization or agency where or in connection with which the psychologist conducts practice. [1963 c.396 §2; 1971 c.362 §1; 1973 c.777 §2; 1987 c.158 §136; 1993 c.585 §2; 1995 c.810 §2]

      (B) In the military; and

      (e) Is of good moral character. For purposes of this section, the lack of good moral character may be established by reference to acts or conduct that reflect moral turpitude or to acts or conduct that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the individual’s honesty, fairness and respect for the rights of others and for the laws of the state and the nation. The conduct or acts in question must be rationally connected to the applicant’s fitness to practice psychology.

      (2) The board shall adopt rules by which a person receiving post-doctoral supervision during the application process may enter into a contract to practice psychology under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, psychologist associate or a person considered by the board to have equivalent supervisory competence. An applicant who enters such a contract shall be designated as a psychologist resident or a psychologist associate resident, accordingly, and shall be subject to ORS 675.010 to 675.150. [1963 c.396 §3; 1973 c.777 §3; 1985 c.90 §3; 1991 c.311 §1; 1991 c.490 §2; 1993 c.585 §3; 2005 c.7 §1; 2012 c.43 §4; 2017 c.6 §4]

Timely and appropriate notice shall be sent to each applicant.

      (2) Any applicant may, upon written request to the board, discuss the applicant’s performance on the board administered examination with the board.

      (3) Any applicant who fails to make a passing grade on the board administered examination shall be allowed to take the examination a second time. Any applicant who fails the examination a second time must obtain special permission from the board to take the examination again. [1963 c.396 §4; 1973 c.777 §6; 2005 c.7 §2; 2017 c.6 §5]

 

      675.045 Examinations administered by board; rules. (1) The Oregon Board of Psychology shall adopt rules governing examinations required by the board.

      (2) When the board requires a board administered examination, the board shall:

      (b) Inform applicants in writing of the examination results for each tested subject area.

      (3) Upon written request to the board, an applicant who fails a board administered examination may review the record of the examination. To ensure and maintain test security, the applicant shall sign a confidentiality agreement prior to reviewing the record of the examination.

      (4) Any applicant who fails a board administered examination shall be:

      (a) Allowed to petition the board to reconsider the results of the entire examination or the results of a particular tested area.

      (b) Reexamined only in the tested areas in which the applicant did not receive a passing grade. [1985 c.90 §6; 1997 c.681 §1; 2005 c.7 §3; 2017 c.6 §6]

 

      675.050 Licensing without national examination; fee; rules. (1) Upon application for licensure accompanied by the established fee, the Oregon Board of Psychology may issue a license, without national examination, to any applicant who furnishes evidence satisfactory to the board that the applicant:

      (a) Holds a doctoral degree from an approved doctoral program in psychology and is licensed or certified to practice psychology in another state in which the requirements for such licensing or certification are, in the judgment of the board, essentially equivalent to licensing requirements of ORS 675.010 to 675.150 and the rules of the board;

      (b) Is a diplomate in good standing of the American Board of Professional Psychology;

      (c) Is licensed in a jurisdiction that is a party to a licensing reciprocity agreement with the State of Oregon and meets the requirements for reciprocity in the agreement;

      (d) Possesses a valid Certificate of Professional Qualification granted by the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards or is credentialed as a Health Service Provider in Psychology by the National Register of Health Service Providers in Psychology; or

      (2) The Oregon Board of Psychology shall adopt by rule and administer an examination on Oregon law to an applicant described in subsection (1) of this section.

Upon application therefor and payment of the required fee, the Oregon Board of Psychology may issue a limited permit to practice as a psychologist to an applicant holding a certificate or license to practice psychology issued by another state whose requirements are, in the judgment of the board, essentially equivalent to those required by ORS 675.010 to 675.150. The limited permit shall be valid for a period of not more than 180 calendar days in any 24-month period. [1973 c.777 §15; 1987 c.56 §1; 1997 c.249 §204; 1999 c.59 §201; 2017 c.6 §8]

[1963 c.396 §8; 1973 c.777 §10; 1979 c.744 §49; 1985 c.90 §7; 1989 c.44 §1; 1989 c.217 §1; 1989 c.444 §1; 2009 c.441 §1; 2009 c.756 §6; 2015 c.79 §2; 2015 c.611 §1; 2017 c.6 §10; 2017 c.104 §12]

CERTIFIED SEX OFFENDER THERAPISTS

 

(Generally)

 

      675.360 Legislative findings. (1) The Legislative Assembly hereby declares that the comprehensive treatment of sex offenders who are subject to the supervision of the criminal justice and juvenile justice systems and the Oregon Health Authority is necessary in order to work toward the elimination of sex offenses. The Legislative Assembly hereby recognizes that sex offender therapists who examine and treat sex offenders therefore occupy a vital role in protecting the public from sex offenders who remain in the community prior to or following disposition or who will reenter the community following a period of incarceration.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly further finds that the qualifications, practices, techniques and levels of effectiveness of sex offender therapists vary widely and that the court’s ability to effectively determine appropriate sentencing and monitoring for sex offenders, thus curtailing the incidence of recidivism in such offenders and enhancing the protection of victims and potential victims, is undermined by a lack of regulated standards of practice and professional responsibility.

      (3) The Legislative Assembly recognizes the right of sex offender therapists to practice, consistent with the paramount requirement of public safety. Public safety is best served by regulating sex offender therapists whose clients are being treated under alternative sentencing or disposition, parole, post-prison supervision, supervision by a county juvenile department or custody of the Oregon Health Authority or the Oregon Youth Authority.

      (4) ORS 675.375 establishes the titles certified clinical sex offender therapist and certified associate sex offender therapist. ORS 675.360 to 675.410 do not prohibit others from providing services to treat sex offenders. However, only those certified under ORS 675.360 to 675.410 shall represent the designated titles to the public. Adult and juvenile parole and probation authorities and the Oregon Health Authority may restrict their referrals to those providers who are certified under ORS 675.360 to 675.410. [2007 c.841 §1; 2009 c.595 §1049]

 

      Note: 675.360 to 675.410 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 675 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.
