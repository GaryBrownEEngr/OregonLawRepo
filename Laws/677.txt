      (a) Have attended and graduated from a school of medicine.

The acts or conduct in question must be rationally connected to the applicant’s fitness to practice medicine.

      (2) If an applicant establishes that the applicant is of good moral character and has qualifications which the board determines are the equivalent of the qualifications required by subsection (1)(a) to (c) of this section, the applicant satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.

In all such examinations an average score of not less than 75 is required for passing. The Oregon Medical Board may require the applicant to take and pass the Federation Licensing Examination, also known as FLEX.

      (2) The Oregon Medical Board may accept a certificate issued by the National Board of Medical Examiners of the United States or the National Board of Examiners for Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons or the Medical Council of Canada or successful completion of the United States Medical Licensing Examination in lieu of its own examination.

      (3) If an applicant fails the examination, the board may permit the applicant to take a subsequent examination, if the applicant has otherwise complied with the law and the rules of the board.

      (4) After any applicant satisfactorily passes the examination in the required subjects, and otherwise complies with the law and the rules of the board, the board shall grant a license to the applicant to practice medicine in Oregon.

      (A) Traditional and modern techniques of diagnosis and evaluation;

The board shall not issue such a license unless the requirements of the other state or territory are similar to the requirements of this state.

      (3) The board shall examine the qualifications of an applicant and determine who shall be authorized to practice acupuncture.

      (4) Using the term “acupuncture,” “acupuncturist,” “Oriental medicine” or any other term, title, name or abbreviation indicating that an individual is qualified or licensed to practice acupuncture is prima facie evidence of practicing acupuncture.

      677.765 Unauthorized practice by acupuncturist. Performance of acupuncture without licensure or after the termination of licensure by the Oregon Medical Board or in the absence of renewal of licensure constitutes the unauthorized practice of medicine and subjects the person to the penalties provided by ORS 677.990.
