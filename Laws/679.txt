Upon expiration of the term of probation, further proceedings shall be abated by the board if the person holding the license furnishes the board with evidence that the person is competent to practice dentistry and has complied with the terms of probation.

      (10) The board may impose against any person who violates the provisions of this chapter or ORS 680.010 to 680.205 or rules of the board a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation. Any civil penalty imposed under this section shall be imposed in the manner provided in ORS 183.745.
