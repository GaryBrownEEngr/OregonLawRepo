      (1) “Board” means the Oregon Board of Optometry.

      (2) “Optometric nontopical formulary” means the list of nontopical pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of diseases of the human eye and the protocols for their usage adopted by the Council on Optometric Nontopical Formulary under ORS 683.240 (2).

      (3) “Practice of optometry” means the use of any means other than invasive or laser surgery, or the prescription of Schedule I and II drugs or pharmaceutical agents that are not on the optometric nontopical formulary, for diagnosis and treatment in the human eye, for the measurement or assistance of the powers or range of human vision or the determination of the accommodative and refractive states of the human eye or the scope of its functions in general or the adaptation of lenses or frames for the aid thereof, subject to the limitations of ORS 683.040. “Practice of optometry” includes the prescription of Schedule II hydrocodone-combination drugs for the purposes listed in this subsection.

      (4) “Trial frames” or “test lenses” means any frame or lens used in testing the eye which is not sold and not for sale. [Amended by 1971 c.102 §1; 1975 c.175 §1; 1989 c.443 §1; 1991 c.904 §4; 1991 c.967 §1; 2001 c.632 §1; 2015 c.18 §1]

In any prosecution for the violation of this section, the use of test cards, test lenses or of trial frames is prima facie evidence of the practice of optometry. [Amended by 1971 c.102 §2; 1987 c.443 §1]

 

      683.030 Persons and practices not affected. ORS 683.010 to 683.340 may not be construed:

      (2) The board shall keep a record showing the registered address of each optometrist.

      (3) Any notice required to be given by the board to any optometrist may be given by mailing it to the optometrist at the last registered address of the optometrist through the United States mail postpaid. [Amended by 1987 c.443 §3]

[Amended by 1987 c.443 §4]

 

      683.120 License renewal; fee; effect of failure to renew license.

However, before setting aside the revocation of any license the board may, in its discretion, require the applicant to pass the regular examination given for applicants. [Amended by 1985 c.103 §7; 1987 c.443 §7; 2005 c.379 §4]

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, any manufacturing, surfacing or dispensing optician may grind any such lens in conformity with the signed prescription or instruction, followed by a written prescription, of any optometrist duly licensed to practice in this state and any dispensing optician may supply any such lens in conformity with the prescription.

      (B) More than two medications are required to control the glaucoma; or

      (C) A secondary glaucoma develops.

      (b) Glaucoma shall be considered to be progressing if, in comparison to prior examinations, there is a reproducible worsening of the patient’s visual field as measured by standard threshold testing or if there is a worsening of the patient’s optic nerve as measured by direct observation or standard imaging technology or by rising eye pressure despite the use of medication. Glaucoma shall be considered to be under control if target eye pressure, individualized for each patient, is maintained with no abnormal glaucomatous progression.

      (c) For purposes of this subsection, a combination medication that contains two pharmacologic agents shall be considered one medication. [2007 c.818 §2]

 

      Note: 683.200 was added to and made a part of 683.010 to 683.310 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      683.210 Continuing education requirement; fee; rules. (1) All optometrists licensed in the State of Oregon are and shall be required to satisfactorily complete courses of study and satisfactorily continue their education by other means as determined by the Oregon Board of Optometry in subjects relating to the practice of the profession of optometry. The study and continued education shall be for the purpose of maintaining and advancing the professional skills and abilities of such licensees and for the purpose of educating such licensees in the utilization and application of new techniques, scientific and clinical advances and the achievements of research so that expansive and comprehensive care to the public will be assured. The length, details and nature of such study and continued education shall be determined by the board.

      (2) Attendance at any approved courses or other approved means of continuing education are to be certified to the board upon a form provided by the board and shall be submitted by each optometrist at the time designated by the board but in any case no less frequently than once every two years. In addition to other means of providing such courses and education facilities, the board is authorized to contract for the providing of educational programs to fulfill the requirements of this section and ORS 683.140. The board is further authorized to treat funds set aside for the purpose of continuing education as state funds for the purpose of accepting any funds made available under federal law on a matching basis for the promulgation and maintenance of programs of continuing education. In no instance may the board require a greater number of hours of study than it provides or approves in the State of Oregon and that are available on the same basis to all licensed optometrists. The board shall be allowed to waive the requirements of this section and ORS 683.140 in cases of illness, undue hardship or other similar appropriate reasons.

      (3) The board may levy an additional fee for each license renewal to carry out the provisions of this section and ORS 683.140.
