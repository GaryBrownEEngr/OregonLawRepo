No person shall remove or dispose of such embargoed drug or device by sale or otherwise without the permission of the board or its agent or, after summary proceedings have been instituted, without permission from the court.

      (b) When a drug or device detained or embargoed under paragraph (a) of this subsection has been declared by such representative to be adulterated, misbranded or a new drug, or rendered unsafe, the board shall, as soon as practical thereafter, petition the judge of the circuit court in whose jurisdiction the article is detained or embargoed for an order for condemnation of such article. If the judge determines that the drug or device so detained or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded or rendered unsafe, the board shall direct the immediate removal of the tag or other marking.

      (c) If the court finds the detained or embargoed drug or device is adulterated or misbranded or rendered unsafe, such drug or device, after entry of the judgment, shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner under the supervision of a board representative and all court costs and fees, storage and other proper expense shall be borne by the owner of such drug or device. When the adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the drug or device, the court, after entry of the judgment and after such costs, fees and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond has been posted, may direct that such drug or device be delivered to the owner thereof for such labeling or processing under the supervision of a board representative. Expense of such supervision shall be paid by the owner. Such bond shall be returned to the owner of the drug or device on representation to the court by the board that the drug or device is no longer in violation of the embargo and the expense of supervision has been paid.

      (d) It is the duty of the Attorney General to whom the board reports any violation of this subsection to cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted in the proper court without delay and to be prosecuted in the manner required by law. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the board to report violations whenever the board believes the public’s interest will be adequately served in the circumstances by a suitable written notice or warning.

      (e) “Therapeutically equivalent” means drugs that are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for interstate distribution and the Food and Drug Administration has determined that the drugs will provide essentially the same efficacy and toxicity when administered to an individual in the same dosage regimen.

      (2) Except as limited by subsections (3) and (5) of this section, unless the purchaser instructs otherwise, a pharmacist may substitute as follows:

      (a) A drug product with the same generic name in the same strength, quantity, dose and dosage form as the prescribed drug which is, in the pharmacist’s professional opinion, therapeutically equivalent.

      (b) When the prescriber is not reasonably available for consultation and the prescribed drug does not utilize a unique delivery system technology, an oral tablet, capsule or liquid form of the prescribed drug so long as the form dispensed or administered has the same strength, dose and dose schedule and is therapeutically equivalent to the drug prescribed.

      (10) A substitution of drugs made by a pharmacist or the pharmacist’s employer in accordance with this section and any rules that the State Board of Pharmacy may adopt thereunder does not constitute evidence of negligence if the substitution was made within reasonable and prudent practice of pharmacy or if the substituted drug was accepted in a generally recognized formulary or government list.

      (11) Failure of a practitioner to specify that no substitution is authorized does not constitute evidence of negligence unless the practitioner knows that the health condition of the patient for whom the practitioner is prescribing warrants the use of the brand name drug product and not the substituted drug.

MISCELLANEOUS

 

      689.605 Power to dispense drugs from hospital pharmacies, drug rooms and penal institutions; rules. (1) In a hospital or long term care facility having a pharmacy and employing a pharmacist, the pharmacy and pharmacist are subject to the requirements of this chapter, except that in a hospital when a pharmacist is not in attendance, pursuant to standing orders of the pharmacist, a registered nurse supervisor on the written order of a person authorized to prescribe a drug may withdraw such drug in such volume or amount as needed for administration to or treatment of an inpatient or outpatient until regular pharmacy services are available in accordance with the rules adopted by the board. However, the State Board of Pharmacy may grant an exception to the requirement for a written order by issuing a special permit authorizing the registered nurse supervisor in a hospital to dispense medication on the oral order of a person authorized to prescribe a drug. An inpatient care facility which does not have a pharmacy must have a drug room. In an inpatient care facility having a drug room as may be authorized by rule of the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, the drug room is not subject to the requirements of this chapter relating to pharmacies. However, a drug room must be supervised by a pharmacist and is subject to the rules of the State Board of Pharmacy. When a pharmacist is not in attendance, any person authorized by the prescriber or by the pharmacist on written order may withdraw such drug in such volume or amount as needed for administration to or treatment of a patient, entering such withdrawal in the record of the responsible pharmacist.

      (2) In a hospital having a drug room, any drug may be withdrawn from storage in the drug room by a registered nurse supervisor on the written order of a licensed practitioner in such volume or amount as needed for administration to and treatment of an inpatient or outpatient in the manner set forth in subsection (1) of this section and within the authorized scope of practice.

      (3) A hospital having a drug room shall cause accurate and complete records to be kept of the receipt, withdrawal from stock and use or other disposal of all legend drugs stored in the drug room. Such record shall be open to inspection by agents of the board and other qualified authorities.

      (4) In an inpatient care facility other than a hospital, the drug room shall contain only prescribed drugs already prepared for patients therein and such emergency drug supply as may be authorized by rule by the Department of Human Services.

      (5) The requirements of this section shall not apply to facilities described in ORS 441.065.

      (6) A registered nurse who is an employee of a local health department that is registered by the board under ORS 689.305 may, pursuant to the order of a person authorized to prescribe a drug or device, dispense a drug or device to a client of the local health department for purposes of caries prevention, birth control or prevention or treatment of a communicable disease. Such dispensing shall be subject to rules jointly adopted by the board and the Oregon Health Authority.

      (7) The board shall adopt rules authorizing a pharmacist to delegate to a registered nurse the authority to withdraw prescription drugs from a manufacturer’s labeled container for administration to persons confined in penal institutions including, but not limited to, adult and juvenile correctional facilities. A penal institution, in consultation with a pharmacist, shall develop policies and procedures regarding medication management, procurement and distribution. A pharmacist shall monitor a penal institution for compliance with the policies and procedures and shall perform drug utilization reviews. The penal institution shall submit to the board for approval a written agreement between the pharmacist and the penal institution regarding medication policies and procedures.
