      (3) “Secondhand watch” means:

      (a) A watch which, as a whole, or the case thereof, or the movement thereof, has been sold to a consumer. However, a watch which has been so sold, and is thereafter returned within a period of six months from the date of the original sale, either through an exchange or for credit, to the same person who sold the watch to the consumer, shall not be deemed to be a secondhand watch for the purpose of ORS 695.210 to 695.240 if the vendor keeps a written record setting forth the name and address of the consumer, the date of the sale to the consumer, the name of the watch or its maker, and the serial number, if any, on the case and the movement of the watch, or other distinguishing numbers or identification marks, such record to be kept for at least three years from the date of the sale of the watch.

      (b) Any watch whose case or movement, serial numbers or other distinguishing numbers or identification marks have been erased, defaced, removed, altered or covered.

 

      695.220 Secondhand watch tag requirement. Any person who sells, exchanges, offers to sell or exchange, exposes for sale or exchange, or possesses with intent to sell or exchange, a secondhand watch, shall affix and keep affixed to the same a tag with the words “secondhand” legibly written or printed thereon in the English language.

 

      695.230 Delivery of invoice to vendee; contents; duplicate invoice. Any person who sells a secondhand watch shall deliver to the vendee a written invoice setting forth the name and address of the vendor, the name and address of the vendee, the date of the sale, the name of the watch or its maker, and the serial numbers, if any, or other distinguishing numbers or identification marks on its case and movement. If the serial numbers, or other distinguishing numbers or identification marks have been erased, defaced, removed, altered or covered, this shall be set forth in the invoice. A duplicate of the invoice shall be kept on file by the vendor of the secondhand watch for at least one year from the date of the sale thereof.
