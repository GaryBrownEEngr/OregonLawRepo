      696.255 Nonresident license equivalent to appointment of commissioner as agent for service of process; service on commissioner; fee. (1) The acceptance by a nonresident of a real estate license shall be considered equivalent to an appointment by the nonresident of the Real Estate Commissioner as the nonresident licensee’s true and lawful attorney, upon whom may be served any lawful summons, process or pleading in any action or suit against the nonresident licensee in any court of this state, arising out of any business done by the nonresident licensee as a real estate licensee in this state. The acceptance shall be considered equivalent to an agreement by the nonresident licensee that any summons, process or pleading so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on the nonresident licensee personally in this state.

      (2) If it appears by the certificate of the sheriff of the county in which an action or suit has been filed against a nonresident licensee, that the defendant cannot be found in this state, service of any summons, process or pleading in the action or suit may be made by leaving a copy thereof, with a fee of $2, in the hands of the commissioner or in the commissioner’s office. Such service shall be sufficient and valid personal service upon the defendant; provided that:

      (a) Notice of the service and copy of the summons, process or pleading is sent forthwith by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt by the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney to the defendant, at the most recent address furnished to the commissioner by the nonresident licensee or to the nonresident licensee’s last-known address; and

      (b) The affidavit of the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney of the mailing is appended to the summons, process or pleading and entered as a part of the return thereof.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, personal service outside of the state in accordance with the statutes relating to personal service of summons outside of the state shall relieve the plaintiff from the mailing requirement under this section.

      (4) Any summons served as provided in this section shall require the defendant to appear and answer the complaint within four weeks after receipt thereof by the commissioner.

      (5) The fee of $2 paid by the plaintiff to the commissioner shall be taxed as costs in favor of the plaintiff if the plaintiff prevails in the action.

      (6) The commissioner shall keep a record of each summons, process or pleading served upon the commissioner under this section, showing the day and hour of service. [1981 c.617 §12a; 1989 c.532 §9; 1991 c.249 §62]

      (B) The nonresident real estate broker does not conduct in this state any acts constituting professional real estate activity and for which compensation is paid. If a country does not license real estate brokers, the payee must be a citizen or resident of the country and represent that the payee is in the business of real estate brokerage in the other country.

      (2) A real estate broker associated with a principal real estate broker may not accept compensation from any person other than the principal real estate broker with whom the real estate broker is associated at the time.

The real estate licensee may not conduct professional real estate activity under a business organization created pursuant to this subsection.

      (5) Nothing in this section prevents payment of compensation earned by a real estate broker or principal real estate broker while licensed because of the real estate broker’s or principal real estate broker’s association with a different principal real estate broker or because of inactivation of the real estate broker’s or principal real estate broker’s license. The compensation may be paid directly to the real estate licensee by the principal real estate broker with whom the real estate licensee was associated at the time the professional real estate activity for which the compensation was earned was conducted.

      (6) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section prohibits a principal real estate broker or licensed real estate property manager who has a property management agreement with the owner of a residential building or facility from authorizing the payment of a referral fee, rent credit or other compensation to an existing tenant of the owner or real estate licensee, or a former tenant if the former tenant resided in the building or facility within the previous six months, as compensation for referring new tenants to the real estate licensee.

      (A) Before the out-of-state real estate licensee performs any act in this state that constitutes professional real estate activity, the real estate licensee and the cooperating Oregon principal real estate broker agree in writing that the acts constituting professional real estate activity conducted in this state will be under the supervision and control of the cooperating Oregon principal real estate broker and will comply with all applicable Oregon laws;

      696.320 Effect of suspension or revocation of principal broker license on associated licensees. The suspension or revocation of a principal real estate broker’s license renders inactive every license of the real estate brokers engaged by the principal real estate broker pending a transfer of the license. The Real Estate Agency shall transfer a license rendered inactive under this section if the real estate licensee requests a transfer within 30 days after the effective date of the suspension or revocation of the principal real estate broker’s license and pays a transfer fee.

      (2) For purposes of a contested case hearing under ORS chapter 183, a persistent course of dealing by the real estate licensee who violated a provision of ORS 696.010 to 696.495, 696.600 to 696.785, 696.800 to 696.870 or 696.890, or a rule adopted pursuant to those sections, constitutes prima facie evidence that an associated real estate licensee had knowledge of the violation by the real estate licensee. [2017 c.234 §2]

      (2) If upon investigation it appears that such agent is so conducting business the commissioner may, in addition to any other remedies, bring action in the name and on behalf of the State of Oregon against such person and any other person acting in violation of ORS 696.505 to 696.590, to enjoin such person and such other person from continuing any act in violation of ORS 696.505 to 696.590.

      (3) The circuit court of any county of this state is vested with jurisdiction to restrain illegal practices or transactions and may grant injunctions to prevent and restrain such illegal practices or transactions, in addition to the penalties and other remedies provided in ORS 696.505 to 696.590. The court shall have power, during the pendency of the proceedings before it to issue such preliminary restraining orders as may appear to be just and proper; and the findings of the commissioner shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence and sufficient ground, in the discretion of the court, for the issue ex parte of a preliminary restraining order.

      (4) In any such court proceedings the commissioner may apply for and on due showing be entitled to have issued the court’s subpoena requiring forthwith the appearance of any defendant and employees of the defendant and the production of documents, books and records as may appear necessary for the hearing of such petition, to testify and give evidence concerning the acts or conduct or things complained of in such application for injunction.

      (2) Pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the commissioner may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the agent’s principal place of business is located for an order directing the agent to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed to take charge of and manage or liquidate if necessary the assets of the agent utilized in professional escrow activity in such a manner as to prevent or minimize such financial loss to others.

      (3) If the court is satisfied from reading the commissioner’s petition that the facts therein alleged, if established, warrant such receivership action, the court shall issue such order to show cause. The court may at such time, without notice, issue a temporary injunction restraining such agent, or any of the agent’s officers, directors, stockholders, members, agents or employees, from the transaction of any professional escrow activity, or the waste or disposition of any such assets until further order of the court. Should such an injunction be issued, a hearing on whether the injunction shall be continued shall be held within five business days of its service.

      (4) On return of the order to show cause, and after a full hearing, the court shall either deny the application or grant the same, together with such other relief as the court may deem necessary.

      (a) The depositing principal gives prior written approval to the escrow agent for such investment after receiving written disclosure as may be required by rule adopted by the commissioner;

      (b) The depositing principal releases the escrow agent from any liability for loss of the trust funds;

      (6) If the trust funds to be invested represent earnest money in a transaction, both principals in the transaction must give prior written approval for the investment and are both considered depositing principals.

      (1) Proceed with an investigation of the licensee;

      (2) Conduct disciplinary proceedings relating to the licensee;

      (3) Take action against a licensee, including assessment of a civil penalty against the licensee for a violation of ORS 696.020 (2); or

      696.785 Commissioner duties when illegal commingling of funds found; receivership procedure. (1) When the Real Estate Commissioner ascertains by audit, investigation or otherwise that a real estate licensee has commingled trust funds with personal funds or has embezzled trust funds and that such activity is likely to cause significant financial loss to others as a result of professional real estate activity engaged in by such licensee, the commissioner may communicate such fact to the Attorney General, whereupon it shall become the duty of the Attorney General to forthwith assist the commissioner in instituting such proceedings as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

      (2) Pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the commissioner may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the licensee’s principal place of business is located for an order directing the licensee to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed to take charge of and manage or liquidate if necessary the assets of the licensee utilized in professional real estate activity in such a manner as to prevent or minimize such financial loss to others.

      (3) If the court is satisfied from reading the commissioner’s petition that the facts therein alleged, if established, warrant such receivership action, the court shall issue such order to show cause. The court may at such time, without notice, issue a temporary injunction restraining such licensee, or any of the licensee’s officers, directors, stockholders, members, agents or employees, from the transaction of any professional real estate activity, or the waste or disposition of any such assets until further order of the court. Should such an injunction be issued, a hearing on whether the injunction shall be continued shall be held within five business days of its service.

      (4) On return of the order to show cause, and after a full hearing, the court shall either deny the application or grant the same, together with such other relief as the court may deem necessary.
