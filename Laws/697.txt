      (c) The bond or an irrevocable letter of credit required by this subsection shall be continuously maintained in the amount required by this subsection. The aggregate liability of the surety under the bond for claims against the bond shall not exceed the penal sum of the bond no matter how many years the bond is in force.

      (5) If an out-of-state collection agency is not exempt from payment of a registration fee under this section, the registration fee for the out-of-state collection agency shall be not less than the fee charged by the state in which the out-of-state collection agency is located to a person who collects debts in that state only by means of interstate communications from the person’s location in another state.

      (6) If the director determines that the state where an out-of-state collection agency is located and registered, if required to be registered, exempts a collection agency located and registered in this state from registration requirements in that state, the director shall exempt out-of-state collection agencies located in that state from the registration requirements of ORS 697.005 to 697.095.
