      701.013 Intent relating to certain business license requirements. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to reduce the number of city business licenses that construction contractors are required to obtain in order to conduct business in the Portland metropolitan area. It is the purpose of this section and ORS 701.015 to enable construction contractors to secure from the metropolitan service district one business license that will permit the conduct of business by construction contractors in cities in which the contractors perform a limited amount of work and in which they do not have a principal place of business. Furthermore, it is also the intent of the Legislative Assembly that this section and ORS 701.015 apply only to construction contractors engaged in the building trades and crafts without regard to any subsequent expansion of the jurisdiction of the Construction Contractors Board over other trades and crafts. It is declared to be the policy of this state that, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the requirements of this section and ORS 701.015, the cities within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district be allowed to control the imposition of business license taxes and to maintain the level of revenues obtained from those taxes. The amount and trends of revenue produced or distributed to each city is intended to reflect the construction business activity within the participating cities. [1991 c.79 §1; 2001 c.409 §10; 2007 c.541 §43]

 

      Note: 701.013 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 701 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      701.015 Business license requirements in cities and metropolitan service districts; fees; distribution of fees. (1) A contractor shall pay directly to any city within the boundaries of a metropolitan service district any business license tax imposed by the city when:

      (a) The principal place of business of the contractor is within the city; or

      (b) The principal place of business of the contractor is not within the city but the contractor derives gross receipts of $250,000 or more from business conducted within the boundaries of the city during the calendar year for which the business license tax is owed.

      (2) A contractor who conducts business during any year in any city within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district other than a city to which the contractor has paid a business license tax for that year may apply for a business license from the metropolitan service district.

      (3) When a contractor obtains a business license from the metropolitan service district under subsection (2) of this section, if a city within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district other than a city to which the contractor is required to directly pay a business license tax under subsection (1) of this section demands payment of a business license tax by the contractor, the city shall waive such payment upon presentation of proof by the contractor that the contractor has a business license issued by the metropolitan service district. Possession by the contractor of a current business license issued by the metropolitan service district under subsection (2) of this section shall be proof sufficient to obtain the waiver described in this subsection.

      (4) The metropolitan service district shall issue a business license to a contractor when:

      (a) The contractor presents proof to the district that the contractor has paid the business license tax imposed by each city within the boundaries of the district to which the contractor must directly pay a business license tax under subsection (1) of this section; and

      (b) The contractor pays a license fee to the district. The license fee charged under this paragraph shall be twice the average business license tax charged contractors by cities located within the metropolitan service district plus an amount that is sufficient to reimburse the district for the administrative expenses of the district incurred in carrying out its duties under this section.

      (5) The metropolitan service district shall distribute the business license fees collected by the district under this section, less administrative expenses, to the cities that are located wholly or partly within the district and that collect a business license tax. In any year, each such city shall receive such share of the license fees as the number of residential building permits that it issued during that year bears to the total number of residential building permits that were issued during that year by all of the cities located wholly or partly within the district. Distribution of moneys under this subsection shall be made at least once in each year. The metropolitan service district shall determine the number of residential building permits issued by cities within the district from statistics.

      (6) As used in this section:

      (a) “Business license tax” means any fee paid by a person to a city or county for any form of license that is required by the city or county in order to conduct business in that city or county. The term does not include any franchise fee or privilege tax imposed by a city upon a public utility under ORS 221.420 or 221.450 or any provision of a city charter.

      (b) “Conducting business” means to engage in any activity in pursuit of gain including activities carried on by a person through officers, agents and employees as well as activities carried on by a person on that person’s own behalf.

      (c) “Principal place of business” means the location in this state of the central administrative office of a person conducting business in this state. [1987 c.581 §2; 1989 c.1064 §§1,2; 1991 c.79 §2; 1999 c.176 §1; 2007 c.541 §44; 2015 c.180 §49]

 

      701.020 Certain cities exempt from application of ORS 701.015. (1) A city that imposes a business license tax based on or measured by adjusted net income earned by conducting business within the city shall be exempt from ORS 701.015.

      (2) As used in this section, “business license tax” has the meaning given that term in ORS 701.015. [1987 c.581 §7]

 

      Note: 701.020 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 701 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (3) The surety bond for a residential contractor must provide that the applicant, with regard to work subject to this chapter, will pay amounts determined by the board as provided under ORS 701.145. The surety bond for a commercial contractor must provide that the applicant, with regard to work subject to this chapter, will pay amounts determined by the board as provided under ORS 701.146. Bonds filed under this section shall remain in effect for at least one year or until depleted by payments under ORS 701.150, 701.153 and 701.157, unless the surety sooner cancels the bond. At the discretion of the surety the bond may be continued for an additional period by continuation certificate. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the aggregate liability of the surety under the bond for complaints against the contractor may not exceed the penal sum of the bond no matter how many years the bond is in force. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an extension by continuation certificate, reinstatement, reissue or renewal of the bond may not increase the liability of the surety.

      (4) The board, by rule, may require a licensee to obtain a new surety bond if, pursuant to a board determination issued under ORS 701.145 or 701.146, the surety pays an amount out of the bond of the licensee. The new surety bond must be in the applicable amount set forth in ORS 701.081 or 701.084 unless a higher amount is required by a board condition or rule described in subsection (5) or (6) of this section. The board may allow a licensee to obtain, instead of a new bond, a certification that the surety remains liable for the full penal sum of the bond, notwithstanding payment by the surety on the complaint.

      (5) If the amount the licensee must pay against the bond under subsection (3) of this section exceeds the amount of the bond, the board shall suspend the contractor’s license until the amount owed is paid. The board, as a condition of ending the suspension, may require a contractor requesting reinstatement of a license to file a bond of an amount up to five times as much as the amount required ordinarily of a licensee under ORS 701.081 or 701.084.

      (6) The board by rule may establish conditions for applicants or persons licensed under this chapter under which the applicant or licensee must file a bond of an amount up to five times as much as the amount required ordinarily of an applicant or licensee under ORS 701.081 or 701.084. The board may reduce the amount of bond it would otherwise require if the contractor demonstrates satisfactory completion of approved elective classes on dispute resolution and prevention, basic accounting and record keeping or such other classes as the board may prescribe.

      (7) The bond required under this section is for the exclusive purpose of payment of amounts for which the board has determined the surety to have responsibility.

      (8) Upon issuance of a determination under ORS 701.145 or 701.146 for a complaint against a contractor who holds a bond required under this section, the board shall notify the surety on the bond of the determination in a manner determined by the board by rule. The notification shall include a list of all board determinations for payment by the surety from the bond.

      (9) A court action may not be commenced against a surety on a bond required under this section until 30 days after the date that the surety is notified by the board under ORS 701.150 that payment is due on the determination.

      (10) In any action against a surety on a bond under this section that is based on the failure of the surety to pay an amount determined by the board, the court may award:

      (a) Costs;

      (b) Reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party as part of the costs; and

      (c) Twice the amount that the board determined the surety must pay on the complaint, if the surety arbitrarily and capriciously refused to pay. [Formerly 701.085; 2009 c.225 §1; 2011 c.630 §§39,60; 2016 c.99 §2]

      701.145 Resolution of complaints involving work on residential structures or certain small commercial structures. For a complaint described in ORS 701.139 (1) or (3)(a) or a complaint under ORS 701.139 (3)(b) that a complainant elects to have resolved under this section:

      (1) The complainant must file the complaint with the Construction Contractors Board in a form prescribed by the board.

      (2) The board may suspend processing of the complaint if:

      (a) The same facts and issues involved in the complaint have been submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction for determination or have been submitted to any other entity authorized by law or the parties to effect a resolution or settlement; or

      (b) The board determines that the nature or complexity of the dispute described in the complaint is such that a court is the appropriate forum for the adjudication of the dispute.

      (3) The board may dismiss or close the complaint as established by rule of the board if any of the following conditions apply:

      (a) The complainant does not respond to a board request and the request is necessary to the board’s investigation of the complaint.

      (b) The complainant does not allow the board to conduct one or more on-site meetings to mediate or investigate the complaint.

      (4) Upon acceptance of the complaint, the board shall give notice to the contractor against whom the complaint is made and shall initiate proceedings to determine board jurisdiction over the complaint. The board shall attempt to conduct one or more meetings on-site or by telephone to mediate a dispute. During mediation of a dispute, the board may recommend to the contractor such action as the board considers appropriate to compensate the complainant. If the contractor performs accordingly, the board shall give that fact due consideration in any subsequent disciplinary proceeding brought by the board.

      (5) If the parties do not resolve or settle the complaint, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the complainant may recover payment from the bond of the contractor only by obtaining:

      (a) A final judgment against the contractor issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or

      (b) An arbitration award against the contractor that a court has reduced to a final judgment.

      (6) If the complaint is filed under ORS 701.140 (4), the complainant may recover payment from the bond of the contractor as provided in subsection (5)(a) of this section or by obtaining a final order issued by the Bureau of Labor and Industries that states an amount of unpaid wages that the licensed contractor owes under ORS 652.140 or 653.010 to 653.261.

      (7) For purposes of subsections (5) and (6) of this section, “final” means that the judgment or order has become final by operation or law or on appeal.

      (8) The board shall send the surety on the contractor bond required under ORS 701.068 a copy of the final judgment or bureau final order, and a copy of a determination issued by the board that the surety must pay the amount stated by the board. A determination issued by the board may not include payment of any attorney fees awarded in the final judgment or bureau final order. The determination issued by the board is an order in other than a contested case proceeding. The determination order is not recordable under ORS 701.153 (1) and (2) to create a lien.

      701.146 Resolution of complaints involving work on large commercial structures or certain small commercial structures. For a complaint described in ORS 701.139 (2) or (3)(c) or a complaint under ORS 701.139 (3)(b) that a complainant elects to have resolved under this section:

      (1) The person seeking to file the complaint with the Construction Contractors Board must:

      (a) Bring an action on the dispute against the licensed contractor in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

      (b) Initiate a proceeding to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration substantially in conformance with ORS 36.600 to 36.740.

      (2) The complainant must file the complaint with the Construction Contractors Board by delivering to the board a copy of the complainant’s court pleading or the demand for arbitration or other document necessary to initiate arbitration. The pleading, demand or other document must be accompanied by a completed board complaint form. The complainant must also give notice to the surety on the bond by delivering to the surety a copy of the complainant’s court pleading or the demand for arbitration or other document necessary to initiate arbitration and a copy of the completed board complaint form. Delivery to the board and the surety must be accomplished by certified mail, return receipt requested, no later than the earlier of:

      (a) The 90th day after filing the court action or after filing or making the arbitration demand or other initiation of arbitration;

      (b) The 14th day before the first day of trial or arbitration; or

      (c) The 30th day before:

      (A) The court issues a judgment in the action; or

      (B) The arbitrator issues an award on the arbitration.

      (3) Filing the complaint with the board under subsection (2) of this section constitutes filing the complaint for purposes of establishing timeliness of the complaint under ORS 701.143 and priority of the complaint for possible payment from the bond under ORS 701.157.

      (4) Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (7) of this section, if the complainant properly gives notice to the surety under subsection (2) of this section, a judgment or award against the contractor entered in the action or arbitration is binding on the surety. If the complainant delivers the notice required under subsection (2) of this section to the wrong surety, the surety receiving the notice may avoid being bound by a judgment or award by delivering notice of the mistake to the complainant or the complainant’s attorney of record, and to the board, on or before the 30th day after the surety receives notice under subsection (2) of this section. Delivery of the notice of mistake must be by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by facsimile machine or other form of transmission with an acknowledgment of receipt.

      (5) A surety under subsection (2) of this section has an absolute right to intervene in an action or arbitration brought or initiated under subsection (1) of this section. A complainant may not join a surety as a party to an action or arbitration unless the complainant disputes the validity or timeliness of the surety’s notice of mistake or the surety disputes the validity or timeliness of the delivery to the surety of the notice required by subsection (2) of this section. If the surety elects to intervene or is joined as a party, the surety is bound by all issues of fact and law determined by the court or arbitrator and may not seek board review of those determinations.

      (6) If a court issues a judgment on an action, or reduces an arbitration award to judgment, against a contractor on a complaint described in subsection (1) of this section, the complainant must deliver a certified copy of the judgment to the board and to the surety no later than the 30th day after entry of the judgment in order to maintain the complaint and possibly receive payment from the bond. The entry of a final judgment against the contractor concludes the contractor’s involvement in any proceedings to determine whether the complaint is subject to payment from the bond. The complainant and the surety are the only parties to the administrative process set forth in subsection (7) of this section.

      (7) Upon receipt of a timely delivered certified copy of the judgment as described in subsection (6) of this section, the board shall issue a determination that the surety must pay the amount stated by the board. The determination issued by the board is an order in other than a contested case proceeding. The determination shall include the amount of the judgment together with any costs, interest and attorney fees awarded under the judgment, to the extent that the judgment, costs, interest and fees are within the jurisdiction of the board. The board’s determination of the complaint is limited to whether the complaint comes within the jurisdiction of the board and is subject to payment by the surety.

      701.149 Status reports; alternative dispute resolution. (1) If the Construction Contractors Board suspends the processing of a complaint because of the complaint having been submitted to a court or arbitrator or because of a court having stayed action on the complaint, the board may require that the complainant provide status reports on the pending court action or arbitration. The board may dismiss or close a complaint filed under ORS 701.139 if the complainant fails to submit status reports on a pending court action or arbitration.

      (2) ORS 183.605 to 183.690 do not limit in any way the ability of the board to make full use of alternative dispute resolution, including mediation or referral for arbitration, to resolve complaints against contractors filed under ORS 701.139. [2005 c.207 §2; 2007 c.793 §18; 2011 c.630 §§48,68; 2016 c.99 §10]

 

      701.150 Determination of amount to be paid from bond. (1) If a licensed contractor fails to pay a complainant amounts due under a court judgment or under a final order of the Bureau of Labor and Industries, the Construction Contractors Board shall issue a determination stating the amount that a surety must pay the complainant. The surety shall pay the amount required under the determination as follows:

      (a) If the complaint was filed under ORS 701.145, the surety shall pay the amount from a bond required for a residential contractor.

      (b) If the complaint was filed under ORS 701.146, the surety shall pay the amount from a bond required for a commercial contractor.

      (2) The surety may not pay on a complaint until the surety receives notice from the board that the complaint is ready for payment.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 701.153 and 701.157, a bond is not subject to payment for a complaint that is filed more than 14 months after the earlier of:

      (a) The expiration or cancellation date of the license that was in force when the work that is the subject of the complaint was completed or abandoned; or

      (b) The date that the surety canceled the bond. [1971 c.740 §17; 1973 c.832 §60; 1981 c.618 §7; 1983 c.616 §15; 1987 c.414 §40c; 1989 c.928 §18; 1991 c.181 §11; 1997 c.387 §7; 1999 c.59 §208; 1999 c.402 §32; 2001 c.197 §16; 2001 c.427 §1a; 2007 c.793 §19; 2007 c.836 §69; 2011 c.630 §§49,69; 2016 c.99 §11]

 

      701.153 Recording of order as lien; satisfaction of order against residential contractor. (1) If an order of the Construction Contractors Board determines a complaint against a residential contractor that was filed with the board prior to July 1, 2011, and the order becomes final by operation of law or on appeal and remains unpaid 10 days after the date the order becomes final, the complainant may file the order with the county clerk in any county of this state.

      (2) Upon receipt of an order described in subsection (1) of this section, the clerk shall record the order in the County Clerk Lien Record. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, recording an order described in subsection (1) of this section in the County Clerk Lien Record pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect provided for in ORS 205.125 and 205.126, and the order may be enforced as provided in ORS 205.125 and 205.126.

      (3)(a) Payments from the surety bond of a residential contractor pursuant to a board determination under ORS 701.145 are satisfied in the following priority in any 90-day period:

      (A) Board determinations as a result of complaints against a residential contractor by the owner of a residential or small commercial structure have payment priority to the full extent of the bond over all other types of complaints.

      (B) If the determinations described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph do not exhaust the bond, then amounts due under board determinations for all other types of residential or small commercial structure complaints filed with the board within that 90-day period may be paid from the bond, except that the total amount paid from any one bond to nonowner complainants may not exceed $3,000.

      (b) A 90-day period begins on the date the first complaint is filed with the board. Subsequent 90-day periods begin on the date the first complaint is filed with the board after the close of the preceding 90-day period.

      (4) If the total amount payable under determinations issued by the board for complaints against a residential contractor filed with the board within 90 days after the board receives notice of the first complaint against the contractor exceed the amount of the bond available for payment, subject to the priorities under this section, the board shall decide how payment of the determined amounts from the bond is to be apportioned.

      (5) If the total amount payable under determinations issued by the board as a result of complaints that were filed with the board within 90 days after the board receives notice of the first complaint do not exceed the amount of the bond available for payment, those determinations have payment priority over amounts due under determinations resulting from subsequently filed complaints.

      (6) The total amount paid from a residential contractor bond for costs and interest under all determinations issued by the board under ORS 701.145 may not exceed $3,000. [2007 c.836 §10; 2007 c.836 §52; 2011 c.630 §§50,70; 2016 c.99 §12]

      (3) If the total amounts due as a result of complaints filed with the board within 90 days after the first complaint is filed do not exceed the amount of the bond available for those complaints, all amounts due as a result of complaints filed within the 90-day period shall have priority over all complaints subsequently filed until the amount of the bond available for the payment of complaints is exhausted.

If after receipt of the notice of noncompliance the person fails within the 10-day period specified in the notice to demonstrate proof of compliance with the licensing requirements of this chapter, the inspector is authorized to order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in the activity. Any person so notified shall stop such work until proof of compliance is demonstrated.

The board may not place a contractor or subcontractor on the list if the only reason that the contractor or subcontractor did not make payment to a person when payment was due is that the contractor or subcontractor did not receive payment from the public contracting agency, contractor or subcontractor when payment was due. The contractor or subcontractor shall remain on the list for a period of not less than six months.

      (3) If the board determines that the information supplied to the board against a contractor or subcontractor was supplied in bad faith or was false, the person who supplied the information in bad faith or supplied false information shall be placed on the list of persons who have been determined to be not qualified to hold or participate in a public contract for a public improvement.

Partial payment allowed under this subsection is not acceptance or approval of some of the work or a waiver of defects in the work.

      (2) The owner, contractor or subcontractor shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month on the final payment due the contractor or subcontractor.

When the contractor or subcontractor considers the work that the contractor or subcontractor is contracted to perform to be complete, the contractor or subcontractor shall notify the party to whom the contractor or subcontractor is responsible for performing the construction work under the contract.

The term of the bond obtained under this subsection must extend to include the period during which claims of lien or notices of other encumbrances based on the construction performed under the contract may be filed under applicable law. The bond must be approved by the owner, contractor or subcontractor entitled to withhold retainage. A faithful performance bond delivered under this section must include, but not be limited to, provisions to the effect that:

      (1) The obligations of the contract must be faithfully performed;

(1) When a contractor on a public contract deposits bonds, securities or other instruments under ORS 279C.560 (4), if the subcontract price exceeds $50,000 and constitutes more than 10 percent of the cost of the public contract, a subcontractor on the public contract may deposit bonds, securities or other instruments with the contractor or in a bank or trust company for the contractor to hold for the contractor’s benefit in lieu of moneys held as retainage. If the contractor accepts the bonds, securities or other instruments deposited as provided in this subsection, the contractor shall reduce the moneys held as retainage in an amount equal to the value of the bonds, securities and other instruments and pay the amount of the reduction to the subcontractor in accordance with ORS 701.420 and 701.430. Interest or earnings on the bonds, securities or other instruments shall accrue to the subcontractor.

      (2) When a contractor on a public contract elects to have the public contracting agency deposit the accumulated retainage in an interest-bearing account under ORS 279C.560 (5), the contractor, within 30 days following payment of the final amount due for construction of the public improvement, shall pay to each subcontractor who performed work on the construction the subcontractor’s proportional share of the interest earnings that accrued to the contractor as a result of the election. A subcontractor’s share of the total amount of interest earnings under this subsection shall be determined by the proportion that the amount of retainage withheld from the subcontractor bears to the amount of retainage withheld from the contractor and the length of time the retainage was withheld from the subcontractor. A share of the interest earnings shall be paid to a subcontractor under this subsection only when:

      (a) Retainage is withheld from the subcontractor for more than 60 days after the day on which the first partial payment was due the subcontractor under the terms of the subcontract; and

      (b) The amount of interest earnings due the subcontractor exceeds $100.

      (3) If the contractor incurs additional costs as a result of the exercise of an option described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the contractor may recover the costs from the subcontractor by reducing the final payment. As work on the subcontract progresses, the contractor shall, upon demand, inform the subcontractor of all accrued additional costs.

      (4) Bonds, securities and other instruments deposited or acquired in lieu of retainage, as permitted by this section, must be of a character approved by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, including but not limited to:

      (a) Bills, certificates, notes or bonds of the United States.

      (b) Other obligations of the United States or agencies of the United States.

      (2) An owner sending a notice of defect under ORS 701.565 shall make the residence available for an inspection pursuant to any written request sent under ORS 701.570. The owner shall make the residence available for inspection during normal business hours or at a time that is mutually agreeable to the owner and the requester.

      (3) An inspection by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier may include any reasonable measures, including testing, for determining the nature, cause and extent of the defects described in the notice of defect or incidental damage and the nature and extent of the necessary remediation. Unless the contractor, subcontractor or supplier conducting the inspection and the owner agree otherwise, the contractor, subcontractor or supplier conducting the inspection shall repair any damage caused by the inspection. Any damage caused by the inspection that is not repaired may be sought as incidental damage in any subsequent arbitration or court action by an owner against the contractor, subcontractor or supplier conducting the inspection.

      (4) A contractor, subcontractor or supplier that requests to inspect a residence must include as part of the written response of the contractor, subcontractor or supplier under ORS 701.570, a written report or other document evidencing the result of the inspection and the existence or nonexistence of the defects described in the notice of defect or discovered during the inspection. [2003 c.660 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 701.560.

 

      701.580 Offer by contractor, subcontractor or supplier; effect of accepting offer; nonperformance; compelling arbitration or commencing court action; admissibility of response or reply. (1) An owner may accept an offer contained in a written response under ORS 701.570 by delivering a written acceptance to the offering contractor, subcontractor or supplier within 30 days after receiving the offer. If an owner fails to accept an offer within 30 days after receipt, the offer is deemed rejected.

      (2) If the owner accepts a contractor, subcontractor or supplier’s offer to perform remediation or to pay monetary compensation, completion of the remediation or payment satisfies the claims by the owner for those defects included in the offer for which remediation was performed or compensation paid, but not for any other defect. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, if the owner accepts an offer by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received a secondary notice, completion of the remediation or payment satisfies claims for those defects included in the offer for which remediation was performed or compensation paid, including claims by the owner and claims for contribution or indemnity against the contractor, subcontractor or supplier by the sender of the secondary notice, but not for any other defect.

      (3) If the owner accepts an offer by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received a secondary notice to perform remediation or to pay monetary compensation and the contractor, subcontractor or supplier fails to perform in accordance with the accepted offer, then the sender of the secondary notice may perform the remediation or pay the monetary compensation offered by the nonperforming contractor, subcontractor or supplier.

      (4) An owner that sends a notice of defect under ORS 701.565 may compel arbitration or commence a court action against a contractor, subcontractor or supplier if:

      (a) The contractor, subcontractor or supplier that receives the notice of defect sent under ORS 701.565 does not send a timely written response under ORS 701.570;

      (b) The written response of the contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received the notice of defect or a secondary notice does not offer remediation or monetary compensation;

      (c) The owner rejects a written offer, or any part thereof, made by the contractor, subcontractor or supplier; or

      (d) The contractor, subcontractor or supplier fails to perform in accordance with an accepted offer.

      (5) A notice of defect and the documents described in ORS 701.575 (4) are admissible in any arbitration or court action between or among an owner, contractor, subcontractor or supplier arising out of or related to the construction, alteration or repair of the residence.

      (6) Except as provided in this subsection, a written response containing an offer to perform remediation or pay monetary compensation made under ORS 701.570 (5) that is not accepted by the owner, and any reply by an owner, unless the reply contains a counteroffer accepted by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, are not admissible during any subsequent arbitration or court action. A response or reply described in this subsection is admissible solely for the purpose of proving that an owner is qualified to compel arbitration or commence a court action under subsection (4)(c) of this section or determining the timeliness of an action under ORS 701.585. [2003 c.660 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 701.560.

 

      701.585 Effect of notice of defect on time for commencing court action. (1) If an owner sends a contractor, subcontractor or supplier a notice of defect within the time allowed for the owner to commence a court action against that contractor, subcontractor or supplier for a claim described in ORS 701.565, the time for the owner to commence the action shall be extended, notwithstanding any statute of limitation or statute of ultimate repose, until the later of:

      (a) One hundred and twenty days after the owner receives a written response from the contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received the notice of defect if the written response does not contain a written offer to perform remediation or pay monetary compensation for one or more of the defects or incidental damage described in the notice of defect;

      (b) One hundred and twenty days after the owner rejects a written offer by any contractor, subcontractor or supplier to perform remediation or pay monetary compensation for one or more of the defects or incidental damage described in the notice of defect; or

      (c) Thirty days after the date specified in an accepted written offer by which the offering contractor, subcontractor or supplier is to complete the remediation or complete payment of monetary compensation for one or more of the defects and any incidental damage described in the notice of defect.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not shorten or terminate the time for bringing a claim in accordance with applicable statutes of ultimate repose and statutes of limitation.

      (3) Delivery of a secondary notice sent by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier under ORS 701.570 does not act to toll the expiration of any right of the owner to commence a court action against the recipient of the secondary notice.

      (4) Any remediation performed pursuant to an accepted offer made under ORS 701.570 does not constitute a new performance and, for purposes of ORS 12.135, relates back to the earliest date of substantial completion or abandonment of the construction, alteration or repair of the improvement to real property. [2003 c.660 §6]

      701.595 Failure to follow notice of defect procedure. If an owner compels arbitration or commences a court action against any contractor, subcontractor or supplier to assert a claim arising out of or related to the construction, alteration or repair of a residence located in this state and the owner has not followed the procedure set forth in ORS 701.565 and 701.575, the arbitrator or court must dismiss the arbitration or action without prejudice. The owner may not commence a new arbitration or action unless the owner follows the procedure set forth in ORS 701.565 and 701.575. [2003 c.660 §8]

      701.625 Progress payments; notice requirements; nonapproval of billing or estimate; withholding; final payment. (1) If a construction contract is for construction work that is expected to take 60 or more days to complete, an owner shall make progress payments to the original contractor. By mutual agreement with an original contractor, an owner may make progress payments to the original contractor under a construction contract for which the construction work is expected to take less than 60 days to complete.

      (2) The owner shall make progress payments on the basis of a certified billing or estimate for work performed, and for materials or products supplied, during the preceding monthly billing cycle or during an alternative billing cycle identified in the construction contract. If a construction contract identifies an alternative billing cycle, the construction contract must expressly state in a clear and conspicuous manner that there is an alternative billing cycle and the owner must provide on each page of drawings and specifications in the construction contract a statement substantially similar to the following:

______________________________________________________________________________

      (A) Make progress payments no later than 14 days after the date the billing is received; and

      (B) Make final payment of all remaining amounts no later than seven days after the date that the owner approves the work.

      (b) An owner may make progress payments or final payment later than the time allowed under paragraph (a) of this subsection if:

      (A) The owner provides drawings and specifications that expressly state in a clear and conspicuous manner that an extended payment period is allowed and identify the extended payment period as a specific number of days after the date that the billing or estimate is received or the date that the owner approves all work; and

      (B) The owner provides on each page of drawings and specifications a statement substantially similar to the following:

______________________________________________________________________________

Notice of Extended Payment Provision

 

      The construction contract will allow the owner to make:

      (1) Progress payments no later than _____ days after the date a billing or estimate is received.

      (2) Final payment of all remaining amounts no later than _____ days after the date the owner approves all work.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (4) Payment is not required under this section unless the owner receives from the original contractor a billing or estimate for the work performed or the materials or products supplied in accordance with the terms of the construction contract.

      (5) The owner is deemed to have received the billing or estimate when the billing or estimate is received by any person designated by the owner for the receipt, review or approval of the billing or estimate. A billing or estimate is deemed to be certified 10 days after the owner receives the billing or estimate, unless before that time the owner or the owner’s agent prepares and issues a written statement detailing those items in the billing or estimate that are not approved. An owner may decline to approve a billing or estimate or portion of a billing or estimate because of:

      (a) Unsatisfactory work progress;

      (b) Defective construction work, materials or products not remedied;

      (c) Disputed work, materials or products, except that the declined amount may not exceed 150 percent of the amount in dispute;

      (d) Failure to comply with other material provisions of the construction contract;

      (e) A third party claim being filed or reasonable evidence that a third party claim will be filed;

      (f) Failure of the original contractor or a subcontractor to make timely payments to subcontractors and material suppliers for labor, equipment, materials and products;

      (g) Damage to the owner;

      (h) Reasonable evidence that the construction contract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the construction contract sum; or

      (i) Other items as allowed under the construction contract terms and conditions.

      (6) An owner may extend the period within which the billing or estimate may be certified if:

      (a) The owner provides drawings and specifications that expressly allow in a clear and conspicuous manner an extended period within which a billing or estimate may be certified; and

      (b) The owner provides for each page of drawings and specifications, including bid drawings and specifications and construction drawings and specifications, a statement substantially similar to the following statement:

______________________________________________________________________________

Notice of

Extended Certification Period Provision

 

      The construction contract will allow the owner to certify billings and estimates no later than _____ days after the billings and estimates are received from the original contractor.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (7) Any requirement under this section that a statement be provided on a page of drawings or specifications may be satisfied by placing the required statement on either side of the page.

      (8) After a subcontractor or material supplier submits a bid or proposal or other written pricing information to an original contractor, an owner and the original contractor may agree in writing to change the specified number of days after certification during which the owner may make payment to the original contractor or within which the owner must certify a billing or estimate. The billings by any subcontractor or material supplier that does not provide written consent to the change remain subject to the certification period indicated in the drawings and specifications. A construction contract may not be changed in a manner that alters the right of any subcontractor or material supplier to receive prompt and timely progress payments as provided under ORS 701.630.

      (9) An owner may withhold from a progress payment an amount that is sufficient to pay the direct expenses the owner reasonably expects to incur to correct any items detailed in a written statement under subsection (5) of this section. The owner may also withhold a reasonable amount as retainage. As used in this subsection, “retainage” has the meaning given that term in ORS 701.410.

      (10) When an original contractor completes and an owner approves all work under a construction contract, the owner shall make payment in full of all remaining amounts due on the construction contract as described in subsection (3) of this section. When an original contractor completes and an owner approves all work under a portion of a construction contract for which the construction contract states a separate price, the owner shall make payment in full of all remaining amounts due on that portion of the construction contract, subject to the satisfaction of any items detailed under subsection (5) of this section or ORS 701.630 (4).

      (11) If an owner or a person designated by the owner as responsible for making progress payments on a construction contract does not make a timely payment under this section, the owner shall pay the original contractor interest on the unpaid balance at the rate of one and one-half percent a month or fraction of a month, or at a higher rate as the parties to the construction contract may agree.

      (12) On the written request of a subcontractor, the owner shall notify the subcontractor no later than five days after the issuance of a progress payment to the original contractor. On the written request of a subcontractor, the owner shall notify the subcontractor no later than five days after the owner makes the final payment to the original contractor on the construction contract.

      (13) If the owner and original contractor are a single entity, that entity shall make progress and final payments to subcontractors and material suppliers as described in subsection (3) or (6) of this section.

      (14) In any action, claim or arbitration brought to collect interest pursuant to this section, the prevailing party shall be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees. [2003 c.675 §55; 2011 c.553 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 701.620.

 

      701.630 Payments to subcontractors and material suppliers; failure to pay; omission of payment. (1) An original contractor, subcontractor or material supplier that performs in accordance with a construction contract is entitled to payment from the party with whom the original contractor, subcontractor or material supplier contracts.

      (2)(a) If a subcontractor has performed in accordance with a construction contract, and the original contractor receives payment from the owner for work performed by the subcontractor, the original contractor shall pay the subcontractor for that work no later than seven days after the original contractor receives the payment. If a material supplier has performed in accordance with a construction contract, and the original contractor receives payment from the owner for materials or products provided by the material supplier, the original contractor shall pay the material supplier for those materials and products no later than seven days after the original contractor receives the payment. An original subcontractor that receives payment under this subsection for work provided to the original subcontractor by another subcontractor, or for materials or products provided to the original subcontractor, shall pay the other subcontractor or material supplier for the work, materials or products no later than seven days after the original subcontractor receives the payment.

      (b) Payment is not required under this subsection unless a subcontractor or material supplier provides to the original contractor or subcontractor a billing or invoice for the work performed or materials or products supplied in compliance with the terms of the contract between the parties. Each subcontractor or material supplier must provide an appropriate waiver of any lien for labor, equipment, services, materials or products in accordance with subcontract or purchase order terms and conditions. The original contractor or subcontractor may require that such waivers of lien be notarized.

      (3) Any failure to reasonably account for the application or use of payments, as proven in a legal proceeding authorized under the terms of the construction contract, may constitute grounds for disciplinary action by the Construction Contractors Board under ORS 701.098.

      (4) An original contractor that submits a billing or estimate to an owner, or an original subcontractor that submits a billing or estimate to the original contractor, may omit from the billing or estimate amounts to be withheld from payment to a subcontractor or material supplier because of:

      (a) Unsatisfactory work progress;

      (b) Defective construction work, materials or products not remedied;

      (c) Disputed work, materials or products, except that the withheld amount may not exceed 150 percent of the amount in dispute;

      (d) Failure to comply with other material provisions of the construction contract;

      (e) A third party claim being filed or reasonable evidence that a third party claim will be filed;

      (g) Damage to an original contractor, subcontractor or material supplier;

      (h) Reasonable evidence that the subcontract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract sum; or

      (i) Other items as allowed under the subcontract or purchase order terms and conditions.

      (5) An original contractor or original subcontractor may also omit from a billing or estimate a reasonable amount for retainage, except that the amount omitted may not exceed the actual percentage allowed by the construction contract, subcontract or purchase order. As used in this subsection, “retainage” has the meaning given that term in ORS 701.410.

      (6) If a progress or final payment to a subcontractor or material supplier is delayed by more than seven days after receipt of a progress or final payment by an original contractor or subcontractor, the original contractor or subcontractor shall pay its subcontractor or material supplier interest beginning on the eighth day, except during periods of time during which payment is withheld pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of this section, at the rate of one and one-half percent a month or a fraction of a month on the unpaid balance or at such higher rate as the parties agree.

      (7) In any action, claim or arbitration brought to collect interest under this section, the prevailing party shall be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees. [2003 c.675 §56; 2011 c.553 §3]

      701.635 Suspension of performance. (1) An original contractor may suspend performance under a construction contract, or if performance is suspended for longer than one month may terminate a construction contract, if the owner fails to make timely payment of the amount certified under ORS 701.625.

A construction contract may not extend the notice period under this subsection.

      (3) A subcontractor may suspend performance under a construction contract, or if performance is suspended for longer than one month may terminate a construction contract, if the owner makes timely payment of amounts certified under ORS 701.625 for the subcontractor’s work but the original contractor fails to pay the subcontractor for the certified work. A subcontractor shall provide written notice to the original contractor and owner at least seven days before the subcontractor suspends performance or terminates the construction contract, unless a shorter notice period is prescribed in the construction contract.

A subcontractor shall provide written notice to the original contractor and the owner at least seven days before the subcontractor suspends performance or terminates the construction contract, unless a shorter notice period is prescribed in the construction contract. A subcontractor may not be deemed in breach of a construction contract for suspending performance or terminating a construction contract pursuant to this subsection.

      (7) In any action, claim or arbitration brought pursuant to this section, the prevailing party shall be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees.
