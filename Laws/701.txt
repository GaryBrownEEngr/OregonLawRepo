      701.013 Intent relating to certain business license requirements. It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to reduce the number of city business licenses that construction contractors are required to obtain in order to conduct business in the Portland metropolitan area. It is the purpose of this section and ORS 701.015 to enable construction contractors to secure from the metropolitan service district one business license that will permit the conduct of business by construction contractors in cities in which the contractors perform a limited amount of work and in which they do not have a principal place of business. Furthermore, it is also the intent of the Legislative Assembly that this section and ORS 701.015 apply only to construction contractors engaged in the building trades and crafts without regard to any subsequent expansion of the jurisdiction of the Construction Contractors Board over other trades and crafts. It is declared to be the policy of this state that, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the requirements of this section and ORS 701.015, the cities within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district be allowed to control the imposition of business license taxes and to maintain the level of revenues obtained from those taxes. The amount and trends of revenue produced or distributed to each city is intended to reflect the construction business activity within the participating cities. [1991 c.79 §1; 2001 c.409 §10; 2007 c.541 §43]

 

      Note: 701.013 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 701 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      701.015 Business license requirements in cities and metropolitan service districts; fees; distribution of fees. (1) A contractor shall pay directly to any city within the boundaries of a metropolitan service district any business license tax imposed by the city when:

      (a) The principal place of business of the contractor is within the city; or

      (b) The principal place of business of the contractor is not within the city but the contractor derives gross receipts of $250,000 or more from business conducted within the boundaries of the city during the calendar year for which the business license tax is owed.

      (2) A contractor who conducts business during any year in any city within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district other than a city to which the contractor has paid a business license tax for that year may apply for a business license from the metropolitan service district.

      (3) When a contractor obtains a business license from the metropolitan service district under subsection (2) of this section, if a city within the boundaries of the metropolitan service district other than a city to which the contractor is required to directly pay a business license tax under subsection (1) of this section demands payment of a business license tax by the contractor, the city shall waive such payment upon presentation of proof by the contractor that the contractor has a business license issued by the metropolitan service district. Possession by the contractor of a current business license issued by the metropolitan service district under subsection (2) of this section shall be proof sufficient to obtain the waiver described in this subsection.

      (4) The metropolitan service district shall issue a business license to a contractor when:

      (a) The contractor presents proof to the district that the contractor has paid the business license tax imposed by each city within the boundaries of the district to which the contractor must directly pay a business license tax under subsection (1) of this section; and

      (b) The contractor pays a license fee to the district. The license fee charged under this paragraph shall be twice the average business license tax charged contractors by cities located within the metropolitan service district plus an amount that is sufficient to reimburse the district for the administrative expenses of the district incurred in carrying out its duties under this section.

      (5) The metropolitan service district shall distribute the business license fees collected by the district under this section, less administrative expenses, to the cities that are located wholly or partly within the district and that collect a business license tax. In any year, each such city shall receive such share of the license fees as the number of residential building permits that it issued during that year bears to the total number of residential building permits that were issued during that year by all of the cities located wholly or partly within the district. Distribution of moneys under this subsection shall be made at least once in each year. The metropolitan service district shall determine the number of residential building permits issued by cities within the district from statistics.

      (6) As used in this section:

      (a) “Business license tax” means any fee paid by a person to a city or county for any form of license that is required by the city or county in order to conduct business in that city or county. The term does not include any franchise fee or privilege tax imposed by a city upon a public utility under ORS 221.420 or 221.450 or any provision of a city charter.

      (b) “Conducting business” means to engage in any activity in pursuit of gain including activities carried on by a person through officers, agents and employees as well as activities carried on by a person on that person’s own behalf.

      (c) “Principal place of business” means the location in this state of the central administrative office of a person conducting business in this state. [1987 c.581 §2; 1989 c.1064 §§1,2; 1991 c.79 §2; 1999 c.176 §1; 2007 c.541 §44; 2015 c.180 §49]

 

      701.020 Certain cities exempt from application of ORS 701.015. (1) A city that imposes a business license tax based on or measured by adjusted net income earned by conducting business within the city shall be exempt from ORS 701.015.

      (2) As used in this section, “business license tax” has the meaning given that term in ORS 701.015. [1987 c.581 §7]

 

      Note: 701.020 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 701 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      701.068 Bonding requirements; action against surety; rules. (1) An applicant for issuance or renewal of a contractor license shall file with the Construction Contractors Board a surety bond with one or more corporate sureties authorized to do business in this state in the amount set forth in ORS 701.081 or 701.084.

      (2) If an applicant for issuance, renewal or an additional endorsement of a license will hold endorsements as both a residential contractor and a commercial contractor, the applicant shall file with the board a surety bond for each endorsement in the amount set forth in ORS 701.081 or 701.084.

      (3) The surety bond for a residential contractor must provide that the applicant, with regard to work subject to this chapter, will pay amounts determined by the board as provided under ORS 701.145. The surety bond for a commercial contractor must provide that the applicant, with regard to work subject to this chapter, will pay amounts determined by the board as provided under ORS 701.146. Bonds filed under this section shall remain in effect for at least one year or until depleted by payments under ORS 701.150, 701.153 and 701.157, unless the surety sooner cancels the bond. At the discretion of the surety the bond may be continued for an additional period by continuation certificate. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the aggregate liability of the surety under the bond for complaints against the contractor may not exceed the penal sum of the bond no matter how many years the bond is in force. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an extension by continuation certificate, reinstatement, reissue or renewal of the bond may not increase the liability of the surety.

      (4) The board, by rule, may require a licensee to obtain a new surety bond if, pursuant to a board determination issued under ORS 701.145 or 701.146, the surety pays an amount out of the bond of the licensee. The new surety bond must be in the applicable amount set forth in ORS 701.081 or 701.084 unless a higher amount is required by a board condition or rule described in subsection (5) or (6) of this section. The board may allow a licensee to obtain, instead of a new bond, a certification that the surety remains liable for the full penal sum of the bond, notwithstanding payment by the surety on the complaint.

      (5) If the amount the licensee must pay against the bond under subsection (3) of this section exceeds the amount of the bond, the board shall suspend the contractor’s license until the amount owed is paid. The board, as a condition of ending the suspension, may require a contractor requesting reinstatement of a license to file a bond of an amount up to five times as much as the amount required ordinarily of a licensee under ORS 701.081 or 701.084.

      (6) The board by rule may establish conditions for applicants or persons licensed under this chapter under which the applicant or licensee must file a bond of an amount up to five times as much as the amount required ordinarily of an applicant or licensee under ORS 701.081 or 701.084. The board may reduce the amount of bond it would otherwise require if the contractor demonstrates satisfactory completion of approved elective classes on dispute resolution and prevention, basic accounting and record keeping or such other classes as the board may prescribe.

      (7) The bond required under this section is for the exclusive purpose of payment of amounts for which the board has determined the surety to have responsibility.

      (8) Upon issuance of a determination under ORS 701.145 or 701.146 for a complaint against a contractor who holds a bond required under this section, the board shall notify the surety on the bond of the determination in a manner determined by the board by rule. The notification shall include a list of all board determinations for payment by the surety from the bond.

      (9) A court action may not be commenced against a surety on a bond required under this section until 30 days after the date that the surety is notified by the board under ORS 701.150 that payment is due on the determination.

      (10) In any action against a surety on a bond under this section that is based on the failure of the surety to pay an amount determined by the board, the court may award:

      (a) Costs;

      (b) Reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party as part of the costs; and

      (c) Twice the amount that the board determined the surety must pay on the complaint, if the surety arbitrarily and capriciously refused to pay. [Formerly 701.085; 2009 c.225 §1; 2011 c.630 §§39,60; 2016 c.99 §2]

      (a) Specify the manner in which the person may show compliance with this subsection at the time of filing the complaint.

      (b) Provide that all or part of the requirements for sending a notice under this subsection may be waived if the contractor, by other means, has actual notice of the dispute with the person filing the complaint.

      (2) If the notice described in subsection (1) of this section is mailed to the contractor fewer than 45 days before expiration of the time limitation under ORS 701.143 for the board to receive the complaint, the time limitation for the board to receive the complaint does not expire until 60 days after the notice is mailed.

      701.145 Resolution of complaints involving work on residential structures or certain small commercial structures. For a complaint described in ORS 701.139 (1) or (3)(a) or a complaint under ORS 701.139 (3)(b) that a complainant elects to have resolved under this section:

      (1) The complainant must file the complaint with the Construction Contractors Board in a form prescribed by the board.

      (2) The board may suspend processing of the complaint if:

      (a) The same facts and issues involved in the complaint have been submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction for determination or have been submitted to any other entity authorized by law or the parties to effect a resolution or settlement; or

      (b) The board determines that the nature or complexity of the dispute described in the complaint is such that a court is the appropriate forum for the adjudication of the dispute.

      (3) The board may dismiss or close the complaint as established by rule of the board if any of the following conditions apply:

      (a) The complainant does not respond to a board request and the request is necessary to the board’s investigation of the complaint.

      (b) The complainant does not allow the board to conduct one or more on-site meetings to mediate or investigate the complaint.

The board shall attempt to conduct one or more meetings on-site or by telephone to mediate a dispute. During mediation of a dispute, the board may recommend to the contractor such action as the board considers appropriate to compensate the complainant. If the contractor performs accordingly, the board shall give that fact due consideration in any subsequent disciplinary proceeding brought by the board.

      (5) If the parties do not resolve or settle the complaint, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the complainant may recover payment from the bond of the contractor only by obtaining:

      (a) A final judgment against the contractor issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or

      (b) An arbitration award against the contractor that a court has reduced to a final judgment.

      (6) If the complaint is filed under ORS 701.140 (4), the complainant may recover payment from the bond of the contractor as provided in subsection (5)(a) of this section or by obtaining a final order issued by the Bureau of Labor and Industries that states an amount of unpaid wages that the licensed contractor owes under ORS 652.140 or 653.010 to 653.261.

      (7) For purposes of subsections (5) and (6) of this section, “final” means that the judgment or order has become final by operation or law or on appeal.

      (8) The board shall send the surety on the contractor bond required under ORS 701.068 a copy of the final judgment or bureau final order, and a copy of a determination issued by the board that the surety must pay the amount stated by the board. A determination issued by the board may not include payment of any attorney fees awarded in the final judgment or bureau final order. The determination issued by the board is an order in other than a contested case proceeding. The determination order is not recordable under ORS 701.153 (1) and (2) to create a lien. [1971 c.740 §16; 1979 c.874 §4; 1983 c.616 §14; 1989 c.167 §2; 1989 c.928 §17; 1991 c.181 §10; 1991 c.717 §2; 1993 c.470 §3; 1993 c.471 §1; 1995 c.771 §4; 1997 c.301 §4; 1999 c.331 §1; 1999 c.344 §5; 1999 c.402 §31; 1999 c.849 §§172,173; 2001 c.197 §§14,15; 2001 c.414 §§9a,10a; 2007 c.288 §16; 2007 c.793 §14; 2007 c.836 §66; 2011 c.630 §§46,66; 2016 c.99 §8]

 

      701.146 Resolution of complaints involving work on large commercial structures or certain small commercial structures. For a complaint described in ORS 701.139 (2) or (3)(c) or a complaint under ORS 701.139 (3)(b) that a complainant elects to have resolved under this section:

      (1) The person seeking to file the complaint with the Construction Contractors Board must:

      (a) Bring an action on the dispute against the licensed contractor in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

      (b) Initiate a proceeding to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration substantially in conformance with ORS 36.600 to 36.740.

      (2) The complainant must file the complaint with the Construction Contractors Board by delivering to the board a copy of the complainant’s court pleading or the demand for arbitration or other document necessary to initiate arbitration. The pleading, demand or other document must be accompanied by a completed board complaint form. The complainant must also give notice to the surety on the bond by delivering to the surety a copy of the complainant’s court pleading or the demand for arbitration or other document necessary to initiate arbitration and a copy of the completed board complaint form. Delivery to the board and the surety must be accomplished by certified mail, return receipt requested, no later than the earlier of:

      (a) The 90th day after filing the court action or after filing or making the arbitration demand or other initiation of arbitration;

      (b) The 14th day before the first day of trial or arbitration; or

      (c) The 30th day before:

      (A) The court issues a judgment in the action; or

      (B) The arbitrator issues an award on the arbitration.

      (3) Filing the complaint with the board under subsection (2) of this section constitutes filing the complaint for purposes of establishing timeliness of the complaint under ORS 701.143 and priority of the complaint for possible payment from the bond under ORS 701.157.

      (4) Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (8) of this section, if the complainant properly gives notice to the surety under subsection (2) of this section, a judgment or award against the contractor entered in the action or arbitration is binding on the surety. If the complainant delivers the notice required under subsection (2) of this section to the wrong surety, the surety receiving the notice may avoid being bound by a judgment or award by delivering notice of the mistake to the complainant or the complainant’s attorney of record, and to the board, on or before the 30th day after the surety receives notice under subsection (2) of this section. Delivery of the notice of mistake must be by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by facsimile machine or other form of transmission with an acknowledgment of receipt.

      (5) A surety under subsection (2) of this section has an absolute right to intervene in an action or arbitration brought or initiated under subsection (1) of this section. A complainant may not join a surety as a party to an action or arbitration unless the complainant disputes the validity or timeliness of the surety’s notice of mistake or the surety disputes the validity or timeliness of the delivery to the surety of the notice required by subsection (2) of this section. If the surety elects to intervene or is joined as a party, the surety is bound by all issues of fact and law determined by the court or arbitrator and may not seek board review of those determinations.

      (6) If a court issues a judgment on an action, or reduces an arbitration award to judgment, against a contractor on a complaint described in subsection (1) of this section, the complainant must deliver a certified copy of the judgment to the board and to the surety no later than the 30th day after entry of the judgment in order to maintain the complaint and possibly receive payment from the bond. The entry of a final judgment against the contractor concludes the contractor’s involvement in any proceedings to determine whether the complaint is subject to payment from the bond. The complainant and the surety are the only parties to the administrative process set forth in subsection (8) of this section.

      (7) If a complaint is filed under ORS 701.140 (4), the complainant may recover payment from the bond of the contractor as provided in subsection (4) or (8) of this section or by obtaining a final order issued by the Bureau of Labor and Industries that states an amount of unpaid wages that the licensed contractor owes to the wage claimant.

      (8) Upon receipt of a timely delivered certified copy of the judgment as described in subsection (6) of this section, the board shall issue a determination that the surety must pay the amount stated by the board. The determination issued by the board is an order in other than a contested case proceeding. The determination shall include the amount of the judgment together with any costs, interest and attorney fees awarded under the judgment, to the extent that the judgment, costs, interest and fees are within the jurisdiction of the board. The board’s determination of the complaint is limited to whether the complaint comes within the jurisdiction of the board and is subject to payment by the surety.

      701.149 Status reports; alternative dispute resolution. (1) If the Construction Contractors Board suspends the processing of a complaint because of the complaint having been submitted to a court or arbitrator or because of a court having stayed action on the complaint, the board may require that the complainant provide status reports on the pending court action or arbitration. The board may dismiss or close a complaint filed under ORS 701.139 if the complainant fails to submit status reports on a pending court action or arbitration.

      (2) ORS 183.605 to 183.690 do not limit in any way the ability of the board to make full use of alternative dispute resolution, including mediation or referral for arbitration, to resolve complaints against contractors filed under ORS 701.139. [2005 c.207 §2; 2007 c.793 §18; 2011 c.630 §§48,68; 2016 c.99 §10]

 

      701.150 Determination of amount to be paid from bond. (1) If a licensed contractor fails to pay a complainant amounts due under a court judgment or under a final order of the Bureau of Labor and Industries, the Construction Contractors Board shall issue a determination stating the amount that a surety must pay the complainant. The surety shall pay the amount required under the determination as follows:

      (a) If the complaint was filed under ORS 701.145, the surety shall pay the amount from a bond required for a residential contractor.

      (b) If the complaint was filed under ORS 701.146, the surety shall pay the amount from a bond required for a commercial contractor.

      (2) The surety may not pay on a complaint until the surety receives notice from the board that the complaint is ready for payment.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 701.153 and 701.157, a bond is not subject to payment for a complaint that is filed more than 14 months after the earlier of:

      (a) The expiration or cancellation date of the license that was in force when the work that is the subject of the complaint was completed or abandoned; or

      (b) The date that the surety canceled the bond.

      701.153 Recording of order as lien; satisfaction of order against residential contractor. (1) If an order of the Construction Contractors Board determines a complaint against a residential contractor that was filed with the board prior to July 1, 2011, and the order becomes final by operation of law or on appeal and remains unpaid 10 days after the date the order becomes final, the complainant may file the order with the county clerk in any county of this state.

      (2) Upon receipt of an order described in subsection (1) of this section, the clerk shall record the order in the County Clerk Lien Record. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, recording an order described in subsection (1) of this section in the County Clerk Lien Record pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect provided for in ORS 205.125 and 205.126, and the order may be enforced as provided in ORS 205.125 and 205.126.

      (b) If a complaint filed under ORS 701.140 (4) or a notice received under ORS 652.333 contributes to the board’s determination under ORS 701.068 (5) or (6) that a licensee must file a bond in an amount that is higher than the amount required ordinarily of a licensee, the total amount available for payment of nonowner complaints shall be $3,000 plus up to 50 percent of the amount of the bond as required by the board that exceeds the bond amount ordinarily required under ORS 701.081 or 701.084.

      (3) Any inspector authorized by the board to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter is authorized to require any person who is engaged in any activity regulated by this chapter to demonstrate proof of compliance with the licensing requirements of this chapter. If a person who is contracting directly with the owner of a structure does not demonstrate proof of compliance with the licensing requirements of this chapter, the inspector shall give notice of noncompliance to the person. The notice of noncompliance shall be in writing, shall specifically state that the person is not in compliance with the licensing requirements of this chapter and shall provide that unless the person demonstrates proof of compliance within 10 days of the date of the notice, the inspector may by order stop all work then being done by the person. The notice of noncompliance shall be served upon the person and shall be served upon or delivered to the owner of each structure upon which the person is then performing work under contract, or mailed to all persons who are mortgagees or trust deed beneficiaries of record with respect to the real property upon which each such structure is situated. If more than one person is the owner of any such structure, a copy of the notice need be given to only one of such persons. If after receipt of the notice of noncompliance the person fails within the 10-day period specified in the notice to demonstrate proof of compliance with the licensing requirements of this chapter, the inspector is authorized to order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in the activity. Any person so notified shall stop such work until proof of compliance is demonstrated.

      (2) If the board determines after notice and opportunity for hearing that a contractor or a subcontractor did not make payment to persons who supplied labor or materials in connection with a public contract for a public improvement within 60 days after the date when payment was received by the contractor or subcontractor, the board shall place the contractor or the subcontractor on the list of persons who have been determined to be not qualified to hold or participate in a public contract for a public improvement. The board may not place a contractor or subcontractor on the list if the only reason that the contractor or subcontractor did not make payment to a person when payment was due is that the contractor or subcontractor did not receive payment from the public contracting agency, contractor or subcontractor when payment was due. The contractor or subcontractor shall remain on the list for a period of not less than six months.

      (3) If the board determines that the information supplied to the board against a contractor or subcontractor was supplied in bad faith or was false, the person who supplied the information in bad faith or supplied false information shall be placed on the list of persons who have been determined to be not qualified to hold or participate in a public contract for a public improvement.

[1975 c.772 §1; 1987 c.158 §148; 1999 c.59 §209; 2003 c.794 §319; 2005 c.22 §§480,481; 2010 c.77 §7]

 

      Note: 701.410 to 701.440 were enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but were not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 701 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      701.420 Partial payment; retainage; effect; interest; notice of completion; payment by contractor and owner. (1) Partial payment is allowed and may be made on contracts for construction and home improvement. An owner, contractor or subcontractor may withhold as retainage an amount equal to not more than five percent of the contract price of the work completed. Partial payment allowed under this subsection is not acceptance or approval of some of the work or a waiver of defects in the work.

      (2)(a) The owner, contractor or subcontractor shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month on the final payment due the contractor or subcontractor. The interest shall commence 30 days after the contractor or subcontractor has completed and the owner has accepted the work under the contract for construction for which the final payment is due. The interest shall run until the date when final payment is tendered to the contractor or subcontractor. When the contractor or subcontractor considers the work that the contractor or subcontractor is contracted to perform to be complete, the contractor or subcontractor shall notify the party to whom the contractor or subcontractor is responsible for performing the construction work under the contract. The party shall, within 15 days after receiving the notice, either accept the work or notify the contractor or subcontractor of work yet to be performed under the contract.

      (b) If the contract price exceeds $500,000, the owner, contractor or subcontractor shall place amounts withheld as retainage into an interest-bearing escrow account. Interest on the retainage amount accrues from the date the payment request is approved until the date the retainage is paid to the contractor or subcontractor to which it is due.

      (3) When a contractor pays a subcontractor in full, including the amount the contractor withheld as retainage, the owner with whom the contractor has the contract shall pay the contractor, out of the amount that the owner withheld from the contractor as retainage, a sum equal to the amount of retainage that the contractor paid the subcontractor. The contractor shall notify the owner when the contractor pays a subcontractor in full under this section and the owner shall, within 15 days after receiving the notice, pay the contractor the amount due the contractor under this subsection. Interest on the amount due the contractor at the rate of one percent per month shall commence 30 days after the owner receives notice of full payment to the subcontractor. [1975 c.772 §2; 2010 c.77 §8; 2013 c.410 §2; 2019 c.486 §2]

 

      Note: See note under 701.410.

 

      701.430 Performance bond; terms. A contractor or subcontractor may execute and deliver to the owner, contractor or subcontractor before the commencement of construction for which the contractor or subcontractor will be responsible for performing a good and sufficient bond in a sum equal to the contract price for the faithful performance of the contract. The term of the bond obtained under this subsection must extend to include the period during which claims of lien or notices of other encumbrances based on the construction performed under the contract may be filed under applicable law. The bond must be approved by the owner, contractor or subcontractor entitled to withhold retainage. A faithful performance bond delivered under this section must include, but not be limited to, provisions to the effect that:

      (1) The obligations of the contract must be faithfully performed;

      (2) Payment must promptly be made to all persons supplying labor or materials to the contractor or subcontractor for prosecution of the work provided in the contract;

      (3) All contributions due the Industrial Accident Fund and the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund from the contractor or subcontractor in connection with the performance of the contract must be made promptly; and

      (4) All sums required to be deducted and retained from the wages of employees of the contractor or subcontractor pursuant to the Personal Income Tax Act of 1969, must be paid over to the Department of Revenue. [1975 c.772 §3; 2013 c.410 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 701.410.

 

      701.435 Deposits in lieu of cash retainage. (1) When a contractor on a public contract deposits bonds, securities or other instruments under ORS 279C.560 (4), if the subcontract price exceeds $50,000 and constitutes more than 10 percent of the cost of the public contract, a subcontractor on the public contract may deposit bonds, securities or other instruments with the contractor or in a bank or trust company for the contractor to hold for the contractor’s benefit in lieu of moneys held as retainage. If the contractor accepts the bonds, securities or other instruments deposited as provided in this subsection, the contractor shall reduce the moneys held as retainage in an amount equal to the value of the bonds, securities and other instruments and pay the amount of the reduction to the subcontractor in accordance with ORS 701.420 and 701.430. Interest or earnings on the bonds, securities or other instruments shall accrue to the subcontractor.

      (2) When a contractor on a public contract elects to have the public contracting agency deposit the accumulated retainage in an interest-bearing account under ORS 279C.560 (5), the contractor, within 30 days following payment of the final amount due for construction of the public improvement, shall pay to each subcontractor who performed work on the construction the subcontractor’s proportional share of the interest earnings that accrued to the contractor as a result of the election. A subcontractor’s share of the total amount of interest earnings under this subsection shall be determined by the proportion that the amount of retainage withheld from the subcontractor bears to the amount of retainage withheld from the contractor and the length of time the retainage was withheld from the subcontractor. A share of the interest earnings shall be paid to a subcontractor under this subsection only when:

      (a) Retainage is withheld from the subcontractor for more than 60 days after the day on which the first partial payment was due the subcontractor under the terms of the subcontract; and

      (b) The amount of interest earnings due the subcontractor exceeds $100.

      (3) If the contractor incurs additional costs as a result of the exercise of an option described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the contractor may recover the costs from the subcontractor by reducing the final payment. As work on the subcontract progresses, the contractor shall, upon demand, inform the subcontractor of all accrued additional costs.

      (4) Bonds, securities and other instruments deposited or acquired in lieu of retainage, as permitted by this section, must be of a character approved by the Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, including but not limited to:

      (a) Bills, certificates, notes or bonds of the United States.

      (b) Other obligations of the United States or agencies of the United States.

      (c) Obligations of a corporation wholly owned by the federal government.

      (d) Indebtedness of the Federal National Mortgage Association.

      (e) General obligation bonds of the State of Oregon or a political subdivision of the State of Oregon.

      Note: See note under 701.410.

 

      701.440 Applicability to federal projects. ORS 279C.555, 701.410, 701.420 and 701.430 do not apply when the owner is the United States or any agency thereof or when the construction is paid for, in whole or in part, with federal moneys. [1975 c.772 §6; 2003 c.794 §321]

      (2) If the owner accepts a contractor, subcontractor or supplier’s offer to perform remediation or to pay monetary compensation, completion of the remediation or payment satisfies the claims by the owner for those defects included in the offer for which remediation was performed or compensation paid, but not for any other defect. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, if the owner accepts an offer by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received a secondary notice, completion of the remediation or payment satisfies claims for those defects included in the offer for which remediation was performed or compensation paid, including claims by the owner and claims for contribution or indemnity against the contractor, subcontractor or supplier by the sender of the secondary notice, but not for any other defect.

      (3) If the owner accepts an offer by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received a secondary notice to perform remediation or to pay monetary compensation and the contractor, subcontractor or supplier fails to perform in accordance with the accepted offer, then the sender of the secondary notice may perform the remediation or pay the monetary compensation offered by the nonperforming contractor, subcontractor or supplier.

      (4) An owner that sends a notice of defect under ORS 701.565 may compel arbitration or commence a court action against a contractor, subcontractor or supplier if:

      (b) The written response of the contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received the notice of defect or a secondary notice does not offer remediation or monetary compensation;

A response or reply described in this subsection is admissible solely for the purpose of proving that an owner is qualified to compel arbitration or commence a court action under subsection (4)(c) of this section or determining the timeliness of an action under ORS 701.585. [2003 c.660 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 701.560.

 

      701.585 Effect of notice of defect on time for commencing court action. (1) If an owner sends a contractor, subcontractor or supplier a notice of defect within the time allowed for the owner to commence a court action against that contractor, subcontractor or supplier for a claim described in ORS 701.565, the time for the owner to commence the action shall be extended, notwithstanding any statute of limitation or statute of ultimate repose, until the later of:

      (a) One hundred and twenty days after the owner receives a written response from the contractor, subcontractor or supplier that received the notice of defect if the written response does not contain a written offer to perform remediation or pay monetary compensation for one or more of the defects or incidental damage described in the notice of defect;

      (b) One hundred and twenty days after the owner rejects a written offer by any contractor, subcontractor or supplier to perform remediation or pay monetary compensation for one or more of the defects or incidental damage described in the notice of defect; or

      (c) Thirty days after the date specified in an accepted written offer by which the offering contractor, subcontractor or supplier is to complete the remediation or complete payment of monetary compensation for one or more of the defects and any incidental damage described in the notice of defect.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not shorten or terminate the time for bringing a claim in accordance with applicable statutes of ultimate repose and statutes of limitation.

      (3) Delivery of a secondary notice sent by a contractor, subcontractor or supplier under ORS 701.570 does not act to toll the expiration of any right of the owner to commence a court action against the recipient of the secondary notice.

      (4) Any remediation performed pursuant to an accepted offer made under ORS 701.570 does not constitute a new performance and, for purposes of ORS 12.135, relates back to the earliest date of substantial completion or abandonment of the construction, alteration or repair of the improvement to real property. [2003 c.660 §6]

      (5) The owner is deemed to have received the billing or estimate when the billing or estimate is received by any person designated by the owner for the receipt, review or approval of the billing or estimate. A billing or estimate is deemed to be certified 10 days after the owner receives the billing or estimate, unless before that time the owner or the owner’s agent prepares and issues a written statement detailing those items in the billing or estimate that are not approved. An owner may decline to approve a billing or estimate or portion of a billing or estimate because of:

      (a) Unsatisfactory work progress;

The billings by any subcontractor or material supplier that does not provide written consent to the change remain subject to the certification period indicated in the drawings and specifications. A construction contract may not be changed in a manner that alters the right of any subcontractor or material supplier to receive prompt and timely progress payments as provided under ORS 701.630.

      (9) An owner may withhold from a progress payment an amount that is sufficient to pay the direct expenses the owner reasonably expects to incur to correct any items detailed in a written statement under subsection (5) of this section.

      (14) In any action, claim or arbitration brought to collect interest pursuant to this section, the prevailing party shall be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees. [2003 c.675 §55; 2011 c.553 §2]

      (2)(a) If a subcontractor has performed in accordance with a construction contract, and the original contractor receives payment from the owner for work performed by the subcontractor, the original contractor shall pay the subcontractor for that work no later than seven days after the original contractor receives the payment. If a material supplier has performed in accordance with a construction contract, and the original contractor receives payment from the owner for materials or products provided by the material supplier, the original contractor shall pay the material supplier for those materials and products no later than seven days after the original contractor receives the payment. An original subcontractor that receives payment under this subsection for work provided to the original subcontractor by another subcontractor, or for materials or products provided to the original subcontractor, shall pay the other subcontractor or material supplier for the work, materials or products no later than seven days after the original subcontractor receives the payment.

      (b) Payment is not required under this subsection unless a subcontractor or material supplier provides to the original contractor or subcontractor a billing or invoice for the work performed or materials or products supplied in compliance with the terms of the contract between the parties. Each subcontractor or material supplier must provide an appropriate waiver of any lien for labor, equipment, services, materials or products in accordance with subcontract or purchase order terms and conditions. The original contractor or subcontractor may require that such waivers of lien be notarized.

      (3) Any failure to reasonably account for the application or use of payments, as proven in a legal proceeding authorized under the terms of the construction contract, may constitute grounds for disciplinary action by the Construction Contractors Board under ORS 701.098.

      (4) An original contractor that submits a billing or estimate to an owner, or an original subcontractor that submits a billing or estimate to the original contractor, may omit from the billing or estimate amounts to be withheld from payment to a subcontractor or material supplier because of:

      (a) Unsatisfactory work progress;

      (b) Defective construction work, materials or products not remedied;

      (c) Disputed work, materials or products, except that the withheld amount may not exceed 150 percent of the amount in dispute;

      (h) Reasonable evidence that the subcontract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract sum; or

      (i) Other items as allowed under the subcontract or purchase order terms and conditions.

      (5) An original contractor or original subcontractor may also omit from a billing or estimate a reasonable amount for retainage, except that the amount omitted may not exceed the actual percentage allowed by the construction contract, subcontract or purchase order.
