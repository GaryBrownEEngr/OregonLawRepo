TRUTH VERIFICATION AND DECEPTION DETECTION BY POLYGRAPH EXAMINERS

 

(Generally)

 

      703.010 Definitions. As used in ORS 703.010 to 703.310, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Board” means the Board on Public Safety Standards and Training.

      (2) “Department” means the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training.

      (3) “Director” means the director of the department.

      (4) “Internship” means the study by a trainee of polygraph examinations and of the administration of polygraph examinations under the personal supervision and control of a polygraph examiner in accordance with the course of study prescribed by the board at the commencement of such study.

      (5) “Person” means any individual, firm, association, partnership or corporation.

      (6) “Polygraph examiner” means a person who purports to be able to detect deception or verify the truth of statements through the use of instrumentation or of a mechanical device that records visually, permanently and simultaneously the cardiovascular pattern, the respiratory pattern and the galvanic skin response of the individual being examined.

      (7) “Trainee” means a person licensed under ORS 703.010 to 703.310 to engage in an internship. [1975 c.608 §3; 1997 c.853 §45; 2003 c.777 §2]

      703.030 Purpose; construction. (1) It is the purpose of ORS 703.010 to 703.310 to regulate all persons who purport to be able to detect deception or to verify the truth of statements through the use of instrumentation or mechanical devices, including but not limited to lie detectors, polygraphs and deceptographs, that record visually, permanently and simultaneously the cardiovascular pattern, the respiratory pattern and the galvanic skin response of the individual being examined.

      (2) ORS 703.010 to 703.310 shall be liberally construed to regulate all persons described in subsection (1) of this section. A person who purports to be able to detect deception or to verify the truth of statements is not exempt from the provisions of ORS 703.010 to 703.310 because of the terminology used to describe the person, the instruments or mechanical devices of the person, or the nature of the services of the person. [1975 c.608 §2; 1987 c.158 §149; 2003 c.777 §3]

      (4) When the department refuses to issue a license based upon an applicant’s failure to meet the requirements of subsection (1)(c) of this section, the department shall prepare a concise, specific written statement of the facts supporting the department’s conclusion that there is a high degree of probability that the applicant will be unlikely to perform required duties in a manner that would serve the interests of the public. A copy of the statement must be given to the applicant. ORS 181A.195 (10) does not apply to the department when the department refuses to issue a license under this subsection.

      (5) The department and an employee of the department acting within the course and scope of employment are immune from any civil liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed for refusing to issue a license under subsection (4) of this section. The department, an employee of the department acting within the course and scope of employment and an employer or employer’s agent who in good faith comply with the requirements of this section, any rules adopted by the department and the decision of the department or employee of the department acting within the course and scope of employment are not liable for employment-related decisions based on decisions made under this section. The department or an employee of the department acting within the course and scope of employment is not liable for defamation or invasion of privacy in connection with the lawful dissemination of information lawfully obtained under ORS 181A.195.
