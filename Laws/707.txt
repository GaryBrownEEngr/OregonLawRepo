      707.007 Organization of Oregon bank as limited liability company. (1) As an alternative to being organized as a corporation under this chapter, an Oregon bank may be organized as a limited liability company.

      (2) With respect to any Oregon bank that is organized as a limited liability company, as used in the Bank Act:

      (a) “Articles of incorporation” means the Oregon bank’s articles of organization, as defined in ORS 63.001.

      (b) “Bylaws” means the Oregon bank’s operating agreement, as defined in ORS 63.001.

      (3) An Oregon bank organized as a limited liability company shall be organized under the authority of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services under this chapter. Except as set forth in subsection (4) of this section, with respect to all other aspects of its operation and existence, an Oregon bank that is organized as a limited liability company is subject to the provisions of ORS chapter 63, to the extent that ORS chapter 63 does not conflict with the Bank Act. In the event of any conflict between the Bank Act and ORS chapter 63, the Bank Act controls.

      (4)(a) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 63, the articles of organization of an Oregon bank that is organized as a limited liability company shall:

      (A) State that the existence of the Oregon bank is perpetual; and

      (B) Provide that the Oregon bank is to be managed by a board of not fewer than five managers.

      (b) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 63, an Oregon bank that is organized as a limited liability company shall be managed exclusively by its board of managers in substantially the same manner as an Oregon bank that is organized as a corporation is managed by its board of directors. The board of managers of an Oregon bank that is organized as a limited liability company has substantially the same rights, powers, privileges, duties and responsibilities as the board of directors of an Oregon bank that is organized as a corporation and is subject to the provisions of this chapter pertaining to directors.

      (c) Notwithstanding any provision of ORS chapter 63, membership interests in an Oregon bank that is organized as a limited liability company are freely transferable, and consent of the Oregon bank or its members or managers is not required for a person to acquire or transfer a membership interest in the Oregon bank. Immediately upon the completion of the transfer of the membership interest to a person, the person becomes a member and has all the rights of a member.

      (d) ORS 63.621 (2) to (4) do not apply to an Oregon bank organized as a limited liability company.

      (c) Transacts any other form of banking business.

      (4) Transact business under any name that the director determines leads the public to believe that the person is transacting business as a banking institution or that the person is affiliated with a banking institution.

      (5) Solicit or receive deposits or transact business in the manner of a banking institution or in such a manner as to lead the public to believe that the person is transacting business as a banking institution.

      (6) This section does not apply to a national bank that was lawfully transacting banking business in this state on June 30, 2011, and has continuously transacted banking business in this state after June 30, 2011. [Amended by 1973 c.797 §51; 1997 c.631 §30; 2015 c.244 §15]

The court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and may make and enter an order or judgment awarding such preliminary or final injunctive relief as in its judgment is proper.

      707.025 Organization of banking institution for purpose of merging with, acquiring assets of or assuming liabilities of financial institution; procedure; conditions; fee. (1) One or more persons or a corporation may organize a banking institution under this section solely for the purpose of merging with, acquiring the assets of or assuming the liabilities of one or more existing financial institutions under ORS chapter 711 and, except as otherwise provided in this section, without authority to engage in or transact banking or trust business.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 707.050, 707.070, 707.080 to 707.120, 707.140, 707.170 or 707.200 or other statutes that are specifically inconsistent with this section, a banking institution described in subsection (1) of this section must be organized as follows:

      (a) A prospective incorporator or incorporators shall submit to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services for filing articles of incorporation that the prospective incorporator or incorporators execute in duplicate, and such other information as the director may require, which may include the additional information required in an application under ORS 707.070 or 716.028 if the banking institution organized under this section is to survive the merger, will purchase assets or will assume liabilities, together with an organizational fee of $2,500.

      (b) The articles of incorporation for the banking institution must specify:

      (A) The name and address of each incorporator.

      (B) The information required under ORS 707.110 (2)(a), (b) and (h) and (3).

      (C) The term of the banking institution’s existence, which may be perpetual.

      (D) The purpose of the banking institution, which must be limited to the purposes set forth in subsection (1) of this section. However, if the banking institution is to be the resulting bank in a merger, or the acquiring bank in an acquisition or assumption, the articles of incorporation may also contain all purposes allowed a banking institution under the Bank Act, provided the implementation of such purposes is conditioned upon consummation of the merger or the acquisition or assumption.

      (E) The name and address of each director of the board of directors, which must be composed of not less than three directors.

      (3) Unless the director finds that approving the articles would violate ORS 707.145 or other applicable law, the director shall file the articles and issue a certificate of incorporation in accordance with ORS 707.120, if:

      (a) The director finds that the articles of incorporation conform to subsection (3) of this section; and

      (b) The director finds that the banking institution, following any merger or assumption of liabilities, will meet the requirements of ORS 707.080 (1) and (2).

      (4) After the director issues a certificate of incorporation, the corporate existence of the banking institution begins and the banking institution may issue stock.

      (5)(a) After the director issues a certificate of incorporation, the new banking institution shall file a certified copy of the banking institution’s bylaws with the director within 90 days. If the director finds that the bylaws are consistent with the requirements of the Bank Act, the director shall issue a provisional charter to the banking institution.

      (b) A provisional charter expires one year after the director issues the provisional charter, but the director may extend the expiration period. If a merger or assumption of liabilities is not consummated before the provisional charter expires, the interim bank ceases to exist and the banking institution’s articles of incorporation and provisional charter are void.

      (c) For purposes of ORS chapter 711, a provisional charter that the director issues under this section is a charter, where appropriate.

      (d) If the merger or assumption of liabilities is consummated and the banking institution organized under this section survives the transaction, the director shall issue to the banking institution a charter to engage in banking business either as an Oregon commercial bank or as an Oregon stock savings bank.

      (6) A banking institution organized solely for the purposes set forth in subsection (1) of this section for which the director has issued a charter may, with the director’s approval, have initial paid-in capital in an amount less than that required by ORS 707.050 before consummation of a proposed merger.

      707.040 [Repealed by 1973 c.797 §428]

 

      707.050 Initial paid-in capital requirement. (1) Every institution or Oregon stock savings bank shall have at the time of issuance of its charter, initial paid-in capital of not less than $1,500,000. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may require a lesser or greater amount of initial paid-in capital for a particular institution or Oregon stock savings bank if the director determines that the lesser or greater amount is sufficient or is necessary for safe and sound operation of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank.

      (2) The initial paid-in capital of an institution or Oregon stock savings bank must be paid either in cash or by exchange of real property and improvements thereon. The real property and improvements must be approved by the director as meeting all applicable requirements of law and all other conditions and standards that the director adopts by rule, including but not limited to a proper appraisal by a qualified appraiser.

Any action required by this chapter to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders or directors of an institution or Oregon stock savings bank or any other action that may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders or directors or of a committee may be taken without a meeting if all of the shareholders or directors or all of the members of the committee entitled to vote with respect to the action sign a consent in writing that sets forth the action to be taken. The consent must be delivered to the institution or Oregon stock savings bank for inclusion in the minutes or for filing with the corporate records. The action is effective on the date on which the last signature is placed on the consent or consents or at such earlier or later time as is set forth in the consent.

If not otherwise determined in accordance with ORS 707.615, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action by consent without a meeting is the date the first shareholder signs the consent.

The waiver must be in writing, be signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice and be delivered to the institution or Oregon stock savings bank for inclusion in the corporate records.

      (2) Attendance at a meeting by a shareholder waives objection to:

      (a) Lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to the holding of the meeting or the transacting of business at the meeting; and

      (b) Consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. [1989 c.324 §51; 1997 c.631 §81]

 

      707.615 Record date. (1) For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors of an institution or Oregon stock savings bank may provide that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a stated period, not to exceed in any case 70 days. If the stock transfer books shall be closed for the purpose of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books shall be closed for at least 10 days immediately preceding such meeting.

      (2) In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the bylaws or, in the absence of an applicable bylaw, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. The record date, in any case, shall be not more than 70 days and, in the case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the close of business on the business day before the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board of directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders.

      (3) When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof, unless the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days from the original meeting date. [1989 c.324 §44; 1997 c.631 §82]

 

      707.617 Shareholders list for meeting. (1) The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of an institution or Oregon stock savings bank shall make, at least 10 days prior to each meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. The list shall be arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder and, for a period of 10 days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the registered office of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours. Such list also shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting. The original stock transfer books shall be prima facie evidence as to which shareholders are entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.

      (2) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall not affect the validity of any action taken at such meeting. [1989 c.324 §45; 1997 c.631 §83]

 

      707.619 Voting entitlement of shares. (1) Each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, except to the extent that the voting rights of the shares of any class or classes are limited or denied by the articles of incorporation as permitted by the Bank Act.

      (2) Neither shares of its own stock held by the institution or Oregon stock savings bank in a fiduciary capacity, nor shares held by another corporation if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation is held by the institution or Oregon stock savings bank shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time. The prohibition of this subsection does not apply if, under the terms of a trust in which such shares are held, the manner in which such shares shall be voted may be determined by the trustee, by a donor or beneficiary of the trust or by some other person named in the trust, and such shares are actually voted in the manner determined or directed by the trustee, donor, beneficiary or other person so authorized.

      (3) A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by the shareholder’s duly authorized attorney in fact. No proxy shall be valid after 11 months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.

      (4) In electing each director for whose election the shareholder has a right to vote, every shareholder entitled to vote at such election shall have the right to vote, either in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by the shareholder. If the articles of incorporation specifically permit cumulative voting, every shareholder shall have the right to cumulate the shareholder’s votes either by giving one candidate as many votes as the number of such directors multiplied by the number of the shareholder’s shares shall equal or by distributing such votes on the same principle among any number of such candidates.

      (5) Shares standing in the name of another domestic or foreign corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership or another entity may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the governing documents of the entity may prescribe or, in absence of such provision, as the board of directors or other governing body of the entity holding the shares may determine.

      (6) Shares held by a personal representative, administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by such person, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into such person’s name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by the trustee without a transfer of the shares to the name of the trustee.

      (7) Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without a transfer into the receiver’s name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.

      (8) Shares may be voted by a pledgee or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder if authorized by the pledge agreement or power of attorney and evidence of such authority is presented to the institution or Oregon stock savings bank upon request.

      (9) On and after the date on which written notice of redemption of shares has been mailed to the holders thereof and a sum sufficient to redeem such shares has been deposited with another institution or Oregon stock savings bank with irrevocable instruction and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders thereof upon surrender of certificates therefor, such shares shall not be entitled to vote on any matter and shall not be deemed to be outstanding shares.

      707.620 Special stockholder meeting called by director. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may call a meeting of the stockholders of any institution or Oregon stock savings bank by giving, or directing the institution or Oregon stock savings bank to give, not less than 15 days’ notice of the meeting to the stockholders in the manner prescribed in ORS 707.611.

      707.621 Quorum. (1) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting at the time the vote is taken and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by the Bank Act or the articles of incorporation.

      (2) Once a share is represented at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. [1989 c.324 §46; 1997 c.631 §86]

 

      707.623 Modification of quorum or voting requirements. (1) The articles of incorporation may provide for a lesser or greater quorum requirement for shareholders, or voting groups of shareholders, than is provided for by this chapter, but in no event shall a quorum for shareholders, or any voting group of shareholders, consist of less than one-third of the votes entitled to be cast on any matter by the shareholders or voting group of shareholders. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater voting requirement for shareholders, or voting groups of shareholders, than is provided for by this chapter.

      (2) An amendment to the articles of incorporation that adds a greater quorum or voting requirement must meet the quorum requirement and be adopted by the vote and voting groups required to take action under the quorum and voting requirements then in effect. An amendment to the articles of incorporation that changes or deletes a greater quorum or voting requirement must meet the quorum requirement and be adopted by the vote and voting groups required to take action immediately prior to the change or deletion. [1989 c.324 §48; 1997 c.631 §87]

 

      707.625 Exemption from personal liability for good faith acts or omissions in compliance with statute, rule or order.

      (4) The designation of committees and the delegation thereto of authority shall not operate to relieve the board of directors, or any member thereof, of any responsibility imposed upon the board of directors or such member by law. [1989 c.324 §50; 1997 c.631 §90]

 

      707.646 Staggered terms for directors. (1) If there are six or more directors, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws may provide for staggering their terms by dividing the total number of directors into two or three groups, with each group to be as nearly equal in number as possible.

      (3) If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the director’s removal. If cumulative voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove the director.

      (4) A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing the director, and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director. [1989 c.324 §49]

      (c) A committee of the board of directors of which the director is not a member, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

      (3) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning a matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection (2) of this section unwarranted.

      (4) When evaluating any offer of another party to make a tender or exchange offer for any equity security of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank, or any proposal to merge the institution or Oregon stock savings bank with another institution or Oregon stock savings bank or to purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all the properties and assets of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank, the directors of an institution or Oregon stock savings bank may, in determining what the directors believe is in the best interests of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank, give due consideration to the social, legal and economic effects on employees, customers and suppliers of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank and on the communities and geographical areas in which the institution or Oregon stock savings bank and the subsidiaries of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank operate, the economy of the state and nation, the long term as well as short term interests of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank and the stockholders of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the institution or Oregon stock savings bank, and other relevant factors.

      (6) Meetings of the board of directors must be held upon such notice as is prescribed in the bylaws. A director’s attendance at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of the meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. The notice or waiver of notice of a meeting of the board of directors does not need to specify either the business to be transacted at or the purpose of the meeting unless required by the bylaws or by law.

      (7) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, members of the board of directors of a banking institution or any committee designated by the board may hold a meeting of the board or committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment that allows all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other.

      (3) In the event the board dismisses an officer, the officer shall no longer serve as a director.

      (4) Any officer or agent elected or appointed by the board of directors may be removed by the board of directors whenever, in its judgment, the best interests of the banking institution will be served thereby, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed.

A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the banking institution’s request if the director’s duties to the banking institution also impose duties on or otherwise involve services by the director to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.

      (2) “Expenses” includes counsel fees.

      (3) “Banking institution” includes any domestic or foreign predecessor entity of a banking institution in a merger or other transaction in which the predecessor’s existence ceased upon the consummation of the transaction.

      (4) “Liability” means the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement, penalty or fine, including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan or reasonable expenses incurred with respect to a proceeding.

      (5) “Officer” means an individual who is or was an officer of a banking institution or an individual who, while an officer of a banking institution, is or was serving at the banking institution’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. An officer is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the banking institution’s request if the officer’s duties to the banking institution also impose duties on or include services by the officer to the employee benefit plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Officer” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of an officer.

      (6) “Party” includes an individual who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.

      (7) “Proceeding” means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal. [1989 c.324 §17; 1997 c.631 §106]

 

      707.746 Authority to indemnify directors. (1) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a banking institution may indemnify an individual made a party to a proceeding because the individual is or was a director against liability incurred in the proceeding if:

      (a) The conduct of the individual was in good faith;

      (b) The individual reasonably believed that the individual’s conduct was in the best interests of the banking institution, or at least not opposed to its best interests; and

      (c) In the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no reasonable cause to believe the individual’s conduct was unlawful.

      (2) A director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

      (3) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director did not meet the standard of conduct described in this section.

      (4) A banking institution may not indemnify a director under this section:

      (a) In connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the banking institution in which the director was adjudged liable to the banking institution; or

      (b) In connection with any other proceeding charging improper personal benefit to the director in which the director was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by the director.

      (5) Indemnification permitted under this section in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the banking institution is limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding. [1989 c.324 §18; 1997 c.631 §107]

 

      707.748 Mandatory indemnification. Unless limited by its articles of incorporation, a banking institution shall indemnify a director who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which the director was a party because of being a director of the banking institution against reasonable expenses incurred by the director in connection with the proceeding.

      (b) The director furnishes the banking institution a written undertaking, executed personally or on the director’s behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that the director did not meet the standard of conduct.

      (3) Any authorization of payments under this section may be made by provision in the articles of incorporation, or bylaws, by a resolution of the shareholders or board of directors or by contract. [1989 c.324 §20; 1997 c.631 §109]

 

      707.754 Court-ordered indemnification. Unless the banking institution’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director of the banking institution who is a party to a proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt of an application, the court, after giving any notice the court considers necessary, may order indemnification if it determines:

      (1) The director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under ORS 707.748, in which case the court shall also order the banking institution to pay the director’s reasonable expenses incurred to obtain court-ordered indemnification; or

      (2) The director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director met the standard of conduct set forth in ORS 707.746 or was adjudged liable as described in ORS 707.746 (4), whether the liability is based on a judgment, settlement or proposed settlement or otherwise.

      707.756 Determination and authorization of indemnification.

      (2) A determination that indemnification of a director is permissible shall be made:

      (a) By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

      (b) If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by a majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding. However, directors who are parties to the proceeding may participate in designation of the committee;

      (c) By special legal counsel selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, or if a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the special legal counsel shall be selected by majority vote of the full board of directors, including directors who are parties to the proceeding; or

      (d) In the case of an institution or Oregon stock savings bank, by the shareholders.

      (3) Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under subsection (2)(c) of this section to select counsel. [1989 c.324 §22; 1997 c.631 §111]

The banking institution may purchase and maintain the insurance even if the banking institution has no power to indemnify the individual against the same liability under ORS 707.746 or 707.748.

Specifically and not by way of limitation, a banking institution shall have the power to make or agree to make any further indemnification, including advancement of expenses, of:

      (a) Any director as authorized by the articles of incorporation, any bylaws approved, adopted or ratified by the shareholders or any resolution or agreement approved, adopted or ratified, before or after such indemnification or agreement is made, by the shareholders, provided that no such indemnification shall indemnify any director from or on account of acts or omissions for which liability could not be eliminated under ORS 707.110 (5)(c); and

      (b) Any officer, employee or agent who is not a director as authorized by its articles of incorporation or bylaws, general or specific action of its board of directors or agreement.
