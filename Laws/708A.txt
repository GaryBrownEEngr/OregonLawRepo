LOANS GENERALLY

 

      708A.250 Lending money. Except as specifically limited by the Bank Act and other applicable law, Oregon commercial banks have the general power to loan money upon terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. [1997 c.631 §138; 2015 c.244 §42]

 

      708A.255 Interest rates on loans or uses of money; late charges. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rate of interest or the amount of other charges that a financial institution may contract for and receive for a loan or use of money is not subject to limitation.

      (2) If a borrower repays before maturity a loan that an Oregon commercial bank made, the Oregon commercial bank shall refund or credit to the borrower as provided in this subsection the unearned portion of the charges, if any. The amount of the refund may not be less than the total interest contracted for to maturity, less the greater of:

      (a) Ten percent of the amount financed, or $75, whichever is less; or

      (b) The interest earned to the installment due date nearest the date of prepayment, computed by applying the simple interest rate of the loan to the actual principal balances outstanding, for the periods of time the balances were actually outstanding. For purposes of computations under this paragraph, the installment due date that precedes the date of prepayment is nearest if prepayment occurs 15 days or less after that installment date. If prepayment occurs more than 15 days after the preceding installment due date, the next succeeding installment due date is nearest the date of prepayment. In determining the simple interest rate, an Oregon commercial bank may apply to the scheduled payments the actuarial method, by which each scheduled payment is applied first to accrued and unpaid interest and any amount remaining is applied to reduce the principal balance.

      (3) Any installment of an installment loan or payment under an open-end credit arrangement that the borrower does not pay when due continues to bear interest until paid. In addition, if the borrower does not pay the installment or payment when due, the installment or payment may bear a late charge in an amount to which the Oregon commercial bank and the borrower agree. Except for loans secured by real property, an Oregon commercial bank may impose a late charge only if:

      (a) The Oregon commercial bank does not receive the installment or payment within 10 days after the due date or, if the open-end credit arrangement is a credit card account, the Oregon commercial bank does not receive the payment on or before the due date;

      (b) The loan agreement or open-end credit arrangement provides for a late charge upon delinquent installments or payments; and

      (c) The Oregon commercial bank provides a monthly billing, coupon or notice that discloses the date on which installments or payments are due and states that the Oregon commercial bank may impose a late charge if:

      (A) The Oregon commercial bank does not receive payment within 10 days after the date on which the installment or payment is due; or

      (B) In the case of an open-end credit arrangement that is a credit card account, the Oregon commercial bank does not receive payment on or before the date on which the payment is due. If the Oregon commercial bank and the borrower have provided in the note or other written loan agreement that the borrower will make payments on the loan by means of automatic deductions from a deposit account that the borrower maintains, this paragraph does not require the Oregon commercial bank to provide the borrower with a monthly billing, coupon or notice on any occasion in which insufficient funds are in the borrower’s account to cover the amount of a loan payment on the date the loan payment becomes due and within the periods described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. [1997 c.631 §139; 1997 c.631 §139a; 2001 c.440 §1; 2015 c.244 §43]

 

      708A.260 Accepting own stock as collateral.

If the indebtedness is not paid in full within six months after the date on which the Oregon commercial bank took the stock as collateral, the Oregon commercial bank shall sell the stock promptly. [1997 c.631 §140; 2015 c.244 §44]

 

      708A.265 Accepting stock of other institutions as collateral. An Oregon commercial bank may not accept or hold as loan collateral in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the capital stock of any other insured stock institution. [1997 c.631 §141; 2015 c.244 §45]

 

      708A.270 Real estate loans. (1) With respect to any loans secured primarily by real estate, an Oregon commercial bank shall maintain a file containing such appraisal, evidence of merchantable title and insurance as may be required by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (2) All loans made by an Oregon commercial bank to finance the construction of buildings and the improvements appurtenant thereto shall be subject to such requirements as the director may determine. [1997 c.631 §142]

 

      708A.275 Establishment of loan production office; notice; fee. (1) An Oregon bank shall file a notice with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services within 30 days after establishing a loan production office in this state or in another state. The notice must include:

      (a) The name of the Oregon bank and the address of the main office;

      (b) The name and address of the loan production office; and

      (c) The name and address of the officer of the Oregon bank who is responsible for loan production office activities.

      (2) An Oregon bank shall file a notice under subsection (1) of this section for each loan production office.

Any such obligations shall, however, be subject to ORS 708A.295 in determining whether the Oregon commercial bank may make additional loans to or acquire other obligations of the person. [1997 c.631 §160]

 

DEPOSITS

 

      708A.400 Deposit accounts. Oregon commercial banks may, consistent with applicable law and safe and sound banking practices, offer deposit accounts upon such terms and conditions as they consider appropriate. [1997 c.631 §161]

 

      708A.405 Deposits; FDIC insurance required. Oregon commercial banks shall secure insurance for their deposits from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a similar organization organized under the laws of the United States. [1997 c.631 §162]

 

      708A.410 Savings accounts; conditions for withdrawal; interest rate; inadvertent overdraft. (1) Within the limits established under applicable federal statutes and regulations, an Oregon commercial bank that receives savings accounts shall prescribe by the Oregon commercial bank’s bylaws or by contract with the Oregon commercial bank’s depositors, the time and conditions on which the Oregon commercial bank repays depositors or makes a repayment to the depositors’ order.

      (2) An Oregon commercial bank may require 30 days’ notice to withdraw any sum up to $5,000, 90 days’ notice to withdraw any sum over $5,000 and not over $50,000, and 180 days’ notice to withdraw any sum over $50,000. The bank may limit, in the aggregate, withdrawals during a specified time period to the amount designated for the time period.

      (3)(a) Except for negotiable orders of withdrawal and similar deposit accounts, withdrawal from which is subject to check, negotiable order of withdrawal or similar instrument, and except for inadvertent overdrafts, an Oregon commercial bank may not knowingly permit a depositor to overdraw the depositor’s savings account.

      (b) As used in paragraph (a) of this subsection, “inadvertent overdraft” means an overdraft that:

      (A) The Oregon commercial bank does not expressly permit or provide for in bylaws or a deposit contract;

      (B) Results from events or circumstances beyond the Oregon commercial bank’s reasonable control; and

      (C) Is eliminated within 14 days after the Oregon commercial bank becomes aware of the overdraft. [1997 c.631 §163; 2013 c.104 §4; 2015 c.244 §46]

 

      708A.415 Securing deposits by surety bond, letter of credit or insurance. (1) An Oregon commercial bank may secure any of the funds deposited with the Oregon commercial bank by giving a surety bond, an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, or a policy of insurance under which some person other than the Oregon commercial bank becomes liable for deposits, provided that the aggregate face amount of the bonds, letters of credit and policies of insurance does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of the Oregon commercial bank.

      (2) A depositor may insure any deposit if the Oregon commercial bank is not a party to the insurance and does not pay any premium or other charges. [1997 c.631 §164]

 

      708A.420 Notice to depositor upon change in terms, charges, withdrawal conditions or decrease in interest rate; exception. (1) If an Oregon commercial bank changes the terms, service charges or conditions for withdrawal of any deposit account, the Oregon commercial bank shall notify the depositor in writing before the change is effective. If an Oregon commercial bank decreases the interest rate on any deposit account, other than an account that by its terms provides for a floating, variable or indexed rate of interest, the Oregon commercial bank shall notify the depositor in writing before the change is effective. With respect to deposit accounts for which the terms provide for a floating, variable or indexed rate of interest, the Oregon commercial bank need not give notice to the depositor concerning changes in the interest rate other than by means of account statements the Oregon commercial bank provides to the depositor in the ordinary course, not less than once each calendar quarter. For accounts that two or more depositors hold, the Oregon commercial bank may give or send the notice to any of the depositors. An Oregon commercial bank may notify a depositor under this section:

      (a) In person;

      (b) By sending the notice by regular mail to the last address shown in the Oregon commercial bank’s deposit account records; or

      (c) By sending the notice electronically in accordance with an agreement the depositor has with the Oregon commercial bank, provided that the Oregon commercial bank complies with all laws and regulations that apply to electronic consumer notices.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to any change in the interest rate payable upon an account as described in ORS 86.245. [1997 c.631 §165; 2015 c.244 §47]

 

      708A.425 Deposit made in name of minor. Any deposit in an Oregon commercial bank made to an account in the name of a minor must be held for the exclusive right and benefit of the minor free from the control or lien of all other persons, except other parties to the account and creditors, and must be paid, in accordance with the terms of the account, together with any interest on the deposit, to or upon the order of the minor. [1997 c.631 §166; 2015 c.244 §48]

 

      708A.430 Disposition of deposit on death of depositor. (1) On the death of a depositor of an insured institution, if the deposit is $25,000 or less, the insured institution, after receiving an affidavit as provided in subsection (3) of this section from a person that claims the deposit, or a declaration from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority as provided in subsection (4) of this section, may pay the moneys on deposit to the credit of the deceased depositor, in the following order of priority, to:

      (a) The surviving spouse at the surviving spouse’s demand at any time after the depositor’s death;

      (b) The Oregon Health Authority or the Department of Human Services, if the authority or the department demands the payment not less than 46 days and no more than 75 days after the death of the depositor if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse and if the authority or department has a preferred claim under ORS 411.708, 411.795 or 416.350;

      (c) The depositor’s surviving children 18 years of age or older, if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse and the authority and department do not have a claim;

      (d) The depositor’s surviving parent, if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse or surviving child 18 years of age or older and if the authority and department do not have a claim; or

      (e) The depositor’s surviving brothers and sisters 18 years of age or older, if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse, surviving child 18 years of age or older or surviving parent and the authority and department do not have a claim.

      (2)(a) An insured institution may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c), (d) or (e) of this section earlier than 46 days after the death of the depositor.

      (b) An insured institution may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c), (d) or (e) of this section earlier than 76 days after the death of the depositor unless the financial institution obtains prior verbal or written authorization from the Oregon Health Authority or its designated representative and the Department of Human Services or its designated representative.

      (3) An affidavit or declaration submitted under this section must:

      (a) State where and when the depositor died;

      (b) State that the total deposits of the deceased depositor in all financial institutions in Oregon do not exceed $25,000;

      (c) Show the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased depositor; and

      (d) Embody a promise to pay the expenses of last sickness, funeral expenses and just debts of the deceased depositor out of the deposit to the full extent of the deposit if necessary, in the order of priority prescribed by ORS 115.125, and to distribute any remaining moneys to the persons that are entitled to the moneys by law.

      (4) An insured institution shall accept from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, without additional requirements, a declaration under penalty of perjury meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. A declaration submitted under this section must be signed by the declarant and must include the following sentence immediately above the signature line of the declarant: “I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that I am authorized by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority to make this declaration, that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I understand that it is subject to penalty for perjury.”

      (5) In the event the depositor died intestate without known heirs, an estate administrator of the Department of State Lands appointed under ORS 113.235 is the affiant and shall receive the moneys as escheat property.

      (6) The insured institution shall determine the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased depositor, but paying the moneys in good faith to the affiant or declarant discharges and releases the insured institution from any liability or responsibility for the transfer in the same manner and with the same effect as if the insured institution transferred, delivered or paid the moneys to a personal representative of the estate of the deceased depositor.

      (7) A probate proceeding is not necessary to establish the right of the surviving spouse, Oregon Health Authority, Department of Human Services, surviving child, surviving parent, surviving brothers and sisters or an estate administrator of the Department of State Lands to withdraw the deposits after filing the affidavit or declaration. If a personal representative is appointed in an estate where a withdrawal of deposits was made under this section, the person that withdraws the deposits shall account for the deposits to the personal representative.

      (8) If an insured institution transfers moneys under subsection (1) of this section, the insured institution may require the transferee to furnish the insured institution with a written indemnity agreement that indemnifies the insured institution against loss for moneys the insured institution transferred to the extent of the amount of the deposit.

      (9)(a) Moneys disbursed to the Department of Human Services under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the department.

      (b) Moneys disbursed to the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the authority.

      (10) This section is subject to the rights of other parties in the account under ORS 708A.455 to 708A.515. [1997 c.631 §167; 2003 c.395 §20; 2005 c.381 §26; 2007 c.369 §1; 2009 c.595 §1113; 2011 c.720 §217; 2015 c.244 §49; 2017 c.51 §1]

 

      708A.435 Adverse claim to deposit; notice; restraining order or other process; indemnity bond or letter of credit. (1) An insured institution shall recognize an adverse claim to a deposit the insured institution holds only if the adverse claimant gives notice to the insured institution of the adverse claim and:

      (a) Procures a restraining order, injunction or other appropriate process against the insured institution in an action wherein the person to whose credit the deposit stands is made a party and served with summons; or

      (b) Delivers to the insured institution in a form, and with sureties acceptable to the insured institution, a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit that another insured institution has issued to indemnify the insured institution from any liability, damage and expenses that may arise from paying the adverse claim or dishonoring the check or other order of the person to whose credit the deposit stands.

      (2) This section does not apply if the person in whose name the account is carried is a fiduciary for the adverse claimant, and the affidavit of the adverse claimant states the facts constituting the fiduciary relationship and the facts showing reasonable cause for the claimant’s belief that the fiduciary is about to misappropriate the deposit.

      (3) An insured institution may, at the insured institution’s option, interplead a deposit that is subject to an adverse claim. [1997 c.631 §168; 2015 c.244 §50]

 

      708A.440 Checks drawn by agents presumed to be in authorized manner. If a person who owns a deposit account subject to check authorizes another person as agent to draw checks against the account, the insured institution, in the absence of written notice to the contrary, may presume that any check the agent draws in the manner that the terms and conditions of the account authorize, including a check the agent draws to the agent’s personal order, is for a purpose that the principal authorizes and is within the scope of the authority conferred upon the agent. [1997 c.631 §169; 2015 c.244 §51]

 

      708A.445 Checks of intoxicated, drugged or financially exploited persons. An insured institution may refuse to pay any check, draft or order drawn upon the insured institution if the officers or employees of the insured institution have reason to believe that the person signing or indorsing the instrument was the victim of financial exploitation, as defined in ORS 124.050, or was so under the influence of liquor, drugs or controlled substances or otherwise so incapacitated as to make it reasonably doubtful whether the person was capable of transacting business at the time of signing or indorsing the check, draft or order. [1997 c.631 §170; 2015 c.244 §52]

 

      708A.450 Certified checks. (1) An Oregon commercial bank shall certify a check only if the amount of the check actually stands to the credit of the drawer in collected funds on the books of the Oregon commercial bank.

      (2) The amount of any certified check shall be immediately charged to the drawer’s account. [1997 c.631 §171]

 

      708A.455 Definitions for ORS 708A.455 to 708A.515. As used in ORS 708A.455 to 708A.515, unless the context requires otherwise:

      708A.460 Application of ORS 708A.465 to 708A.475; liability and setoff rights of financial institutions. The provisions of ORS 708A.465 to 708A.475 concerning beneficial ownership as between parties, or as between parties and P.O.D. payees or beneficiaries of multiple-party accounts, apply only to controversies between the parties, the P.O.D. payees or the beneficiaries and the creditors and other successors of the parties, P.O.D. payees or beneficiaries, and do not apply to the power of withdrawal that a party, P.O.D. payee or beneficiary has under the terms of account contracts. The provisions of ORS 708A.485 to 708A.510 govern the liability of insured institutions that make payments under ORS 708A.485 to 708A.510, and an insured institution’s setoff rights. [1997 c.631 §173; 2015 c.244 §56]

 

      708A.465 Ownership of multiple-party accounts. (1) A joint account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.

      (2) A P.O.D. account belongs to the original party during the lifetime of the party and not to the P.O.D. payee or payees. If two or more persons are named as original parties, during their lifetimes, rights as between them are governed by subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Unless a contrary intent is manifested by the terms of the account or the deposit agreement or there is other clear and convincing evidence of an irrevocable trust, a trust account belongs beneficially to the trustee during the lifetime of the trustee. If two or more parties are named as trustees on the account, during their lifetimes beneficial rights as between them are governed by subsection (1) of this section. If there is an irrevocable trust, the account belongs beneficially to the beneficiary. [1997 c.631 §174]

 

      708A.470 Multiple-party accounts; disposition of deposit upon death of party or trustee; effect of will. (1) Sums that remain on deposit in an insured institution at the death of a party to a joint account are rebuttably presumed to belong to the surviving party or parties as against the estate of the decedent. If two or more parties survive, each party’s respective ownership during the party’s lifetime must be in proportion to the party’s previous ownership interest under ORS 708A.465, augmented by an equal share for each surviving party of any interest the decedent may have owned in the account immediately before death. The right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.

      (2) If the account is a P.O.D. account:

      (a) On the death of one of two or more original parties, subsection (1) of this section governs the rights to any sums that remain on deposit.

      (b) On the death of the sole original party or the survivor of two or more original parties, any sums that remain on deposit belong to the P.O.D. payee or payees, if a P.O.D. payee or payees survive, or to the remaining P.O.D. payee or payees if one or more P.O.D. payees die before the original party. If two or more P.O.D. payees survive, a remaining P.O.D. payee does not have a right of survivorship after one of the P.O.D. payees dies unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship among remaining P.O.D. payees.

      (3) If an account is a trust account:

      (a) On the death of one of two or more trustees, subsection (1) of this section governs the rights to any sums that remain on deposit.

      (b) On the death of the sole trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, any sums that remain on deposit belong to the person or persons named as beneficiaries, if a beneficiary or beneficiaries survive, or to the remaining beneficiary if one or more beneficiaries die before the trustee, unless clear and convincing evidence exists of a contrary intent. If two or more beneficiaries survive, a remaining beneficiary does not have a right of survivorship after one of the beneficiaries dies unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship among remaining beneficiaries.

      (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the death of any party to a multiple-party account does not affect the beneficial ownership of the account, other than to transfer the rights of the decedent as part of the decedent’s estate.

      (5) A will may not change a right of survivorship that arises from the express terms of the account or under this section, a beneficiary designation in a trust account, or a P.O.D. payee designation.

      (6) The rebuttable presumption under subsection (1) of this section may be overcome by evidence establishing that:

      (a) The deceased party intended a different result; or

      (b) The deceased party lacked capacity when the joint account was established.

      (7) An insured institution is not liable, with respect to sums that remain on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account, for distributing the sums to a surviving party or parties in accordance with the account agreement unless, before distributing the sums to a surviving party or parties:

      (a) The insured institution has received notice in writing of an adverse claim under ORS 708A.435; and

      (b) The adverse claimant proceeds as required under ORS 708A.435. [1997 c.631 §175; 2003 c.256 §1; 2015 c.244 §57]

 

      708A.475 Rights of survivorship based on form of account; alteration of form of account. The provisions of ORS 708A.470 as to rights of survivorship are determined by the form of the account at the death of a party. Subject to satisfaction of the requirements of the insured institution, the form of an account may be altered by written order given by a party to the insured institution if the party signs the order and the insured institution receives the order during the party’s lifetime, and if the party does not countermand the order with another written order during the party’s lifetime. [1997 c.631 §176; 2015 c.244 §58]

 

      708A.480 Transfer of moneys upon death of depositor or trustee is not testamentary disposition. Any transfers resulting from the application of ORS 708A.470 are effective by reason of the account contracts involved and ORS 708A.470, and are not to be considered as testamentary or subject to administration in the estate of a deceased party. [1997 c.631 §177]

 

      708A.485 Payment of deposit in multiple-party account to one or more parties; institution not required to determine source or use of funds in account. An insured institution may enter into a multiple-party account to the same extent that the insured institution may enter into a single-party account. The insured institution may pay any multiple-party account, on request, to any one or more of the parties. An insured institution need not inquire as to the source of funds the insured institution receives for deposit to a multiple-party account, or as to the proposed application of any sum withdrawn from an account, for purposes of establishing net contributions. [1997 c.631 §178; 2015 c.244 §59]

 

      708A.488 Withdrawal or payment conditioned on advance notice. If an insured institution conditions withdrawal or payment on advance notice, for purposes of ORS 708A.455 to 708A.515, a request for withdrawal or payment is immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is a request for withdrawal. [2015 c.244 §55]

 

      Note: 708A.488 was added to and made a part of 708A.455 to 708A.515 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      708A.490 Joint account; payment to any party to account; payment to others. An insured institution may pay any sums in a joint account, on request, to any party without regard to whether any other party is incapacitated or deceased at the time the party demands payment. An insured institution may not pay the personal representative or heirs of a deceased party unless proofs of death are presented to the insured institution showing that the decedent was the last surviving party or unless no right of survivorship exists under ORS 708A.470. [1997 c.631 §179; 2015 c.244 §60]

 

      708A.495 P.O.D. account; payment to any original party; payment to others. An insured institution may pay any P.O.D. account, on request, to any original party to the account. The insured institution may pay, on request, the P.O.D. payee or the personal representative or heirs of a deceased P.O.D. payee upon presentation to the insured institution of proof of death showing that the P.O.D. payee survived all persons named as original parties. The insured institution may pay the personal representative or heirs of a deceased original party if proof of death is presented to the insured institution showing that the decedent survived all other persons named on the account either as an original party or as P.O.D. payee. [1997 c.631 §180; 2015 c.244 §61]

 

      708A.500 Trust account; payment to any trustee; payment to others. An insured institution may pay any trust account, on request, to any trustee. Unless the insured institution has received written notice that the beneficiary has a vested interest that does not depend upon the beneficiary’s surviving the trustee, the insured institution may pay the personal representative or heirs of a deceased trustee if proof of death is presented to the insured institution showing that the decedent survived all other persons named on the account either as trustee or beneficiary. The insured institution may pay, on request, the beneficiary upon presentation to the insured institution of proof of death showing that the beneficiary or beneficiaries survived all persons named as trustees. [1997 c.631 §181; 2015 c.244 §62]

 

      708A.505 Discharge of institution from liability for payments made; conditions. A payment that an insured institution makes under ORS 708A.485, 708A.490, 708A.495 or 708A.500 discharges the insured institution from all claims for amounts the insured institution paid whether or not the payment is consistent with the beneficial ownership of the account as between parties, P.O.D. payees or beneficiaries, or successors of the parties, P.O.D. payees or beneficiaries. The protection given by this section does not extend to payments an insured institution makes after receiving a written notice from any party able to request present payment to the effect that withdrawals in accordance with the terms of the account should not be permitted. Unless the person that gives the notice withdraws the notice, the successor of any deceased party must concur in any demand for withdrawal in order for the protections that this section provides to extend to the insured institution. Any other notice or information shown to have been available to an insured institution does not affect the insured institution’s right to protection under this section. The protection that this section provides does not affect the rights of parties in disputes between the parties or the parties’ successors concerning the beneficial ownership of funds in, or withdrawn from, multiple-party accounts. [1997 c.631 §182; 2015 c.244 §63]

 

      708A.510 Right of institution to setoff; amount. Without qualifying any other statutory or common law right to setoff or lien and subject to any contractual provision, if a party to a multiple-party account is indebted to an insured institution, the insured institution has a right to setoff against the account in which the party has or had a present right of withdrawal immediately before the party’s death. The amount of the account that is subject to setoff is the proportion to which the debtor is, or was immediately before the death of the debtor, beneficially entitled and, in the absence of proof of net contributions, to an equal share with all parties that have present rights of withdrawal. [1997 c.631 §183; 2015 c.244 §64]

 

      708A.515 Designation of agent for account; powers of agent. ORS 708A.455 to 708A.465 do not preclude a party to an account from adding the name of another person to the account with the designation “agent.” The agent does not have a present or future interest in the sums on deposit in such account, but the insured institution may honor requests from the agent for payment from the account, unless the principal is deceased at the time the agent requests the payment and the insured institution has actual knowledge of the principal’s death. An insured institution’s payment from the account at the agent’s request discharges the insured institution from all claims for amounts the insured institution paid. [1997 c.631 §184; 2015 c.244 §65]
