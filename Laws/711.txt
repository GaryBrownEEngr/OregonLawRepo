      (3) The director is under no obligation to determine the relationship of the affiants or declarants to the deceased depositor and the payment of dividends made in good faith to parties making the affidavit or declaration shall be a release of the director for the amount of the dividends so paid.

The director may require that the person show identification reasonably identifying the person as the person whose name appears as owner of the property on the institution’s books or as the person in whose name the safe, vault or box stands. The director may limit access to normal business hours.

      (2) Upon the date fixed by the notice, the contract, if any, between a person and the institution for the storage of the property or for the use of the safe, vault or box is terminated, and the amount of the unearned rent or charges, if any, paid by the person becomes a debt of the institution to the person.

      (3) After the date fixed in the notice the safe, vault or box may be opened in the presence of the director, and a witness who is not an officer or employee of the institution. A list and description of the property shall be made by the person opening the safe, vault or box and shall be attached to the property.

      (2) The agent shall file with the director a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit to the State of Oregon in an amount not less than 20 percent of the book value of the assets to be surrendered to the agent, but in no case shall the bond or letter of credit be less than $1,000.

The bond or letter of credit shall be conditioned for the faithful performance of all the duties of the agent’s trust.

      (3) When the agent files the required bond or letter of credit, the director shall transfer to the agent all the assets of the institution remaining in the hands of the director. Upon the transfer and delivery the director is discharged from all further liability to the institution and its creditors.

      (4) If the stockholders fail to meet on the date advertised for the stockholders’ meeting or within 15 days after the advertised date or fail to appoint an agent, or if the agent fails to qualify as required in this section within 30 days after the date of their selection, the director may appoint an agent. This agent shall file a bond or letter of credit and liquidate the affairs of the institution as though the agent had been selected by the stockholders. Upon the transfer and delivery to the agent appointed by the director of all the remaining assets in the hands of the director, the director is discharged from all further liability to the institution and its creditors. [Amended by 1973 c.797 §287; 1991 c.331 §116; 1997 c.631 §252]

If a petitioner is dissatisfied with the decision of the director the petitioner may, within 30 days after the decision of the director, present the petition, with the decision of the director, to the supervising court. The supervising court shall fix a date for the hearing of the petition, giving reasonable notice of the date to the petitioner and to the director.

      711.610 [Repealed by 1973 c.797 §428]

[Amended by 1973 c.797 §292; 1999 c.803 §7]

 

      711.620 Suspending or restricting payment of liabilities; duration. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may order an Oregon stock bank to suspend or restrict the payment of its liabilities to depositors and other creditors except as provided in ORS 711.620 to 711.670, if the action is necessary for the protection of the depositors and other creditors of the Oregon stock bank and is in the public interest.

      (2) The order of the director is effective upon receipt by the Oregon stock bank of written notice thereof signed by the director and shall continue in effect until released or modified by the written order of the director. The suspension and restriction shall not exceed a period of 90 days, but may be extended for further periods not to exceed 90 days each upon the written order of the director. [1973 c.797 §293; 1997 c.631 §253]

 

      711.625 Taking possession of Oregon stock bank by director; powers of director; expenses. (1) When the order mentioned in ORS 711.620 takes effect, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall immediately take possession of the property and affairs of the Oregon stock bank, and take whatever action is necessary to conserve the assets of the Oregon stock bank pending further disposition of its business.

      (2) While the director is in possession of an Oregon stock bank, the director shall have all the powers given to the director in connection with insolvent Oregon stock banks, and the rights of interested parties shall, subject to ORS 711.620 to 711.670, be the same as if the director had taken possession of the Oregon stock bank because of insolvency.

      (3) All expenses of the director while in possession of the Oregon stock bank shall be paid out of the assets of the Oregon stock bank and shall be a lien on the assets prior to any other lien. [1973 c.797 §294; 1975 c.544 §38; 1997 c.631 §254]

 

      711.630 Pro rata withdrawals by depositors. While the Oregon stock bank is in the possession of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services under ORS 711.625, the director may set aside and make available for withdrawal by depositors on a ratable basis such amounts as in the opinion of the director may safely be used for the purpose. [1973 c.797 §295; 1997 c.631 §255]

 

      711.635 Receiving new deposits; segregation. (1) While the Oregon stock bank is in the possession of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services under ORS 711.625, the Oregon stock bank may accept deposits but the deposits shall not be subject to any limitation as to payment or withdrawal.

      (2) Deposits received after the director takes possession and the amounts released for payment to depositors under ORS 711.630, shall be segregated and held and used solely to meet the deposit liability and the pro rata amount so released. They shall not be used to liquidate any indebtedness of the Oregon stock bank existing at the time the director took possession, or any subsequent indebtedness incurred in liquidating any indebtedness of the Oregon stock bank existing at the time the director took possession.

      (3) Deposits received while the Oregon stock bank is in the possession of the director shall be kept on hand in cash, invested in direct obligations of the United States or deposited with an approved reserve depository. [1973 c.797 §296; 1997 c.631 §256]

 

      711.640 Termination of suspension or restriction on payment of liabilities. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may, by order, on a date fixed by the order and at least 10 days after the date of the order, terminate the suspension or restriction on payment of liabilities of the Oregon stock bank designated in the order.

      (2) Immediately upon the termination of the suspension or restriction on payment of liabilities of the Oregon stock bank designated in the order, the director shall surrender possession of the assets and properties of the Oregon stock bank to the proper officers of the Oregon stock bank. The receipt of the officers operates as a full release of the director. [1973 c.797 §297; 1997 c.631 §257]

 

      711.645 Notice of termination of suspension or restriction on payment of liabilities. (1) At least 10 days before the date on which the suspension or restriction on the payment of liabilities is terminated, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall cause a notice to be published in a newspaper circulated in the city, town or county in which the principal office of the Oregon stock bank is located. Only one publication of the notice is required.

      (2) The notice shall specify:

      (a) The date on which the suspension or restriction on the payment of liabilities will be removed;

      (b) That the provisions of ORS 711.635 pertaining to the segregation of deposits will not be effective after that date; and

      (c) That the segregated deposits after the removal of the restriction or suspension will be general deposits.

      (3) On or before the date of the publication of the notice, the director shall mail, postage prepaid, to each depositor in the Oregon stock bank whose deposit has been segregated as provided by ORS 711.635 a copy of the notice addressed to the last-known address of each depositor as shown by the records of the Oregon stock bank.

      (4) The director shall hand a copy of the notice to every depositor making a deposit in the Oregon stock bank after the date of the newspaper publication and up to the time the suspension or restriction on the payment of liabilities of the Oregon stock bank is removed. [1973 c.797 §298; 1997 c.631 §258]

 

      711.650 Segregation of deposits until termination notice has been given. If the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services removes the restrictions or suspensions on the payment of liabilities of any Oregon stock bank and surrenders possession of the assets and properties of the Oregon stock bank to the proper officers of the Oregon stock bank, before the 10 days’ notice provided for by ORS 711.645 has been given, the Oregon stock bank shall keep deposits segregated under ORS 711.635 separate and apart from its other assets until the notice has been given by the Oregon stock bank in the manner provided in ORS 711.645. After the notice has been given, the segregated deposits shall become general deposits and may be mingled with the other assets of the Oregon stock bank and the provisions of ORS 711.635 with respect to segregation of deposits shall no longer apply. [1973 c.797 §299; 1997 c.631 §259]

 

      711.655 Use of suspended deposits to pay indebtedness of depositor. Nothing in ORS 711.620 to 711.670 prevents the assignment of a suspended deposit liability or the application of all or a part of a suspended deposit to payment at maturity of any indebtedness of the depositor to the Oregon stock bank that existed at the time the suspension became effective, but a deposit liability subsequently assigned may not be so applied. [1973 c.797 §300; 1997 c.631 §260]

 

      711.660 Assignment or transfer of capital stock while payment of liabilities suspended or restricted. While the payment of the liabilities of any Oregon stock bank is suspended or restricted under ORS 711.620, an assignment or transfer of the capital stock of the Oregon stock bank is invalid. [1973 c.797 §301; 1997 c.631 §261]

 

      711.665 Suspension or restriction of liability payment not evidence of insolvency. An order of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services under ORS 711.620 to 711.670 or the taking possession of the assets and properties of an Oregon stock bank by the director under ORS 711.620 to 711.670 is not an act of insolvency of the Oregon stock bank and does not raise any presumption of insolvency. [1973 c.797 §302; 1997 c.631 §262]

 

      711.670 Compliance with ORS 711.620 to 711.670 as defense to depositor’s action. Compliance with the terms and conditions of ORS 711.620 to 711.670 and orders and rules promulgated as a result of ORS 711.620 to 711.670 is a complete defense to any suit or action brought by any depositor or creditor against an Oregon stock bank with respect to any deposit or contract liability. [1973 c.797 §303; 1997 c.631 §263]

 

PENALTIES

 

      711.980 Civil penalties. Any person who violates ORS 711.415 shall forfeit and pay to the State Treasurer to be deposited in the Consumer and Business Services Fund a civil penalty in an amount determined by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services of not more than $2,500 for each offense. The civil penalty may be recovered as provided in ORS 706.980. [1975 c.544 §40]

 

      711.990 [Amended by 1973 c.797 §304; repealed by 1975 c.544 §62]
