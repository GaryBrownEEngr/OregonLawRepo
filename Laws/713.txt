If the director finds that the application conforms to the provisions of this chapter, the director, when all fees and charges have been paid, shall file the application to withdraw and return the copy marked “Filed” to the sender.

      (2) The authority of the out-of-state bank or extranational institution to conduct banking business in this state ceases when the application to withdraw is filed. [1989 c.324 §67; 1997 c.631 §302; 2011 c.263 §14]

 

      713.230 Revocation of certificate of authority. A certificate of authority for an out-of-state bank or extranational institution to conduct banking business in this state may be revoked if the out-of-state bank or extranational institution:

      (1) Failed to file a report or pay a fee required under the Bank Act;

      (2) Failed to appoint or maintain a registered agent or office in this state as required by ORS 713.170 or failed to maintain authority to transact business as required by ORS 713.140 (3);

      (3) Changed the out-of-state bank’s or extranational institution’s registered office or registered agent and failed to submit a statement of the change to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services as required by ORS 713.200 (1);

      (4) Misrepresented or allowed a misrepresentation of a material matter in an application, report, affidavit or other document that the out-of-state bank or extranational institution submitted pursuant to the Bank Act;

      (5) Failed to submit for filing an application to amend the out-of-state bank’s or extranational institution’s certificate of authority as required by ORS 713.200 (2); or

      (6) Failed to submit for filing a certificate of merger or consolidation as required by ORS 713.260. [1989 c.324 §68; 1997 c.631 §303; 2011 c.263 §15]

 

      713.240 Procedure for revocation of certificate of authority; restoration; reinstatement; fee. (1) If an out-of-state bank or extranational institution has given cause for revocation of a certificate of authority as provided in ORS 713.230 and has failed to correct the neglect, omission, misrepresentation or delinquency, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may revoke the right of the out-of-state bank or extranational institution to conduct banking business in this state. The director shall mail a notice of the revocation to the mailing address shown for the out-of-state bank or extranational institution in the current records of the director and to the out-of-state bank or extranational institution at the registered office for the out-of-state bank or extranational institution in this state or the principal office in the out-of-state bank’s or extranational institution’s home state or country.

      (2) After the director revokes the certificate of authority, all powers that this state conferred upon the out-of-state bank or extranational institution cease, and thereafter a person may not exercise or attempt to exercise power under the revoked certificate of authority in this state.

      (3) If the director is satisfied that an out-of-state bank or extranational institution that has had a certificate of authority revoked under subsection (1) of this section has corrected the cause for revocation, the director shall restore the out-of-state bank’s or extranational institution’s former rights and privileges in the same manner as the director revoked the authority of the out-of-state bank or extranational institution.

      (4) An out-of-state bank or extranational institution previously authorized to conduct banking business in this state that has had a certificate of authority revoked and that has corrected the cause for revocation under subsection (1) of this section may apply to reinstate the certificate of authority within two years after the date of revocation. The out-of-state bank or extranational institution shall pay all fees that accrued before the director revoked the certificate of authority and a reinstatement filing fee of $100. The payment must accompany the application for reinstatement. If the director is satisfied that the out-of-state bank or extranational institution has corrected the cause for revocation, the director shall file the application for reinstatement, which entitles the out-of-state bank or extranational institution to resume business in this state. The director may not file the application for reinstatement unless the name of the out-of-state bank or extranational institution conforms to ORS 713.130 and the application is filed within two years after the date of revocation.

      (5) Reinstatement under this section relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the revocation of the certificate of authority, so that the existence of the out-of-state bank or extranational institution is deemed to have continued without interruption from that date. [1989 c.324 §69; 1997 c.631 §304; 2011 c.263 §16]

 

      713.250 Limits on banks and institutions without certificates of authority. (1) An out-of-state bank or extranational institution that conducts banking business in this state without a certificate of authority may not maintain an action, suit or proceeding in a court of this state until the out-of-state bank or extranational institution obtains a certificate of authority.

      (2) An out-of-state bank’s or extranational institution’s failure to obtain a certificate of authority to conduct banking business in this state does not impair the validity of a contract or an act of the out-of-state bank or extranational institution, and does not prevent the out-of-state bank or extranational institution from defending an action, suit or proceeding in a court of this state.

      (3) An out-of-state bank or extranational institution that conducts banking business in this state without a certificate of authority is liable to this state for the years or partial years during which the out-of-state bank or extranational institution conducted banking business in this state without a certificate of authority. The amount of the liability is equal to all fees, assessments and other charges that the out-of-state bank or extranational institution would have paid under the Bank Act had the out-of-state bank or extranational institution duly applied for and received a certificate of authority to conduct banking business in this state and filed all reports required under the Bank Act, plus all penalties imposed under the Bank Act for failure to pay the fees and charges. The Attorney General may bring proceedings to recover amounts due this state under the provisions of this section. [1989 c.324 §70; 1997 c.631 §305; 2011 c.263 §17]

 

      713.260 Merger or consolidation. If an out-of-state bank or extranational institution that has a certificate of authority under ORS 713.020 ceases to exist because of a statutory merger or consolidation with any other out-of-state bank, an extranational institution or other entity, the resulting institution shall, within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services a certificate from the appropriate public officer of the state, territory or country under the laws of which the out-of-state bank or extranational institution is organized, or other evidence satisfactory to the director to the effect that the out-of-state bank or extranational institution has merged or consolidated and has ceased to exist. [1989 c.324 §71; 1997 c.631 §306; 2011 c.263 §18]

 

      713.270 Maintaining out-of-state bank branch in this state; requirements; application; fee; denial of application; enforcement. (1) An out-of-state bank, including a savings bank organized under the laws of another state, may open, occupy or maintain a branch in this state that results from:

      (a) Acquiring another bank or branch of another bank that is located in this state; or

      (b) Merging with or converting from another bank or branch of another bank that is located in this state.

      (2) An out-of-state bank may conduct banking business in this state under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section or by opening one or more de novo branches in this state if the laws of the jurisdiction in which the out-of-state bank’s principal office is located expressly permit an Oregon bank to open one or more de novo branches in the jurisdiction under conditions that are not more restrictive than the conditions this chapter imposes on an out-of-state bank.

      (3) An out-of-state bank must submit an application for a certificate of authority to conduct banking business in this state to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services at the time that the out-of-state bank files with the out-of-state bank’s home state or primary federal regulator for approval to open, occupy or maintain a branch in this state.

      (4) At the time the out-of-state bank applies for a certificate of authority, the out-of-state bank must pay the application fee prescribed in ORS 713.150.

      (5) If the director authorizes an out-of-state bank to open, occupy or maintain a branch in this state, the out-of-state bank may exercise the powers and authorities that the laws of this state authorize for Oregon banks unless the laws of the out-of-state bank’s home state limit the powers and authorities.

      (6) If the director determines that an out-of-state bank’s opening, occupying or maintaining of a branch in this state is not consistent with the laws of this state or that the branch would operate in an unsafe or unsound manner, the director shall notify the out-of-state bank that:

      (a) The director has denied the out-of-state bank’s application for a certificate of authority to conduct banking business in this state; and

      (b) The out-of-state bank may not conduct banking business at a branch located in this state.

      (7) If the director determines that a branch that an out-of-state bank maintains in this state is being operated in violation of the laws of this state or that the branch is being operated in an unsafe or unsound manner, the director may take all enforcement actions the director could take with respect to an Oregon bank, except that the director shall notify the responsible bank supervisory agency of each enforcement action the director takes and, to the extent practicable, shall consult and cooperate with the responsible bank supervisory agency in pursuing and resolving the enforcement action. [1997 c.631 §284; 2011 c.263 §19]

 

      713.280 Effect of laws of state or country in which out-of-state bank or extranational institution is organized. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may not deny a certificate of authority to an out-of-state bank or extranational institution solely because the laws of the state or country under which the out-of-state bank or extranational institution is organized, or the laws that govern the organization and internal affairs of the out-of-state bank or extranational institution, differ from the laws of this state. This chapter does not authorize this state to regulate the organization or internal affairs of an out-of-state bank or extranational institution. [1997 c.631 §285; 2011 c.263 §20]

 

      713.290 Requirements for deposits at office of extranational institution. An extranational institution may not accept deposits at an office in this state in an amount less than $250,000, unless the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures the insurable deposits of the office or the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation do not require insurance. [1997 c.631 §289; 2011 c.263 §21]

 

      713.300 Out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association; activities that do not constitute transacting business in this state; filing notice with director; fee. (1) For purposes of this section, “foreign association” means a corporation organized to transact savings and loan business under federal law or under the laws of another state or territory of the United States, the home state or territory of which is a state or territory other than Oregon.

      (2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, an out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association, without being authorized to transact banking business or savings and loan business in this state, may take, acquire, hold and enforce notes secured by mortgages or trust deeds and make commitments to purchase the notes. The out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association may foreclose the mortgages or trust deeds in the courts of this state, acquire the mortgaged property, hold, own and operate the property for a period not exceeding five years and dispose of the property. The activities that this subsection authorizes an out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association to engage in do not constitute transacting business in this state for the purposes of ORS chapter 60.

      (3) Before an out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association engages in an activity described in subsection (2) of this section, the out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association shall first file with the Department of Consumer and Business Services a notice that states that the out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association intends to engage in one or more of the activities described in subsection (2) of this section. The out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association shall pay an initial filing fee of $200 and an annual fee of $200. The notice must include the address of the principal place of business of the out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association.

      (4) An out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association that is authorized to transact banking business in this state under ORS 713.160 need not comply with subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) An out-of-state bank, extranational institution or foreign association that indirectly engages in the activities described in subsection (2) of this section because of a beneficial interest in a pool of notes secured by mortgages or trust deeds need not comply with subsection (3) of this section. [1999 c.30 §4; 2009 c.541 §32; 2015 c.244 §87; 2017 c.209 §1]

 

      713.990 Civil penalties. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may impose on any person that violates any provision of this chapter a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each day during which the offense continues. The penalty shall be assessed and collected in the manner prescribed in ORS 706.570 (3). [1997 c.631 §308; 2015 c.244 §88]
