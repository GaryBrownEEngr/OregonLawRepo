The director shall promptly advise the banking institution if the notice is incomplete or if the director requires additional information.

      (b) The director may limit or restrict a banking institution’s ability to establish an additional branch if the director determines that establishing an additional branch would adversely affect the banking institution’s safety and soundness.

      (a) Any law enacted by the Congress of the United States; or

      714.270 Prohibitions on use of ATM for banking information. No person shall use or attempt to use an ATM facility for the purpose of obtaining any information concerning an account or line of credit other than the person’s own account or line of credit without the prior approval of an authorized signer on the account or line of credit. No person having received prior approval of the customer shall utilize such authority to obtain through the use of the ATM any information not necessary to the transaction which the customer seeks to accomplish through its use. [1975 c.193 §9; 1993 c.381 §7; 1997 c.631 §310]

 

      714.280 Legislative intent of ATM and night deposit facility law. (1) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly in enacting ORS 714.280 to 714.315 to enhance the safety of consumers using ATMs and night deposit facilities in Oregon without discouraging the siting of ATMs and night deposit facilities in locations convenient to consumers’ homes and workplaces. Since decisions concerning safety at ATMs and night deposit facilities are inherently subjective, the Legislative Assembly intends to establish as the standard of care applicable to operators of ATMs and night deposit facilities in connection with user safety, the compliance with the objective standards and information requirements of ORS 714.280 to 714.315. The Legislative Assembly further recognizes the need for uniformity as to the establishment of safety standards for ATMs and night deposit facilities and intends with ORS 714.280 to 714.315 to supersede and preempt any rule, regulation, code or ordinance of any city, county, municipality or local agency regarding customer safety at ATMs and night deposit facilities in this state.

      (2) It is not the intent of the Legislative Assembly in enacting ORS 714.280 to 714.315 to impose a duty to relocate or modify ATMs or night deposit facilities upon the occurrence of any particular events or circumstances, but rather to establish a means for the evaluation of all ATMs and night deposit facilities as provided in ORS 714.210 to 714.992. [1993 c.381 §§9,11]

 

      714.285 Adoption of procedures for evaluating safety of ATM or night deposit facilities. Before installing any ATM or night deposit facility, the operator shall adopt procedures for evaluating the safety of the ATM or night deposit facility. For ATMs and night deposit facilities installed on or before July 1, 1994, operators shall adopt procedures not later than July 1, 1994. The procedures shall include a consideration of the following:

      (1) The extent to which the lighting for the ATM or night deposit facility complies or will comply with the standards required by ORS 714.290 and 714.295.

      (2) The presence of landscaping, vegetation or other obstructions in the area of the ATM or night deposit facility, the access area and the defined parking area.

      (3) The incidence of crimes of violence in the immediate neighborhood of the ATM or night deposit facility, as reflected in the records of the local law enforcement agency and of which the operator has actual knowledge. [1993 c.381 §10]

 

      714.290 Deadlines for compliance with ORS 714.295. (1) Each operator of an ATM or night deposit facility installed after July 1, 1994, shall comply with ORS 714.295. Compliance with ORS 714.295 by operators of ATMs and night deposit facilities existing on or before July 1, 1994, shall be optional until July 1, 1996, and mandatory thereafter. This section shall apply to an operator of an ATM or night deposit facility only to the extent that the operator controls the access area or defined parking area to be lighted.

      (2) If an access area or a defined parking area is not controlled by the operator of an ATM or night deposit facility, and if the person who leased the ATM or night deposit facility site to the operator controls the access area or defined parking area, the person who controls the access area or defined parking area shall comply with ORS 714.295 regarding any ATM or night deposit facility installed after July 1, 1994. Regarding any ATM or night deposit facility installed on or before July 1, 1994, the person shall comply with ORS 714.295 no later than July 1, 1996. [1993 c.381 §12]

 

      714.295 Lighting requirements for ATMs and night deposit facilities. The operator, owner or other person responsible for the ATM or night deposit facility shall provide lighting during hours of darkness for an open and operating ATM or night deposit facility and any defined parking area, access area and the exterior of an enclosed ATM or night deposit facility installation according to the following standards:

      (1) There shall be a minimum of 10 candlefoot power at the face of the ATM or night deposit facility and extending in an unobstructed direction outward five feet.

      (2) There shall be a minimum of two candlefoot power within 50 feet in all unobstructed directions from the face of the ATM or night deposit facility. In the event the ATM or night deposit facility is located within 10 feet of the corner of the building and the ATM or night deposit facility is generally accessible from the adjacent side, there shall be minimum of two candlefoot power along the first 40 unobstructed feet of the adjacent side of the building.

      (3) There shall be a minimum of two candlefoot power in that portion of the defined parking area within 60 feet of the ATM or night deposit facility. [1993 c.381 §13]

 

      714.300 Issuance of safety information to customers of ATMs and night deposit facilities. The issuers of access devices shall furnish customers receiving the devices with notices of basic safety precautions which customers should employ while using an ATM or night deposit facility. This information shall be furnished by personally delivering or by mailing the information to each customer whose mailing address as to the account to which the access device relates is in this state. This information shall be furnished with respect to access devices issued after July 1, 1994, at or before the time the customer is furnished with his or her access device. With respect to a customer to whom an access device has been issued on or before July 1, 1994, the information shall be delivered or mailed to the customer on or before December 31, 1994. Only one notice need be furnished per household, and if access devices are furnished to more than one customer for a single account or set of accounts or on the basis of a single application or other request for the access devices, only a single notice need be furnished in satisfaction of the notification responsibilities as to all those customers. The information may be included with other disclosures related to the access device furnished to the customer, such as with any initial or periodic disclosure statement furnished pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). [1993 c.381 §14]

 

      714.305 Exempted ATMs and night deposit facilities. The requirements of ORS 714.280 (2) and 714.285 to 714.295 shall not apply to any ATM or night deposit facility that is:

      (1) Located inside of a building, unless it is a freestanding installation that exists for the sole purpose of providing an enclosure for the ATM or night deposit facility.

      (2) Located inside of a building, except to the extent that a transaction can be conducted from outside the building.

      (3) Located in any area, including any access area, building, enclosed space or parking area that is not controlled by the operator. [1993 c.381 §15]

 

      714.310 Preemption of local regulation. ORS 714.210 to 714.315 supersede and preempts all rules, regulations, codes, statutes or ordinances of all cities, counties, municipalities and local agencies regarding customer safety at ATMs or night deposit facilities located in Oregon. [1993 c.381 §16]

 

      714.315 Creation of rebuttable presumption. Compliance with ORS 714.280 to 714.300 shall create a rebuttable presumption that the operator of the ATM or night deposit facility in question has provided adequate measures for the safety of users of the ATM or night deposit facility. [1993 c.381 §17]

 

      714.990 [Repealed by 1973 c.797 §428]
