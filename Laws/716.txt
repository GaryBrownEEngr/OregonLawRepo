For purposes of this section, references in federal statutes, regulations and other authorities that prescribe permissible activities and investments of federal savings banks and subsidiaries of federal savings banks shall be considered whenever practicable to refer to comparable provisions of Oregon law. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may approve an activity or investment that requires director approval subject to such conditions as the director deems appropriate.

The required contents of the report shall be established by the director by rule. The reports filed with the director under this paragraph shall be available for public inspection in the office of the director.

      716.780 Crediting portion of net earnings to guaranty fund. (1) If at the close of any dividend period the guaranty fund of an Oregon nonstock bank is impaired or is less than 10 percent of the amount due to depositors, a sum not less than five percent of the net earnings for the period shall be deducted from the net earnings and credited to its guaranty fund, after declaration of dividends, if the deduction will not compel the Oregon nonstock bank to reduce its dividends to depositors below the rate of one percent per annum.

      (2) If the guaranty fund accumulated from earnings equals or exceeds 10 percent of the amount due depositors and the net earnings for a dividend period are sufficient, the minimum dividend shall be four percent, unless a smaller percentage is authorized by rule promulgated by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. [Amended by 1973 c.797 §386; 1975 c.544 §48; 1997 c.631 §353]

 

      716.790 Computation of guaranty fund. (1) To determine the amount of a guaranty fund of an Oregon nonstock bank, the total liabilities due and accrued, undivided profits and net earnings since the last declaration of dividends shall be subtracted from the total assets. In determining the value of the assets:

      (a) Securities, other evidences of indebtedness and other interest-bearing obligations shall be carried at a sum, not to exceed their cost to the Oregon nonstock bank, calculated according to accepted principles of accounting.

      (b) Real estate shall not be estimated above cost unless its fair market value has been determined by written appraisal made by a certified appraiser and approved by the board of the Oregon nonstock bank, in which case the real estate may be carried at the fair market value determined by the appraisal. If the real estate has been acquired by foreclosure or judgment at more than its actual fair market value, the value of the real estate shall be determined by written appraisal made by a certified appraiser and approved by the board of the Oregon nonstock bank and filed with the Oregon nonstock bank.

      (c) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the following shall be excluded:

      (A) Assets that have been disallowed by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the directors of the Oregon nonstock bank;

      (b) The debt is secured by a first mortgage upon real estate and is carried as an asset at the amount of the debt secured by the mortgage or at the actual fair market value of the real estate as determined by written appraisal made by a certified appraiser and approved by the board of the Oregon nonstock bank and filed with the Oregon nonstock bank, whichever is smaller. [Amended by 1973 c.797 §387; 1997 c.631 §354; 2003 c.576 §551]

 

      716.800 Repayment of contributions made to expense fund and guaranty fund. (1) Contributions made by the incorporators or directors to the expense fund may be repaid pro rata to the contributors from that portion of the guaranty fund created from earnings if the payments will not reduce the guaranty fund below 10 percent of the total amount due depositors. If the Oregon nonstock bank liquidates before the contributions to the expense fund have been repaid, any contributions to the expense fund remaining after the payment of the expenses of liquidation and the payment to depositors in full may be repaid to the contributors pro rata.

      (2) When the contributions of the incorporators or directors to the expense fund have been returned to the contributors, the contributions made to the guaranty fund by incorporators or directors may be returned to them pro rata from that portion of the guaranty fund created from the earnings of the Oregon nonstock bank, if the repayments will not reduce the earned portion of the guaranty fund below 10 percent of the amount due depositors. If the Oregon nonstock bank liquidates before the contributions to the guaranty fund have been repaid, any portion of the contributions not needed for the payment of the expenses of liquidation, the payment of depositors in full and the repayment of contributions to the expense fund may be repaid to the contributors pro rata.

      (3) The board of directors may create a fund to be known as the guarantor’s reimbursement fund. One percent of the net earnings at the close of any dividend period may be paid in the guarantor’s reimbursement fund if it can be done without reducing the dividend rate below one percent per annum. The guarantor’s reimbursement fund may accumulate until it is equal to the amount contributed by the incorporators to the guaranty and expense funds, at which time the fund shall be used to repay the incorporators the amounts contributed by them to the guaranty and expense funds, if that portion of the guaranty fund created from earnings amounts to at least $15,000. [Amended by 1973 c.797 §388; 1997 c.631 §355]

 

      716.805 Determining earnings. Earnings of a savings bank shall be calculated on an accrual basis according to generally accepted accounting principles. [1973 c.797 §389]

      716.830 Payment of dividends; classification of depositors; certificates of deposit; notice of change of rate. (1) Every Oregon nonstock bank shall regulate the rate of dividends upon the amounts to the credit of its time depositors so that time depositors receive dividends on their deposits in accordance with the terms of their respective deposit agreements with the Oregon nonstock bank, after transferring:

      (a) To the guaranty fund any amount considered by the directors to be expedient and for the security of the depositors; and

      (b) To undivided profits, for the purpose of maintaining its rate of dividends, the amount considered by the directors as wise.

      (2) An Oregon nonstock bank may classify its time depositors according to the character, amount or duration of their deposits with the Oregon nonstock bank, and may regulate its dividends so that each time depositor shall receive the same ratable portion of dividends as all others in the same class of time depositors.

      (3) Dividends may be apportioned upon unimpaired contributions to the initial guaranty fund and to the expense fund, and may be credited and paid to the contributors. If the guaranty fund of any Oregon nonstock bank is sufficiently large to permit the return of the contributions, the contributors may receive dividends on the contributions not exceeding the highest rate paid to depositors.

      (4) An Oregon nonstock bank may issue certificates of deposit and agree to pay dividends on the amounts deposited at a rate specified in the certificate for the entire term of the certificate.

      (5) An Oregon nonstock bank shall not:

      (a) Declare, credit or pay any dividend except as authorized by a vote of a majority of the board of directors and recorded in its minutes according to the ayes and noes upon each vote.

      (b) Pay any dividend other than the regular monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual dividend, or the dividends prescribed in this subsection.

      (c) Declare, credit or pay dividends on any amount to the credit of a depositor for a longer period than it has been credited, but deposits made not later than the 10th business day of any month, or withdrawn upon one of the last three business days of the month ending any quarterly or semiannual dividend period, may have dividends declared upon them for the whole of the period or month when they were so deposited or withdrawn. If authorized in the bylaws, accounts closed between dividend periods may be credited with dividends at the rate of the last dividend, computed from the last dividend period to the date when closed.

      (6) A notice posted in an Oregon nonstock bank of a change in the rate of dividends is equivalent to a personal notice. [Amended by 1963 c.409 §1; 1969 c.211 §7; 1971 c.219 §11; 1973 c.797 §390; 1975 c.544 §49; 1983 c.37 §29; 1997 c.631 §356]

 

      716.840 Liability of directors voting improper dividend.

[Amended by 1973 c.797 §391; 1975 c.544 §49a; 1997 c.631 §357]

 

      716.850 False advertising of surplus or guaranty fund prohibited.
