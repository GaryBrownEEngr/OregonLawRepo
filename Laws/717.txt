      717.225 Security devices. (1) Each license application shall be accompanied by a security device in the amount of $25,000. If the applicant proposes to engage in business under ORS 717.200 to 717.320, 717.900 and 717.905 at more than one location through authorized delegates or otherwise, the amount of the security device shall increase by $5,000 per location, not to exceed a maximum of $150,000. The security device shall be in a form satisfactory to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and shall run to the State of Oregon for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission and payment of money in connection with the sale and issuance of payment instruments or transmission of money. The aggregate liability on any security device shall not exceed the principal sum of the security device. Claimants against the licensee may bring suit directly on the security device or the director may bring suit on behalf of such claimants, either in one action or in successive actions.

      (2) In lieu of the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, a licensee may deposit with the director, or with insured institutions as defined in ORS 706.008 located in this state and designated by the licensee and approved by the director, securities in an aggregate amount, based upon principal amount or market value, whichever is lower, of not less than the amount of the security device applicable under subsection (1) of this section or portion thereof. The securities shall be held to secure the same obligations as would the security device. The depositor shall be entitled to receive all interest and dividends on the securities and may, with the approval of the director, substitute other securities for those deposited. The director, in writing, for good cause shown, may require the depositor to substitute other securities for those deposited. As used in this subsection, “securities” includes interest-bearing stocks and bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations of the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality of the United States Government, or guaranteed by the United States Government, or of this state, or of a city, county, district or instrumentality of this state, or guaranteed by this state.

      (3) The security device shall remain in effect until cancellation, which may occur only after 30 days’ written notice to the director. Cancellation shall not affect any liability incurred or accrued during the 30-day period.

      (4) The security device shall remain in place for no longer than five years after the licensee ceases money transmission operations in this state. However, notwithstanding this provision, the director may permit the security device to be reduced or eliminated prior to that time to the extent that the amount of the licensee’s payment instruments outstanding in this state are reduced. The director may also permit a licensee to substitute a letter of credit or such other form of security device acceptable to the director for the security device in place at the time the licensee ceases money transmission operations in this state.

      (5) In the event of bankruptcy of the licensee, the security device shall be considered by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of purchasers and holders of the licensee’s outstanding payment instruments. [1999 c.571 §7]

 

      717.230 Application fee. At the time an applicant submits an application, the applicant shall pay to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services a fee of $1,000 for a license term that expires at the end of the calendar year in which the applicant submitted the application. [1999 c.571 §8; 2015 c.118 §9]

 

      717.235 License issuance; grounds for disapproval of application; appeals. (1) Upon the filing of a complete application, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall review the application and may investigate the financial condition and responsibility, financial and business experience, character and general fitness of the applicant. The director may conduct an on-site investigation of the applicant, the reasonable cost of which shall be paid by the applicant. The director may disapprove an application if the director finds that the applicant:

      (a) Is insolvent, either in the sense that the person’s liabilities exceed the person’s assets or that the person cannot meet obligations as they mature, or that the person is in such financial condition that the person cannot continue in business with safety to the person’s customers;

      (b) Has engaged in dishonest, fraudulent or illegal practices or conduct in any business or profession;

      (c) Has willfully or repeatedly violated or failed to comply with a provision of the Oregon Bank Act, Oregon Securities Law, Oregon Credit Union Act, Oregon Consumer Finance Act or Pawnbrokers Act or any rule or order of the director adopted under those laws;

      (d) Has been convicted of a crime, an essential element of which is fraud;

      (e) Is not qualified to engage in the business of money transmission on the basis of such factors as training, experience and knowledge of the business;

      (f) Is permanently or temporarily enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice involving an aspect of the banking business or of the money transmission business;

      (g) Is the subject of an order of the director subjecting the person to a civil penalty or removing the person from an office in any entity regulated by the director; or

      (h) Is the subject of an order entered within the past five years, subjecting the person to a civil penalty or removing the person from an office in a state or federally chartered, licensed or regulated financial services company.

      (2) The director may also disapprove an application if the director finds that a controlling person is subject to a provision of subsection (1) of this section except subsection (1)(a) or (e) of this section. If a controlling person is the sole owner of the applicant, then the director may disapprove an application if the director finds that the controlling person is subject to a provision of subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) If the director finds that the applicant’s business will be conducted honestly, fairly and in a manner commanding the confidence and trust of the community, and that the applicant has fulfilled the requirements imposed by ORS 717.200 to 717.320, 717.900 and 717.905 and has paid the required license fee, the director shall issue a license to the applicant authorizing the applicant to conduct money transmission business in this state for a term of one year. If these requirements have not been met, the director shall deny the application in writing and shall describe the reasons for the denial.
