      (d) Embody a promise to pay the expenses of last sickness, funeral expenses and just debts of the deceased member out of the deposit, to the full extent of the deposit if necessary, in the order of priority prescribed by ORS 115.125, and to distribute any remaining moneys to the persons who are entitled to those moneys by law.

      (4) A credit union shall accept from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, without additional requirements, a declaration under penalty of perjury meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. A declaration submitted under this section must be signed by the declarant and must include the following sentence immediately above the signature line of the declarant: “I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that I am authorized by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority to make this declaration, that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I understand that it is subject to penalty for perjury.”

      (5) In the event the member died intestate without known heirs, an estate administrator of the Department of State Lands appointed under ORS 113.235 shall be the affiant and shall receive the moneys as escheat property.

      (6) The credit union shall determine the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased member. However, payment of the moneys in good faith to the affiant or declarant discharges and releases the transferor from any liability or responsibility for the transfer in the same manner and with the same effect as if the property had been transferred, delivered or paid to a personal representative of the estate of the deceased member.

      (7) A probate proceeding is not necessary to establish the right of the surviving spouse, Oregon Health Authority, Department of Human Services, surviving children, surviving parents, surviving brothers and sisters or an estate administrator of the Department of State Lands to withdraw the deposits upon the filing of the affidavit or declaration. If a personal representative is appointed in an estate where a withdrawal of deposits was made under this section, the person withdrawing the deposits shall account for them to the personal representative.

      (8) When a credit union transfers moneys under subsection (1) of this section, the transferor may require the transferee to furnish the transferor with a written indemnity agreement, indemnifying the transferor against loss for moneys paid to the extent of the amount of the deposit.

      (9)(a) Moneys disbursed to the Department of Human Services under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the department.

      (b) Moneys disbursed to the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the authority.

      (10) This section is subject to the rights of other parties to the account under ORS 723.474 to 723.498. [1999 c.185 §21; 2003 c.395 §24; 2005 c.381 §28; 2007 c.369 §3; 2009 c.11 §93; 2009 c.595 §1115; 2011 c.720 §218; 2017 c.51 §2]

 

      Note: The amendments to 723.466 by section 77, chapter 678, Oregon Laws 2019, become operative July 1, 2021. See section 85, chapter 678, Oregon Laws 2019. The text that is operative on and after July 1, 2021, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      723.466. (1) On the death of a member of a credit union, if the deposit to the credit of the deceased member is $25,000 or less, the credit union may, upon receipt of an affidavit from a person claiming the deposit as provided in subsection (3) of this section, or a declaration from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority as provided in subsection (4) of this section, pay the moneys on deposit:

      (a) To the surviving spouse on demand of the surviving spouse at any time after the death of the member;

      (b) If there is no surviving spouse, to the Oregon Health Authority or the Department of Human Services, on demand of the authority or the department no less than 46 days and no more than 75 days after the death of the member when there is a preferred claim arising under ORS 411.708, 411.795 or 416.350;

      (c) If there is no surviving spouse and no authority or department claim, to the member’s surviving children 18 years of age or older;

      (d) If there is no surviving spouse, authority claim, department claim or surviving child 18 years of age or older, to the member’s surviving parents;

      (e) If there is no surviving spouse, authority claim, department claim, surviving child 18 years of age or older or surviving parent, to the member’s surviving brothers and sisters 18 years of age or older; or

      (f) If there is no surviving spouse, authority claim, department claim, surviving child 18 years of age or older, surviving parent or surviving brothers or sisters 18 years of age or older, to any other surviving heir of the member.

      (2)(a) A credit union may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c) to (f) of this section earlier than 46 days after the death of the member.

      (b) A credit union may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c) to (f) of this section earlier than 76 days after the death of the member unless the financial institution obtains prior verbal or written authorization from the Oregon Health Authority or its designated representative and the Department of Human Services or its designated representative.

      (3) An affidavit or declaration submitted under this section must:

      (a) State where and when the member died;

      (b) State that the total deposits of the deceased member in all financial institutions in this state do not exceed $25,000;

      (c) Show the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased member; and

      (d) Embody a promise to pay the expenses of last sickness, funeral expenses and just debts of the deceased member out of the deposit, to the full extent of the deposit if necessary, in the order of priority prescribed by ORS 115.125, and to distribute any remaining moneys to the persons who are entitled to those moneys by law.

      (4) A credit union shall accept from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, without additional requirements, a declaration under penalty of perjury meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. A declaration submitted under this section must be signed by the declarant and must include the following sentence immediately above the signature line of the declarant: “I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that I am authorized by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority to make this declaration, that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I understand that it is subject to penalty for perjury.”

      (5) In the event the member died intestate without known heirs, an estate administrator of the State Treasurer appointed under ORS 113.235 shall be the affiant and shall receive the moneys as escheat property.

      (6) The credit union shall determine the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased member. However, payment of the moneys in good faith to the affiant or declarant discharges and releases the transferor from any liability or responsibility for the transfer in the same manner and with the same effect as if the property had been transferred, delivered or paid to a personal representative of the estate of the deceased member.

      (7) A probate proceeding is not necessary to establish the right of the surviving spouse, Oregon Health Authority, Department of Human Services, surviving children, surviving parents, surviving brothers and sisters or an estate administrator of the State Treasurer to withdraw the deposits upon the filing of the affidavit or declaration. If a personal representative is appointed in an estate where a withdrawal of deposits was made under this section, the person withdrawing the deposits shall account for them to the personal representative.

      (8) When a credit union transfers moneys under subsection (1) of this section, the transferor may require the transferee to furnish the transferor with a written indemnity agreement, indemnifying the transferor against loss for moneys paid to the extent of the amount of the deposit.

      (9)(a) Moneys disbursed to the Department of Human Services under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the department.

      (b) Moneys disbursed to the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the authority.

      (10) This section is subject to the rights of other parties to the account under ORS 723.474 to 723.498.

 

      723.468 Adverse claim to deposit; notice; restraining order or other process; indemnity bond or letter of credit. (1) A credit union shall be obligated to recognize an adverse claim to a deposit it holds only if the adverse claimant gives notice to the credit union of its claim and:

      (a) Procures a restraining order, injunction or other appropriate process against the credit union in an action wherein the person to whose credit the deposit stands is made a party and served with summons; or

      (b) Delivers to the credit union in a form, and with sureties acceptable to the credit union, a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a financial institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, indemnifying the credit union from any liability, damage or expenses on account of the payment of the adverse claim or the dishonor of the check or other order of the person to whose credit the deposit stands.

      (2) This section does not apply when the person in whose name the account is carried is a fiduciary for the adverse claimant, and the affidavit of the adverse claimant states the facts constituting the fiduciary relationship and the facts showing reasonable cause of belief on the part of the claimant that the fiduciary is about to misappropriate the deposit.

      (3) A credit union may, at its option, interplead a deposit that is subject to any adverse claim. [1999 c.185 §22]

 

      723.470 Checks drawn by agents presumed to be in authorized manner. If a person who owns a share or deposit account subject to check authorizes another person as agent to draw checks against the account, the credit union, in the absence of written notice to the contrary, may presume that any check drawn by the agent in the manner authorized by the terms and conditions of the account, including checks drawn to the personal order of the agent, is drawn for a purpose authorized by the principal and within the scope of the authority conferred upon the agent. [1999 c.185 §23]

 

      723.472 Checks of intoxicated or drugged persons. A credit union may refuse to pay any check, draft or order drawn upon it when the officers or employees of the credit union have reason to believe that the person signing or indorsing the instrument was so under the influence of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances or that the person was otherwise so incapacitated as to make it reasonably doubtful whether the person was capable of transacting business at the time of signing or indorsing the check, draft or order. [1999 c.185 §24]

 

      723.474 Definitions for ORS 723.474 to 723.498. As used in ORS 723.474 to 723.498, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Account” means a contract of deposit of funds between a member and a credit union and includes a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit and share account.

      (2) “Beneficiary” means a person named in a trust account as one for whom a party to the account is named as trustee.

      (3) “Joint account” means an account payable on request to one or more of two or more parties whether or not mention is made of any right of survivorship.

      (4) “Multiple-party account” means a joint account, a P.O.D. account or a trust account. “Multiple-party account” does not include:

      (a) Accounts established for the deposit of funds of a partnership, joint venture or other association for business purposes; or

      (b) Accounts controlled by one or more persons as the duly authorized agent or trustee for a corporation, unincorporated association, charitable or civic organization, or a regular fiduciary or trust account where the relationship is established other than by deposit agreement.

      (5) “Net contribution” of a party to a joint account means the sum of all deposits made to the account by or for the party, less all withdrawals made by or for the party that have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance. “Net contribution” includes any proceeds of deposit life insurance added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question.

      (6) “Party” means a person who, by the terms of the multiple-party account, has a present right, subject to request, to payment from a multiple-party account. A P.O.D. payee or beneficiary of a trust account is a party only after the account becomes payable to the payee or beneficiary by reason of the payee or beneficiary surviving the original party or trustee. “Party” includes a guardian, conservator, personal representative or assignee, including an attaching creditor, of a party. “Party” also includes a person identified as a trustee of an account, whether or not a beneficiary is named, but does not include any named beneficiary unless the named beneficiary has a present right of withdrawal.

      (7) “Payment” of sums on deposit includes withdrawal, payment on check or other directive of a party, any pledge of sums on deposit by a party and any setoff, deduction or other disposition of all or part of an account pursuant to a pledge.

      (8) “P.O.D. account” means an account payable on request:

      (a) To one person during the lifetime of the person and upon the death of the person to one or more P.O.D. payees; or

      (b) To one or more persons during their lifetimes and upon the death of all of them to one or more P.O.D. payees.

      (9) “P.O.D. payee” means a person designated on a P.O.D. account as the person to whom the account is payable on request after the death of one or more persons.

      (10) “Request” means a proper request for withdrawal, or a check or order for payment, that complies with all conditions of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the credit union. If the credit union conditions withdrawal or payment on advance notice, for purposes of ORS 723.474 to 723.498, the request for withdrawal or payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for withdrawal.

      (11) “Sums on deposit” means the balance payable on a multiple-party account including interest, dividends and any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of a party.

      (12) “Trust account” means an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries where the relationship is established by the form of the account and the deposit agreement with the credit union, and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account. It is not essential that payment to the beneficiary be mentioned in the deposit agreement. A trust account does not include a regular trust account under a testamentary trust, a trust agreement that has significance apart from the account, or a fiduciary account arising from a fiduciary relationship such as attorney-client.

      (13) “Withdrawal” includes payment to a third person pursuant to check or other directive of a party. [1999 c.185 §25]

 

      723.476 Application of ORS 723.478, 723.480 and 723.482; liability and setoff rights of credit unions. The provisions of ORS 723.478, 723.480 and 723.482 concerning beneficial ownership between parties or between parties and P.O.D. payees or beneficiaries of multiple-party accounts are relevant only to controversies between those persons and their creditors and other successors, and have no bearing on the power of withdrawal of those persons as determined by the terms of account contracts. The provisions of ORS 723.486 to 723.496 govern the liability of credit unions that make payments pursuant thereto, and their setoff rights. [1999 c.185 §26]

 

      723.478 Ownership of multiple-party accounts. (1) A joint account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each party to the sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.

      (2) A P.O.D. account belongs to the original party during the lifetime of the party and not to the P.O.D. payee or payees. If two or more persons are named as original parties, during their lifetimes, rights between them are governed by subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Unless a contrary intent is manifested by the terms of the account or the deposit agreement, or there is other clear and convincing evidence of an irrevocable trust, a trust account belongs beneficially to the trustee during the lifetime of the trustee. If two or more parties are named as trustees of the account, during their lifetimes, beneficial rights between them are governed by subsection (1) of this section. If there is an irrevocable trust, the account belongs beneficially to the beneficiary. [1999 c.185 §27]

 

      723.480 Multiple-party accounts; disposition of deposit upon death of party or trustee; effect of will. (1) Sums remaining on deposit at a credit union at the death of a party to a joint account are rebuttably presumed to belong to the surviving party or parties against the estate of the decedent. If there are two or more surviving parties, their respective ownerships during their lifetimes shall be in proportion to their previous ownership interests under ORS 723.478, augmented by an equal share for each survivor of any interest the decedent may have owned in the account immediately before death. The right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.

      (2) If the account is a P.O.D. account:

      (a) Upon the death of one of two or more original parties, the rights to any sums remaining on deposit are governed by subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) Upon the death of the sole original party or the survivor of two or more original parties, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the P.O.D. payee or payees, if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the original party. If two or more P.O.D. payees survive, there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a P.O.D. payee thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them.

      (3) If the account is a trust account:

      (a) Upon the death of one of two or more trustees, the rights to any sums remaining on deposit are governed by subsection (1) of this section.

      (b) Upon the death of the sole trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the person or persons named as beneficiaries, if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the trustee, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a contrary intent. If two or more beneficiaries survive, there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of any beneficiary thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them.

      (4) In other cases, the death of any party to a multiple-party account has no effect on beneficial ownership of the account, other than to transfer the rights of the decedent as part of the estate of the decedent.

      (5) A right of survivorship arising under this section or from the express terms of the account, a beneficiary designation in a trust account or a P.O.D. payee designation cannot be changed by will.

      (6) The rebuttable presumption under subsection (1) of this section may be overcome by evidence establishing that:

      (a) The deceased party intended a different result; or

      (b) The deceased party lacked capacity when the joint account was established.

      (7) A credit union is not liable for distributing sums remaining on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account to a surviving party or parties in accordance with the account agreement unless, prior to distributing sums to a surviving party or parties:

      (a) The credit union has received notice of an adverse claim under ORS 723.468; and

      (b) The adverse claimant proceeds as required under ORS 723.468. [1999 c.185 §28; 2003 c.256 §2]

 

      723.482 Rights of survivorship based on form of account; alteration of form of account. The provisions of ORS 723.480 that apply to rights of survivorship are determined by the form of the account at the time of death of a party. Subject to satisfaction of the requirements of the credit union, the form of an account may be altered by a written order given by a party to the credit union. The order must be signed by the party, be received by the credit union during the party’s lifetime, and not be countermanded by other written order of the same party during the lifetime of the party. [1999 c.185 §29]

 

      723.484 Transfers of moneys upon death of depositor or trustee is not testamentary disposition. Any transfers resulting from the application of ORS 723.480 are effective by reason of the account contracts involved and application of ORS 723.480. The transfers are not to be considered as testamentary or subject to administration in the estate of a deceased party. [1999 c.185 §30]

 

      723.486 Multiple party account; payment of deposit to one or more parties; credit union not required to determine source or use of funds in account. Credit unions may enter into multiple-party accounts to the same extent that they may enter into single-party accounts. Any multiple-party account may be paid, on request, to any one or more of the parties. For purposes of establishing net contributions a credit union shall not be required to inquire about the source of funds received for deposit to a multiple-party account, or to inquire about the proposed application of any sum withdrawn from an account. [1999 c.185 §31]

 

      723.488 Joint account; payment to any party to account; payment to others. Any sums in a joint account may be paid, on request, to any party without regard to whether any other party is incapacitated or deceased at the time the payment is requested. Payment may not be made to the personal representative or heirs of a deceased party unless:

      (1) Proof of death is presented to the credit union, showing that the decedent was the last surviving party; or

      (2) There is no right of survivorship under ORS 723.480. [1999 c.185 §32]

 

      723.490 P.O.D. account; payment to any original party; payment to others. Any P.O.D. account may be paid, on request, to any original party to the account. Payment may be made, on request, to the P.O.D. payee or to the personal representative or heirs of a deceased P.O.D. payee upon presentation to the credit union of proof of death showing that the P.O.D. payee survived all persons named as original parties. Payment may be made to the personal representative or heirs of a deceased original party if proof of death is presented to the credit union showing that the decedent was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as an original party or as a P.O.D. payee. [1999 c.185 §33]

 

      723.492 Trust account; payment to trustee; payment to others. Any trust account may be paid, on request, to any trustee. Unless the credit union has received written notice that the beneficiary has a vested interest not dependent upon the beneficiary surviving the trustee, payment may be made to the personal representative or heirs of a deceased trustee if proof of death is presented to the credit union showing that the decedent survived all other persons named on the account as either trustee or beneficiary. Payment may be made, on request, to the beneficiary upon presentation to the credit union of proof of death showing that the beneficiary or beneficiaries survived all persons named as trustees. [1999 c.185 §34]

 

      723.494 Discharge of credit union for payments made; conditions. Payment made pursuant to ORS 723.486, 723.488, 723.490 or 723.492 discharges the credit union from all claims for amounts paid, whether or not the payment is consistent with the beneficial ownership of the account between parties, P.O.D. payees or beneficiaries, or their successors. The protection given by this section does not extend to payments made after a credit union has received written notice from any party able to request present payment that states that withdrawals in accordance with the terms of the account should not be permitted. Unless the notice is withdrawn by the person giving it, the successor of any deceased party must concur in any demand for withdrawal if the credit union is to be protected under this section. No other notice or any other information shown to have been available to a credit union shall affect its right to the protection provided by this section. The protection provided by this section shall have no bearing on the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their successors concerning the beneficial ownership of funds in or withdrawn from multiple-party accounts. [1999 c.185 §35]

 

      723.496 Right of credit union to setoff; amount. Without qualifying any other statutory or common law right to setoff or lien, and subject to any contractual provision, if a party to a multiple-party account is indebted to a credit union, the credit union has a right to setoff against the account in which the party has or had immediately before the death of the party a present right of withdrawal. The amount of the account subject to setoff is that proportion to which the debtor is, or was immediately before the death of the debtor, beneficially entitled and, in the absence of proof of net contributions, to an equal share with all parties having present rights of withdrawal. [1999 c.185 §36]

 

      723.498 Designation of agent for account; powers of agent. Nothing in ORS 723.426, 723.432, 723.474, 723.476 or 723.478 shall preclude a party to an account from adding the name of another person to the account with the designation of “agent.” The agent shall have no present or future interest in the sums on deposit in the account, but the credit union may honor requests for payment from the accounts by the agent, unless the principal is deceased at the time the payment is requested and the credit union has actual knowledge of the death. Payments from the account by the credit union at the request of the agent shall discharge the credit union from all claims for amounts so paid. [1999 c.185 §37]

 

LOANS

 

      723.502 Purposes; terms. A credit union may make loans to members of the credit union for such purpose and upon such security and terms as the credit committee, credit manager or loan officer approves. A person who is not a member of the credit union may be a guarantor or co-obligor on a credit union’s loan to a member of the credit union. [1975 c.652 §52; 1981 c.412 §8; 2007 c.343 §7]

 

      723.506 Application. Every application for a loan shall be made in the form prescribed by the credit committee, credit manager or loan officer. The application shall state the security, if any offered. Each loan shall be evidenced by a written document. [1975 c.652 §53; 1991 c.635 §14]

(1) A credit union may not make a loan to any member in an aggregate amount that exceeds $100,000, or 15 percent of the credit union’s equity, whichever is greater. In determining the amount of loans to be made to a member, loans for which that member is a guarantor or surety must be included, as well as loans to persons who are not individuals if the individual member is a principal or owner of the person who is not an individual or the loan is for that member’s benefit.

      (2) The restrictions in subsection (1) of this section do not apply to any loan that is fully guaranteed by shares or deposits. [1975 c.652 §54; 1977 c.628 §3; 1979 c.88 §34; 1987 c.650 §8; 1995 c.319 §8; 1999 c.185 §42; 2013 c.480 §6]

      723.520 [Repealed by 1959 c.106 §23]

 

      723.522 Line of credit. The credit committee, credit manager, or loan officer may approve in advance upon their own motion or upon application by a member, a line of credit, and advances may be granted to such member within the limit of such extension of credit. Where a line of credit has been approved, no additional loan applications are required as long as the aggregate obligation does not exceed the limit of such extension of credit. [1975 c.652 §56; 1987 c.286 §8]

 

      723.526 Other loan programs. (1) Loans to credit union members may be shared with other credit unions, corporations or financial organizations.

      (2) A credit union may participate in guaranteed loan programs of the federal government, the State of Oregon or any other state.

      (3) A credit union may purchase the conditional sales contracts, notes and similar instruments of its members.

      (4) A credit union may purchase the leases of its members if the leases satisfy the requirements of ORS 723.152 (9). [1975 c.652 §57; 1999 c.185 §43]

 

      723.530 [Amended by 1959 c.106 §21; 1971 c.367 §1; repealed by 1975 c.652 §88]

 

      723.532 Loans to credit union officials; waiver; rules. (1) For the purposes of this section, “management team” means the president or chief executive officer of a credit union or an individual who holds a position in a credit union of vice president or higher who has policymaking authority or authority to approve loans.

      (3) Upon receipt from the suspended credit union of evidence that the conditions causing the order of suspension have been corrected, the director may revoke the suspension notice and permit the credit union to resume normal operations.

      (5) If, within the suspension period, the credit union fails to answer the suspension notice or request a hearing, the director may then revoke the credit union’s charter, appoint a liquidating agent and liquidate the credit union. [1975 c.652 §69; 1985 c.762 §99; 1991 c.249 §68]

Within 10 days after the members act on the question of liquidation, the president or chairperson of the board shall notify the director in writing as to whether or not the members approved the proposed liquidation.

On approval by the members of such proposal, all such business transactions shall be permanently discontinued. Necessary expenses of operation shall, however, continue to be paid on authorization of the board of directors or liquidating agent during the period of liquidation.

      (5) For a credit union to enter voluntary liquidation, approval by a majority of the members in writing or by a two-thirds majority of the members present at a regular or special meeting of the members is required.

      (7) The board of directors or the liquidating agent shall use the assets of the credit union to pay: First, expenses incidental to liquidating including any surety bond that may be required; and, second, any liability due nonmembers. Assets then remaining shall be distributed to the members proportionately to the shares and deposits held by each member as of the date dissolution was voted.

      (8) As soon as the board of directors or the liquidating agent determines that all assets from which there is a reasonable expectancy of realization have been liquidated and distributed as set forth in this section, they shall execute a certificate of dissolution on a form prescribed by the director and file the same, together with all pertinent books and records of the liquidating credit union, with the director, whereupon such credit union shall be dissolved.

      (2) After the directors agree to a plan and the members of the merging credit union approve the plan, the president and secretary of the credit union shall execute a certificate of merger, which shall set forth all of the following:

The rights and privileges of the members of the merged credit union remain intact.

      (5) This section permits a credit union chartered under the laws of another state or of the United States to merge with a credit union chartered under the laws of this state, and a credit union chartered under the laws of this state to merge with a credit union chartered under the laws of another state or of the United States, to the same extent that the laws of this state permit two or more credit unions chartered under the laws of this state to merge.

      (6)(a) After the board of directors of a credit union that is chartered in this state has approved a plan to merge with another credit union, if a member of the credit union opposes the plan to merge and wishes to inform other members of the credit union of the member’s opposition, the member may submit a proposed statement of opposition to the credit union and may ask the credit union to disseminate the statement of opposition to the other members.

      (b) If the credit union maintains on the Internet and publicizes to the credit union’s members a public forum for communications concerning the plan to merge or other issues related to the credit union, the credit union, within 14 calendar days after receiving the proposed statement of opposition from the member and subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection, shall publish the statement of opposition on the public forum.

      (c) If the credit union does not make a public forum available on the Internet and if the credit union received the member’s proposed statement of opposition at least 28 days before the date on which the members of the credit union are to vote on the plan to merge, subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection, the credit union shall:

      (A) Notify the member, within seven days after receiving the statement of opposition, of:

      (i) Any limit, which may not be less than 500 words, that the credit union may impose on the length of the statement of opposition; and

      (ii) The estimated reasonable cost to reproduce and mail the statement of opposition as a stand-alone document or the estimated cost to include the statement of opposition in any informational or persuasive material concerning the plan to merge that the credit union disseminates to credit union members. The credit union’s estimate of the cost of including the statement of opposition in the credit union’s material may not exceed two cents multiplied by the number of the credit union’s members.

      (B) Reproduce and mail the statement of opposition to the credit union’s members or include the statement of opposition in the credit union’s informational or persuasive materials concerning the plan to merge, within 10 days after receiving payment of the cost estimated in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, if the member agrees to the limit the credit union imposes on the length of the statement of opposition and pays the cost at least 14 days before the date on which the members of the credit union are to vote on the plan to merge.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this subsection, informational and persuasive material concerning the plan to merge does not include a notice of the meeting at which the credit union’s members are to consider the plan to merge, a summary of the merger plan or other items that state or federal law requires the credit union to send to credit union members.

      (e)(A) The credit union shall notify the credit union member within seven days after receiving the proposed statement of opposition if the credit union declines to disseminate the statement of opposition because the statement of opposition:

      (i) Is false or misleading with respect to a material fact at the time and in light of the circumstances in which the statement is made;

      (ii) Omits a material fact that is necessary for the statement of fact not to be false or misleading;

      (iii) Relates to a personal claim or grievance or solicits personal gain by or business advantage for any party;

      (iv) Is not sufficiently related to the credit union’s business or affairs;

      (v) Impugns, directly or indirectly, a person’s character, integrity or personal reputation or without an expressed factual basis charges a person with illegal, improper or immoral conduct; or

      (vi) Impugns the stability or soundness of the credit union.

      (B) The credit union may decline to disseminate the proposed statement of opposition if the credit union member does not agree to the limits the credit union imposes on the length of the statement of opposition or fails within the time limits set in paragraph (c) of this subsection to pay the cost of mailing the statement or including the statement with the credit union’s informational or persuasive material concerning the plan to merge.

      (C) The credit union may not decline to disseminate the statement of opposition for reasons other than the reasons identified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph.

      (f)(A) A credit union member may appeal to the director the credit union’s decision under paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection not to disseminate the credit union member’s statement of opposition. An appeal under this paragraph is not a contested case, as defined in ORS 183.310, and a party to the appeal is not entitled to notice and an opportunity for a hearing under ORS 183.413 to 183.470. As part of the appeal, the credit union member shall provide the director with:

      (i) The proposed statement of opposition;

      (ii) A statement of reasons for disagreeing with the credit union’s decision under paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection not to disseminate the statement of opposition; and

      (iii) The credit union member’s name, address and telephone number or other contact information.

      (B) Before issuing an order under this paragraph, the director shall request from the credit union a statement of reasons for declining to disseminate the proposed statement of opposition. The director shall consider the credit union member’s proposed statement of opposition and statement of reasons and the credit union’s statement of reasons and shall arrive at an independent determination as to whether the credit union correctly declined to disseminate the credit union member’s proposed statement for the reasons identified in paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection.

      (C) The director by order shall uphold the credit union’s decision under paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection or shall require the credit union to disseminate the credit union member’s proposed statement of opposition in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The director’s order is subject to appeal only as provided in ORS 183.484. [1975 c.652 §71; 1999 c.185 §51; 2011 c.327 §5; 2019 c.45 §4]
