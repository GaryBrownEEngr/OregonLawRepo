      (E) A fact or condition exists that clearly would have warranted the director’s refusing to issue the license had the fact or condition existed at the time the licensee submitted an application under ORS 725A.022.

      (2) The director, without notice or hearing, may suspend a license for a period not exceeding 30 days, pending investigation.

      (3) The director may revoke or suspend only the particular license with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.

      (3) A licensee’s surrendering a license under subsection (1) or (2) of this section does not affect the licensee’s civil or criminal liability for acts the licensee committed before surrendering the license. [2010 c.23 §12]

 

      725A.040 Effect of license revocation, suspension or surrender. Revocation, suspension or surrender of a license issued under ORS 725A.024 does not impair or affect the rights or obligations specified in a lawful contract between the licensee and a borrower that existed before the revocation, suspension or surrender.

      (3) Permit a borrower at any time to pay any amount in advance on any loan.

      (4) Mark the word “Paid” or “Renewed” indelibly on the note, or on other evidence of the debt or obligation that bears the borrower’s signature, whenever the borrower pays the loan in full or renews the loan. If the borrower repays the loan in full, the licensee shall also:

      (a) Release a mortgage or security agreement that no longer secures the loan and restore any security or collateral, to the extent and in the manner required by law.

      (b) Release a Uniform Commercial Code filing that no longer secures the loan, to the extent and in the manner required under ORS 79.0513.

      (c) Return any assignment the borrower gave.

      (d) Return to the borrower the canceled note or other evidence of the loan or, alternatively, acknowledge to the borrower in writing that the borrower has repaid the loan. [2010 c.23 §17]

 

      725A.058 Dissemination of false, misleading or deceptive statement. A licensee or other person may not advertise, print, display, publish, distribute or broadcast or cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed, published, distributed or broadcast in any manner whatsoever a statement or representation that is false, misleading or deceptive with respect to a rate, term or condition for a payday loan or title loan. [2010 c.23 §18]

 

      725A.060 Prohibited conduct generally. (1) A licensee or a person required under ORS 725A.020 to obtain a license may not:

      (a) Take from a consumer:

      (A) A power of attorney, except a power of attorney to transfer ownership of a motor vehicle at the time the licensee or the person makes a loan secured by a motor vehicle.

      (B) A note or promise to pay that does not accurately disclose the actual amount or the term of the loan, the rate of interest charged and the schedule of payments for the loan.

      (C) An instrument in which blank spaces remain to be filled in after execution.

      (D) An assignment of earnings as payment or as security for a loan. An assignment that violates this subparagraph is unenforceable by the assignee and revocable by the assignor. For purposes of this subparagraph, if the licensee or the person pays money to or on behalf of a consumer in return for a right or claim to all or a portion of the consumer’s unpaid earnings, the licensee or the person has made a loan to the consumer that is secured by an assignment of earnings. This subparagraph does not preclude an employee from authorizing deductions from the employee’s earnings if the authorization is revocable.

      (b) Conduct business where liquor or lottery tickets are sold or where gambling devices are located.

      (c) Charge a consumer:

      (A) More than the actual amount that the vendor or service provider charges the licensee or the person for access to or use of the system described in ORS 725A.090; or

      (B) More than one fee per loan transaction for dishonored checks or insufficient funds, regardless of how many checks or debit agreements the licensee or the person obtains from the consumer for the transaction. The fee may not exceed $20.

      (d) Collect a fee for a dishonored check under ORS 30.701 or seek or recover statutory damages or attorney fees from a consumer for a dishonored check under ORS 30.701. The licensee or the person may recover from the consumer a fee that an unaffiliated financial institution charges to the licensee or the person for each dishonored check. For a dishonored check or insufficient funds, the fees described in this subsection are the only remedy the licensee or the person may pursue and the only fees the licensee or the person may charge.

      (e) Make a loan to a consumer who has not fully repaid an outstanding payday loan or title loan. This paragraph does not prohibit a licensee or person from renewing an existing payday loan or title loan as provided in ORS 725A.010 to 725A.092 and 725A.990.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 725A.010 to 725A.092 and 725A.990 do not prevent a licensee or a person required under ORS 725A.020 to obtain a license from recovering amounts associated with collecting a defaulted loan that are authorized by statute or awarded by a court of law. [2010 c.23 §19; 2019 c.188 §1]

A title loan lender complies with this subsection if the title loan lender meets the conditions the director specifies.

      (5) Charge a consumer a fee or interest other than a fee or interest described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section or in ORS 725A.060 (1)(c) or (d).

      (6) Include in a title loan contract:

      (a) A hold-harmless clause;

      (b) A confession of judgment or other waiver of the right to notice and the opportunity to be heard in an action;

      (c) A provision in which the consumer agrees not to assert against the lender or a holder in due course a claim or defense arising out of the contract;

      (d) An executory waiver or a limitation of exemption from attachment, execution or other process on real or personal property the consumer holds, owns or is due, unless the waiver or limitation applies only to property that is subject to a security interest executed in connection with the loan; or

      (e) A clause that permits interest to continue after the consumer’s motor vehicle, recreational vehicle, boat or mobile home has been repossessed.

      (7) Require or accept from a consumer a set of keys to the motor vehicle, recreational vehicle, boat or mobile home the title to which secures the title loan.

      (7) Make a new payday loan to a consumer within seven days after the date on which the consumer fully repays a previous payday loan. [2010 c.23 §21; 2019 c.188 §3]
