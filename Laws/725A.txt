      (2) The director, without notice or hearing, may suspend a license for a period not exceeding 30 days, pending investigation.

      (3) A licensee’s surrendering a license under subsection (1) or (2) of this section does not affect the licensee’s civil or criminal liability for acts the licensee committed before surrendering the license. [2010 c.23 §12]

 

      725A.040 Effect of license revocation, suspension or surrender. Revocation, suspension or surrender of a license issued under ORS 725A.024 does not impair or affect the rights or obligations specified in a lawful contract between the licensee and a borrower that existed before the revocation, suspension or surrender.

A licensee or other person may not advertise, print, display, publish, distribute or broadcast or cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed, published, distributed or broadcast in any manner whatsoever a statement or representation that is false, misleading or deceptive with respect to a rate, term or condition for a payday loan or title loan. [2010 c.23 §18]

 

      725A.060 Prohibited conduct generally. (1) A licensee or a person required under ORS 725A.020 to obtain a license may not:

      (a) Take from a consumer:

      (A) A power of attorney, except a power of attorney to transfer ownership of a motor vehicle at the time the licensee or the person makes a loan secured by a motor vehicle.

      (C) An instrument in which blank spaces remain to be filled in after execution.

      (D) An assignment of earnings as payment or as security for a loan. An assignment that violates this subparagraph is unenforceable by the assignee and revocable by the assignor. For purposes of this subparagraph, if the licensee or the person pays money to or on behalf of a consumer in return for a right or claim to all or a portion of the consumer’s unpaid earnings, the licensee or the person has made a loan to the consumer that is secured by an assignment of earnings. This subparagraph does not preclude an employee from authorizing deductions from the employee’s earnings if the authorization is revocable.

      (b) Conduct business where liquor or lottery tickets are sold or where gambling devices are located.

      (c) Charge a consumer:

      (A) More than the actual amount that the vendor or service provider charges the licensee or the person for access to or use of the system described in ORS 725A.090; or

      (d) Collect a fee for a dishonored check under ORS 30.701 or seek or recover statutory damages or attorney fees from a consumer for a dishonored check under ORS 30.701. The licensee or the person may recover from the consumer a fee that an unaffiliated financial institution charges to the licensee or the person for each dishonored check. For a dishonored check or insufficient funds, the fees described in this subsection are the only remedy the licensee or the person may pursue and the only fees the licensee or the person may charge.

      (2) The provisions of ORS 725A.010 to 725A.092 and 725A.990 do not prevent a licensee or a person required under ORS 725A.020 to obtain a license from recovering amounts associated with collecting a defaulted loan that are authorized by statute or awarded by a court of law.

      (e) A clause that permits interest to continue after the consumer’s motor vehicle, recreational vehicle, boat or mobile home has been repossessed.

      (7) Require or accept from a consumer a set of keys to the motor vehicle, recreational vehicle, boat or mobile home the title to which secures the title loan.
