LICENSING

 

      726.040 Pawnbroker license required. No person shall engage or continue in the business of a pawnbroker, or use any assumed business name or advertising that in any way would lead the public to believe the person is a licensed pawnbroker, except as authorized by this chapter and without first procuring a license from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services as provided in this chapter. [Amended by 1979 c.202 §1]

 

      726.050 Requirements for issuance of license. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may not issue a license to a corporation, limited liability company or limited liability partnership or to a person using an assumed business name unless:

      726.070 Applicant to furnish bond or letter of credit; actions on bond or letter of credit. (1) A bond in the sum of $25,000 executed by the applicant as obligor, together with a surety company authorized to do business in this state as surety or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution as defined in ORS 706.008 in the amount of $25,000 shall accompany the application and be maintained by the pawnbroker licensee with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. This bond or letter of credit shall be executed to the State of Oregon and for the use of the state and of any person who may have a cause of action against the obligor of the bond or the letter of credit issuer under this chapter. The bond or letter of credit shall be conditioned that the obligor will faithfully conform to and abide by the provisions of this chapter and of all rules and regulations lawfully made by the director under this chapter, and will pay to the state and to any such person any and all moneys that may become due or owing to the state or to such person from the obligor under and by virtue of the provisions of this chapter.

      (2) If any person is aggrieved by the misconduct of a pawnbroker or by the pawnbroker’s violation of any law and recovers judgment therefor, the person may, after the return unsatisfied either in whole or in part of any execution issued upon the judgment, maintain an action for the person’s own use upon the bond or letter of credit of the pawnbroker in any court having jurisdiction of the amount claimed. The director shall furnish to anyone applying therefor, a certified copy of any such bond or letter of credit filed with the director. The certified copy is prima facie evidence in any court that the bond or letter of credit was duly executed and delivered by each pawnbroker whose name appears on the bond or letter of credit. [Amended by 1971 c.218 §2; 1979 c.202 §2; 1991 c.331 §125; 1993 c.18 §155; 1997 c.631 §544; 2003 c.176 §1; 2007 c.360 §3]

 

      726.075 Grounds for denial of license. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may not grant a license to engage in the business of pawnbroker to any person if any person named in the application submitted pursuant to ORS 726.060:

      (1) Is insolvent, either in the sense that the person’s liabilities exceed the person’s assets or that the person cannot meet obligations as they mature, or is in such financial condition that the person cannot continue in business with safety to the person’s customers;

      (2) Has engaged in dishonest, fraudulent or illegal practices or conduct in any business or profession;

      (7) Is the subject of an order of the director, subjecting the person to a civil penalty, or removing the person from an office in an entity regulated by either director; or

      (8) Is the subject of an order that was issued by the regulatory authority of another state or of the federal government with authority over such banking institutions, credit unions, consumer finance companies or savings associations, that was entered within the past five years and that subjects the person to a civil penalty or removes the person from an office in a state banking institution, a national bank, a state or federal savings association, a state or federal credit union or a consumer finance company. [1977 c.135 §55; 1985 c.762 §137; 2009 c.541 §47; 2011 c.597 §294]

 

      726.080 Issuance and denial of license. (1) Conditioned upon the applicant’s compliance with this chapter, the payment of the license fee and the filing of a bond or letter of credit on a form approved by the Attorney General, and in the absence of any reason or condition that in the judgment of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services might warrant the refusal of the granting of a license, including the reasons set out in ORS 726.075, the director shall issue a license within 45 days after the date a complete application was received.

      (2) If the application is denied, the director shall indorse on the application with the date the word “Disapproved” and shall immediately advise the applicant by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt of the reason for the denial.

Each additional license shall be for a separate and distinct place of business for the making and completing of pledge loans as provided in this chapter.

 

      726.110 Change of place of business. Whenever a pawnbroker changes the place of business to another location within the same city or town, the pawnbroker shall at once give written notice of the change to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and shall surrender the pawnbroker’s license for cancellation. Thereupon a new license shall be issued by the director for the new location.

[Amended by 1971 c.218 §5; 2007 c.360 §5]

 

      726.120 [Amended by 1971 c.218 §6; repealed by 1985 c.762 §196]

 

      726.125 License fees; fees for extra service. (1) Each pawnbroker shall pay to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services each year the license fee determined by the director under subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) The director may charge and collect a license fee from each pawnbroker, according to a license fee schedule established by the director by rule, for the purpose of defraying the costs of performing supervision, enforcement and other duties imposed by law upon the director in respect to pawnbrokers. In setting the license fee schedule and allocating license fees among pawnbrokers, the director shall take into consideration the costs of performing the duties of the director relative to each pawnbroker, the amount of all other moneys paid to the director under this chapter and the cost of developing and maintaining a reasonable emergency fund. License fees under this subsection shall be assessed and paid upon approval of a new license application, and not later than December 15 or such date as may be specified by the director by rule for renewal of a license.

      (3) In addition to the license fee collected under subsection (2) of this section, whenever the director devotes any extra attention to the affairs of a pawnbroker, either upon determination by the director or upon request of the pawnbroker, the fee for the extra service shall be the actual cost thereof. [1985 c.762 §139; 1997 c.842 §2; 2007 c.768 §56]

 

      726.130 Annual report of licensee. Every pawnbroker, on or before January 15, shall submit to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services an annual report in a form prescribed by the director, giving the following information:

      726.150 Revocation and suspension of license. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may revoke any license under this chapter if the director finds that:

      (a) The pawnbroker has failed to pay the annual license fee or to maintain in effect the required bond or to comply with any demand, ruling or requirement of the director lawfully made pursuant to and within the authority of this chapter or to comply with the provisions of law to keep the corporation in good standing if such pawnbroker is a corporation;

      (b) The pawnbroker has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation lawfully made by the director under and within the authority of this chapter; or

      (c) Any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for a license, would have warranted the director in refusing originally to issue the license.

      (2) The director may, without notice or hearing, suspend any license for a period not exceeding 30 days, pending investigation.

      (3) The director may revoke or suspend only the particular license with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension occur or exist, or, if the director finds that such grounds for revocation or suspension are of general application to all offices or to more than one office operated by the pawnbroker, the director shall revoke or suspend all the licenses issued to the pawnbroker or such number of licenses as such grounds apply to, as the case may be. [Amended by 1971 c.734 §177; 1977 c.135 §57]

 

      726.155 Procedure for license denial, revocation or suspension. (1) Where the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services proposes to refuse to issue a license, or proposes to revoke or suspend a license, opportunity for hearing shall be accorded as provided in ORS chapter 183.

      (2) Judicial review of orders under subsection (1) of this section shall be as provided in ORS chapter 183. [1971 c.734 §179]

 

      726.160 [Repealed by 1971 c.734 §21]

 

      726.170 Reinstatement or issuance of new license; fee. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may reinstate any suspended license or issue a new license to a pawnbroker whose license has been revoked, upon the pawnbroker’s compliance with the provisions of law or any demand, ruling or requirement lawfully made by the director pursuant to and within the authority of this chapter. For such reinstatement or issuance of a new license a fee of $25 shall be paid.

 

      726.180 Expiration of license; effect of revocation, suspension or surrender of license. Every license issued under this chapter shall remain in force until it has been surrendered, revoked or suspended in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. No revocation, suspension or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation of any preexisting lawful contract between the pawnbroker and any borrower. [Amended by 1971 c.218 §7]

 

      726.190 Surrender of license. Any pawnbroker may surrender any license by delivering to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services written notice that the pawnbroker thereby surrenders such license, but such surrender shall not affect the pawnbroker’s civil or criminal liability for acts committed prior to the surrender.

 

      726.250 Investigations and examinations; cost. (1)(a) For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter or securing information required by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services under this chapter, the director at any time, either personally or by an examiner or other employee of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, may investigate the pledge loans and business and examine the books, accounts, records and files used in the pledge loans and business of every pawnbroker and of every person that the director has reason to believe is acting as a pawnbroker without a license, whether that person acts or claims to act as principal or agent, or under or without the authority of this chapter.

      (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection:

      (A) Every pawnbroker and person that the director has reason to believe is acting as a pawnbroker without a license shall give the director, examiner or other employee of the department free access to the person’s place of business, books, accounts, papers, records, files, safes and vaults; and

      (B) The director, examiner or other employee may:

      (i) Compel the attendance of witnesses and examine the witnesses under oath; and

      (ii) Require the production of documents or records.

      (c) The actual cost of each examination shall be paid to the director by every person examined. The director may maintain an action for recovery of costs in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The examination shall occur at the licensed location of the pawnbroker.

      (3) As often as the director determines necessary, each licensed pawnbroker shall submit to the director for examination, at the office of the director, those books, records and documents prescribed by the director by rule. [Amended by 1973 c.449 §1; 1985 c.762 §140; 2003 c.176 §2; 2005 c.338 §28; 2007 c.360 §6]

      (2) If a person fails to comply with a subpoena issued under subsection (1) of this section or a party or witness refuses to testify on any matter, the judge of the circuit court for any county, on the application of the director, shall compel obedience in the manner provided by law in the case of disobedience to a subpoena issued in a civil action in the circuit court.

      (3) Each witness who appears before the director under a subpoena shall receive the fees and mileage provided for witnesses in ORS 44.415 (2), except a witness subpoenaed at the instance of parties other than the director or an examiner shall not be compensated for attendance or travel unless the director certifies that the testimony of the witness was material to the matter investigated.

      (4) The director in any investigation may cause the depositions of witnesses to be taken in the manner prescribed by law for like depositions in civil suits in the circuit court. [1979 c.202 §9; 1985 c.762 §141; 1989 c.980 §21]

      (2) Nothing that appears on the pawn ticket relieves the pawnbroker of the obligation to exercise reasonable care in safekeeping articles pledged with the pawnbroker. [Amended by 1979 c.202 §4; 2009 c.372 §1; 2019 c.10 §1]

 

      726.310 Person entitled to redeem pledge; return of pledge stored off premises. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a person that holds a memorandum or pawn ticket is the person entitled to redeem the pledge associated with the memorandum or pawn ticket. A pawnbroker shall deliver the pledge to the person presenting such memorandum or pawn ticket upon payment of principal and interest due on the pledge loan.

      (2) If a pawnbroker holds a pledge at a location that is off the premises of the business location at which the pawnbroker made the pledge loan or at which a person redeems the pledge, the pawnbroker shall return the pledge within two business days after the date on which the person redeems the pledge. [Amended by 2019 c.10 §2]

 

      726.320 Redemption by mail. When a pawn ticket, instead of being presented in person, is sent to the pawnbroker by mail, accompanied with a money order, bank draft or cash for the amount due including the cost of shipment and packing as desired, the pledge shall be securely packed and forwarded by the pawnbroker in accordance with the remitter’s instructions. If the remittance is insufficient to cover the amount due and the cost of shipment and packing as desired, the pawnbroker shall either notify the remitter of the amount of the deficiency or send the pledge subject to the payment of the deficiency by the consignee. The pawnbroker’s liability for the pledge shall cease upon delivery thereof to the carrier or the agent of the carrier. [Amended by 1973 c.449 §4; 1981 c.192 §43]

 

      726.330 Delivery of pledge upon surrender of pawn ticket. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a pawnbroker shall not be required to deliver a pledge except upon surrender of the pawn ticket, unless the ticket is impounded or its negotiation enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

      726.340 Loss, destruction or theft of pawn ticket; affidavit; liability. If a pawn ticket or memorandum is lost, destroyed or stolen, the pledgor shall notify the pawnbroker of the loss, destruction or theft in writing. The pawnbroker shall treat receipt of the notice as a stop against the pledge loan, and thereafter the provisions of ORS 726.310 and 726.320 do not apply to the pledge loan. Before delivering the pledge or issuing a new pawn ticket, the pawnbroker may require the pledgor to make an affidavit of the alleged loss, destruction or theft and may charge a fee of not more than $3 for the lost, destroyed or stolen ticket. Not more than five days after receiving notice of the loss, destruction or theft of the ticket, the pawnbroker shall permit the pledgor either to redeem the pledge or to receive a new ticket upon paying accrued interest. The pawnbroker shall incur no liability for permitting the pledgor to redeem the pledge or receive a new ticket unless the pawnbroker has previously received written notice of an adverse claim. This section does not limit or affect the pawnbroker’s legal liability in cases where goods are stolen or other legal defects exist in the pledgor’s title with respect to the pledge. [Amended by 2007 c.360 §8; 2009 c.372 §2]

 

      726.350 Alteration. The alteration of a pawn ticket shall not excuse the pawnbroker who issued it from liability to deliver the pledge according to the terms of the pawn ticket as originally issued, but shall relieve the pawnbroker of any other liability to the pledgor or holder of the pawn ticket.

 

      726.360 Spurious pawn tickets. If a pawn ticket is presented to a pawnbroker which purports to be the one issued by the pawnbroker, but which is found to be spurious, the pawnbroker may seize and retain it without any liability whatsoever to the holder thereof. Any such pawn ticket so seized shall be delivered or mailed immediately to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services accompanied by a letter of explanation. [Amended by 1987 c.373 §73]

 

      726.370 Multiple claimants of pledge; interpleader. (1) If more than one person claims the right to redeem a pledge, the pawnbroker is not liable for refusing to deliver the pledge until the respective rights of the claimants have been adjudicated unless the pawnbroker fails to verify whether the pledge is subject to a lien or other encumbrance, if the pledge is:

      (a) A boat, as defined in ORS 830.005;

      (b) A snowmobile, as defined in ORS 801.490;

      (c) A trailer, as described in ORS 726.010 (2)(a)(D); or

      (d) An all-terrain vehicle that is not required to be registered with the Department of Transportation.

      (2) In an action brought against the pawnbroker for recovery of the pledge, the pawnbroker may as a defense require all known claimants to interplead.

      (3) If either claimant does not bring an action against the pawnbroker within 30 days after notice of an adverse claim, the pawnbroker may dispose of the pledge as provided in this chapter. [Amended by 2013 c.261 §3]

 

      726.380 Loss of or injury to pledge; storage of large items off premises; lien on pledge; rules. (1) A pawnbroker is liable for the loss of a pledge or a part of a pledge or for an injury to a pledge that results from failure to exercise reasonable care. Reasonable care includes maintaining sufficient insurance coverage against possible loss as a result of fire, theft and burglary so as to protect the interest of the pledgor for the amount of the loan.

      (2)(a) A pawnbroker may store large items, including items identified in paragraph (c) of this subsection, off the premises of the business location at which the pawnbroker makes the pledge loan only if:

      (A) The pawnbroker and the pledgor agree in writing that the pawnbroker may store the large item as described in this paragraph;

      (B) The pawnbroker maintains a business location at which the pawnbroker displays a license the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services issued under ORS 726.080; and

      (C) The off-premises location complies with all requirements this chapter or the director sets forth for pawnbroker business locations with respect to security, bonding, insurance and notice.

      (b) A pawnbroker may have only one off-premises location at which the pawnbroker stores large items for each business location for which the pawnbroker has the license described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection.

      (c) A pawnbroker shall hold a pledge in a gated, secured facility that is designed, constructed, furnished and maintained to present physical deterrents to a person’s ability to enter into the facility without authorization and remove the pledge, if the pledge is:

      (A) A boat, as defined in ORS 830.005;

      (B) A snowmobile, as defined in ORS 801.490;

      (C) A trailer, as described in ORS 726.010 (2)(a)(D); or

      (D) An all-terrain vehicle that is not required to be registered with the Department of Transportation.

      (d) The director by rule may define “large items” for the purposes of this subsection.

      (3) The pawnbroker has the burden of proof to establish due care if a pledge is lost.

      (4) The pawnbroker has a first lien on any pledge for the amount of the pledge loan and interest in all cases except where goods are stolen or where a prior lien exists by virtue of any provision of law. [Amended by 1979 c.202 §5; 2013 c.261 §4; 2019 c.10 §3]

 

      726.390 Interest rates and charges. (1)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a pawnbroker may not charge, contract for or receive interest at a rate in excess of three percent per month.

      (b) A pawnbroker may charge one month’s interest or $3 on pledge loans redeemed within the first month if interest accumulated amounts to less. The pawnbroker may not compound the interest and may not deduct or receive an amount in advance.

      (2) A pawnbroker may charge a set-up fee of 10 percent for loans and loan renewals with a minimum charge of $2 and a maximum charge of $250.

      (4) Except as provided by law, a pawnbroker may not charge, contract for or receive an amount in addition to the interest provided for in this section. [Amended by 1973 c.449 §5; 1979 c.202 §6; 1981 c.192 §44; 1985 c.795 §1; 1997 c.842 §3; 2009 c.372 §3; 2015 c.90 §1]

 

      726.395 Charges related to firearms. (1) A pawnbroker may charge a pledgor or customer a $3 fee if the pledgor or customer places a firearm with the pawnbroker. The pawnbroker may charge a $1 fee to renew the pledgor’s or customer’s placement of the firearm with the pawnbroker.

      (2) In addition to the fees described in subsection (1) of this section, a pawnbroker may charge a pledgor or customer any fee that a government entity imposes on the pawnbroker for holding or transferring a firearm. [1973 c.449 §3; 1997 c.842 §4; 2009 c.372 §4; 2014 c.54 §1]

 

      726.400 Loan period; renewal; forfeiture of pledge; notice; period for redeeming pledge. (1) Unless a pledgor and a pawnbroker agree to a longer loan period and the longer loan period is written on the pawn ticket, a pledge loan must be made for a period of 60 days. A pledge may be redeemed and the pledge loan repaid at any time before the loan period expires. A pawn ticket must clearly state the expiration date of the loan.

      (2) A pledgor and a pawnbroker may agree to renew a pledge loan for successive periods of 60 days or longer. A loan is a renewal of the original loan if the pledgor pays only the interest and the fees on the loan or pays a portion of the principal, the interest and the fees on the loan and accepts another pledge loan from the pawnbroker on the same pledge on the same day.

      (3) Except for a pledge that secures a pledge loan of $500 or less, the pawnbroker may not deem a pledge to be forfeited until:

      (a) The pawnbroker notifies the pledgor that the pledge is at risk of forfeiture after the period described in subsection (1) of this section expires; and

      (b) The pledgor has had an opportunity to redeem the pledge as provided in this section.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the notice described in subsection (3) of this section must be in writing and delivered postpaid in a securely closed envelope addressed to the pledgor at the last-known address shown on the pawnbroker’s record by regular mail.

      (b) At the time the pawnbroker makes or renews the loan, the pledgor may agree in writing to receive the notice described in subsection (3) of this section by electronic mail or other electronic means instead of by regular mail.

      (b) As evidence of delivery of the notice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the pawnbroker shall keep for at least two years:

      (A) A copy of, and the returned envelope for, each notice the pawnbroker sends by regular mail; and

      (B) An electronic record of each notice the pawnbroker sends by electronic mail or other electronic means.

      (6) A pledgor has a grace period of 30 days after the pledge loan period expires or 30 days after the delivery date specified in subsection (5) of this section of the notice required under this section, whichever date is later, in which to redeem the pledge or to renew the loan by paying any renewal fee and all the accrued interest and fees to date. There is no grace period after a renewal expires.

      (7) A pledge is forfeited if the pledge is not redeemed within the renewal period, if any, or within 30 days after the loan period expires or 30 days after the delivery date specified in subsection (5) of this section of a notice given under this section, whichever date is later. The pawnbroker acquires the pledgor’s title and interest in the forfeited pledge and the right to hold and dispose of the pledge as the pawnbroker’s own property. [Amended by 1973 c.449 §6; 1979 c.202 §7; 1981 c.192 §45; 1985 c.795 §2; 1997 c.842 §5; 2009 c.372 §5; 2010 c.14 §1; 2014 c.54 §2; 2017 c.56 §1]

 

      726.410 Record of forfeited pledges. Every pawnbroker shall keep an indelible record, fully itemized, of all forfeited pledges. The record shall contain the following information:

      (1) The number of the pledge.

      (2) The name and address of the pledgor.

      (3) The date of the pledge loan or the date of the last payment received as interest or principal.

      (4) The date of mailing notice.

      (5) The date of forfeiture. [Amended by 1985 c.795 §3]

 

      726.420 Effect of charging excessive interest or fees. If any pawnbroker or agent, member, officer or employee thereof, or any other person is found by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to have charged, contracted for or received any interest, fees or other charges in excess of those permitted by ORS 726.390, then the pledge loan shall be void. The pawnbroker shall forfeit the right to collect or receive any principal, interest or charges whatsoever. The pawnbroker shall upon order of the director return to the pledgor free from the pawnbroker’s lien the pledge pledged by the pledgor without tender of principal and interest and shall pay into the county school fund of the county wherein the loan is made all payments and all fees or other charges previously collected under such pledge loan. [Amended by 1975 c.544 §59a; 1987 c.373 §74]
