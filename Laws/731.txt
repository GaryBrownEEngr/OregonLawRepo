      (b) If the defendant shows the circuit court any ground upon which enforcement of a judgment of any circuit court of this state would be stayed, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign decree for an appropriate period, upon requiring the same security for satisfaction of the decree which is required in this state for a judgment.

      (2) The director, in any administrative proceeding in which service is made as provided in ORS 731.324, may order such postponement as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to comply with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and to defend such action.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall be construed to prevent an unauthorized insurer from filing a motion to quash a writ or to set aside service thereof made in the manner provided in ORS 731.324. [1969 c.336 §4; 1991 c.331 §126; 1997 c.631 §545]

Actions may be brought against or defended in the name of the reciprocal insurer adopted by the subscribers. [Formerly 749.050]

 

      731.371 Powers of reciprocal insurer regarding real estate. Except where inconsistent with other provisions of the Insurance Code, a reciprocal insurer in its own name, as in the case of an individual, may purchase, receive, own, hold, lease, mortgage, pledge or encumber by deed of trust or otherwise, manage and sell real estate for the purposes and objects of the insurer including, but not limited to, investment for the production of income or for its accommodation in the convenient transaction of its business.

However, if the foreign or alien insurer acquires any property given as security for such a mortgage or trust deed, all income accruing to the foreign or alien insurer solely from the ownership, sale or other disposal of such property is subject to taxation in the same manner and on the same basis as income of corporations doing business in this state.

In making the determination the director shall consider, among other things:

      (3) The certificate of authority, if issued, shall specify the class or classes of insurance the insurer is authorized to transact in this state. The director may issue authority limited to particular subclasses of insurance or types of insurance coverages within the scope of a class of insurance. [1967 c.359 §85]

 

      731.406 What certificate evidences; ownership of certificate. (1) An insurer’s subsisting certificate of authority is evidence of its authority to transact in this state the class or classes of insurance specified therein, either as direct insurer or as reinsurer or as both.

[1967 c.359 §86]

 

      731.410 Continuance, expiration or reinstatement of certificate of authority.

      (4) The director, in the discretion of the director, upon the insurer’s request made not later than the 90th day after expiration, may reinstate a certificate of authority which the insurer has permitted to expire, after the insurer has cured all its failures which resulted in the expiration and has paid the fee for reinstatement established by the director. Otherwise the insurer shall be granted another certificate of authority only after filing application therefor and meeting all other requirements as for an original certificate of authority in this state.

      (b) The insurer is in unsound condition, or in such condition or using such methods and practices in the conduct of its business, as to render its further transaction of insurance in this state hazardous or injurious to its policyholders or to the public.

      (c) The insurer has failed, after written request by the director, to remove or discharge an officer or director who has been convicted in any jurisdiction of an offense which, if committed in this state, constitutes a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude or a felony, or is punishable by death or imprisonment under the laws of the United States, in any of which cases the record of the conviction shall be conclusive evidence.

      (7) This section does not apply to any master policy issued to a multistate employer or labor union.

LIMIT OF RISK; REINSURANCE

 

      731.504 Limit of risk. (1) No insurer shall retain any risk on any one subject of insurance, whether a domestic risk or not, in an amount exceeding 10 percent of its surplus to policyholders, or in the case of title insurance, more than 50 percent of such surplus, except that an insurance company, including a reciprocal insurance company, comprised solely of 1,000 or more licensed Oregon physicians organized for the purpose of insuring for professional liability may consider aggregate insurance as surplus to policyholders for purposes of this section and shall not be allowed to retain the risk on any one subject of insurance in excess of two and one-half percent of such aggregate insurance.

      (2) For purposes of this section, aggregate insurance is insurance which provides coverage in the event that the total fund of an insurance company, including a reciprocal insurance company, which is available to pay claims for occurrences of any one year, is exhausted. Aggregate insurance shall be in an amount equal to at least five times the annual premium collected by the insurance company.

      (3) A “subject of insurance” for the purposes of this section:

      (a) As to insurance against fire and hazards other than windstorm, earthquake and other catastrophic hazards, includes all properties insured by the same insurer that customarily are considered by underwriters to be subject to loss or damage from the same fire or the same occurrence of any other hazard insured against;

      (b) As to group life and health insurance, refers individually to each person benefited under the group policy as a separate subject; and

      (c) As to mortgage insurance, includes all obligations secured by real property in a single tract, or in multiple tracts not separated by at least one-half mile.

      (4) Reinsurance ceded as authorized by ORS 731.508 shall be deducted in determining risk retained. As to surety risks, deduction also shall be made of the amount assumed by any established incorporated cosurety and the value of any security deposited, pledged, or held subject to the surety’s consent and for the surety’s protection.

      (5) As to alien insurers, this section relates only to risks and surplus to policyholders of the insurer’s United States branch.

      (6) As used in this section, “surplus to policyholders,” in addition to the insurer’s capital and surplus, includes any voluntary reserves that are not required pursuant to law, includes the contingency reserve held for mortgage insurance as required by ORS 733.100, and shall be determined from the last sworn statement of the insurer on file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, or by the last report of examination of the insurer, whichever is the more recent at time of assumption of risk.

      (7) This section does not apply to wet marine and transportation insurance or to any policy or type of coverage as to which the maximum possible loss to the insurer is not readily ascertainable on issuance of the policy. [1967 c.359 §103; 1969 c.692 §3; 1975 c.796 §12]

 

      731.508 Approved reinsurance. (1) An insurer may accept reinsurance only of such risks, and retain risk thereon within such limits, as it is otherwise authorized to insure.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 731.512, 732.517 to 732.546 or 742.150 to 742.162, an insurer may reinsure risks with an insurer authorized to transact such insurance in this state, or in any other solvent insurer approved or accepted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services for the purpose of such reinsurance. The director shall not approve or accept any such reinsurance by a ceding domestic insurer in an unauthorized insurer which the director finds for good cause would be contrary to the interests of the policyholders or stockholders of such domestic insurer.

      (3) Credit shall not be allowed, as an asset or as a deduction from liability, to any ceding insurer for reinsurance unless the reinsurance contract provides, in substance, that in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer, the reinsurance shall be payable under a contract or contracts reinsured by the assuming insurer on the basis of reported claims allowed by the court hearing the liquidation proceeding, without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer. Such payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator except:

      (a) When the contract or other written agreement specifically provides another payee of the reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or

      (b) When the assuming insurer, with the consent of the direct insured or insureds, has assumed the policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees.

      (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the reinsurance agreement may provide that the domiciliary liquidator of an insolvent ceding insurer shall, within a reasonable time after the claim is filed in the liquidation proceeding, give written notice to the assuming insurer of the pendency of a claim against the ceding insurer on the contract reinsured. During the pendency of the claim, an assuming insurer may investigate the claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding in which the claim is to be adjudicated any defenses that the assuming insurer determines to be available to the ceding insurer or its liquidator. The expense may be filed as a claim against the insolvent ceding insurer to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit that may accrue to the ceding insurer solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the assuming insurer. When two or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose one or more defenses to the claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement as though the expense had been incurred by the ceding insurer.

      (5) The director may disallow credit that would otherwise be allowed if the director determines that allowing credit would be contrary to accurate financial reporting or proper financial management, or may be hazardous to policyholders of the insurer or the insurance-buying public generally. The director may make such a determination only according to standards established by the director by rule. This subsection applies only to insurers who transact life insurance or health insurance, or both.

      (6) Upon request of the director, a ceding insurer promptly shall inform the director in writing of the cancellation or any other material change of any of its reinsurance treaties or arrangements.

      (7) This section does not apply to wet marine and transportation insurance. [1967 c.359 §104; 1993 c.447 §68; 1995 c.30 §9; 1995 c.638 §1; 2001 c.318 §14]

 

      731.509 Legislative intent; criteria for allowing credit for reinsurance. (1) The purpose of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 is to protect the interests of insureds, claimants, ceding insurers, assuming insurers and the public generally. The Legislative Assembly declares that its intent is to ensure adequate regulation of insurers and reinsurers and adequate protection for those to whom they owe obligations. In furtherance of that state interest, the Legislative Assembly mandates that upon the insolvency of an alien insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund its United States obligations in accordance with ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the assets representing the security shall be maintained in the United States and claims shall be filed with and valued by the state insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight, and the assets shall be distributed in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic United States insurers. The Legislative Assembly declares that the laws contained in ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1011 and 1012.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall not allow credit for reinsurance to a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded unless credit is allowed as provided under ORS 731.508 and unless the reinsurer meets the requirements of:

      (a) Subsection (3) of this section;

      (b) Subsection (4) of this section;

      (c) Subsections (5) and (8) of this section;

      (d) Subsections (6) and (8) of this section;

      (e) Subsection (7) of this section; or

      (f) Subsection (9) of this section.

      (3) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an authorized assuming insurer that accepts reinsurance of risks, and retains risk thereon within such limits, as the assuming insurer is otherwise authorized to insure in this state as provided in ORS 731.508.

      (4) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state as provided in ORS 731.511. The director shall not allow credit to a domestic ceding insurer if the accreditation of the assuming insurer has been revoked by the director after notice and opportunity for hearing.

      (5) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to a foreign assuming insurer or a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer meeting all of the following requirements:

      (a) The foreign assuming insurer must be domiciled in a state employing standards regarding credit for reinsurance that equal or exceed the standards applicable under this section. The United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must be entered through a state employing such standards.

      (b) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must maintain a combined capital and surplus in an amount not less than $20,000,000. The requirement of this paragraph does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.

      (c) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must submit to the authority of the director to examine its books and records.

      (6) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund meeting the requirements of this subsection and additionally complies with other requirements of this subsection. The trust fund must be maintained in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in ORS 731.510 (1), for the payment of the valid claims of its United States policyholders and ceding insurers and their assigns and successors in interest. The assuming insurer must report annually to the director information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the annual statement form by ORS 731.574 by authorized insurers, in order to enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. The following requirements apply to such a trust fund:

      (a) In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust fund must consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers. In addition, the assuming insurer must maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20,000,000.

      (b) In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:

      (A) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment or renewal date on or after August 1, 1995, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group.

      (B) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States.

      (C) In addition to the trusts described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.

      (D) The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

      (E) Within 90 days after the group’s financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if certification is unavailable, financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by independent certified public accountants.

      (c) In the case of a group of incorporated insurers described in this paragraph, the trust must be in an amount equal to the group’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group. This paragraph applies to a group of incorporated insurers under common administration that complies with the annual reporting requirements contained in this subsection and that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to making application for accreditation. Such a group must have an aggregate policyholders’ surplus of $10,000,000,000 and must submit to the authority of this state to examine its books and records and bear the expense of the examination. The group shall also maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities. Each member of the group shall make available to the director an annual certification of the member’s solvency by the member’s domiciliary regulator and its independent certified public accountant.

      (d) The form of the trust and any amendment to the trust shall have been approved by the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled or by the insurance commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.

      (e) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the insurance commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument must provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust must vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer’s United States ceding insurers and their assigns and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination as determined by the director. The trust must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.

      (f) Not later than March 1 of each year, the trustees of each trust shall report to the director in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust’s investments at the preceding year end, and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31.

      (7) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subsection (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this section, but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions in which the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.

      (8) If the assuming insurer is not authorized to transact insurance in this state or accredited as a reinsurer in this state, the director shall not allow the credit permitted by subsections (5) and (6) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreement to the provisions stated in this subsection. This subsection is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if such an obligation is created in the agreement. The assuming insurer must agree in the reinsurance agreement:

      (a) That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and

      (b) To designate the director or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company may be served.

      (9) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to the Oregon Reinsurance Program established in section 18, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017.

      (10) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section, the credit permitted by subsection (6) of this section shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:

      (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount less than the applicable amount required by subsection (6)(a), (b) or (c) of this section, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of the grantor’s state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight all the assets of the trust fund.

      (b) The assets shall be distributed by and claims shall be filed with and valued by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

      (c) If the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part thereof are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part thereof shall be returned by the insurance commissioner according to the laws of that state and according to the terms of the trust agreement not inconsistent with the laws of that state.

      (d) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection. [1993 c.447 §65; 1995 c.99 §1; 2001 c.318 §15; 2013 c.698 §§5,35; 2017 c.538 §23]

 

      Note: The amendments to 731.509 by section 25, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017, become operative January 2, 2024. See section 46, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017. The text that is operative on and after January 2, 2024, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      731.509. (1) The purpose of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 is to protect the interests of insureds, claimants, ceding insurers, assuming insurers and the public generally. The Legislative Assembly declares that its intent is to ensure adequate regulation of insurers and reinsurers and adequate protection for those to whom they owe obligations. In furtherance of that state interest, the Legislative Assembly mandates that upon the insolvency of an alien insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund its United States obligations in accordance with ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the assets representing the security shall be maintained in the United States and claims shall be filed with and valued by the state insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight, and the assets shall be distributed in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic United States insurers. The Legislative Assembly declares that the laws contained in ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1011 and 1012.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall not allow credit for reinsurance to a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded unless credit is allowed as provided under ORS 731.508 and unless the reinsurer meets the requirements of:

      (a) Subsection (3) of this section;

      (b) Subsection (4) of this section;

      (c) Subsections (5) and (8) of this section;

      (d) Subsections (6) and (8) of this section; or

      (e) Subsection (7) of this section.

      (3) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an authorized assuming insurer that accepts reinsurance of risks, and retains risk thereon within such limits, as the assuming insurer is otherwise authorized to insure in this state as provided in ORS 731.508.

      (4) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state as provided in ORS 731.511. The director shall not allow credit to a domestic ceding insurer if the accreditation of the assuming insurer has been revoked by the director after notice and opportunity for hearing.

      (5) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to a foreign assuming insurer or a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer meeting all of the following requirements:

      (a) The foreign assuming insurer must be domiciled in a state employing standards regarding credit for reinsurance that equal or exceed the standards applicable under this section. The United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must be entered through a state employing such standards.

      (b) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must maintain a combined capital and surplus in an amount not less than $20,000,000. The requirement of this paragraph does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.

      (c) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must submit to the authority of the director to examine its books and records.

      (6) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund meeting the requirements of this subsection and additionally complies with other requirements of this subsection. The trust fund must be maintained in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in ORS 731.510 (1), for the payment of the valid claims of its United States policyholders and ceding insurers and their assigns and successors in interest. The assuming insurer must report annually to the director information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the annual statement form by ORS 731.574 by authorized insurers, in order to enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. The following requirements apply to such a trust fund:

      (a) In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust fund must consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers. In addition, the assuming insurer must maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20,000,000.

      (b) In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:

      (A) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment or renewal date on or after August 1, 1995, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group.

      (B) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States.

      (C) In addition to the trusts described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.

      (D) The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

      (E) Within 90 days after the group’s financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if certification is unavailable, financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by independent certified public accountants.

      (c) In the case of a group of incorporated insurers described in this paragraph, the trust must be in an amount equal to the group’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group. This paragraph applies to a group of incorporated insurers under common administration that complies with the annual reporting requirements contained in this subsection and that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to making application for accreditation. Such a group must have an aggregate policyholders’ surplus of $10,000,000,000 and must submit to the authority of this state to examine its books and records and bear the expense of the examination. The group shall also maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities. Each member of the group shall make available to the director an annual certification of the member’s solvency by the member’s domiciliary regulator and its independent certified public accountant.

      (d) The form of the trust and any amendment to the trust shall have been approved by the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled or by the insurance commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.

      (e) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the insurance commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument must provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust must vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer’s United States ceding insurers and their assigns and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination as determined by the director. The trust must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.

      (f) Not later than March 1 of each year, the trustees of each trust shall report to the director in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust’s investments at the preceding year end, and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31.

      (7) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subsection (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this section, but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions in which the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.

      (8) If the assuming insurer is not authorized to transact insurance in this state or accredited as a reinsurer in this state, the director shall not allow the credit permitted by subsections (5) and (6) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreement to the provisions stated in this subsection. This subsection is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if such an obligation is created in the agreement. The assuming insurer must agree in the reinsurance agreement:

      (a) That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and

      (b) To designate the director or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company may be served.

      (9) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subsection (3), (4) or (5) of this section, the credit permitted by subsection (6) of this section shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:

      (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount less than the applicable amount required by subsection (6)(a), (b) or (c) of this section, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of the grantor’s state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight all the assets of the trust fund.

      (b) The assets shall be distributed by and claims shall be filed with and valued by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

      (c) If the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part thereof are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part thereof shall be returned by the insurance commissioner according to the laws of that state and according to the terms of the trust agreement not inconsistent with the laws of that state.

      (d) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection.

 

      731.510 Criteria for allowing reduction from liability for reinsurance. (1) Subject to the provisions of ORS 731.508 relating to allowance of credit for reinsurance, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall allow a reduction from liability for the reinsurance ceded by a domestic insurer to a reinsurer not meeting the requirements of ORS 731.509 in an amount not exceeding the liabilities carried by the ceding insurer, as provided in this section. The reduction shall be in the amount of funds held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer, including funds held in trust for the ceding insurer, under a reinsurance contract with the reinsurer as security for the payment of obligations thereunder, if the security:

      (a) Is held in the United States subject to withdrawal solely by and under the exclusive control of the ceding insurer; or

      (b) In the case of a trust, is held in a qualified United States financial institution. For purposes of this paragraph, a qualified United States financial institution is an institution that:

      (A) Is organized, or, in the case of a United States branch or agency office of a foreign banking organization, is licensed, under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and has been granted authority to operate with fiduciary powers; and

      (B) Is regulated, supervised and examined by federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies.

      (2) The security for purposes of subsection (1) of this section may be in any of the following forms:

      (a) Cash.

      (b) Securities listed by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and qualifying as allowed assets.

      (c) Clean, irrevocable, unconditional letters of credit, issued or confirmed by a qualified United States financial institution, effective not later than December 31 of the year for which filing is being made, and in the possession of, or in trust for, the ceding company on or before the filing date of its annual statement. Letters of credit issued or confirmed by an institution meeting applicable standards of issuer acceptability as of the dates of their issuance or confirmation shall continue to be acceptable as security, notwithstanding the subsequent failure of the issuing or confirming institution to meet applicable standards of issuer acceptability, until their expiration, extension, renewal, modification or amendment, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this paragraph, a qualified United States financial institution is an institution that:

      (A) Is organized or, in the case of a United States office of a foreign banking organization, is licensed, under the laws of the United States or any state thereof;

      (B) Is regulated, supervised and examined by United States federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies; and

      (C) Has been determined by the director to meet such standards of financial condition and standing as are considered necessary and appropriate to regulate the quality of financial institutions whose letters of credit will be acceptable to the director. For the purpose of making a determination under this subparagraph, the director shall consider and may accept determinations made by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as to whether a financial institution meets its standards of financial conditions and standing.

      (d) Any other form of security acceptable to the director. [1993 c.447 §66; 2001 c.318 §16]

 

      731.511 Criteria to be met by assuming insurer in order to be accredited as reinsurer. (1) For purposes of allowing credit to a ceding domestic insurer under ORS 731.509 when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state, an insurer may be accredited as a reinsurer in this state if the insurer:

      (a) Files and maintains with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services evidence of its submission to the jurisdiction of this state;

      (b) Submits to the authority of the director to examine its books and records;

      (c) Is authorized or licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through and authorized or licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state;

      (d) Files annually with the director a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and

      (e) Satisfies either of the following requirements:

      (A) Maintains combined capital and surplus in an amount that is not less than $20,000,000. An application for accreditation by an insurer who maintains the amount of combined capital and surplus specified in this subparagraph is considered to be approved if the application is not disapproved on or before the 90th day after the application is complete and is filed with the director.

      (B) Maintains combined capital and surplus in an amount less than $20,000,000. An insurer applying for accreditation who maintains the amount of combined capital and surplus specified in this subparagraph is not accredited until the application for accreditation is approved by the director.

      (2) An insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state may accept reinsurance only of those risks and retain the risk thereon within such limits as the accredited reinsurer is otherwise authorized to insure directly in a state in which the accredited reinsurer is authorized or licensed to transact insurance.

      (3) The director may revoke the accreditation of an assuming insurer if the director determines that the assuming insurer has failed to continue to meet any of the requirements of subsection (1) of this section. [1993 c.447 §67]

 

      731.512 Withdrawal of insurer; reinsurance. (1) No insurer shall withdraw from this state until its direct liability to its policyholders and obligees under all its insurance policies then in force in this state has been assumed by another authorized insurer under an agreement approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. In the case of a life insurer, its liability pursuant to policies issued in this state in settlement of proceeds under its policies shall likewise be so assumed.

      (2) The director may waive this requirement if the director finds upon examination that a withdrawing insurer then is fully solvent and that the protection to be given its policyholders in this state will not be impaired by the waiver.

      (3) The assuming insurer within a reasonable time shall replace the assumed insurance policies with its own, or by indorsement thereon acknowledge its liability thereunder.

      (4) This section is in addition to the requirements of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 and 742.150 to 742.162. [1967 c.359 §105; 1995 c.30 §10]

 

      731.516 Mortgage insurance limitation; waiver of limitation; rules; fees. (1) As used in this section, “policyholders’ position” means the aggregate amount of mortgage insurance policies covering amounts of insured obligations, divided by the insurer’s surplus to policyholders as defined in ORS 731.504 (6).

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a mortgage insurer shall not have outstanding at any time a policyholders’ position greater than 25.

      (3)(a) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may waive the requirement in subsection (2) of this section in response to the request of a mortgage insurer if the director finds that the mortgage insurer’s policyholders’ position is reasonable in relation to the mortgage insurer’s aggregate insured risk and adequate to the mortgage insurer’s financial needs.

      (b) The request of the mortgage insurer must be made in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the mortgage insurer expects to exceed the policyholders’ position allowed by subsection (2) of this section, and shall at a minimum address the factors set forth in subsection (4) of this section that the director may use in making a decision on the waiver request.

      (4) In determining whether a mortgage insurer’s requested policyholders’ position is reasonable in relation to the mortgage insurer’s aggregate insured risk and adequate to the mortgage insurer’s financial needs, the director may consider the following factors:

      (a) The size of the mortgage insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria.

      (b) The extent to which the mortgage insurer’s business is diversified across time, geography, credit quality, origination and distribution channels.

      (c) The nature and extent of the mortgage insurer’s reinsurance program.

      (d) The quality, diversification and liquidity of the mortgage insurer’s assets and investment portfolio.

      (e) The historical and projected trends in the magnitude of the mortgage insurer’s policyholders’ position.

      (f) The policyholders’ position maintained by other comparable mortgage insurers.

      (g) The adequacy of the mortgage insurer’s reserves.

      (h) The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates of the mortgage insurer. The director may treat any such investment as a nonadmitted asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of the mortgage insurer’s policyholders’ position.

      (i) The quality of the mortgage insurer’s earnings and the extent to which the reported earnings of the mortgage insurer include extraordinary items.

      (j) An independent actuary’s opinion as to the reasonableness and adequacy of the mortgage insurer’s historical and projected policyholders’ position.

      (k) The capital contributions that have been invested or are available for future investment in the mortgage insurer.

      (L) The historical and projected trends in the components of the mortgage insurer’s aggregate insured risk including, but not limited to, the quality and type of the risks included in the aggregate insured risk.

      (m) Any other factors the director believes are relevant in making a decision on the request.

      (5) The director may retain accountants, actuaries or other experts to assist the director in the review of the mortgage insurer’s request submitted under subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) Any waiver granted by the director under subsection (3) of this section is:

      (a) In effect for a specified period of time, not to exceed two years. The mortgage insurer may request an extension of the waiver for a period not exceeding two additional years, and the director shall review the extension request based upon the factors set forth in subsection (4) of this section.

      (b) Subject to any terms and conditions that the director considers necessary to restore the mortgage insurer’s policyholders’ position to 25 or lower as required by subsection (2) of this section.

      (7) The director may adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section.

      (8) The director shall charge a fee for a waiver request under this section designed to reimburse the Department of Consumer and Business Services for all costs incurred by the department in reviewing the waiver request. [1969 c.692 §5; 1977 c.600 §1; 2010 c.46 §1]

 

CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

 

      731.554 Capital and surplus requirements. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) to (6) of this section and ORS 731.562 and 731.566, to qualify for authority to transact insurance in this state an insurer shall possess and thereafter maintain capital or surplus, or any combination thereof, of not less than $2.5 million.

      (2) An insurer transacting any workers’ compensation insurance business shall possess and thereafter maintain capital or surplus, or any combination thereof, of not less than $5 million.

      (3) An insurer transacting mortgage insurance shall possess and thereafter maintain capital or surplus, or any combination thereof, of not less than $4 million.

      (4) A home protection insurer shall possess and thereafter maintain capital or surplus, or any combination thereof, of not less than 10 percent of the aggregate of premiums charged on its policies currently in force, but the required amount shall not be less than $250,000 or more than $1 million.

      (5) A domestic insurer applying for its original certificate of authority in this state shall possess, when first so authorized, additional capital or surplus, or any combination thereof, of not less than $500,000. However, the additional amount in the case of a home protection insurer shall be not less than $10,000.

      (6) For the protection of the public, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may require an insurer to possess and maintain capital or surplus, or any combination thereof, in excess of the amount otherwise required under this section, ORS 731.562 or 731.566, owing to the type, volume and nature of insurance business transacted by the insurer, if the director determines that the greater amount is necessary for maintaining the insurer’s solvency according to standards established by rule. In developing such standards, the director shall consider model standards adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. For the purpose of determining the reasonableness and adequacy of an insurer’s capital and surplus, the director must consider at least the following factors, as applicable:

      (a) The size of the insurer, as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria.

      (3) Deposits made by insurers and reinsurers in this state under ORS 731.628 shall be held for the payment of compensation benefits to workers employed by insured employers other than those insured with the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation to whom the insurer has issued a workers’ compensation insurance policy under ORS chapter 656.

      (2) If release of the deposit is claimed by the insurer upon the ground that all its liabilities, as to which the deposit was held, have been assumed by another insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state, the insurer shall file with the director a copy of the contract or agreement of such reinsurance duly attested under the oath of an officer of each of the insurers that are parties thereto.

      (3) If release of the deposit is claimed by a domestic insurer upon the ground that all its liabilities, as to which the deposit was held, have been terminated other than by reinsurance, the director shall make an examination of the affairs of the insurer for determination of the actuality of such termination.

      (4) Upon being satisfied by such statement and reinsurance contract, or examination of the insurer if required under subsection (3) of this section, or by such other examination of the affairs of the insurer as the director deems advisable to make, that the insurer is entitled to the release of its deposit or portion thereof as provided in ORS 731.648, the director shall release the deposit or excess portion thereof to the insurer or its authorized representative.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 731.760 to 731.770, any person who performs or directs the performance of an insurance compliance audit, any officer, employee or agent of an insurer who is involved with an insurance compliance audit and any consultant who is hired for the purpose of performing an insurance compliance audit may not be examined in any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding about the insurance compliance audit or any insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document. [2001 c.329 §3]

 

      731.762 Authority of director. (1) ORS 731.761 does not limit the authority of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to acquire any insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document or to examine any person in connection with the document. If the director determines that the actions of an insurer are egregious, the director may introduce and use the document in any administrative proceeding or civil action under the Insurance Code. The director may require that an insurer submit an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document for the purpose of an examination or investigation conducted under this chapter. An insurer may also voluntarily submit an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document to the director.

      (2) Any insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document submitted to the director under this section and in the possession of the director remains the property of the insurer and is not subject to disclosure or production under ORS 192.311 to 192.478.

      (3)(a) The director shall consider the corrective action taken by an insurer to eliminate problems identified in the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document as a mitigating factor when determining a civil penalty or other action against the insurer.

      (b) The director may, in the director’s sole discretion, decline to impose a civil penalty or take other action against an insurer based on information obtained from an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document if the insurer has taken reasonable corrective action to eliminate the problems identified in the document.

      (4) Disclosure of an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document to a governmental agency, whether voluntarily or pursuant to compulsion of law, does not constitute a waiver of the privilege set forth in ORS 731.761 for any other purpose.

      (5) The director may not be compelled to produce an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document. [2001 c.329 §4]

 

      731.764 Waiver of privilege; permitted disclosures. (1) The privilege set forth in ORS 731.761 does not apply to the extent that the privilege is expressly waived by the insurer that prepared or caused to be prepared the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document.

      (2) The privilege set forth in ORS 731.761 does not apply in any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding commenced by the Attorney General relating to Medicaid fraud, without regard to whether the proceeding is brought on behalf of the state, a state agency or a federal agency. An insurer may request an in camera review of any document or other evidence to be released or used under this subsection and may request that appropriate protective orders be entered governing release and use of the material.

      (3) In any civil proceeding a court of record may, after an in camera review, require disclosure of material for which the privilege set forth in ORS 731.761 is asserted if the court determines that the material is not subject to the privilege, or that the privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose, including but not limited to an assertion of the privilege for an insurance compliance audit that was conducted for the purpose of concealing a violation of any federal, state or local law or rule. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to acquire, examine and use insurance compliance self-evaluative audit documents under ORS 731.762.

      (4) In a criminal proceeding, a court of record may, after an in camera review, require disclosure of material for which the privilege set forth in ORS 731.761 is asserted if the court determines that:

      (a) The privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose, including but not limited to an assertion of the privilege for an insurance compliance audit that was conducted for the purpose of concealing a violation of any federal, state or local law or rule;

      (b) The material is not subject to the privilege; or

      (c) The material contains evidence relevant to commission of a criminal offense, and:

      (A) A district attorney or the Attorney General has a compelling need for the information;

      (B) The information is not otherwise available; or

      (C) The district attorney or Attorney General is unable to obtain the substantial equivalent of the information by any other means without incurring unreasonable cost and delay. [2001 c.329 §5]

 

      731.766 Petition for in camera hearing; hearing; compelled disclosure. (1) Within 30 days after a district attorney or the Attorney General serves on an insurer a written request by certified mail for disclosure of an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document, the insurer that prepared or caused the document to be prepared may file in circuit court a petition requesting an in camera hearing on whether the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document or portions of the document are privileged under ORS 731.761 or subject to disclosure. Failure by the insurer to file a petition waives the privilege only with respect to the specific request.

      (2) A petition filed by an insurer under this section must contain the following information:

      (a) The date of the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document.

      (b) The identity of the person that conducted the audit.

      (c) The general nature of the activities covered by the insurance compliance audit.

      (d) An identification of the portions of the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document for which the privilege is being asserted.

      (3) Within 45 days after the filing of a petition by an insurer under this section, the court shall schedule an in camera hearing to determine whether the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document or portions of the document are privileged under ORS 731.761.

      (4) The court, after an in camera review pursuant to this section, may require disclosure of material for which the privilege established by ORS 731.761 is asserted if the court determines that any of the conditions set forth in ORS 731.764 are met. Upon making such a determination, the court may compel the disclosure of only those portions of an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document relevant to issues in dispute in the underlying proceeding. Any disclosure that is compelled by the court will not be considered to be a public document or be deemed to be a waiver of the privilege for any other civil, criminal or administrative proceeding. A party unsuccessfully opposing disclosure may apply to the court for an appropriate order protecting the document from further disclosure.

      (5) An insurer asserting the privilege established under ORS 731.761 has the burden of establishing that the privilege applies. If the insurer establishes that the privilege applies, a party seeking disclosure under ORS 731.764 has the burden of proving the elements set forth in ORS 731.764. [2001 c.329 §6]

 

      731.768 Privilege; exceptions. The privilege established under ORS 731.761 does not apply to any of the following:

      (1) Documents, communications, data, reports or other information expressly required to be collected, developed, maintained or reported to a regulatory agency under the Insurance Code or other state or federal law;

      (2) Information obtained by observation or monitoring by any regulatory agency; or

      (3) Information obtained from a source other than the insurance compliance audit. [2001 c.329 §7]

 

      731.770 Other privileges or limitations pertaining to audit document. Nothing in ORS 731.760 to 731.770, or in the release of any insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document under ORS 731.760 to 731.770, shall limit, waive or abrogate the scope or nature of any statutory or common law privilege or other limitation on admissibility of evidence including, but not limited to, the work product doctrine, the lawyer-client privilege under ORS 40.225 or the subsequent remedial measures exclusion provided by ORS 40.185.

In the case of reciprocal insurers, the amount of savings paid or credited to the accounts of subscribers shall be deducted from the gross amount of premiums. In establishing the percentage rate or rates, the director shall use the most recent premium data approved by the director. In establishing the amounts to be collected under this subsection, the director shall take into consideration the expenses of the department for administering the Insurance Code and the fees collected under subsection (2) of this section.

      (3) If the director, during the period in which the director under ORS 731.836 may collect taxes owing under this section, finds the amount of such taxes paid by an insurer to have been incorrect, the director shall charge or credit the insurer with the difference between the correct amount of tax and the amount actually paid. [1967 c.359 §135; 1967 c.453 §4; 1971 c.231 §15; 1975 c.275 §1; 1983 c.130 §1; 1989 c.700 §6; 2003 c.364 §77; 2013 c.191 §1]

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall credit the prepayment toward the appropriate tax obligations of the insurer for the current calendar year under section 2, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, or ORS 731.820 or ORS 731.854 and 731.859.

      (3) The amounts of the prepayments shall be percentages of the insurer’s tax obligation based on the preceding calendar year’s business adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the declining percentages set forth in section 2 (3), chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, applicable for the current year, and shall be paid to the director by the due dates and in the following amounts:

      (b) On or before September 15, 25 percent; and

      (c) On or before December 15, 25 percent.

      731.824 Tax on underwriting profits of wet marine and transportation insurers. (1) Wet marine and transportation insurance written by foreign or alien insurers within this state shall be taxed only on that proportion of the total underwriting profit of such insurer from such insurance written within the United States that the gross premiums of the insurer from such insurance written within this state bear to the gross premiums of such insurer from such insurance written within the United States.

      (2) The “underwriting profit,” for purposes of this section, is arrived at by deducting from the net earned premiums on such insurance policies written within the United States during the calendar year:

      (a) The losses incurred, and

      (b) Expenses incurred, including all taxes, state and federal, in connection with such net earned premiums.

      (3) The amount of “net earned premiums” on such insurance policies written during the calendar year is the sum of paragraphs (a) and (b) less paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (a) Gross premiums on such insurance policies written during the calendar year, less any and all return premiums, any and all premiums on policies not taken and any and all premiums paid for such reinsurance.

      (b) Unearned premiums on such outstanding marine business at the end of the preceding calendar year.

      (c) Unearned premiums on such outstanding marine business at the end of the current calendar year.

      (a) Specific expenses incurred on such earned wet marine and transportation insurance premiums, consisting of all commissions, agency expenses, taxes, licenses, fees, loss-adjustment expenses, and all other expenses incurred directly and specifically in connection with such premiums, less recoveries or reimbursements on account of or in connection with such commissions or other expenses collected or collectible because of reinsurance or from any other source.

      (b) General expenses incurred on such earned premiums, consisting of that proportion of general or overhead expenses, such as salaries of officers and employees, printing and stationery, all taxes of this state and of the United States, except as otherwise provided herein, and all other expenses not chargeable specifically to a particular class of insurance, which the net premiums of such insurance written bear to the total net premiums written by such insurer from all classes of insurance written by it during the current calendar year. However, in arriving at the “underwriting profit” for purposes of taxation under this section there shall not be deducted in respect to expenses incurred, as defined and specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, amounts which, in the aggregate, exceed 40 percent of the gross premiums on such insurance policies. [Formerly 745.145]

      (2) Each insurer that has been writing such insurance in this state for three years shall furnish the director a statement of all of the items referred to in subsection (1) of this section, in the form prescribed by the director, for each of the preceding three calendar years.

      (3) On or before June 15 of each year, if the insurer has transacted such insurance for three years, the insurer shall:

      (a) Ascertain the average annual underwriting profit, as provided in ORS 731.824, derived by the insurer from such insurance business written within the United States during the last preceding three calendar years.

      (b) Ascertain the proportion which the average annual premiums of the insurer from such insurance written by it in this state during the last preceding three calendar years bears to the average total of such wet marine and transportation insurance premiums of the insurer during the same three years.

      (c) Pay five percent on this proportion of the average annual underwriting profit of the insurer from such insurance to the director as a tax upon such insurance written by it in this state during the current calendar year.

      (4) The insurer each year shall compute the tax, according to the method described in this section, upon the average annual underwriting profit of such insurer from such insurance during the preceding three years, including the current calendar year. At the expiration of each current calendar year, the profit or loss on such insurance business of that year is to be added or deducted, and the profit or loss upon such insurance business of the first calendar year of the preceding three-year period is to be dropped so that the computation of underwriting profit for purposes of taxation under this section will always be on a three-year average.

      (5) An insurer that has not been writing wet marine and transportation insurance in this state for three years shall, until it has transacted such business in this state for that number of years, be taxed on the basis of its annual underwriting profit on such insurance written within the United States for the current calendar year, subject, however, to an adjustment in the tax as soon as the insurer, in accordance with the provisions of this section, is enabled to compute the tax on the three-year basis.

      (6) In the case of mutual insurers the insurer shall not include in the underwriting profit, when computing the tax prescribed by this section, the amounts refunded by such insurers on account of premiums previously paid by their policyholders.

      (7) If the director, during the period in which the director under ORS 731.836 may collect taxes owing under this section, finds the amount of such taxes paid by an insurer to have been incorrect, the director shall charge or credit the insurer with the difference between the correct amount of tax and the amount actually paid.

      (8) If an insurer ceases to transact wet marine and transportation insurance in the state, it shall thereupon make report to the director of the items pertaining to such insurance business, as enumerated and described in this section, to the date of its ceasing to transact such insurance and not theretofore reported, and forthwith pay to the director the taxes computed according to this section and the annual authorization fees thereon. [Formerly 745.150; 1969 c.158 §1; 1975 c.250 §1; 1989 c.700 §7]

      731.836 Limitation on enforcement of insurer’s tax obligations. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall commence an action for the recovery of taxes payable under ORS 731.820, 731.824, 731.828 and 731.859 not later than the later of the following:

      (1) Five years after the date such taxes were payable to the director under such sections; or

      (2) Three years after the date on which the report of examination by the domiciliary state of the insurer, disclosing that such taxes were owing by the insurer under such sections, was filed with the director. [1967 c.359 §139; 1969 c.158 §4; 1989 c.700 §8]

 

      731.840 Retaliatory or corporate excise tax in lieu of certain taxes and assessments; certain local taxes prohibited. (1) The retaliatory tax imposed upon a foreign or alien insurer under ORS 731.854 and 731.859, or the corporate excise tax imposed upon a foreign or alien insurer under ORS chapter 317, is in lieu of all other state taxes upon premiums, taxes upon income, franchise or other taxes measured by income that might otherwise be imposed upon the foreign or alien insurer except the fire insurance premiums tax imposed under ORS 731.820, the tax imposed upon wet marine and transportation insurers under ORS 731.824 and 731.828 and the assessment imposed under section 5, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017. However, all real and personal property, if any, of the insurer shall be listed, assessed and taxed the same as real and personal property of like character of noninsurers. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the imposition of the assessments imposed under ORS 656.612 upon a foreign or alien insurer.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies to a reciprocal insurer and its attorney in its capacity as such.

      (a) No county, city, district, or other political subdivision or agency in this state shall so regulate, or shall levy upon insurers, or upon their insurance producers and representatives as such, any such tax, license or fee; except that whenever a county, city, district or other political subdivision levies or imposes generally on a nondiscriminatory basis throughout the jurisdiction of the taxing authority a payroll, excise or income tax, as otherwise provided by law, such tax may be levied or imposed upon domestic insurers; and

      (b) No county, city, district, political subdivision or agency in this state shall require of any insurer, insurance producer or representative, duly authorized or licensed as such under the Insurance Code, any additional authorization, license, or permit of any kind for conducting therein transactions otherwise lawful under the authority or license granted under this code.

If, on account of the provisions of section 2, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, and the amendments to ORS 731.840 by section 6, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, the amendments to ORS 750.329 by section 11, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, the amendments to ORS 317.010 by section 12, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, and the amendments to ORS 317.080 by section 13, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, any insurer authorized to transact business in Oregon on January 1, 1997, is subject to the local taxes, licenses and fees described in ORS 731.840 (4)(a) as of January 1, 1997, and was not so subject before January 1, 1997, the authority of the local government to impose those taxes is preempted by the State of Oregon and no county, city, district or other political subdivision or agency in this state shall levy or impose upon such insurer, or upon its insurance producers or representatives, any excise, privilege, franchise, income, license, permit, registration or similar tax, license or fee. [1995 c.786 §20; 2003 c.364 §79]

 

      731.842 Adjustment of amount to be prepaid for taxes; extension of time for payment; interest; penalty for late payment. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may grant, for good cause shown, a request for an adjustment of the amount of the prepayment due under ORS 731.822 or an extension of time for payment of taxes under ORS 731.808 to 731.828 and 731.859. The extension shall be requested no later than the due date and may not exceed 30 days or one month, whichever is longer, except that an extension of time for payments under ORS 731.822 may not exceed 10 days.

      (2) Interest at the rate of two-thirds of one percent per month or fraction of a month shall accrue on any such tax payment not made by the due date (determined without regard to extensions).

      (3) A penalty of 10 percent of the tax amount shall be imposed upon any late payment of any such tax, except for a payment made within an extension period as provided in subsection (1) of this section or when the director believes extenuating circumstances justify waiver of the penalty. [1975 c.230 §2; 1980 c.10 §4; 1995 c.786 §7]

 

      731.844 No personal liability for paying invalid tax.
