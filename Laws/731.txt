      (2) The director, in any administrative proceeding in which service is made as provided in ORS 731.324, may order such postponement as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to comply with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and to defend such action.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall be construed to prevent an unauthorized insurer from filing a motion to quash a writ or to set aside service thereof made in the manner provided in ORS 731.324. [1969 c.336 §4; 1991 c.331 §126; 1997 c.631 §545]

A transferring insurer shall file new policy forms with the director on or before the effective date of the transfer but may use existing policy forms with appropriate indorsements if allowed by the director, according to any conditions established by the director.

      (3) Each transferring insurer shall notify the director of the details of the proposed transfer and shall file promptly any resulting amendments to corporate or other organizational documents filed or required to be filed with the director.

Actions may be brought against or defended in the name of the reciprocal insurer adopted by the subscribers. [Formerly 749.050]

 

      731.371 Powers of reciprocal insurer regarding real estate. Except where inconsistent with other provisions of the Insurance Code, a reciprocal insurer in its own name, as in the case of an individual, may purchase, receive, own, hold, lease, mortgage, pledge or encumber by deed of trust or otherwise, manage and sell real estate for the purposes and objects of the insurer including, but not limited to, investment for the production of income or for its accommodation in the convenient transaction of its business.

However, if the foreign or alien insurer acquires any property given as security for such a mortgage or trust deed, all income accruing to the foreign or alien insurer solely from the ownership, sale or other disposal of such property is subject to taxation in the same manner and on the same basis as income of corporations doing business in this state.

In making the determination the director shall consider, among other things:

      (1) The history and financial condition of the insurer;

      (2) The character, responsibility and fitness of the officers and directors of the insurer; and

      (3) The certificate of authority, if issued, shall specify the class or classes of insurance the insurer is authorized to transact in this state. The director may issue authority limited to particular subclasses of insurance or types of insurance coverages within the scope of a class of insurance. [1967 c.359 §85]

 

      731.406 What certificate evidences; ownership of certificate. (1) An insurer’s subsisting certificate of authority is evidence of its authority to transact in this state the class or classes of insurance specified therein, either as direct insurer or as reinsurer or as both.

      (4) The director, in the discretion of the director, upon the insurer’s request made not later than the 90th day after expiration, may reinstate a certificate of authority which the insurer has permitted to expire, after the insurer has cured all its failures which resulted in the expiration and has paid the fee for reinstatement established by the director. Otherwise the insurer shall be granted another certificate of authority only after filing application therefor and meeting all other requirements as for an original certificate of authority in this state.

      (b) The insurer is in unsound condition, or in such condition or using such methods and practices in the conduct of its business, as to render its further transaction of insurance in this state hazardous or injurious to its policyholders or to the public.

With the consent of the insurer issuing such policies, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may waive this provision if the director finds that the waiver will not be detrimental to the public; or

      (b) That is deceptive or misleading as to the type of organization of the insurer or that does not indicate the insurer is transacting insurance.

      (2) Any insurer doing business in this state may file and register with the director in writing, in its articles of incorporation or otherwise, an assumed name that it will use in transacting insurance in this state. Such name may not be a name prohibited by subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) Any person may reserve a name for use as a corporate name or an assumed business name in transacting insurance in this state by filing in writing with the director a reservation of such name.

LIMIT OF RISK; REINSURANCE

 

      731.504 Limit of risk. (1) No insurer shall retain any risk on any one subject of insurance, whether a domestic risk or not, in an amount exceeding 10 percent of its surplus to policyholders, or in the case of title insurance, more than 50 percent of such surplus, except that an insurance company, including a reciprocal insurance company, comprised solely of 1,000 or more licensed Oregon physicians organized for the purpose of insuring for professional liability may consider aggregate insurance as surplus to policyholders for purposes of this section and shall not be allowed to retain the risk on any one subject of insurance in excess of two and one-half percent of such aggregate insurance.

      (2) For purposes of this section, aggregate insurance is insurance which provides coverage in the event that the total fund of an insurance company, including a reciprocal insurance company, which is available to pay claims for occurrences of any one year, is exhausted. Aggregate insurance shall be in an amount equal to at least five times the annual premium collected by the insurance company.

      (3) A “subject of insurance” for the purposes of this section:

      (a) As to insurance against fire and hazards other than windstorm, earthquake and other catastrophic hazards, includes all properties insured by the same insurer that customarily are considered by underwriters to be subject to loss or damage from the same fire or the same occurrence of any other hazard insured against;

      (b) As to group life and health insurance, refers individually to each person benefited under the group policy as a separate subject; and

      (c) As to mortgage insurance, includes all obligations secured by real property in a single tract, or in multiple tracts not separated by at least one-half mile.

      (4) Reinsurance ceded as authorized by ORS 731.508 shall be deducted in determining risk retained. As to surety risks, deduction also shall be made of the amount assumed by any established incorporated cosurety and the value of any security deposited, pledged, or held subject to the surety’s consent and for the surety’s protection.

      (5) As to alien insurers, this section relates only to risks and surplus to policyholders of the insurer’s United States branch.

      (6) As used in this section, “surplus to policyholders,” in addition to the insurer’s capital and surplus, includes any voluntary reserves that are not required pursuant to law, includes the contingency reserve held for mortgage insurance as required by ORS 733.100, and shall be determined from the last sworn statement of the insurer on file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, or by the last report of examination of the insurer, whichever is the more recent at time of assumption of risk.

      (7) This section does not apply to wet marine and transportation insurance or to any policy or type of coverage as to which the maximum possible loss to the insurer is not readily ascertainable on issuance of the policy. [1967 c.359 §103; 1969 c.692 §3; 1975 c.796 §12]

 

      731.508 Approved reinsurance. (1) An insurer may accept reinsurance only of such risks, and retain risk thereon within such limits, as it is otherwise authorized to insure.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 731.512, 732.517 to 732.546 or 742.150 to 742.162, an insurer may reinsure risks with an insurer authorized to transact such insurance in this state, or in any other solvent insurer approved or accepted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services for the purpose of such reinsurance. The director shall not approve or accept any such reinsurance by a ceding domestic insurer in an unauthorized insurer which the director finds for good cause would be contrary to the interests of the policyholders or stockholders of such domestic insurer.

      (3) Credit shall not be allowed, as an asset or as a deduction from liability, to any ceding insurer for reinsurance unless the reinsurance contract provides, in substance, that in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer, the reinsurance shall be payable under a contract or contracts reinsured by the assuming insurer on the basis of reported claims allowed by the court hearing the liquidation proceeding, without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer. Such payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator except:

      (a) When the contract or other written agreement specifically provides another payee of the reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or

      (b) When the assuming insurer, with the consent of the direct insured or insureds, has assumed the policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees.

      (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the reinsurance agreement may provide that the domiciliary liquidator of an insolvent ceding insurer shall, within a reasonable time after the claim is filed in the liquidation proceeding, give written notice to the assuming insurer of the pendency of a claim against the ceding insurer on the contract reinsured. During the pendency of the claim, an assuming insurer may investigate the claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding in which the claim is to be adjudicated any defenses that the assuming insurer determines to be available to the ceding insurer or its liquidator. The expense may be filed as a claim against the insolvent ceding insurer to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit that may accrue to the ceding insurer solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the assuming insurer. When two or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose one or more defenses to the claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement as though the expense had been incurred by the ceding insurer.

      (5) The director may disallow credit that would otherwise be allowed if the director determines that allowing credit would be contrary to accurate financial reporting or proper financial management, or may be hazardous to policyholders of the insurer or the insurance-buying public generally. The director may make such a determination only according to standards established by the director by rule. This subsection applies only to insurers who transact life insurance or health insurance, or both.

      (6) Upon request of the director, a ceding insurer promptly shall inform the director in writing of the cancellation or any other material change of any of its reinsurance treaties or arrangements.

      (7) This section does not apply to wet marine and transportation insurance. [1967 c.359 §104; 1993 c.447 §68; 1995 c.30 §9; 1995 c.638 §1; 2001 c.318 §14]

 

      731.509 Legislative intent; criteria for allowing credit for reinsurance; rules. (1) The purpose of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 is to protect the interests of insureds, claimants, ceding insurers, assuming insurers and the public generally. The Legislative Assembly declares that the intent of the Legislative Assembly is to ensure adequate regulation of insurers and reinsurers and adequate protection for those to whom insurers and reinsurers owe obligations. In furtherance of that state interest, the Legislative Assembly mandates that upon the insolvency of an alien insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund the alien insurer’s or reinsurer’s United States obligations in accordance with ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the assets representing the security must be maintained in the United States and claims must be filed with and valued by the state insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight, and the assets must be distributed in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic United States insurers. The Legislative Assembly declares that the laws contained in ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1011 and 1012.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may not allow credit for reinsurance to a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded unless credit is allowed as provided under ORS 731.508 and unless the reinsurer meets the requirements of:

      (a) Subsection (4) of this section;

      (b) Subsection (5) of this section and ORS 731.511 (1);

      (c) Subsection (6) of this section;

      (d) Subsections (7) and (8) of this section;

      (e) ORS 731.511; or

      (f)(A) Subsection (9) of this section; and

      (B) Additional requirements that the director specifies by rule, which may include:

      (i) The valuation of assets or reserve credits;

      (ii) The amount and forms of security that support reinsurance arrangements; and

      (iii) The circumstances under which the director will reduce or eliminate credit.

      (3) The director shall allow credit under subsection (4), (5) or (6) of this section or under ORS 731.511 only with respect to cessions of the kinds or classes of business that the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in the state in which the assuming insurer is domiciled or, if the assuming insurer is an alien insurer, the state in which the assuming insurer is entered and is licensed or authorized to transact insurance or reinsurance. The director may allow credit under subsection (6) or (7) of this section only if the assuming insurer satisfies applicable requirements under subsection (10) of this section.

      (4) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an authorized assuming insurer that accepts reinsurance of risks and retains the risk of the reinsurance within such limits as the assuming insurer is otherwise authorized to insure in this state, as provided in ORS 731.508.

      (5) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state, as provided in ORS 731.511. The director may not allow credit to a domestic ceding insurer if the director has revoked accreditation of the assuming insurer after notice and opportunity for hearing.

      (6) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to a foreign assuming insurer or a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer meeting all of the following requirements:

      (a) The foreign assuming insurer must be domiciled in a state employing standards regarding credit for reinsurance that equal or exceed the standards applicable under this section. The United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must be entered through a state employing such standards.

      (b) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must maintain a combined capital and surplus in an amount not less than $20,000,000. The requirement of this paragraph does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.

      (c) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must submit to the authority of the director to examine the foreign assuming insurer’s or alien assuming insurer’s books and records.

      (7) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund meeting the requirements of this subsection and subsection (8) of this section and that also complies with other requirements of this subsection and subsection (8) of this section. The trust fund must be maintained in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in ORS 731.510 (1), for the payment of the valid claims of the assuming insurer’s United States policyholders and ceding insurers and the assigns and successors in interest of the policyholders and ceding insurers. The assuming insurer must report annually to the director information that is substantially the same as information authorized insurers must report on the annual statement form under ORS 731.574, in order to enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. The assuming insurer shall submit to the director’s examination of the assuming insurer’s books and records and shall pay to the director the expenses of the examination.

      (8) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurers:

      (a)(A) For a single assuming insurer, the trust fund must consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers. In addition, except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the assuming insurer must maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20,000,000.

      (B) At any time after the assuming insurer permanently discontinues underwriting, for at least three full years, new business that the trust secures, the commissioner that has principal regulatory oversight over the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after finding based on an assessment of the risk that the new required surplus level is adequate to protect United States ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and must consider all material risk factors, including, if applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer’s liquidity or solvency. The commissioner may not reduce the amount of the minimum required trusteed surplus below 30 percent of the assuming insurer’s liabilities that are attributable to reinsurance that United States ceding insurers covered by the trust have ceded.

      (b) For a group that includes incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:

      (A) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment or renewal date on or after August 1, 1995, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several liabilities attributable to business United States domiciled ceding insurers have ceded to any member of the group.

      (B) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States.

      (C) In addition to the trusts described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.

      (D) The incorporated members of the group may not engage in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and are subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

      (E) Within 90 days after the group’s financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if certification is unavailable, financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by independent certified public accountants.

      (c) For the group of incorporated insurers described in this paragraph, the trust must be in an amount equal to the group’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group. This paragraph applies to a group of incorporated insurers under common administration that complies with the annual reporting requirements contained in subsection (7) of this section and that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately before applying for accreditation. Such a group must have an aggregate policyholders’ surplus of $10,000,000,000 and must submit to the authority of this state to examine the group’s books and records and bear the expense of the examination. The group shall also maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities. Each member of the group shall make available to the director an annual certification of the member’s solvency by the member’s domiciliary regulator and the member’s independent certified public accountant.

      (d) The form of the trust and any amendment to the trust must be approved by the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled or by the insurance commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.

      (e) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also must be filed with the insurance commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument must provide that contested claims are valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust must vest legal title to the trust’s assets in the trust’s trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer’s United States ceding insurers and the assigns and successors in interest of the ceding insurers. The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination as determined by the director. The trust must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.

      (f) Not later than March 1 of each year, the trustees of each trust shall report to the director in writing the balance of the trust, list the trust’s investments at the preceding year end and certify the date of termination of the trust, if a termination is planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31.

      (9) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that does not meet the requirements of subsection (4), (5), (6) or (7) of this section or ORS 731.511 (1) or (4), but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions in which the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.

      (10) If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the director may not allow the credit permitted by subsections (6) and (7) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreement to the provisions stated in this subsection. This subsection does not conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate the parties’ disputes, if such an obligation is created in the agreement. The assuming insurer must agree in the reinsurance agreement:

      (a) That if the assuming insurer fails to perform the assuming insurer’s obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and

      (b) To designate the director or a designated attorney as the assuming insurer’s true and lawful attorney upon whom any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company may be served.

      (11) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to the Oregon Reinsurance Program established in section 18, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017.

      (12) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subsection (4), (5) or (6) of this section or ORS 731.511 (1) or (4), the director may not allow the credit permitted by subsection (7) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:

      (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because the trust fund contains an amount less than the applicable amount required by subsection (8)(a), (b) or (c) of this section, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of the grantor’s state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight all the assets of the trust fund.

      (b) The assets must be distributed by and claims must be filed with and valued by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that apply to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

      (c) If the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part of the assets is not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled shall return the assets or part of the assets in accordance with the laws of the state and the terms of the trust agreement that are consistent with the laws of the state.

      (d) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to the grantor under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection. [1993 c.447 §65; 1995 c.99 §1; 2001 c.318 §15; 2013 c.698 §§5,35; 2017 c.538 §23; 2019 c.151 §20]

 

      Note: The amendments to 731.509 by section 25, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017, become operative January 2, 2024. See section 46, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017. The text that is operative on and after January 2, 2024, including amendments by section 21, chapter 151, Oregon Laws 2019, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      731.509. (1) The purpose of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 is to protect the interests of insureds, claimants, ceding insurers, assuming insurers and the public generally. The Legislative Assembly declares that the intent of the Legislative Assembly is to ensure adequate regulation of insurers and reinsurers and adequate protection for those to whom insurers and reinsurers owe obligations. In furtherance of that state interest, the Legislative Assembly mandates that upon the insolvency of an alien insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund the alien insurer’s or reinsurer’s United States obligations in accordance with ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the assets representing the security must be maintained in the United States and claims must be filed with and valued by the state insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight, and the assets must be distributed in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic United States insurers. The Legislative Assembly declares that the laws contained in ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516 are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1011 and 1012.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may not allow credit for reinsurance to a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded unless credit is allowed as provided under ORS 731.508 and unless the reinsurer meets the requirements of:

      (a) Subsection (4) of this section;

      (b) Subsection (5) of this section and ORS 731.511 (1);

      (c) Subsection (6) of this section;

      (d) Subsections (7) and (8) of this section;

      (e) ORS 731.511; or

      (f)(A) Subsection (9) of this section; and

      (B) Additional requirements that the director specifies by rule, which may include:

      (i) The valuation of assets or reserve credits;

      (ii) The amount and forms of security that support reinsurance arrangements; and

      (iii) The circumstances under which the director will reduce or eliminate credit.

      (3) The director shall allow credit under subsection (4), (5) or (6) of this section or under ORS 731.511 only with respect to cessions of the kinds or classes of business that the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in the state in which the assuming insurer is domiciled or, if the assuming insurer is an alien insurer, the state in which the assuming insurer is entered and is licensed or authorized to transact insurance or reinsurance. The director may allow credit under subsection (6) or (7) of this section only if the assuming insurer satisfies applicable requirements under subsection (10) of this section.

      (4) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an authorized assuming insurer that accepts reinsurance of risks and retains the risk of the reinsurance within such limits as the assuming insurer is otherwise authorized to insure in this state, as provided in ORS 731.508.

      (5) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state as provided in ORS 731.511. The director may not allow credit to a domestic ceding insurer if the director has revoked accreditation of the assuming insurer after notice and opportunity for hearing.

      (6) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to a foreign assuming insurer or a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer meeting all of the following requirements:

      (a) The foreign assuming insurer must be domiciled in a state employing standards regarding credit for reinsurance that equal or exceed the standards applicable under this section. The United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must be entered through a state employing such standards.

      (b) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must maintain a combined capital and surplus in an amount not less than $20,000,000. The requirement of this paragraph does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.

      (c) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must submit to the authority of the director to examine the foreign assuming insurer’s or the alien assuming insurer’s books and records.

      (7) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund meeting the requirements of this subsection and subsection (8) of this section and that also complies with other requirements of this subsection and subsection (8) of this section. The trust fund must be maintained in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in ORS 731.510 (1), for the payment of the valid claims of the assuming insurer’s United States policyholders and ceding insurers and the assigns and successors in interest of the policyholders and ceding insurers. The assuming insurer must report annually to the director information that is substantially the same as information authorized insurers must report on the annual statement form under ORS 731.574, in order to enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. The assuming insurer shall submit to the director’s examination of the assuming insurer’s books and records and shall pay to the director the expenses of the examination.

      (8) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurers:

      (a)(A) For a single assuming insurer, the trust fund must consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers. In addition, except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the assuming insurer must maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20,000,000.

      (B) At any time after the assuming insurer permanently discontinues underwriting, for at least three full years, new business that the trust secures, the commissioner that has principal regulatory oversight over the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after finding based on an assessment of the risk that the new required surplus level is adequate to protect United States ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and must consider all material risk factors including, if applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer’s liquidity or solvency. The commissioner may not reduce the amount of the minimum required trusteed surplus below 30 percent of the assuming insurer’s liabilities that are attributable to reinsurance that United States ceding insurers covered by the trust have ceded.

      (b) For a group that includes incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:

      (A) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment or renewal date on or after August 1, 1995, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several liabilities attributable to business United States domiciled ceding insurers have ceded to any member of the group.

      (B) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States.

      (C) In addition to the trusts described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.

      (D) The incorporated members of the group may not engage in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and are subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

      (E) Within 90 days after the group’s financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if certification is unavailable, financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by independent certified public accountants.

      (c) For the group of incorporated insurers described in this paragraph, the trust must be in an amount equal to the group’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group. This paragraph applies to a group of incorporated insurers under common administration that complies with the annual reporting requirements contained in subsection (7) of this section and that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately before applying for accreditation. Such a group must have an aggregate policyholders’ surplus of $10,000,000,000 and must submit to the authority of this state to examine the group’s books and records and bear the expense of the examination. The group shall also maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities. Each member of the group shall make available to the director an annual certification of the member’s solvency by the member’s domiciliary regulator and the member’s independent certified public accountant.

      (d) The form of the trust and any amendment to the trust must be approved by the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled or by the insurance commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.

      (e) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also must be filed with the insurance commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument must provide that contested claims are valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust must vest legal title to the trust’s assets in the trust’s trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer’s United States ceding insurers and the assigns and successors in interest of the ceding insurers. The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination as determined by the director. The trust must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.

      (f) Not later than March 1 of each year, the trustees of each trust shall report to the director in writing the balance of the trust, list the trust’s investments at the preceding year end and certify the date of termination of the trust, if a termination is planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31.

      (9) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that does not meet the requirements of subsection (4), (5), (6) or (7) of this section or ORS 731.511 (1) or (4), but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions in which the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.

      (10) If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the director may not allow the credit permitted by subsections (6) and (7) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreement to the provisions stated in this subsection. This subsection does not conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate the parties’ disputes, if such an obligation is created in the agreement. The assuming insurer must agree in the reinsurance agreement:

      (a) That if the assuming insurer fails to perform the assuming insurer’s obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and

      (b) To designate the director or a designated attorney as the assuming insurer’s true and lawful attorney upon whom any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company may be served.

      (11) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subsection (4), (5) or (6) of this section or ORS 731.511 (1) or (4), the director may not allow the credit permitted by subsection (7) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:

      (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because the trust fund contains an amount less than the applicable amount required by subsection (8)(a), (b) or (c) of this section, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of the grantor’s state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight all the assets of the trust fund.

      (b) The assets must be distributed by and claims must be filed with and valued by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that apply to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

      (c) If the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part of the assets is not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled shall return the assets or part of the assets in accordance with the laws of the state and the terms of the trust agreement that are consistent with the laws of the state.

      (d) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to the grantor under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection.

 

      731.510 Criteria for allowing reduction from liability for reinsurance; rules. (1) Subject to the provisions of ORS 731.508 relating to allowance of credit for reinsurance, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall allow a reduction from liability for the reinsurance a domestic insurer cedes to a reinsurer that does not meet the requirements of ORS 731.509 in an amount that does not exceed the liabilities the ceding insurer carries, as provided in this section. The reduction must be in the amount of funds held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer, including funds a reinsurer holds in trust for the ceding insurer as security for payment of obligations under a reinsurance contract with the reinsurer, if the security:

      (a) Is held in the United States subject to withdrawal solely by and under the exclusive control of the ceding insurer; or

      (b) In the case of a trust, is held in a qualified United States financial institution. For purposes of this paragraph, a qualified United States financial institution is an institution that:

      (A) Is organized, or, in the case of a United States branch or agency office of a foreign banking organization, is licensed, under the laws of the United States or any state and has been granted authority to operate with fiduciary powers; and

      (B) Is regulated, supervised and examined by federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies.

      (2) The security for purposes of subsection (1) of this section may be in any of the following forms:

      (a) Cash.

      (b) Securities listed by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and qualifying as allowed assets.

      (c) Clean, irrevocable, unconditional letters of credit, issued or confirmed by a qualified United States financial institution, effective not later than December 31 of the year for which filing is being made, and in the possession of, or in trust for, the ceding company on or before the filing date of the ceding company’s annual statement. Letters of credit issued or confirmed by an institution meeting applicable standards of issuer acceptability as of the dates of issuance or confirmation of the letters of credit are acceptable as security, notwithstanding the subsequent failure of the issuing or confirming institution to meet applicable standards of issuer acceptability, until the letters of credit expire or are extended, renewed, modified or amended, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this paragraph, a qualified United States financial institution is an institution that:

      (A) Is organized or, in the case of a United States office of a foreign banking organization, is licensed, under the laws of the United States or any state;

      (B) Is regulated, supervised and examined by United States federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies; and

      (C) Has been determined by the director to meet such standards of financial condition and standing as are considered necessary and appropriate to regulate the quality of financial institutions whose letters of credit will be acceptable to the director. For the purpose of making a determination under this subparagraph, the director shall consider and may accept determinations made by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as to whether a financial institution meets the office’s standards of financial conditions and standing.

      (d) Any other form of security acceptable to the director.

      (3) The director by rule may specify additional requirements for:

      (a) Valuing assets or reserve credits;

      (b) Setting the amount and forms of security to support reinsurance arrangements; and

      (c) The circumstances under which the director will reduce or eliminate credit.

      (4) In addition to the authority of the director described in subsection (3) of this section, the director by rule may adopt guidelines, rules, regulations or interpretive letters from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that apply to reinsurance collateral requirements for alien reinsurers. [1993 c.447 §66; 2001 c.318 §16; 2019 c.151 §22]

 

      731.511 Criteria to be met by assuming insurer in order to be accredited as reinsurer; rules. (1) For purposes of allowing credit to a ceding domestic insurer under ORS 731.509 if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state, an insurer may be accredited as a reinsurer in this state if the insurer:

      (a) Files and maintains with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services evidence of the insurer’s submission to the jurisdiction of this state;

      (b) Submits to the authority of the director to examine the insurer’s books and records;

      (c) Is authorized or licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through and authorized or licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state;

      (d) Files annually with the director a copy of the insurer’s annual statement filed with the insurance department of the insurer’s state of domicile and a copy of the insurer’s most recent audited financial statement; and

      (e) Satisfies either of the following requirements:

      (A) Maintains combined capital and surplus in an amount that is not less than $20,000,000.

      (B) Maintains combined capital and surplus in an amount less than $20,000,000. An insurer applying for accreditation who maintains the amount of combined capital and surplus specified in this subparagraph is not accredited until the application for accreditation is approved by the director.

      (2) An insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state may accept reinsurance only of those risks and retain the risk of the reinsurance within such limits as the accredited reinsurer is otherwise authorized to insure directly in a state in which the accredited reinsurer is authorized or licensed to transact insurance.

      (3) The director may revoke the accreditation of an assuming insurer if the director determines that the assuming insurer has failed to continue to meet any of the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.

      (4)(a) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that the director certifies has:

      (A) Maintained a minimum amount of capital and a surplus, or the equivalent, in an amount the director specifies by rule;

      (B) Maintained a financial strength rating from two or more rating agencies that the director by rule deems acceptable for this purpose;

      (C) Agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the state, to appoint the director as the assuming insurer’s agent for the service of process in this state and to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer’s liabilities that are attributable to reinsurance that ceding insurers have ceded, if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a United States judgment;

      (D) Agreed to meet applicable information filing requirements that the director specifies by rule;

      (E) Included a covenant in the language of any trust the assuming insurer maintains to secure the assuming insurer’s obligations under ORS 731.509 (8), and in the language of an agreement between the assuming insurer and the commissioner with principal regulatory authority over the assuming insurer, that requires the assuming insurer to fund out of the remaining surplus of the trust any deficiency in a trust account that terminates; and

      (F) Satisfied any other requirements that the director specifies for certification.

      (b) The director may accredit an association as a reinsurer, including an incorporated underwriter or individual unincorporated underwriters, if the association, the incorporated underwriter or the individual unincorporated underwriter, as appropriate, meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection and, in addition:

      (A) Satisfies minimum capital and surplus requirements by means of the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, of the association and the association’s members, which must include a joint central fund with an amount that the director determines is adequate to satisfy any unsatisfied obligation of the association or a member of the association;

      (B) Does not engage, as an incorporated member of the association, in any business other than underwriting and is subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control as the association’s unincorporated members are under the association’s domiciliary regulator; and

      (5)(a) The director shall publish a list of jurisdictions that the director considers qualified for the purpose of accrediting as a reinsurer an assuming insurer that is licensed and domiciled in the jurisdiction.

      (b) To determine whether a domiciliary jurisdiction outside the United States is qualified for the purpose described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director shall:

      (A) Evaluate and monitor how appropriate and effective the jurisdiction’s insurance supervisory system is and the extent to which the jurisdiction affords reinsurers that are licensed and domiciled in the United States rights, benefits and reciprocal recognition;

      (B) Require that the jurisdiction share information and cooperate with the director in any matter that concerns a reinsurer that the director accredits and that is domiciled within the jurisdiction;

      (C) Refuse to accredit a jurisdiction if the jurisdiction does not promptly and adequately enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards; and

      (D) Consider other criteria the director deems appropriate.

      (c) To determine whether a domiciliary jurisdiction inside the United States is qualified for the purpose described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director shall:

      (A) Consider the list of qualified jurisdictions that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners publishes and, if the director accredits a jurisdiction that does not appear on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ list, justify the director’s accreditation with appropriate documentation in accordance with rules the director adopts for this purpose; and

      (B) Accredit United States jurisdictions that meet the requirements of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ financial standards and accreditation program.

      (d) If an assuming insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to qualify under paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection, the director may suspend indefinitely the assuming insurer’s accreditation as a reinsurer.

      (6)(a) The director by rule shall designate rating agencies upon which the director will rely for financial strength ratings for accredited reinsurers and shall give appropriate consideration to the rating agencies’ financial strength ratings in assigning ratings to each accredited reinsurer. The director shall publish a list of the accredited reinsurers together with the director’s corresponding rating for each.

      (b) An accredited reinsurer shall secure obligations the accredited reinsurer assumes from ceding insurers at a level that is consistent with the rating the director assigns and in accordance with rules the director adopts.

      (7)(a) In order for a ceding domestic insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance that the ceding domestic insurer cedes to an accredited reinsurer, the accredited reinsurer must maintain security in a form that is acceptable to the director and that is consistent with the requirements of ORS 731.510 or maintain security in a trust fund in accordance with ORS 731.509 (8), except as otherwise provided in this section.

      (b) If an accredited reinsurer maintains a trust fund to fully secure the accredited reinsurer’s obligations under ORS 731.509 (8) and the trust fund is a multibeneficiary trust, the accredited reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for the obligations the accredited reinsurer incurs under reinsurance agreements the accredited reinsurer issued or renewed as an accredited reinsurer with reduced security, as provided under this section or under comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions, and for obligations the accredited reinsurer incurs that are subject to ORS 731.509 (8).

      (c) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements under ORS 731.509 (8) do not apply to an accredited reinsurer that maintains a multibeneficiary trust for the purpose of securing obligations under this subsection, except that the trust must maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $100,000,000.

      (8) The director shall reduce the allowable credit for ceding insurers by an amount that is proportionate to any deficiency in the security required for an accredited reinsurer under this section. The director may also reduce the allowable credit further if the director finds that a material risk exists that the accredited reinsurer will not pay the accredited reinsurer’s obligations in full when due.

      (9)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the director shall require an accredited reinsurer that has become inactive or has voluntarily surrendered accreditation as an accredited reinsurer, or for which the director has revoked or suspended accreditation, to secure 100 percent of the reinsurer’s obligations.

      (b) The security requirement described in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to an accredited reinsurer that is inactive, or for which the director has suspended accreditation, if the director maintains a high rating for the reinsurer under subsection (6) of this section.

      (10) The director may accredit an assuming insurer as a reinsurer in this state if a jurisdiction that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has qualified as meeting the association’s financial standards and accreditation has certified the assuming insurer as a reinsurer. The director may also assign to the accredited reinsurer the rating that the qualifying jurisdiction assigned to the accredited reinsurer.

      (11) An accredited reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may apply to the director to become inactive and to qualify for a reduction in security for the business the accredited reinsurer maintains. An inactive accredited reinsurer shall comply with all other applicable requirements of this section and the director shall assign a rating to the accredited reinsurer that accounts for the reasons that the accredited reinsurer is not assuming new business, if the reasons are relevant to the rating.

      (12)(a) The director may suspend or revoke an assuming insurer’s accreditation as a reinsurer in this state if the assuming insurer fails to meet applicable requirements for accreditation.

      (b) The director shall give an accredited reinsurer notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking action under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a suspension or revocation is not effective until after the director’s final order unless:

      (A) The accredited reinsurer waives the opportunity for a hearing;

      (B) The director bases the final order on regulatory action by the accredited reinsurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction or on the accredited reinsurer’s having voluntarily surrendered or terminated the accredited reinsurer’s authorization to transact insurance or reinsurance in the domiciliary jurisdiction or in a jurisdiction whose certification of the reinsurer formed the basis upon which the director accredited the reinsurer in this state under subsection (10) of this section; or

      (C) The director finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court does not stay the director’s action.

      (13) A reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the director suspends an accredited reinsurer’s certification does not qualify for credit unless the reinsurer secures the reinsurer’s obligations in accordance with ORS 731.510. The director may not grant credit for reinsurance after the effective date of the director’s revocation of accreditation unless the reinsurer secures the reinsurer’s obligations in accordance with subsections (6), (7) and (9) of this section or ORS 731.510.

      (14) The director may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section including, but not limited to, rules that adopt guidelines, rules, regulations or interpretive letters from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that apply to reinsurance collateral requirements for alien reinsurers. [1993 c.447 §67; 2019 c.151 §23]

 

      731.512 Withdrawal of insurer; reinsurance. (1) No insurer shall withdraw from this state until its direct liability to its policyholders and obligees under all its insurance policies then in force in this state has been assumed by another authorized insurer under an agreement approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. In the case of a life insurer, its liability pursuant to policies issued in this state in settlement of proceeds under its policies shall likewise be so assumed.

      (2) The director may waive this requirement if the director finds upon examination that a withdrawing insurer then is fully solvent and that the protection to be given its policyholders in this state will not be impaired by the waiver.

      (3) The assuming insurer within a reasonable time shall replace the assumed insurance policies with its own, or by indorsement thereon acknowledge its liability thereunder.

      (4) This section is in addition to the requirements of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 and 742.150 to 742.162. [1967 c.359 §105; 1995 c.30 §10]

 

      731.514 Ceding insurer’s management of reinsurance recoverables; requirement to diversify reinsurance program. (1) A ceding insurer shall manage the ceding insurer’s reinsurance recoverables in proportion to the ceding insurer’s book of business. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services within 30 days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers exceeds or is likely to exceed 50 percent of the domestic ceding insurer’s surplus, as last reported to the ceding insurer’s policyholders. In the notification, the domestic ceding insurer shall demonstrate that the domestic ceding insurer is safely managing the exposure.

      (2) A ceding insurer shall diversify the ceding insurer’s reinsurance program. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the director within 30 days after ceding to any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers more than 20 percent of the ceding insurer’s gross written premium in the previous calendar year or after determining that the ceded reinsurance will likely exceed this percentage. In the notification, the domestic ceding insurer shall demonstrate that the domestic ceding insurer is safely managing the exposure. [2019 c.151 §2]

 

      731.516 Mortgage insurance limitation; waiver of limitation; rules; fees.

      (3)(a) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may waive the requirement in subsection (2) of this section in response to the request of a mortgage insurer if the director finds that the mortgage insurer’s policyholders’ position is reasonable in relation to the mortgage insurer’s aggregate insured risk and adequate to the mortgage insurer’s financial needs.

      (b) The request of the mortgage insurer must be made in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the mortgage insurer expects to exceed the policyholders’ position allowed by subsection (2) of this section, and shall at a minimum address the factors set forth in subsection (4) of this section that the director may use in making a decision on the waiver request.

      (4) In determining whether a mortgage insurer’s requested policyholders’ position is reasonable in relation to the mortgage insurer’s aggregate insured risk and adequate to the mortgage insurer’s financial needs, the director may consider the following factors:

      (a) The size of the mortgage insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria.

      (b) The extent to which the mortgage insurer’s business is diversified across time, geography, credit quality, origination and distribution channels.

      (c) The nature and extent of the mortgage insurer’s reinsurance program.

      (i) The quality of the mortgage insurer’s earnings and the extent to which the reported earnings of the mortgage insurer include extraordinary items.

      (j) An independent actuary’s opinion as to the reasonableness and adequacy of the mortgage insurer’s historical and projected policyholders’ position.

      (k) The capital contributions that have been invested or are available for future investment in the mortgage insurer.

      (L) The historical and projected trends in the components of the mortgage insurer’s aggregate insured risk including, but not limited to, the quality and type of the risks included in the aggregate insured risk.

      (m) Any other factors the director believes are relevant in making a decision on the request.

      (5) The director may retain accountants, actuaries or other experts to assist the director in the review of the mortgage insurer’s request submitted under subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) Any waiver granted by the director under subsection (3) of this section is:

      (a) In effect for a specified period of time, not to exceed two years. The mortgage insurer may request an extension of the waiver for a period not exceeding two additional years, and the director shall review the extension request based upon the factors set forth in subsection (4) of this section.

      (b) Subject to any terms and conditions that the director considers necessary to restore the mortgage insurer’s policyholders’ position to 25 or lower as required by subsection (2) of this section.

      (7) The director may adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section.

      (8) The director shall charge a fee for a waiver request under this section designed to reimburse the Department of Consumer and Business Services for all costs incurred by the department in reviewing the waiver request. [1969 c.692 §5; 1977 c.600 §1; 2010 c.46 §1]

In developing such standards, the director shall consider model standards adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. For the purpose of determining the reasonableness and adequacy of an insurer’s capital and surplus, the director must consider at least the following factors, as applicable:

      731.574 Annual financial statement.

      (2) If an insurer has reason to believe that criminal conduct involving insurance has been, is being or is about to be committed, the insurer shall notify the appropriate agency of that fact.

      731.608 Purpose of deposit. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, deposits made in this state under ORS 731.624 shall be held for the faithful performance by the insurer of all insurance obligations, including claims for unearned premiums, with respect to domestic risks pertaining to the particular class of insurance for which the deposit was made. However, there shall be excluded from each such obligation the same amount as is excluded in determining the obligation of the Oregon Insurance Guaranty Association under ORS 734.510 to 734.710.

      (2) If at any time a deposit made under ORS 731.624 by a particular insurer is insufficient to perform the insurance obligations upon the faithful performance of which the deposit was conditioned, then any other deposit made under ORS 731.624 by that insurer shall be so used to the extent that such other deposit is not used to perform the insurance obligations upon the faithful performance of which such other deposit was conditioned.

      (3) Deposits made by insurers and reinsurers in this state under ORS 731.628 shall be held for the payment of compensation benefits to workers employed by insured employers other than those insured with the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation to whom the insurer has issued a workers’ compensation insurance policy under ORS chapter 656. Deposits made by insurers and reinsurers under ORS 731.628 also shall be held to reimburse the Department of Consumer and Business Services, subject to approval by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, for costs incurred by the department in processing workers’ compensation claims of insurers which have been placed in liquidation, receivership, rehabilitation or other such status for the orderly conservation or distribution of assets, pursuant to the laws of this state or any other state.

      (1) Demand, receive, sue for and recover the income from the assets deposited;

      (2) Exchange and substitute for the deposited assets, or any part thereof, other eligible assets of equivalent or greater value; and

      (3) At any reasonable time inspect such deposit. [1967 c.359 §114]

      (3) If for any reason the current market value of such assets falls below the amount of deposit required of the insurer, the insurer shall promptly deposit other or additional assets eligible for deposit in an amount sufficient to cure the deficiency. The insurer has 30 days in which to cure the deficiency after notice thereof from the director. [1967 c.359 §115]

(1) Within 30 days after a district attorney or the Attorney General serves on an insurer a written request by certified mail for disclosure of an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document, the insurer that prepared or caused the document to be prepared may file in circuit court a petition requesting an in camera hearing on whether the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document or portions of the document are privileged under ORS 731.761 or subject to disclosure. Failure by the insurer to file a petition waives the privilege only with respect to the specific request.

      (2) A petition filed by an insurer under this section must contain the following information:

      (a) The date of the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document.

      (b) The identity of the person that conducted the audit.

      (c) The general nature of the activities covered by the insurance compliance audit.

      (d) An identification of the portions of the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document for which the privilege is being asserted.

      (3) Within 45 days after the filing of a petition by an insurer under this section, the court shall schedule an in camera hearing to determine whether the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document or portions of the document are privileged under ORS 731.761.

      (4) The court, after an in camera review pursuant to this section, may require disclosure of material for which the privilege established by ORS 731.761 is asserted if the court determines that any of the conditions set forth in ORS 731.764 are met. Upon making such a determination, the court may compel the disclosure of only those portions of an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document relevant to issues in dispute in the underlying proceeding. Any disclosure that is compelled by the court will not be considered to be a public document or be deemed to be a waiver of the privilege for any other civil, criminal or administrative proceeding. A party unsuccessfully opposing disclosure may apply to the court for an appropriate order protecting the document from further disclosure.

      (5) An insurer asserting the privilege established under ORS 731.761 has the burden of establishing that the privilege applies. If the insurer establishes that the privilege applies, a party seeking disclosure under ORS 731.764 has the burden of proving the elements set forth in ORS 731.764. [2001 c.329 §6]

 

      731.768 Privilege; exceptions. The privilege established under ORS 731.761 does not apply to any of the following:

      (1) Documents, communications, data, reports or other information expressly required to be collected, developed, maintained or reported to a regulatory agency under the Insurance Code or other state or federal law;

      (2) Information obtained by observation or monitoring by any regulatory agency; or

      (3) Information obtained from a source other than the insurance compliance audit. [2001 c.329 §7]

 

      731.770 Other privileges or limitations pertaining to audit document. Nothing in ORS 731.760 to 731.770, or in the release of any insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document under ORS 731.760 to 731.770, shall limit, waive or abrogate the scope or nature of any statutory or common law privilege or other limitation on admissibility of evidence including, but not limited to, the work product doctrine, the lawyer-client privilege under ORS 40.225 or the subsequent remedial measures exclusion provided by ORS 40.185. [2001 c.329 §8]

 

ASSESSMENTS, FEES AND TAXES

 

      731.804 Assessments; rules; fees; how determined. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, each authorized insurer doing business in this state shall pay assessments that the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines are necessary to support the legislatively authorized budget of the Department of Consumer and Business Services with respect to functions of the department under the Insurance Code. The director shall determine the assessments according to one or more percentage rates established by the director by rule. The director shall specify in the rule when assessments shall be made and payments shall be due. The premium-weighted average of the percentage rates may not exceed nine-hundredths of one percent of the gross amount of premiums received by an insurer or the insurer’s insurance producers from and under the insurer’s policies covering direct domestic risks, after deducting the amount of return premiums paid and the amount of dividend payments made to policyholders with respect to such policies. In the case of reciprocal insurers, the amount of savings paid or credited to the accounts of subscribers shall be deducted from the gross amount of premiums. In establishing the percentage rate or rates, the director shall use the most recent premium data approved by the director. In establishing the amounts to be collected under this subsection, the director shall take into consideration the expenses of the department for administering the Insurance Code and the fees collected under subsection (2) of this section. When the director establishes two or more percentage rates:

      (a) Each rate shall be based on such expenses of the department ascribed by the director to the line of insurance for which the rate is established.

      (b) Each rate shall be applied to the gross amount of premium received by an insurer or its insurance producers for the applicable line of insurance as provided in this subsection.

      (2) The director may collect fees for specific services provided by the department under the Insurance Code according to a schedule of fees established by the director by rule. The director may collect such fees in advance. In establishing the schedule for fees, the director shall take into consideration the cost of each service for which a fee is imposed.

      (3)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 743A.067 (7)(e) and 743A.067 (9), for the purpose of mitigating inequity in the health insurance market, the director may assess a fee on any insurer that offers a health benefit plan, as defined in ORS 743B.005, that is exempt from a provision of ORS chapter 743A or other provision of the Insurance Code that requires specified coverage by health benefit plans.

      (b) Any fees collected under paragraph (a) of this subsection must be the actuarial equivalent of costs attributed to the provision and administration of the required coverage by an insurer that is not exempt.

      (c) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the director to enforce the provisions of ORS chapter 743A if an insurer unlawfully fails to comply.

      (d) Notwithstanding ORS 646A.628, fees paid in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be deposited in the General Fund to become available for general governmental expenses.

      (4) Establishment and amendment of the schedule of fees under subsection (2) of this section are subject to prior approval of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and a report to the Emergency Board prior to adopting the fees and shall be within the budget authorized by the Legislative Assembly as that budget may be modified by the Emergency Board.

      (5) The director may not collect an assessment under subsection (1) of this section from any of the following persons:

      (a) A fraternal benefit society complying with ORS chapter 748.

      (b) Any person or class of persons designated by the director by rule.

      (6) The director may not collect an assessment under subsection (1) of this section with respect to premiums received from any of the following policies:

      (a) Workers’ compensation insurance policies.

      (b) Wet marine and transportation insurance policies.

      (c) Any category of policies designated by the director by rule. [1967 c.359 §131; 1971 c.231 §14; 1971 c.425 §7; 1983 c.94 §1; 1985 c.697 §17; 1987 c.373 §81; 1989 c.331 §24; 1989 c.413 §1; 1991 c.371 §1; 1991 c.703 §40; 1991 c.958 §5; 1993 c.265 §5; 2003 c.364 §75; 2005 c.31 §7; 2007 c.560 §1; 2019 c.285 §4]

 

      731.808 “Gross amount of premiums” defined. As used in ORS 731.804, 731.812, 731.820, 731.830 and 731.834, “gross amount of premiums” means the consideration paid by insureds to an insurer for policies of insurance, and includes all premiums, assessments, dues and fees received or derived, or obligations taken therefor, by whatever term known. [1967 c.359 §132; 1989 c.413 §5; 2019 c.493 §4]

 

      731.812 Foreign and alien insurer’s report of Oregon business.

[1967 c.359 §133; 2003 c.364 §76]

 

      731.816 [1967 c.359 §134; 1971 c.560 §1; 1989 c.700 §5; repealed by 1995 c.786 §1]

 

      731.820 Gross premium tax on fire insurance premiums. (1)(a) For the purpose of maintaining the office of State Fire Marshal and paying the expenses incident thereto, every insurer transacting insurance covering the peril of fire shall pay a tax to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, on or before April 1 of each year, equal to 1.15 percent of the gross amount of premiums received by it or its insurance producers from such business, from and under its policies covering direct domestic risks in the preceding calendar year after deducting the amount of return premiums paid and the amount of dividend payments made to policyholders or, in the case of a reciprocal insurer, the amount of savings paid or credited to the accounts of subscribers, with respect to such policies.

      (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this subsection the following portions of the amounts required to be reported by line of business in the annual financial statement required by ORS 731.574 shall be considered premiums for insurance covering the peril of fire:

      (A) Fire, 100 percent.

      (B) Homeowners and farm owners multiple peril, 65 percent.

      (C) Commercial multiple peril, 50 percent.

      (D) Inland marine, 20 percent.

      (E) Automobile physical damage, eight percent.

      (F) Aircraft physical damage, eight percent.

      (2) If an insurer ceases to do business or collect premiums on direct domestic risks, it thereupon shall make a report to the director of its premiums subject to taxation as provided in subsection (1) of this section and collected or due as of the date when it ceased to do business or collect premiums on direct domestic risks, and not theretofore reported, and shall forthwith pay to the director the tax thereon.

      (3) If the director, during the period in which the director under ORS 731.836 may collect taxes owing under this section, finds the amount of such taxes paid by an insurer to have been incorrect, the director shall charge or credit the insurer with the difference between the correct amount of tax and the amount actually paid. [1967 c.359 §135; 1967 c.453 §4; 1971 c.231 §15; 1975 c.275 §1; 1983 c.130 §1; 1989 c.700 §6; 2003 c.364 §77; 2013 c.191 §1]

 

      731.822 Prepayment of tax due. (1) Every insurer with a tax obligation under section 2, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, ORS 731.820 or ORS 731.854 and 731.859 shall make prepayment of the tax obligations under section 2, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, ORS 731.820, 731.854 and 731.859 for the current calendar year’s business, if the sum of the tax obligations under section 2, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, ORS 731.820, 731.854 and 731.859 for the preceding calendar year’s business is $400 or more.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall credit the prepayment toward the appropriate tax obligations of the insurer for the current calendar year under section 2, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, or ORS 731.820 or ORS 731.854 and 731.859.

      (3) The amounts of the prepayments shall be percentages of the insurer’s tax obligation based on the preceding calendar year’s business adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the declining percentages set forth in section 2 (3), chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, applicable for the current year, and shall be paid to the director by the due dates and in the following amounts:

      (a) On or before June 15, 45 percent;

      (b) On or before September 15, 25 percent; and

      (c) On or before December 15, 25 percent.

      (4) The effect of transferring policies of insurance from one insurer to another insurer is to transfer the tax prepayment obligation with respect to such policies.

      (5) On or before June 1 of each year, the director shall notify each insurer required to make prepayments in that year of the amount of each prepayment, and shall provide remittance forms to be used by the insurer. However, an insurer’s responsibility to make prepayments is not affected by failure of the director to send, or the insurer to receive, the notice or forms. [1980 c.10 §2; 1995 c.786 §5]

 

      731.824 Tax on underwriting profits of wet marine and transportation insurers. (1) Wet marine and transportation insurance written by authorized foreign or alien insurers within this state shall be taxed only on that proportion of the total underwriting profit of the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance written within the United States that the gross premiums of the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance written within this state bear to the gross premiums of the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance written within the United States.

      (2) The “underwriting profit,” for purposes of this section, is arrived at by deducting from the net earned premiums on wet marine and transportation insurance policies written within the United States during the calendar year:

      (a) The losses incurred; and

      (b) Expenses incurred, including all taxes, state and federal, in connection with net earned premiums.

      (3) The amount of “net earned premiums” on wet marine and transportation insurance policies written during the calendar year is the sum of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection less paragraph (c) of this subsection:

      (a) Gross premiums on wet marine and transportation insurance policies written during the calendar year, less any and all return premiums, any and all premiums on policies not taken and any and all premiums paid for reinsurance.

      (b) Unearned premiums on outstanding marine business at the end of the preceding calendar year.

      (c) Unearned premiums on outstanding marine business at the end of the current calendar year.

      (4) “Losses incurred,” as used in this section, means gross losses incurred during the calendar year under policies written within the United States, less reinsurance claims collected or collectible and salvages or recoveries collectible from any source applicable to the losses.

      (5) “Expenses incurred” includes:

      (a) Specific expenses incurred on earned wet marine and transportation insurance premiums, consisting of all commissions, agency expenses, taxes, licenses, fees, loss-adjustment expenses, and all other expenses incurred directly and specifically in connection with the premiums, less recoveries or reimbursements on account of or in connection with commissions or other expenses collected or collectible because of reinsurance or from any other source.

      (b) General expenses incurred on earned premiums, consisting of that proportion of general or overhead expenses, such as salaries of officers and employees, printing and stationery, all taxes of this state and of the United States, except as otherwise provided in this section, and all other expenses not chargeable specifically to a particular class of insurance, that the net premiums of insurance written bear to the total net premiums written by an authorized insurer from all classes of insurance written by the authorized insurer during the current calendar year. However, in arriving at the “underwriting profit” for purposes of taxation under this section there may not be deducted in respect to expenses incurred, as defined and specified in this subsection, amounts that, in the aggregate, exceed 40 percent of the gross premiums on the insurance policies. [Formerly 745.145; 2019 c. 493 §1]

 

      731.828 Computation of wet marine and transportation insurance tax. (1) Each authorized insurer transacting wet marine and transportation insurance in this state shall file annually on or before June 15 with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and in the form prescribed by the director, a report of all the items pertaining to the authorized insurer’s insurance business as enumerated and prescribed in ORS 731.824.

      (2) Each authorized insurer that has written wet marine and transportation insurance in this state for three years shall furnish to the director a statement of all of the items referred to in subsection (1) of this section, in the form prescribed by the director, for each of the preceding three calendar years. An authorized insurer that has not written wet marine and transportation insurance for three years shall furnish to the director a statement of all items for each of the calendar years during which the authorized insurer has written wet marine and transportation insurance.

      (3) On or before June 15 of each year, if the authorized insurer has transacted wet marine and transportation insurance for three years, the authorized insurer shall:

      (a) Ascertain the average annual underwriting profit, as provided in ORS 731.824, derived by the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance business written within the United States during the last preceding three calendar years.

      (b) Ascertain the proportion that the average annual premiums of the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance written by the authorized insurer in this state during the last preceding three calendar years bears to the average total of wet marine and transportation insurance premiums of the authorized insurer during the same three years.

      (c) Pay five percent on this proportion of the average annual underwriting profit of the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance to the director as a tax upon the insurance written by the authorized insurer in this state during the current calendar year.

      (4) The authorized insurer each year shall compute the tax, according to the method described in this section, upon the authorized insurer’s average annual underwriting profit from wet marine and transportation insurance during the preceding three years, including the current calendar year. At the expiration of each current calendar year, the profit or loss on wet marine and transportation insurance business of that year is to be added or deducted, and the profit or loss upon the insurance business of the first calendar year of the preceding three-year period is to be dropped so that the computation of underwriting profit for purposes of taxation under this section will always be on a three-year average.

      (5) An authorized insurer that has not written wet marine and transportation insurance in this state for three years shall, until the authorized insurer has transacted wet marine and transportation insurance in this state for three years, be taxed on the basis of the authorized insurer’s annual underwriting profit on wet marine and transportation insurance written within the United States for the current calendar year, subject, however, to an adjustment in the tax as soon as the authorized insurer, in accordance with the provisions of this section, is enabled to compute the tax on the three-year basis.

      (6) In the case of authorized mutual insurers, the authorized insurer may not include in the underwriting profit, when computing the tax prescribed by this section, the amounts refunded by the mutual insurers on account of premiums previously paid by the policyholders of the mutual insurers.

      (7) If the director, during the period in which the director under ORS 731.836 may collect taxes owing under this section, finds the amount of taxes paid by an authorized insurer to have been incorrect, the director shall charge or credit the authorized insurer with the difference between the correct amount of tax and the amount actually paid.

      (8) If an authorized insurer ceases to transact wet marine and transportation insurance in this state, the authorized insurer shall report to the director the items the authorized insurer has not previously reported pertaining to the insurance business, as enumerated and described in this section, to the date on which the authorized insurer ceased to transact wet marine and transportation insurance, and shall forthwith pay to the director the taxes computed according to this section and the annual authorization fees thereon.

An insurance producer shall pay to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services a premium tax that is equal to three-fourths of one percent of the gross amount of premiums the insurance producer receives for wet marine and transportation insurance that the insurance producer places with unauthorized or nonadmitted insurers if the insured’s home state is Oregon. [2019 c.493 §6]

 

      731.832 [Formerly 736.175; 1987 c.373 §82; repealed by 1995 c.786 §4]

The record must include a copy of the policy, certificate, cover note or other evidence of insurance that the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services specifies by rule.

      (2) A producer shall keep the record described in subsection (1) of this section open at all reasonable times to the director’s examination, without notice, for a period of not less than five years after termination of the nonadmitted wet marine and transportation insurance contract. [2019 c.493 §7]

 

      731.834 Insurance producer’s collection of taxes on wet marine and transportation insurance; report to director; rules. (1) An insurance producer that places wet marine and transportation insurance with a nonadmitted insurer shall collect taxes on the insurance in addition to the gross amount of premiums the insurance producer and other intermediaries charge. If an insurance producer collects taxes under this subsection, the insurance producer shall return directly to the policyholder the taxes that the state credited to the licensee on any portion of the premium that is unearned at the termination of the insurance. The insurance producer may not absorb the taxes or rebate any part of the taxes for any reason.

      (2) Each producer of nonadmitted wet marine and transportation insurance shall file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, in accordance with the director’s prescription, a verified report of any Oregon home state risk nonadmitted wet marine and transportation insurance the producer transacted during the previous 90 days and shall accompany the report with payment of the tax due on each transaction. The report need not show transacted insurance that the producer filed in an earlier report. The report must show:

      (a) Gross amount of premiums or return premium; and

      (b) The amount of the tax.

      (3) The director may require insurance producers to file the report described in subsection (2) of this section on a form the director specifies or on a form that the Surplus Line Association of Oregon prescribes. If the director specifies that a producer must file the report on a Surplus Line Association of Oregon form, the association shall file the report with the director. The director may also permit electronic filing and may exempt a licensee from the requirement to file for good cause shown.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if an insurance producer’s license is terminated or not renewed for any reason, the taxes described in this section are due on the 30th day after the termination or nonrenewal.

      (5) The director by rule may establish requirements for filing reports on nonadmitted wet marine and transportation insurance transacted outside this state on Oregon home state risks for the purpose of collecting taxes on insurance that covers Oregon home state risks that is placed outside this state.

      (6) The director may collect taxes on 100 percent of the gross amount of premiums on Oregon home state risks for the purposes of carrying out the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-203, Title V, Subtitle B). If the director enters into a compact or otherwise establishes procedures with other states under ORS 735.418, the director by rule shall establish procedures to facilitate reporting, collecting, paying, allocating and disbursing premium taxes on Oregon home state risks that also include risks that are allocable to other states.

      (7) If an insurance producer does not pay within the prescribed time a tax the producer must collect under this section, the director may bring an action against the insurance producer to recover the amount of the unpaid tax. [2019 c.493 §8]

 

      731.836 Limitation on enforcement of insurer’s tax obligations. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall commence an action for the recovery of taxes payable under ORS 731.820, 731.824, 731.828 and 731.859 not later than the later of the following:

      (1) Five years after the date such taxes were payable to the director under such sections; or

      731.840 Retaliatory or corporate excise tax in lieu of certain taxes and assessments; certain local taxes prohibited. (1) The retaliatory tax imposed upon a foreign or alien insurer under ORS 731.854 and 731.859, or the corporate excise tax imposed upon a foreign or alien insurer under ORS chapter 317, is in lieu of all other state taxes upon premiums, taxes upon income, franchise or other taxes measured by income that might otherwise be imposed upon the foreign or alien insurer except the fire insurance premiums tax imposed under ORS 731.820, the tax imposed upon wet marine and transportation insurers under ORS 731.824 and 731.828 and the assessment imposed under section 5, chapter 538, Oregon Laws 2017. However, all real and personal property, if any, of the insurer shall be listed, assessed and taxed the same as real and personal property of like character of noninsurers. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the imposition of the assessments imposed under ORS 656.612 upon a foreign or alien insurer.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section applies to a reciprocal insurer and its attorney in its capacity as such.

      (3) Subsection (1) of this section applies to foreign or alien title insurers and to foreign or alien wet marine and transportation insurers issuing policies and subject to taxes referred to in ORS 731.824 and 731.828.

      (4) The State of Oregon hereby preempts the field of regulating or of imposing excise, privilege, franchise, income, license, permit, registration, and similar taxes, licenses and fees upon insurers and their insurance producers and other representatives as such, and:

      (a) No county, city, district, or other political subdivision or agency in this state shall so regulate, or shall levy upon insurers, or upon their insurance producers and representatives as such, any such tax, license or fee; except that whenever a county, city, district or other political subdivision levies or imposes generally on a nondiscriminatory basis throughout the jurisdiction of the taxing authority a payroll, excise or income tax, as otherwise provided by law, such tax may be levied or imposed upon domestic insurers; and

      (b) No county, city, district, political subdivision or agency in this state shall require of any insurer, insurance producer or representative, duly authorized or licensed as such under the Insurance Code, any additional authorization, license, or permit of any kind for conducting therein transactions otherwise lawful under the authority or license granted under this code.

      731.841 Conditions under which local authority to tax insurer is preempted. If, on account of the provisions of section 2, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, and the amendments to ORS 731.840 by section 6, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, the amendments to ORS 750.329 by section 11, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, the amendments to ORS 317.010 by section 12, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, and the amendments to ORS 317.080 by section 13, chapter 786, Oregon Laws 1995, any insurer authorized to transact business in Oregon on January 1, 1997, is subject to the local taxes, licenses and fees described in ORS 731.840 (4)(a) as of January 1, 1997, and was not so subject before January 1, 1997, the authority of the local government to impose those taxes is preempted by the State of Oregon and no county, city, district or other political subdivision or agency in this state shall levy or impose upon such insurer, or upon its insurance producers or representatives, any excise, privilege, franchise, income, license, permit, registration or similar tax, license or fee. [1995 c.786 §20; 2003 c.364 §79]

 

      731.842 Adjustment of amount to be prepaid for taxes; extension of time for payment; interest; penalty for late payment. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may grant, for good cause shown, a request for an adjustment of the amount of the prepayment due under ORS 731.822 or an extension of time for payment of taxes under ORS 731.808 to 731.834 and 731.859.

RETALIATORY PROVISIONS
