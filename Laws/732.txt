The contract shall be deemed approved unless disapproved by the director within 20 days after date of filing, subject to such reasonable extension of time as the director may require by notice given within such 20 days. Notice of any disapproval shall be delivered to the insurer in writing, stating the grounds therefor.

      (2) Any such contract shall provide that any such producer of an insurer’s business shall within 90 days after expiration of each calendar year furnish the insurer’s board of directors or other governing body a written statement of:

      (2) If the amount of any such impairment is not made good within the time prescribed by the director under subsection (1) of this section, the director shall proceed under the provisions of ORS chapter 734.

      (3) An order directing an insurer to cure an impairment is confidential as provided in ORS 705.137, for such time as the director considers proper but not exceeding the time prescribed by the director for making the amount of the impairment good.

      (b) A domestic insurer complies with the requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the domestic insurer:

By majority vote such emergency board of directors may elect other directors. If there are not at least three surviving vice presidents, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall appoint three persons as directors who shall possess all of the powers of the previous board of directors and such powers as are granted by this section, and these persons by majority vote may elect other directors.

In addition to any other notice required under ORS chapter 183, at least 20 days before the hearing the director shall notify the person that filed the written request and the acquiring party of the hearing.

      (3) The hearing must be conducted in accordance with the provisions for a contested case proceeding under ORS chapter 183. [Formerly 732.535; 2013 c.370 §20]

      (4) A chief insurance regulatory official may attend the proceeding described in subsection (1) of this section in person or by telecommunication. [2013 c.370 §4]

 

      732.528 Approval of proposed activity; grounds for refusing approval. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall make a determination concerning the proposed activity described in ORS 732.521 (1) within a period that begins 60 days before the effective date of the activity. The director may refuse, after a public hearing, to approve a proposed activity if:

      (a) The activity is contrary to law or would result in a prohibited combination of risks or classes of insurance.

      (b) The activity is inequitable or unfair to the policyholders or shareholders of any insurer involved in, or to any other person affected by, the proposed activity. However, in connection with an acquisition of the insurer’s voting securities from the insurer’s shareholders, the director shall evaluate whether the proposed acquisition is fair to the shareholders of the insurer to be acquired only with respect to any shareholders that are unaffiliated with the acquiring party or parties and that would remain after the acquisition is completed.

      (c) The activity would substantially reduce the security of and service to be rendered to policyholders of any domestic insurer involved in the proposed activity, or would otherwise prejudice the interests of such policyholders in this state or elsewhere.

      (d) The activity provides for a foreign or alien insurer to be an acquiring party, and the director further finds that the insurer cannot satisfy the requirements of this state for transacting an insurance business involving the classes of insurance affected by the activity.

      (e) The activity or the completion of the activity would substantially diminish competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly. In determining whether the activity would substantially diminish competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly, the director:

      (A) Shall require the information described in ORS 732.539 and apply the standards set forth in ORS 732.542.

      (B) May not disapprove the activity if the director finds that the activity would yield substantial economies of scale or increase the availability of insurance as provided in ORS 732.542 (9).

      (C) May condition the director’s approval of the activity on a party’s removing the basis for the director’s disapproval within a specific period of time.

      (f) After the change of control or ownership, the domestic insurer to which the activity described in ORS 732.521 (1) applies would not be able to satisfy the requirements for receiving a certificate of authority to transact the line or lines of insurance for which the domestic insurer is currently authorized.

      (g) The financial condition of any acquiring party might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer.

      (h) The plans or proposals that the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell the insurer’s assets or consolidate or merge the insurer with any person, or to make any other material change in the insurer’s business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to the insurer’s policyholders and not in the public interest.

      (i) The competence, experience and integrity of the persons that would control the operation of the insurer are such that permitting the activity or permitting completion of the activity would not be in the interest of the insurer’s policyholders and the public.

      (j) The activity or completing the activity is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance-buying public.

      (k) The activity is subject to other material and reasonable objections.

      (2) If the director disapproves the proposed activity, the director shall promptly notify, in writing, each insurer and each acquiring party involved in the proposed activity, specifying the bases, factors and reasons for the disapproval and giving each insurer and each acquiring party that filed the statement relating to the proposed activity an opportunity to amend the statement, if possible, to obviate the director’s objections.

      (3) If the director determines that a party that acquires control of a domestic insurer must maintain or restore the domestic insurer’s capital to a level required under the laws and rules of this state, the director shall make and communicate the determination to the acquiring party not later than 60 days after the acquiring party files the statement required under ORS 732.523.

      (4) The acquiring party or parties that filed a statement of acquisition under ORS 732.523 shall file any amendment to the statement that responds to the director’s objection and, if a hearing was held on the proposed activity, shall resubmit the amendment at a hearing held under this section unless the director finds that a hearing is not necessary to protect the policyholders, shareholders or any other person the proposed activity affects.

      (5) The director may retain at the acquiring party’s expense any actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the director’s staff as the director may reasonably need to assist the director in reviewing the proposed activity.

      (8) On petition to the court, the court’s power extends to affirming the order of the director, modifying all or any part of the director’s objections, adding additional objections, approving the proposed activity as submitted or subject to such modifications or changes as the court may find proper, and requiring resubmission to the boards of directors or other governing bodies or for hearing as provided in ORS 732.526.

      732.537 Application of ORS 732.527, 732.539, 732.542 and 732.544 to change of control of insurer; exemptions. (1) As used in subsection (3)(d) of this section, “market” means the direct written insurance premium for a line of business in this state that an insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state claims in the annual financial statement the insurer files under ORS 731.574.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, ORS 732.527, 732.539, 732.542 and 732.544 apply to an acquisition in which a change of control occurs in an insurer that is authorized to transact insurance in this state.

      (3) ORS 732.527, 732.539, 732.542 and 732.544 do not apply to:

      (a) A person’s purchase of an insurer’s securities solely for investment purposes, provided that the person does not use the person’s ownership of the securities to cause or attempt to cause an action, or to vote to take an action, that would cause a substantial decrease in competition in an insurance market in this state. If a presumption arises that a person controls the insurer by reason of the person’s purchase of securities, the person’s purchase of the securities is not solely for investment purposes unless the chief insurance regulatory official in the state in which the person is domiciled accepts a disclaimer of control from the person or the regulatory official affirmatively finds that the person does not control the insurer. The person or the regulatory official must communicate the disclaimer or the finding to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (b) A person’s acquisition of another person, if both the person that is acquiring the other person and the person that is subject to the acquisition are not engaged primarily in transacting insurance, either directly or through an affiliate. An exemption under this subsection from the application of ORS 732.527, 732.539, 732.542 and 732.544 is effective only if the person that is acquiring the other person notifies the director in accordance with ORS 732.539 not less than 30 days before the date on which the acquisition would be completed. The requirement to notify the director does not apply if an exclusion set forth in paragraph (a), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this subsection applies to the acquisition.

      (c) An acquisition in which a person acquires another person with which the person is already affiliated.

      (d) An acquisition that, immediately after completion, would meet any of these conditions:

      (A) The combined market share held by an insurer that is acquiring another insurer and the insurer that is subject to the acquisition does not exceed five percent of the total market share in any market;

      (B) The market share in any market does not increase for either an insurer that is acquiring another insurer or the insurer that is subject to the acquisition; or

      (C) The combined market share held by an insurer that is acquiring another insurer and the insurer that is subject to the acquisition does not:

      (i) Exceed 12 percent of the total market share in any market; or

      (ii) Increase by more than two percent of the total market share in any market.

      (e) An acquisition for which an insurer that is acquiring another insurer must notify the director in accordance with ORS 732.539 solely because of the effect the acquisition would have on the ocean marine line of business.

      (f)(A) An acquisition of an insurer for which the chief insurance regulatory officer of the state in which the insurer is domiciled finds that:

      (i) The insurer is in failing condition;

      (ii) No feasible alternative exists for improving the insurer’s condition; and

      (iii) The public benefit that would arise from improving the insurer’s condition by means of the acquisition outweigh the detriment that may result from diminishing competition among insurers; and

      (B) For an exemption under this paragraph to apply, the chief insurance regulatory officer of the state in which the insurer is domiciled must communicate the regulatory officer’s findings to the director. [2013 c.370 §5]

 

      732.538 Effect of merger or consolidation. (1) When a merger or consolidation becomes effective, the effect on the insurers and other parties to the merger or consolidation is as follows:

      (a) The several insurers and other parties to the plan of merger or consolidation shall be a single insurer or other corporation, which, in the case of a merger, shall be that insurer or other corporation designated in the plan of merger as the surviving insurer or corporation, and, in the case of a consolidation, shall be the new insurer or other corporation provided for in the plan of consolidation.

      (b) The separate existence of all insurers and other corporations party to the plan of merger or consolidation, except the surviving or new insurer or other corporation, shall cease.

      (c) The surviving or new insurer or other corporation shall have all the rights, privileges, immunities and powers and shall be subject to all the duties and liabilities of an insurer organized under this chapter. If the surviving corporation is a health care service contractor, the corporation shall be subject to all the duties and liabilities of a health care service contractor under the Insurance Code.

      (d) The surviving or new insurer or other corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises, as well of a public as of a private nature, of each of the merging or consolidating insurers and other corporations. All property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account, including subscriptions to shares, and all other choses in action, and all and every other interest, of or belonging to or due to each of the insurers and other corporations so merged or consolidated, shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to and vested in the single insurer or corporation without further act or deed. The title to any real estate, or any interest therein, vested in any of such insurers and other corporations shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the merger or consolidation.

      (e) The surviving or new insurer or other corporation shall thenceforth be responsible and liable for all the liabilities and obligations of each of the insurers and other corporations so merged or consolidated. Any claim existing or action or proceeding pending by or against any of such insurers or other corporations may be prosecuted as if the merger or consolidation had not taken place, or such surviving or new insurer or other corporation may be substituted in its place. Neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the property of any such insurer or other corporation shall be impaired by such merger or consolidation.

      (f) In the case of a merger, the articles of incorporation of the surviving insurer or other corporation shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, if any, that changes in its articles of incorporation are stated in the plan of merger. In the case of a consolidation, the statements set forth in the articles of consolidation that are required or permitted to be set forth in the articles of incorporation of corporations organized under ORS chapter 60 shall be deemed to be the original articles of incorporation of the new corporation.

      (2) Subject to any shareholder rights under ORS 60.554 and 60.557, when a merger or consolidation becomes effective, in the case of an insurer or other corporation that has ceased to exist because of a merger or consolidation, the shares of that insurer or other corporation that are to be converted under the plan of merger or consolidation are void.

      (3) As of the date on which a merger or consolidation becomes effective, the holders of converted shares are entitled only to the shares, obligations, other securities, cash or other property into which the shares have been converted in accordance with the plan of merger or consolidation.

      (4) In the event of reinsurance pursuant to the plan, the applicable provisions of the Insurance Code shall govern the effects thereof. [Formerly 732.570; 1999 c.362 §66]

 

      732.539 Notification of acquisition; confidentiality; order; rules; required information; waiting period. (1)(a) A person that proposes to acquire another person, or the person that would be subject to the acquisition, must notify the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and wait for the period of time specified in subsection (3) of this section before completing the acquisition. The director shall treat a notice and information that a person submits in accordance with this section as confidential and as exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478.

      (b) A person that completes an acquisition without notifying the director as provided in this subsection may be subject to an order from the director under ORS 732.544.

      (2) The director by rule shall prescribe the form and content of the notice that a person must submit under subsection (1) of this section and, in prescribing the form and content of the notice, shall consider the form and content of the notice that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners prescribes for markets in which, under ORS 732.537 (2), completing an acquisition requires submitting a notice under this section. The director may require any additional information the director deems necessary to determine under ORS 732.542 whether the acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly. The additional information may include an opinion from an economist that assesses what competitive impact the acquisition may have in this state. A person that submits an economist’s opinion under this subsection shall also submit a summary of the economist’s education and experience that reflect the economist’s ability to render an informed opinion.

      (3)(a) A person may not proceed with an acquisition until 30 days after the director receives the notice under subsection (1) of this section, unless the director permits the acquisition to proceed earlier.

      (b) During the period of time described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director may, only once, require the person to submit additional information related to the acquisition. If the director requires additional information, the person may not proceed with the acquisition until 30 days after the director receives the additional information, unless the director permits the acquisition to proceed earlier.

      732.541 Jurisdiction over person obtaining or attempting to obtain control. The courts of this state are vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled or authorized to do business in this state who is required to file a statement with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services under ORS 732.523 and over all actions involving such a person arising out of violations of ORS 732.517 to 732.546. Each such person shall be considered to have appointed the director for the purpose of service of process. [Formerly 732.580]

 

      732.542 Monopoly or substantial diminishment of competition; director’s order; prima facie and substantial evidence; determination of scope and extent of market. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Highly concentrated market” means a market in which the share that the four largest insurers hold is 75 percent or more of the market.

      (b) “Insurer” means a company that transacts insurance or a group of companies that transact insurance and are under common management, ownership or control.

      (c) “Market” means the relevant product or geographical market the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines under subsection (7) of this section.

      (2) The director may issue an order under ORS 732.544 if an insurer fails to submit adequate information in accordance with ORS 732.539 or if prima facie or substantial evidence of the type described in subsection (3)(a) or (b) of this section exists to support the director’s determination that an acquisition may:

      (a) Substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state; or

      (b) Tend to create a monopoly.

      (3)(a) Prima facie evidence exists to support the director’s determination that an acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly if the acquisition:

      (A) Is subject to ORS 732.537;

      (B) Involves two or more insurers that compete in the same market;

      (C) Will take place in a market that has a significant trend toward increased concentration, as provided in subsection (4) of this section; and

      (D) Involves at least one insurer within a group of up to eight of the largest insurers in a market that has a significant trend toward increased concentration, as provided in subsection (4) of this section, and another insurer that is either within the same group or has a market share of two percent or more.

      (b) Substantial evidence exists to support the director’s determination that an acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly if:

      (A) In a highly concentrated market the insurers involved in the acquisition hold the following shares:

______________________________________________________________________________

 

      Insurer A               Insurer B

 

      Four percent          Four percent or more

      10 percent             Two percent or more

      15 percent             One percent or more

 

______________________________________________________________________________

 

      (B) In a market that is not highly concentrated, the insurers involved in the acquisition hold the following shares:

______________________________________________________________________________

 

      Insurer A               Insurer B

 

      Five percent          Five percent or more

      10 percent             Four percent or more

      15 percent             Three percent or more

      19 percent             One percent or more

 

______________________________________________________________________________

 

      (4) Evidence of a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market exists if the aggregate market share of any grouping of as many as eight of the largest insurers in the market has increased by seven percent or more over a period of time that begins at least five years and not more than 10 years before the date of the notice described in ORS 732.539 and that ends on the date of the notice described in ORS 732.539.

      (5) Notwithstanding the requirement in subsection (2) of this section to find prima facie or substantial evidence before issuing an order under ORS 732.544, the director may issue the order if the director determines, on the basis of other substantial evidence, that the acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly. In making a determination under this subsection, the director may consider:

      (a) The market shares of the insurers involved in the acquisition;

      (b) Volatility in the relative market shares among the largest insurers in the market;

      (c) The number of competitors in the market;

      (d) The concentration of the market and any trend toward increased concentration; and

      (e) The ease with which an insurer may enter or exit the market.

      (6) The director has the burden of showing prima facie evidence for the director’s determination that an acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly. A person may rebut the director’s showing or determination under subsection (2), (3) or (5) of this section by providing substantial evidence to the contrary.

      (7) In determining the scope and extent of the market for the purpose of determining whether an acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly, the director at a minimum shall consider definitions and guidelines that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners promulgates and information that the parties to the acquisition submit. Unless the director determines otherwise:

      (a) The product market is the direct written insurance premium for the line of business in this state that an insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state claims in the annual financial statement the insurer files under ORS 731.574; and

      (b) The geographical market is this state.

      (8) In the tables shown in subsection (3)(b) of this section:

      (a) Percentages that do not appear in the tables may be interpolated using the percentages that appear in the tables.

      (b) Prima facie evidence exists for the director to determine that an acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly if more than two insurers are involved in the acquisition and the total market share among the insurers exceeds the aggregated market share of “Insurer A” and “Insurer B” in any row shown in the tables.

      (c) “Insurer A” is the insurer with the largest share of the market.

      (9) The director may not issue an order under ORS 732.544 if:

      (a) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or substantial economies in resource use that cannot feasibly be achieved in any other way and the economies would provide a public benefit that outweighs the public benefit of maintaining competition in the market; or

      (b) The acquisition would substantially increase the availability of insurance and the public benefit from increased insurance availability outweighs the public benefit of maintaining competition in the market. [2013 c.370 §7]

 

      732.543 [Formerly 732.590; renumbered 732.547 in 2013]

 

      732.544 Director’s order; effect; requirements for issuing; penalties. (1)(a) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may issue an order with the effect described in paragraph (b) of this subsection if the director determines that an acquisition may substantially diminish competition in a line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly or if the director determines that a party to an acquisition has violated a provision of ORS 732.539. The director shall issue the order together with findings of fact and conclusions of law that support the order.

      (b) An order issued under paragraph (a) of this subsection may:

      (A) Require an insurer to cease and desist from transacting insurance in this state in the line of insurance the director identifies in the director’s determination under paragraph (a) of this subsection; or

      (B) Deny an application from an insurer for a certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state.

      (2) The director may not issue an order under subsection (1) of this section unless the director:

      (a) Provides a hearing to the person that will be subject to the order;

      (b) Notifies the person of the impending order and the hearing within 30 days after the date on which the person submitted the notice described in ORS 732.539 and not less than 15 days before the date of the hearing; and

      (c) Completes the hearing and issues the order not later than 60 days after the date on which the person submitted the notice described in ORS 732.539.

      (3) An order issued under subsection (1) of this section does not apply if an acquisition that is the subject of the order does not proceed.

      (4) A person that violates an order issued under subsection (1) of this section may be subject to:

      (a) A civil penalty under ORS 731.988; or

      (b) A suspension or revocation of the person’s certificate of authority.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 732.547 (4), ORS 732.547 (2) and (3) and 732.588 do not apply to an acquisition concerning which the director has issued an order under subsection (1) of this section. [2013 c.370 §8]

 

      732.545 [1967 c.359 §202; 1973 c.515 §2; 1981 c.633 §81; 1983 c.498 §12; 1987 c.846 §10; repealed by 1993 c.447 §122]

 

      732.546 Severability. If any provision of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 are declared to be severable. [Formerly 732.595]

 

      732.547 Remedies for violation of ORS 732.517 to 732.546. (1) Whenever it appears to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services that any person has committed or is about to commit a violation of any provision of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 or of any rule or order issued by the director under ORS 732.517 to 732.546, the director may apply to the Circuit Court for Marion County for an order enjoining the person, and any director, officer, employee or agent of the person, from the violation, and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interests of the policyholders, creditors and shareholders of any insurer or the public may require.

      (2) No security that is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or that is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 or of any rule or order issued by the director under ORS 732.517 to 732.546, may be voted at any shareholder’s meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though such securities were not issued and outstanding. However, no action taken at any such meeting shall be invalidated by the voting of such securities unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state have so ordered. If an insurer or the director has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 or any rule or order issued by the director under ORS 732.517 to 732.546, the insurer or the director may apply to the Circuit Court for Marion County, or to the circuit court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business in this state, if any, to enjoin the violation, to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of such security already cast at any meeting of shareholders, and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interests of the insurer’s policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require.

      (3) In any case in which a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities of an insurer in violation of ORS 732.517 to 732.546 or any rule or order issued by the director under ORS 732.517 to 732.546, the Circuit Court for Marion County, or the circuit court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business in this state, if any, upon the application of the insurer or the director and on such notice as the court deems appropriate, may seize or sequester any voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by the person, and issue any order with respect to the voting securities as may be appropriate to effect the provisions of ORS 732.517 to 732.546. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the purposes of this section, the situs of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers is located in this state.

      (4) The director may exercise remedies available under this section in addition to or in lieu of any other remedy or administrative action available to the director under the Insurance Code. [Formerly 732.543]

      (c) This subsection does not authorize or permit any transaction that, in the case of an insurer that is not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.

This subparagraph applies to transactions that equal or exceed the following:

      (3) A domestic insurer may not enter into one or more transactions during any 12-month period that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons that are within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of the separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise.

      (2)(a) A domestic insurer subject to registration may not pay or make any extraordinary dividend or distribution to the domestic insurer’s shareholders either until 30 days after the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services has received notice of the declaration of the dividend or distribution, if the director has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period, or until the date on which the director approves the payment if approval occurs within the 30-day period.

      (b) For purposes of this section:

      (A) “Extraordinary dividend or distribution” includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the period of 12 consecutive months ending on the date on which the proposed dividend or other distribution is scheduled to be paid or made, exceeds the greater of:

      (ii) The net gain from operations of the insurer after dividends to policyholders and federal income taxes and before realized capital gains or losses, if the insurer is authorized to transact life insurance, or the net income, if the insurer is not authorized to transact life insurance, for the 12-month period ending the 31st day of December immediately preceding.

      (B) “Extraordinary dividend or distribution” does not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities.

      (4) An insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the director’s approval of the dividend or distribution.

The insurer shall calculate the amount of the net income the insurer may carry forward by taking the insurer’s net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends the insurer paid in the second and immediately preceding calendar years.

If the insurer cannot obtain the information the director requires, the insurer shall provide the director with a detailed explanation of the reason the insurer cannot obtain the information and shall identify the person that possesses the information.

      732.588 Supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. (1) If the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines that a person’s violation of any provision of ORS 732.517 to 732.596 so impairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten insolvency or makes the insurer’s further transaction of business hazardous to the insurer’s policyholders, creditors, shareholders or the public, the director may place the insurer under supervision or in rehabilitation or liquidation as provided in ORS chapter 734.

      (2) If the director determines that a person’s violation of ORS 732.521, 732.523, 732.526, 732.541 or 732.566 prevents the director from fully understanding the enterprise risk that an insurance holding company system or an affiliate of an insurer presents to the insurer, the director may, on the basis of the violation, disapprove a dividend or distribution and may place the insurer under supervision as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

      732.592 Recovery from parent corporation or holding company if domestic insurer ordered into liquidation or rehabilitation. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order may recover, on behalf of the insurer, from any parent corporation or holding company or person or affiliate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions, other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock, paid by the insurer on the insurer’s capital stock, or any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or the insurer’s subsidiary to a director, officer or employee, when such a distribution or payment is made at any time during the 12 calendar months preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation, as the case may be, subject to the limitations of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section.

      (2) A distribution to which subsection (1) of this section applies is not recoverable if the parent or affiliate shows that the distribution was lawful and reasonable when paid and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill the insurer’s contractual obligations.

      (3) Any person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time a distribution to which subsection (1) of this section applies was paid is liable in an amount that is not more than the amount of distributions or payments received by the person under subsection (1) of this section.

      (6) If the director places an insurer under liquidation or rehabilitation as provided in ORS chapter 734 and the insurer engages in transactions within an insurance holding company system as provided in ORS 732.574, the director retains authority over the insurer’s operations and over transactions in which the insurer engages within an insurance holding company system of which the insurer is a member.

(1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall:

      (a) Act, in accordance with the provisions of this section, as the group-wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group; or

      (b) Acknowledge another regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group if the internationally active insurance group:

      (B) Has substantial insurance operations in the United States but not in this state; or

      (2) The director, in cooperation with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies, shall identify a single group-wide supervisor for each internationally active insurance group. The director may determine that the director is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group with substantial insurance operations in this state or the director may determine that another regulatory official is the appropriate group-wide supervisor.

      (a) Where the insurers that have the largest share of the internationally active insurance group’s written premiums, assets or liabilities are domiciled;

      (b) Where the top-tier insurers within the internationally active insurance group’s insurance holding company system are domiciled;

      (b) Cooperate with and obtain acknowledgment from other regulatory officials with responsibility for supervising the internationally active insurance group; and

      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or ORS 732.596, the director shall acknowledge another regulatory official that is acting as a group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group unless a material change in the internationally active insurance group requires the director to make a determination under subsection (2) of this section as to the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.

Before determining that the director is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the director shall inform the insurer that provided the information and the controlling entity within the internationally active insurance group, and give the internationally active insurance group at least 30 days in which to provide any additional information that may relate to the director’s determination. The director shall identify internationally active insurance groups for which the director acts as the group-wide supervisor on the Department of Consumer and Business Services website.

      (6) As the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the director may:

      (b) Request from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the director’s supervision information that is necessary and appropriate to enable the director to assess enterprise risk for the member, including information about the member’s:

      (B) Capital adequacy; and

      (C) Material intercompany transactions;

      (e) Enter into agreements with, or obtain information from, any insurer registered under ORS 732.551, any member of an internationally active insurance group or any other state, federal or international regulatory agency with authority over the internationally active insurance group in order to clarify or provide a basis for the director’s authority as a group-wide supervisor, provided that the agreements or information:

      (A) Enable the director to resolve disputes with other regulatory officials; and

      (B) Will not serve as evidence in any proceeding that an insurer or person within an insurance holding company system that is not domiciled or organized in this state is transacting insurance in this state or is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of this state; or

      (f) Perform any other activities the director deems necessary to exercise the functions of a group-wide supervisor, provided the activities are consistent with the authority and the purposes set forth in this section.

      (7)(a) The director may cooperate, including through a supervisory college described in ORS 732.571, with another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has not accredited in the regulatory official’s role as a group-wide supervisor if:

      (A) The director acknowledges the regulatory official as a group-wide supervisor;

      (B) The director’s cooperation complies with the laws of this state; and

      (C) The regulatory official cooperates with the director’s activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups as appropriate.

      (b) The director may refuse to acknowledge and cooperate with a regulatory official who does not reciprocate the director’s acknowledgment and cooperation under this subsection.

      (8) The director may enter into agreements with or obtain information from an insurer registered under ORS 732.551, an affiliate of the insurer and any other state, federal or international regulatory agency if the agreement or information clarifies or provides the basis for a regulatory official’s authority as a group-wide supervisor.

      (9) An insurer that is subject to this section, or that is a member of an internationally active insurance group that is subject to this section, shall pay the director’s reasonable expenses of administering this section, including expenses associated with engaging attorneys, actuaries or other professionals and reasonable travel expenses.

      732.605 [1971 c.373 §2; 1993 c.447 §23; renumbered 732.548 in 1993]

 

      732.606 Plan for conversion or reorganization; documents filed; approval by director and members. (1) In order for a domestic mutual insurer to engage in a conversion or reorganization as provided in ORS 732.604, the board of directors of the mutual insurer must adopt a plan that meets the requirements of ORS 732.610.

      (2) After the board of directors of a mutual insurer has adopted a plan and before the board of directors seeks approval of the plan by the eligible members of the mutual insurer, the mutual insurer shall file the following documents with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services:

      (a) The plan of conversion or reorganization.

      (b) The form of notice of the meeting at which the eligible members vote on the plan.

      (c) The form of any proxies to be solicited from the eligible members. Proxies must offer the eligible members the option of voting in favor or voting against the plan or abstaining.

      (d) Information required by ORS 732.523.

      (e) Other information or documentation required by the director.

      (3) The director shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove a plan and other documents submitted under subsection (2) of this section, according to the standards established in ORS 732.626. The director must take such action not later than the 60th day after the director has received a completed filing of the plan and all information requested by the director or not later than the 30th day after the completion of a hearing on the plan, whichever date is later.

      (4) At any time before approval of a plan by the director, the board of directors of the mutual insurer may amend or withdraw the plan.

      (5) After approval by the director, the plan must be approved by the eligible members of the mutual insurer. Approval by the eligible members is subject to the following requirements:

      (a) All eligible members must be given notice of the plan and of their opportunity to vote on the plan. A copy of the plan or a summary of the plan must accompany the notice. The notice shall be mailed to the last known address of each eligible member, as shown on the records of the mutual insurer, not later than the 45th day after approval of the plan by the director. The meeting of the eligible members at which a vote on the plan will occur shall be set for a date that is not earlier than the 30th day after the date on which the mutual insurer mailed the notice of the meeting. If the mutual insurer complies substantially and in good faith with the notice requirements of this section, the mutual insurer’s failure to give any member or members any required notice does not impair the validity of any action taken under this section.

      (b) The vote required for approval must be conducted as provided in ORS 732.470 and 732.475, except as follows:

      (A) Only eligible members may vote on the plan.

      (B) An eligible member may vote in person or by proxy at the meeting at which the plan is voted upon.

      (C) The plan is approved by the eligible members upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the eligible members voting on the plan, unless the articles of incorporation require a greater number of affirmative votes.

      (6) The plan shall be carried out in accordance with its terms on the effective date of the conversion or reorganization. [1997 c.771 §4; 2001 c.352 §2]

 

      732.608 Waiver of requirements of ORS 732.606. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may waive the requirements of ORS 732.606 if:

      (1) The director determines that a domestic mutual insurer is in hazardous financial condition according to standards established under ORS 731.385 or if a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding or an administrative supervision proceeding has been instituted against the insurer; and

      (2) The director determines that the transfer of the policies is in the best interests of the policyholders. [1997 c.771 §16]

 

      732.610 Contents of plan. A plan of conversion or reorganization of a domestic mutual insurer must include the following:

      (1) A statement of the reasons for the proposed action.

      (2) A description of how the plan will be carried out, including, but not limited to, any merger, transfer, assumption, exchange, acquisition, contribution or other transaction included within the plan and a description of any stock holding company, mutual holding company, intermediate stock holding company or other corporation organized pursuant to the plan.

      (3) A description of all significant terms of the conversion or reorganization.

      (4) A description of the overall effect of the plan on policies issued by the converting mutual insurer. The description must show that policyholder interests collectively are properly preserved and protected and that the plan is fair and equitable to the policyholders.

      (5) A statement of the manner and method by which membership interests in the converting mutual insurer will be extinguished and consideration will be provided to the eligible members in accordance with ORS 732.612.

      (6) The record date for determining whether a member of the converting mutual insurer is an eligible member.

      (7) The proposed effective date of the conversion or reorganization or the manner in which the proposed effective date of the conversion or reorganization is established.

      (8) The proposed amendments to or restatement of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the converting mutual insurer and the proposed articles of incorporation and bylaws of any stock holding company, mutual holding company, intermediate stock holding company or other corporation organized pursuant to the plan.

      (9) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 732.612, the valuation of the converting mutual insurer immediately before the effective date of the conversion.

      (10) A description of the significant terms of any offering of shares of capital stock or other securities of an issuer.

      (11) The intention, if any, that a director or officer of the converting mutual insurer or converted stock insurer or any stock holding company, mutual holding company, intermediate stock holding company or other corporation organized pursuant to the plan may, within the six-month period following the effective date of the conversion or reorganization, purchase or acquire shares of capital stock or other securities of an issuer to be issued pursuant to the plan.

      (12) A provision that all policies in force on the effective date of the conversion or reorganization will remain in force under the terms of those policies. The plan also must provide that on the effective date of the conversion or reorganization, any voting rights of the members provided for under the policies or under the Insurance Code are extinguished. Except for individual policies of life insurance, guaranteed renewable health insurance and noncancelable health insurance issued by the converting mutual insurer, the plan may authorize the converted stock insurer to issue nonparticipating policies as a substitute for participating policies upon the renewal dates of the participating policies.

      (13) If applicable, a provision establishing a closed block of individual policies of life insurance, guaranteed renewable health insurance and noncancelable health insurance issued by the converting mutual insurer that are participating policies and in force on the effective date of the conversion or reorganization and for which the converting mutual insurer has an experience-based dividend scale payable in the year in which the plan is adopted by the board of directors of the converting mutual insurer. The plan may provide for conditions under which the converted stock insurer may cease to maintain the closed block and its allocated assets. Regardless of such a cessation, the obligations under the individual policies constituting the closed block business remain the obligations of the converted stock insurer. Dividends on those policies must be apportioned by the board of directors of the converted stock insurer in accordance with the terms of the policies. Assets of the insurer must be allocated to the closed block in an amount producing cash flows that, together with anticipated revenues from the closed block business, are expected to be sufficient to support the closed block business, including payment of claims and those expenses and taxes specified in the plan, and provide for continuation of dividend scales in effect on the effective date if the experience underlying the dividend scales continues. The provision establishing the closed block must provide for appropriate adjustments in the dividend scales if the experience changes. [1997 c.771 §5]

 

      732.611 Eligible member of domestic mutual insurer or mutual holding company; record date. (1)(a) A member is an eligible member of a domestic mutual insurer for purposes of ORS 732.600 to 732.630 if the member’s policy is in force as of the record date for a plan of conversion or reorganization.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, the record date is the date on which the mutual insurer’s board of directors adopts the plan of conversion or reorganization or on some other date that the plan specifies as the record date and that the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services approves.

      (2)(a) A member is an eligible member of a mutual holding company for purposes of ORS 732.622 and 732.624 if the member’s policy is in force as of the record date for a plan of restructuring.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, the record date is the date on which the mutual holding company’s board of directors adopts the plan of restructuring or on another date the plan specifies as the record date and that the director approves. [2013 c.370 §14]

 

      732.612 Consideration for membership interest in converting or reorganizing mutual insurer; kinds of consideration; allocation of consideration. (1) In the case of a conversion or in the case of a reorganization that involves the organization of a stock holding company, consideration for the membership interests of the eligible members of a converting mutual insurer consists of one or any combination of the following:

      (a) Nontransferable subscription rights to purchase shares of capital stock of the issuer as described in subsection (2) of this section;

      (b) Shares of capital stock of the issuer as described in subsection (3) of this section;

      (c) Cash;

      (d) Premium credits;

      (e) In the case of a converting mutual insurer transacting primarily property or casualty insurance, or both, certificates of contribution that bear interest as established in the plan, that are repayable within 10 years or, if approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, within a longer period and that are repayable on terms set forth in the plan;

      (f) In the case of individual policies of life insurance, credits to policy account values or other enhancements in policy benefits; and

      (g) Any other form of consideration described in the plan and approved by the director.

      (2) A plan may provide for allocating to eligible members, without payment, nontransferable subscription rights to purchase shares of capital stock of the issuer. In addition, the plan must:

      (a) Allocate the subscription rights in whole shares among the eligible members. In the case of a converting mutual insurer transacting primarily life or health insurance, or both, the subscription rights must be allocated in accordance with subsection (6) of this section. In the case of a converting mutual insurer transacting primarily property or casualty insurance, or both, the subscription rights must be allocated in accordance with subsection (7) of this section.

      (b) Specify the expiration date of the subscription rights or authorize the board of directors of the converting mutual insurer to establish the expiration date. An eligible member may exercise the subscription rights, in whole or in part, in the manner described in the plan including, but not limited to, paying the subscription exercise price for the shares purchased. The plan may require an eligible member who exercises subscription rights to purchase a minimum number of shares unless the director determines that a minimum purchase requirement is unreasonable based on the interests of the eligible members, the converted stock insurer and the issuer. The proposed subscription exercise price per share must be set forth in the plan and must be less than the price at which shares of capital stock of the issuer will be first offered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this subsection. The boards of directors of the converting mutual insurer and the issuer shall determine the proposed subscription exercise price per share and the director must approve the proposed price based on the interests of the eligible members, the policyholders, the converted stock insurer and the issuer.

      (c) Provide that to the extent an eligible member does not exercise, in whole or in part, subscription rights allocated to the eligible member, the eligible member instead will receive one or more of the forms of consideration described in subsection (1) of this section that are specified in the plan.

      (d) Set the pro forma market value of the converted stock insurer, which is the value that is estimated to be necessary to attract full subscription for all shares offered by the issuer. The pro forma market value of the converted stock insurer must be determined by an independent valuation by a qualified person. The price per share at which the shares of capital stock of the issuer are first offered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this subsection must be equal to such pro forma market value of the converted stock insurer divided by the number of shares that would be issued if all subscription rights allocated to the eligible members are exercised.

      (e) Further provide that any shares of capital stock of the issuer for which subscription rights are allocated to the eligible members but that the eligible members do not purchase by exercising the members’ subscription rights must be sold in a public offering through an underwriter, unless the number of shares that the eligible members do not purchase is so small in number that the expense of a public offering is not warranted, in which case the plan may provide for the sale of the shares by private placement or through any other fair and equitable means approved by the director. If the director finds that market conditions or other circumstances may cause the interests of the eligible members to be adversely affected, the director may require the offering of shares to be postponed or the terms of the offering to be modified.

      (3) A plan may provide for allocating to the eligible members, without payment, shares of capital stock of the issuer. The plan must allocate the shares of capital stock of the issuer in whole shares among the eligible members. In the case of a converting mutual insurer transacting primarily life or health insurance, or both, the shares must be allocated in accordance with subsection (6) of this section. In the case of a converting mutual insurer transacting primarily property or casualty insurance, or both, the shares must be allocated in accordance with subsection (7) of this section. If shares of capital stock of the issuer constitute the only consideration the eligible members will receive and the plan does not provide for selling additional shares of capital stock or other securities of the issuer, the plan does not need to include the valuation of the converting mutual insurer. If the plan provides for allocating to the eligible members, without payment, shares of capital stock of the issuer, the plan may establish a reasonable period within which the eligible members to whom such shares are issued may not dispose of such shares.

      (4) If shares of capital stock of the issuer are issued in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the issuer must use the issuer’s best efforts to encourage and assist in establishing a public market for the shares unless the director finds that a public market is not feasible or is not in the best interests of the eligible members, the converted stock insurer and the issuer. The director may provide that subscription rights or shares of capital stock of the issuer do not need to be allocated under subsection (2) or (3) of this section to eligible members who reside in a foreign country or other jurisdiction if a small number of eligible members reside in the foreign country or other jurisdiction and any registration, qualification, filing or other compliance matters under the laws of the foreign country or other jurisdiction with respect to the shares of capital stock of the issuer would be impracticable or unduly burdensome upon the issuer.

      (5) Regardless of the form of consideration for the membership interests of the eligible members of a converting mutual insurer, the plan may provide for selling additional shares of capital stock or other securities of the issuer to persons other than the eligible members. The issuer shall offer such additional shares or other securities at a price and on terms determined by the boards of directors of the converting mutual insurer and the issuer.

      (6) For a converting mutual insurer that transacts primarily life or health insurance, or both, the consideration specified in subsection (1) of this section must be allocated among the eligible members in accordance with a fair and equitable formula. The formula for allocating the consideration among the eligible members must either:

      (a) Allocate a fixed component of consideration per capita among the eligible members and allocate a variable component of consideration among the eligible members in proportion to the cash value of policies the eligible members hold; or

      (b) Allocate the consideration among the eligible members in any other manner approved by the director.

      (7) For a converting mutual insurer transacting primarily property or casualty insurance, or both, the consideration specified in subsection (1) of this section must be allocated among the eligible members in accordance with a fair and equitable formula. The formula for allocating the consideration among the eligible members must either:

      (a) Allocate the consideration among the eligible members in the proportion that the aggregate premiums the converting mutual insurer earns on the eligible member’s policies in force during a specified period before the record date described in ORS 732.611 (1) bear to the aggregate premiums that the converting mutual insurer earns during the same period on all eligible members’ policies in force. The specified period must be 36 months unless the plan specifies another period.

      (b) Allocate the consideration among the eligible members in any other manner approved by the director.

      (8) The form of consideration to be given to a class or category of eligible members may differ from the form of consideration to be given to another class or category of eligible members. The choice of the form of consideration to be given to a class or category of eligible members may take into account the type of policy, size of policy, tax status of the eligible members and other factors that the director determines are appropriate.

      (9) In the case of a conversion or in the case of a reorganization that involves the organization of a stock holding company, a member of the converting mutual insurer who is not an eligible member is not entitled to receive any consideration for the member’s membership interest.

      (10) In the case of a reorganization that involves the organization of a mutual holding company, the membership interests of the members of the converting mutual insurer, whether or not the members are eligible members, must be merged into the mutual holding company, and consequently the membership interests of the members of the converting mutual insurer must become membership interests in the mutual holding company. [1997 c.771 §6; 2013 c.370 §33]

 

      732.614 Effect of conversion. (1) Upon the effective date of a conversion, the membership interests of all members of the converting mutual insurer, whether or not eligible members, shall be extinguished, and the eligible members of the converting mutual insurer shall be entitled to receive the consideration described in ORS 732.612 in accordance with the plan.

      (2) A converting mutual insurer becomes a stock insurer on the effective date of the conversion. The amended or restated articles of incorporation of the converting mutual insurer shall be filed with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and shall become effective on the effective date of the conversion. The certificate of authority of the converting mutual insurer shall be amended by the director on the effective date of the conversion.

      (3) A converted stock insurer continues the corporate existence of the converting mutual insurer. Except as provided in the plan, the conversion does not annul, modify or change any existing license or other authority or any of the existing civil actions, rights, contracts or liabilities of the converting mutual insurer. All property, debts and choses in action and every other interest belonging to the converting mutual insurer before the conversion are retained by the converted stock insurer without further action needed. On and after the effective date of the conversion, the converted stock insurer shall exercise all rights and powers and perform all duties conferred or imposed by law upon insurers writing the classes of insurance written by the converted stock insurer, shall retain the rights and contracts of the converting mutual insurer existing immediately before the conversion and shall be subject to all obligations and liabilities of the converting mutual insurer existing immediately before the conversion, subject to the terms of the plan.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the conversion may be carried out through any other method described in the plan and approved by the director.

      (5) Unless otherwise specified in the plan, the directors and officers of the converting mutual insurer shall serve as directors and officers of the converted stock insurer until new directors and officers are elected.

      (6) The provisions of this section apply to the conversion of the converting mutual insurer whether or not the conversion is part of a reorganization. [1997 c.771 §7]

 

      732.615 [1971 c.373 §3; 1981 c.247 §8; 1993 c.447 §37; renumbered 732.551 in 1993]

 

      732.616 Reorganization involving organization of stock holding company; subsidiaries. (1) Upon the effective date of a reorganization involving the organization of a stock holding company, the membership interests of all members of the converting mutual insurer, whether or not eligible members, shall be extinguished, and the eligible members of the converting mutual insurer shall be entitled to receive the consideration described in ORS 732.612 in accordance with the plan.

      (2) The stock holding company and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the stock holding company shall be organized at the time or times set forth in the plan.

      (3) As part of the plan of reorganization or in a separate transaction after the effective date of the reorganization, a stock holding company may organize one or more direct or indirect subsidiaries to conduct noninsurance business or businesses. The subsidiaries may be affiliated with the converted stock insurer or any direct or indirect parent corporation of the converted stock insurer.

      (4) Shares of capital stock or other securities of the converted stock insurer, the stock holding company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the stock holding company may be issued or sold in accordance with the plan or after the effective date of the reorganization.

      (5) Unless otherwise specified in the plan, the directors and officers of the converting mutual insurer shall serve as directors and officers of the stock holding company and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the stock holding company until new directors and officers are elected.

      (6) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services retains jurisdiction over the stock holding company and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the stock holding company as provided in this section and as provided in ORS 732.517 to 732.596. [1997 c.771 §8]

 

      732.618 Reorganization involving organization of mutual holding company; subsidiaries. (1) Upon the effective date of a reorganization involving the organization of a mutual holding company, the membership interests of all members of the converting mutual insurer, whether or not such members are eligible members, shall be merged into the mutual holding company. Consequently, the members of the converting mutual insurer shall become members of the mutual holding company, and the membership interests of the members of the converting mutual insurer shall become membership interests in the mutual holding company. Upon the effective date of the reorganization, the membership interests of all members of the converting mutual insurer shall be extinguished. Any owner of one or more policies of insurance, other than a policy of reinsurance, issued by the converted stock insurer after the effective date of the conversion and, if set forth in an order of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, any owner of one or more policies of insurance, other than a policy of reinsurance, issued by any other insurer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of the mutual holding company after the effective date of the reorganization becomes a member of the mutual holding company.

      (2) The articles of incorporation of the mutual holding company shall be filed with the director and shall become effective at the time specified in the plan. Any intermediate stock holding company and any subsidiary of an intermediate stock holding company shall be organized at the time or times set forth in the plan.

      (3) Upon the effective date of a reorganization involving the organization of a mutual holding company either:

      (a) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the converted stock insurer must be issued to the mutual holding company; or

      (b) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company must be issued to the mutual holding company.

      (4) If there is no intermediate stock holding company, the mutual holding company shall own at all times after the effective date of the reorganization a majority of the outstanding shares of voting capital stock of the converted stock insurer and a majority of the total value of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the converted stock insurer.

      (5) If there is an intermediate stock holding company, the mutual holding company shall own at all times after the effective date of the reorganization a majority of the outstanding shares of voting capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company and a majority of the total value of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company. At all times after the effective date of the reorganization, the intermediate stock holding company shall own, either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary, all outstanding shares of capital stock of the converted stock insurer. Subject to such requirement of share ownership by the mutual holding company and any intermediate stock holding company in this subsection, shares of capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company may be issued by the intermediate stock holding company or may be sold or otherwise transferred by the mutual holding company.

      (6) After the effective date of the reorganization, the mutual holding company must at all times have the direct or indirect power to cast at least a majority of the votes for the election of directors of:

      (a) The converted stock insurer; and

      (b) The intermediate stock holding company, if any.

      (7) As part of the plan of reorganization or in a separate transaction after the effective date of the reorganization, a mutual holding company may organize or acquire one or more direct or indirect subsidiaries to conduct noninsurance business or businesses.

[1997 c.771 §9]

 

      732.620 Status of mutual holding company as corporation; status as insurer; rights and obligations of members; voting; articles of incorporation. (1) A mutual holding company is a corporation. To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Insurance Code or ORS 732.600 to 732.630, ORS chapter 60 governs the powers, duties and relationships of a mutual holding company. The following sections in ORS chapter 60 do not apply to a mutual holding company: ORS 60.004, 60.007 to 60.014, 60.016, 60.017 to 60.024, 60.027, 60.031, 60.051 to 60.057, 60.131 to 60.147, 60.154 to 60.177, 60.224, 60.227, 60.234, 60.241 to 60.265, 60.470 to 60.534, 60.551 to 60.594, 60.701 to 60.747, 60.787, 60.801 to 60.816 and 60.825 to 60.845. The enumeration in this subsection of inapplicable sections in ORS chapter 60 is not exclusive.

      (2) In applying ORS chapter 60 as provided in this section, unless the context requires otherwise, references to:

      (a) “Corporation” shall be deemed references to “mutual holding company.”

      (b) “Shareholders” shall be deemed references to “members.”

      (c) “Secretary of State” shall be deemed references to “Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.”

      (3) A mutual holding company is not an insurer for purposes of the Insurance Code. However, in the event a mutual holding company engages in an activity described in ORS 732.521, then ORS 732.517 to 732.546 shall apply to the mutual holding company and the effect of such activity shall be governed by ORS 732.517 to 732.546. A mutual holding company may merge with another corporation in accordance with a plan of restructuring described in ORS 732.622 and 732.624.

      (4) A mutual holding company shall not dissolve or liquidate without approval by the director or unless required by judicial order. The director retains jurisdiction over a mutual holding company, any intermediate stock holding company and any subsidiary of an intermediate stock holding company as provided in this section and as provided in ORS 732.517 to 732.596.

      (5) The members of a mutual holding company have the rights and obligations set forth in this section and in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the mutual holding company. No member of a mutual holding company may transfer membership in the mutual holding company or any right arising from such membership. Such limitation on the transfer of membership or rights arising from membership shall not restrict the assignment of a policy that is otherwise permissible. A member of a mutual holding company is not personally liable for the acts, debts, liabilities or obligations of the mutual holding company merely by reason of being a member. No assessment of any kind may be imposed upon a member of a mutual holding company.

      (6) A membership interest in a mutual holding company shall not constitute a security as defined in ORS 59.015.

      (7) Each member of a mutual holding company is entitled to one vote on each matter coming before a meeting of the members and for each director to be elected regardless of the number of policies or amount of insurance and benefits held by such member. The voting rights of the members of a mutual holding company shall be determined in accordance with ORS 732.470.

      (8) Meetings of the members of a mutual holding company shall be governed by ORS 732.475 in the same manner as if the mutual holding company were a domestic mutual insurer, except for provisions governing quorum requirements, the approval of matters by the members and the election of directors by the members. The members present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a duly called meeting of the members. If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors, is approved by the members if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles of incorporation require a greater number of affirmative votes. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the members entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum exists.

      (9) The articles of incorporation of a mutual holding company must contain the following provisions:

      (a) The name of the mutual holding company. The name must include the words “mutual holding company” or “mutual insurance holding company” or other words connoting the mutual character of the mutual holding company that are approved by the director.

      (b) A provision specifying that the mutual holding company is not authorized to issue capital stock, whether voting or nonvoting.

      (c) A provision setting forth any rights of the members of the mutual holding company upon dissolution or liquidation.

      (10) A mutual holding company shall automatically be a party to any rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding involving the converted stock insurer that as a result of a reorganization is a direct or indirect subsidiary of the mutual holding company. In such a proceeding, the assets of the mutual holding company shall be counted as assets of the estate of the converted stock insurer for the purpose of satisfying the claims of the policyholders of the converted stock insurer. [1997 c.771 §10]

 

      732.622 Restructuring of mutual holding company. (1) A mutual holding company may restructure to a stock holding company in accordance with a plan of restructuring. The restructuring may include the continuation or organization of one or more corporations that become direct or indirect subsidiaries of the restructured stock holding company in accordance with the plan of restructuring.

      (2) In order to restructure a mutual holding company, the board of directors of the mutual holding company must adopt a plan as provided in this section.

      (c) A description of how the plan will be carried out, including, but not limited to, any merger, transfer, assumption, exchange, acquisition, contribution or other transaction included within the plan, and a description of the restructured stock holding company and any other corporation organized pursuant to the plan.

      (d) A description of all significant terms of the restructuring.

      (e) A description of the overall effect of the plan on policies issued by any insurer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of the restructuring mutual holding company. The description must show that policyholder interests collectively are properly preserved and protected and that the plan is fair and equitable to the policyholders.

      (f) A statement of the manner and method by which membership interests in the restructuring mutual holding company will be extinguished and consideration will be provided to the eligible members.

      (g) The record date for determining whether a member of the restructuring mutual holding company is an eligible member.

      (h) The proposed effective date of the restructuring or the manner in which the proposed effective date of the restructuring is established.

      (i) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 732.624, the valuation of the restructuring mutual holding company immediately before the effective date of the restructuring.

      (j) A description of the significant terms of any offering of shares of capital stock or other securities of an issuer.

      (k) The intention, if any, that a director or officer of the restructuring mutual holding company, any direct or indirect subsidiary of the restructuring mutual holding company or any other corporation organized pursuant to the plan may, within the six-month period following the effective date of the restructuring, purchase or acquire shares of capital stock or other securities of an issuer to be issued pursuant to the plan.

      (4) After the board of directors of a mutual holding company has adopted a plan and before the board of directors seeks approval of the plan by the eligible members of the mutual holding company, the mutual holding company shall file the following documents with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services:

      (a) The plan of restructuring.

      (b) The form of notice of the meeting at which the eligible members vote on the plan.

      (c) The form of any proxies to be solicited from the eligible members. Proxies must offer the eligible members the option of voting in favor or voting against the plan or abstaining.

      (d) Information required by ORS 732.523.

      (e) Other information or documentation required by the director. [1997 c.771 §11]

 

      732.624 Approval by Director of Department of Consumer and Business Services of mutual holding company restructuring plan; approval by members; effect of restructuring. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove a plan of restructuring and other documents submitted under ORS 732.622 according to the standards established in ORS 732.626. The director must take such action not later than the 60th day after the director has received a completed filing of the plan and all information requested by the director or not later than the 30th day after the completion of a hearing on the plan, whichever date is later.

      (2) At any time before approval of a plan by the director, the board of directors of the mutual holding company may amend or withdraw the plan.

      (3) After approval by the director, the plan must be approved by the eligible members of the mutual holding company. Approval by the eligible members is subject to the following requirements:

      (a) All eligible members must be given notice of the plan and of their opportunity to vote on the plan. A copy of the plan or a summary of the plan must accompany the notice. The notice shall be mailed to the last known address of each eligible member, as shown on the records of the mutual holding company, not later than the 45th day after approval of the plan by the director. The meeting of the eligible members at which a vote on the plan will occur shall be set for a date that is not earlier than the 30th day after the date on which the mutual holding company mailed the notice of the meeting. If the mutual holding company complies substantially and in good faith with the notice requirements of this section, the mutual holding company’s failure to give any member or members any required notice does not impair the validity of any action taken under this section.

      (b) The vote required for approval must be conducted as provided in ORS 732.620, except as follows:

      (A) Only eligible members may vote on the plan.

      (B) An eligible member may vote in person or by proxy at the meeting at which the plan is voted upon.

      (4) The plan shall be carried out in accordance with its terms on the effective date of the restructuring. A restructuring may be carried out through any method approved by the director, including, but not limited to, the organization of an interim subsidiary of the mutual holding company and the merger of the mutual holding company with and into such subsidiary.

      (5) The restructured stock holding company and any other corporation included in the plan of restructuring shall be organized at the time or times set forth in the plan.

      (6) Upon the effective date of the restructuring, the membership interests of all members of the restructuring mutual holding company, whether or not eligible members, shall be extinguished, and the eligible members of the restructuring mutual holding company shall be entitled to receive any form of consideration described in ORS 732.612 in accordance with the plan. In applying ORS 732.612 to the members of the restructuring mutual holding company, references in ORS 732.612 to the “converting mutual insurer” shall mean the restructuring mutual holding company, and references to the policies of the eligible members shall mean those policies of the eligible members that result in membership in the restructuring mutual holding company. For this purpose, ORS 732.612 shall be construed and applied so that the effect upon the eligible members of the restructuring mutual holding company is similar to the effect upon the eligible members of a converting mutual insurer. If the consideration for the membership interests of the eligible members is nontransferable subscription rights to purchase shares of capital stock of the issuer, the plan must set the pro forma market value of the restructured stock holding company in the same manner as the pro forma market value of the converted stock insurer is determined in accordance with ORS 732.612. If shares of capital stock of the issuer constitute the only consideration to be received by the eligible members of the restructuring mutual holding company and the plan does not provide for the sale of additional shares of capital stock or other securities of the issuer, the plan does not need to include the valuation of the restructuring mutual holding company.

      (7) Unless otherwise specified in the plan, the directors and officers of the restructuring mutual holding company shall serve as directors and officers of the restructured stock holding company until new directors and officers are elected.

      (8) The director retains jurisdiction over the restructured stock holding company and any direct or indirect subsidiary of the restructured stock holding company as provided in this section and as provided in ORS 732.517 to 732.596.

      (9) A restructured stock holding company shall automatically be a party to any rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding involving a converted stock insurer if the restructuring mutual holding company would have been a party to such proceeding under ORS 732.620. [1997 c.771 §12]

      732.626 Plan review and approval; general provisions. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall review a plan of conversion, reorganization or restructuring that is submitted to the director. Upon review, the director shall approve or conditionally approve the plan if the director finds all of the following:

      (g) If a stock holding company or mutual holding company is organized, the financial condition of the stock holding company, the mutual holding company or any subsidiary thereof will not jeopardize the financial stability of the converted stock insurer.

      (h) The financial condition of the converting mutual insurer will not be jeopardized by the conversion or reorganization, and the conversion or reorganization will not jeopardize the financial stability of the stock holding company, the mutual holding company or any subsidiary thereof.

      (i) The competence, experience and integrity of those persons who will control the operation of the converted stock insurer are not contrary to the interests of policyholders of the converted stock insurer and of the public in allowing the plan to proceed.

      (j) Implementation of the plan will protect the interests of the insurance-buying public.

      (k) The activity is not subject to other material and reasonable objections.

      (L) All modifications required by the director have been made.

      (2) An approval or conditional approval of a plan by the director expires if the plan is not carried out within one year after the date of the approval or conditional approval, unless the time period is extended by the director for good cause, upon written application for such extension.

      (3) In connection with an approval or disapproval of a plan, when the plan must include a valuation, the director shall separately review and approve or disapprove the valuation stated in the plan, and shall make a specific finding thereon in the approval or disapproval.

      (4) The director may retain, at the expense of the converting mutual insurer or restructuring mutual holding company, qualified experts not otherwise a part of the staff of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to assist in reviewing the plan and supplemental documents and valuations, and in making the finding in subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) The director may hold a hearing for the purposes of receiving comment on whether a plan should be approved and on any other matter relating to the conversion, reorganization or restructuring. The hearing shall be held within 60 days after the director has received a completed filing of the plan and all information required by the director. [1997 c.771 §13]

 

      732.628 Limitations on ownership of shares in companies resulting from conversion, reorganization or restructuring. (1) For a period of three years following the effective date of a conversion, reorganization or restructuring, unless authorized by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the directors, officers and employees of the converted stock insurer, any stock holding company, any mutual holding company or any subsidiary of a stock holding company or mutual holding company collectively shall not own, whether directly or indirectly, more than 25 percent of all outstanding shares issued by the converted stock insurer, any stock holding company or any subsidiary of a stock holding company or mutual holding company.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 732.600 to 732.630, neither a person nor a group of persons acting in concert may acquire, through public offering, exchange or subscription rights or otherwise, more than five percent of the shares of capital stock of the converted stock insurer, any stock holding company or any subsidiary of a stock holding company or mutual holding company for a period of five years from the effective date of the conversion, reorganization or restructuring except with the approval of the director.

      (3) If the plan so provides and not otherwise, directors and officers of the converting mutual insurer, the converted stock insurer, any stock holding company or any subsidiary of a stock holding company or mutual holding company may, within the six-month period following the effective date of the conversion, reorganization or restructuring, purchase or acquire shares of capital stock or other securities of an issuer offered pursuant to the plan.

      732.656 Risk management framework.

If the insurer is a member of an insurance group and the director is the lead state director for the insurance group, the insurer shall submit the own risk and solvency assessment summary report or combination of reports without waiting for a request from the director.

      (2) The insurer’s or insurance group’s chief risk officer, or another executive who has responsibility for overseeing the insurer’s or insurance group’s enterprise risk management process, shall attest in a signed statement in the own risk and solvency assessment summary report that to the best of the officer’s or executive’s belief and knowledge the insurer applies the enterprise risk management process described in the insurer’s own risk and solvency assessment summary report and that a copy of the report has been provided to the insurer’s board of directors or an appropriate committee of the board of directors.

      (3) An insurer may comply with subsection (1) of this section by providing the most recent and substantially similar report that the insurer or another member of an insurance group of which the insurer is a member provided to the director of another state or to a supervisor or regulator of a foreign jurisdiction, if the report provides information that is comparable to the information described in the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Guidance Manual.

      (4) An insurer that must submit a report under this section shall submit the report in accordance with a schedule the director establishes, unless the director for good cause shown extends the time for submitting the report. [2015 c.547 §6]

      732.666 Exemptions; director’s requirements. (1) An insurer is exempt from the requirements of ORS 732.650 to 732.689 if:

      (a) The insurer has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium of less than $500 million, including international direct and assumed premium but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program; and

      (b) The insurance group of which the insurer is a member has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium of less than $1 billion, including international direct and assumed premium but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program.

      (2) If an insurer is exempt under subsection (1)(a) of this section, but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member is not exempt under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the own risk and solvency assessment summary report required under ORS 732.662 must include every insurer within the insurance group. The insurer may satisfy this requirement by submitting more than one own risk and solvency assessment summary report for any combination of insurers, if the combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.

      (3) If an insurer is not exempt under subsection (1)(a) of this section but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member is exempt under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the only own risk and solvency assessment summary report required under ORS 732.662 is the report that applies to the insurer.

      (4) An insurer that is not exempt under subsection (1) of this section may apply to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services for a waiver from the requirements of ORS 732.650 to 732.689 based upon unique circumstances. In deciding whether to grant the insurer’s request for a waiver, the director may consider the type and volume of business the insurer writes, the insurer’s ownership and organizational structure and any other factor the director considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member. If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers that are domiciled in more than one state, the director shall coordinate with the lead state director and with the other domiciliary directors in considering whether to grant the insurer’s request for a waiver.

      (5) Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section, the director may require an insurer to maintain a risk management framework, conduct an own risk and solvency assessment and file an own risk and solvency assessment summary report:

      (a) Based on unique circumstances that include, but are not limited to, the type and volume of business the insurer writes, the insurer’s ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests and international supervisor requests; or

      (b) If the insurer has risk-based capital that falls into company action level, meets one or more of the standards the director established under ORS 731.385 to determine whether an insurer is in hazardous financial condition or otherwise exhibits qualities that the director determines are characteristic of a troubled insurer.

      (6) If an insurer that was exempt under subsection (1) of this section subsequently no longer qualifies for an exemption because of changes in premium that are reflected in the insurer’s most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer has one year after the date on which the insurer is no longer exempt to comply with ORS 732.650 to 732.689. [2015 c.547 §7]

 

      Note: See note under 732.650.

 

      732.669 Documentation and supporting information; director’s review. (1) Each insurer that must prepare an own risk and solvency assessment summary report shall prepare the report consistent with the current version of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Guidance Manual, subject to the requirements of subsection (2) of this section. The insurer shall maintain documentation and supporting information and make the documentation and supporting information available when the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services examines the insurer or at the director’s request.

      (2) The director shall review an own risk and solvency assessment summary report, and make any additional requests for information, using procedures currently used in analyzing and examining multistate or global insurers and insurance groups. [2015 c.547 §8]

 

      Note: See note under 732.650.

 

      732.672 Confidentiality; permissible disclosures; agreement with National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the director may:

      (a) Use the documents, materials or other information in any regulatory or legal action the director brings as a part of the director’s official duties.

      (b) Share documents, materials or other information related to an own risk and solvency assessment, including confidential documents and information, only:

      (A) As provided in ORS 705.137, 705.138 and 705.139 in response to a request from a chief insurance regulatory official, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a state, federal, foreign or international law enforcement agency; and

      (B) After receiving written consent from the affected insurer.

      (c) Share documents or materials or other information related to an own risk and solvency assessment with any third-party consultants the director designates, but only if the consultant:

      (A) Agrees in writing to keep the documents, materials or other information confidential; and

      (B) Demonstrates in writing and to the director’s satisfaction that the consultant has the capacity and legal authority to keep the documents, materials or other information confidential.

      (3) In addition to the requirements of ORS 705.137, 705.138 and 731.312, the director shall enter into a written agreement with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant that:

      (a) Prohibits the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant from storing the information the director or the department shares under ORS 732.650 to 732.689 in a permanent database after the underlying analysis is complete; and

      (b) Requires that an affected insurer must give written consent before a third-party consultant may disclose any documents, material or information the director or the department shares under ORS 732.650 to 732.689. [2015 c.547 §9]

      (C) At the level at which the insurer or insurance group collectively oversees or coordinates and exercises supervision over the insurer’s or insurance group’s earnings, capital, liquidity operations and reputation; or

      (D) At the level at which legal liability for failing in the duties of general corporate governance would occur.

      (b) An insurer or insurance group that determines the level at which the insurer or insurance group provides information in the corporate governance annual disclosure under paragraph (a)(B), (C) or (D) of this subsection shall indicate which criteria the insurer or insurance group used for the disclosure and explain any subsequent changes in the level at which the disclosure occurs.

      (4) If the director has determined a lead state in accordance with the procedures set forth in the financial analysis handbook described in subsection (1) of this section, an appropriate official in the lead state shall review the corporate governance annual disclosure and request any other information necessary for the review.

      (5) An insurer or insurance group that provides information that is substantially similar to the information required under this section or ORS 732.683 in other documents that the insurer or insurance group submits to the director, including proxy statements in conjunction with Form B requirements or other state or federal filings, need not duplicate the information in the corporate governance annual disclosure, but must include in the documents the insurer or insurance group submits to the director a cross-reference to documents that have the required information. [2017 c.479 §5]

The director may request additional information the director deems material and necessary to enable a clear understanding of the corporate governance policies and the reporting, information systems or controls that implement the policies.

      (2) Notwithstanding the discretion permitted to an insurer or insurance group under subsection (1) of this section, the insurer or insurance group shall prepare the corporate governance annual disclosure in a manner consistent with rules the director adopts under ORS 732.680. The insurer or insurance group shall maintain documentation and supporting information for the corporate governance annual disclosure and make the documentation and supporting information available during an examination of the insurer or insurance group or otherwise at the director’s request.

      (2) Subsections (4) to (7) of this section apply to a controlled insurer and a controlling producer if, in any calendar year, the aggregate amount of gross written premium on insurance placed with a controlled insurer by a controlling producer is equal to or greater than five percent of the allowed assets of the controlled insurer, as reported in the quarterly financial statement of the controlled insurer filed as of September 30 of the prior year.

      (3) Subsections (4) to (7) of this section do not apply to a controlled insurer and a controlling producer if:

      (a) The controlling producer places insurance only with the controlled insurer or only with the controlled insurer and a member or members of the holding company system of the controlled insurer or the parent, affiliate or subsidiary of the controlled insurer, and receives no compensation based upon the amount of premiums written in connection with the insurance, and accepts insurance placements only from nonaffiliated subproducers and not directly from insureds; and

      (4) A controlled insurer shall not accept insurance placements from a controlling producer, and a controlling producer shall not place insurance with a controlled insurer, unless there is a written contract between the controlling producer and the insurer that complies with the requirements of this subsection. The contract must be approved by the board of directors of the insurer before it becomes effective. The contract must specify the responsibilities of each party and contain the following minimum provisions:

      (a) A provision authorizing the controlled insurer to terminate the contract for cause, upon written notice to the controlling producer, and requiring the controlled insurer to suspend the authority of the controlling producer to write insurance during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause for the termination.

      (b) A provision requiring the controlling producer to render accounts to the controlled insurer detailing all material transactions, including information necessary to support all commissions, charges and other fees received by or owing to the controlling producer.

The rates of the commissions, charges and other fees must not be greater than those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by insurance producers other than controlling producers.

      (A) Must require the controlled insurer to notify the controlling producer when the applicable limit is approached and prohibit the controlled insurer from accepting insurance from the controlling producer if the limit is reached.

      (B) Must prohibit the controlling producer from placing insurance with the controlled insurer if it has been notified by the controlled insurer that the limit has been reached.

      (k) A provision that the controlling producer may negotiate but shall not bind reinsurance on behalf of the controlled insurer on insurance the controlling producer places with the controlled insurer, except that the controlling producer may bind facultative reinsurance contracts pursuant to obligatory facultative agreements if the contract with the controlled insurer contains underwriting guidelines including, for reinsurance assumed and for reinsurance ceded, a list of reinsurers with which such automatic agreements are in effect, the coverages and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured and commission schedules.

      (5) A controlled insurer must have an audit committee of the board of directors composed of independent directors. The audit committee shall meet annually with management, the independent certified public accountants of the insurer and an independent casualty actuary or other independent loss reserve specialist acceptable to the director to review the adequacy of the loss reserves of the insurer.

      (6) In addition to any other required loss reserve certification, on April 1 of each year, a controlled insurer shall file with the director an opinion of an independent casualty actuary, or an independent loss reserve specialist that is acceptable to the director, reporting loss ratios for each line of insurance written and attesting to the adequacy of loss reserves established for losses incurred and outstanding as of year end, including losses incurred but not reported, on insurance placed by the insurance producer.

      (7) A controlled insurer shall annually report to the director the amount of commissions paid to the insurance producer, the percentage such amount represents of the net premiums written and comparable amounts and percentage paid to noncontrolling producers for placements of the same kinds of insurance.

      732.813 Notice to prospective insured. A controlling producer, prior to the effective date of a policy, shall deliver written notice to the prospective insured disclosing the relationship between the producer and the controlled insurer. If the insurance is placed through a subproducer who is not a controlling producer, the controlling producer must retain in the records of the controlling producer a signed commitment from the subproducer that the subproducer is aware of the relationship between the insurer and the producer and that the subproducer has or will notify the insured of the relationship. [1993 c.447 §61]

 

      Note: See note under 732.810.

 

      732.814 Authority of director over controlling producer and controlled insurer. (1) If the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services believes that the controlling producer or any other person has not complied with ORS 732.810 to 732.814 or any rule adopted or order issued thereunder, the director may order the controlling producer to cease placing insurance with the controlled insurer.

      (2) If the director finds that the controlled insurer or any policyholder of the controlled insurer has suffered any loss or damage because the controlling producer or any other person has not complied with ORS 732.810 to 732.814 or any rule adopted or issued thereunder, the director may maintain a civil action or intervene in an action brought by or on behalf of the insurer or policyholder for recovery of compensatory damages for the benefit of the insurer or policyholder or other appropriate relief.

      (3) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of the controlled insurer has been entered pursuant to ORS chapter 734 and the receiver appointed under that order believes that the controlling producer or any other person has not complied with ORS 732.810 to 732.814 or any rule adopted or order issued thereunder, and if the insurer suffered any loss or damage because of the noncompliance, the receiver may maintain a cause of action for recovery of damages or other appropriate sanctions for the benefit of the insurer.

      (4) This section does not affect the authority of the director to take any other administrative action under the Insurance Code.

      (5) This section does not alter or affect the rights of policyholders, claimants, creditors or other third parties. [1993 c.447 §62]

      (G) Promulgating a code of ethics to address permissible and prohibited activities of commission members and employees.

      (H) Providing a mechanism for winding up the operations of the commission and the equitable disposition of any surplus funds that may exist after the termination of the compact after the payment or reserving of all of its debts and obligations.

      (C) Four members from those compacting states with less than two percent of the market based on the premium volume described above, with one selected from each of the four zone regions of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as provided in the bylaws.

      (b) The management committee shall have authority and duties as may be set forth in the bylaws, including but not limited to:

      (A) Managing the affairs of the commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and purposes of the commission;

      (B) Establishing and overseeing an organizational structure within, and appropriate procedures for, the commission to provide for the creation of uniform standards and other rules, receipt and review of product filings, administrative and technical support functions, review of decisions regarding the disapproval of a product filing, and the review of elections made by a compacting state to opt out of a uniform standard. However, a uniform standard shall not be submitted to the compacting states for adoption unless approved by two-thirds of the members of the management committee;

      (D) Planning, implementing and coordinating communications and activities with other state, federal and local government organizations in order to advance the goals of the commission.

      (b) The commission shall establish two advisory committees, one of which shall comprise consumer representatives independent of the insurance industry, and the other comprising insurance industry representatives.

However, this paragraph does not protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of that person.

      (b) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities.

ARTICLE VI

MEETINGS AND ACTS

OF THE COMMISSION

 

      (1) The commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this compact and the bylaws.

      (2) Each member of the commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the commission. A member shall vote in person or by such other means as provided in the bylaws. The bylaws may provide for members’ participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication.

      (3) The commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the bylaws.

 

ARTICLE VII

RULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES:

RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS

OF THE COMMISSION

AND OPTING OUT OF

UNIFORM STANDARDS

 

      (1) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. In the event the commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, then such an action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.

      (2) Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission. Before the commission adopts a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard. The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.

      (3) A uniform standard shall become effective 90 days after its adoption by the commission or on such later date as the commission may determine. However, a compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this Article. All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure or amendment.

      (4)(a) A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard either by legislation or regulation adopted by the insurance department under the compacting state’s Administrative Procedure Act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by regulation, the compacting state must:

      (A) Give written notice to the commission no later than 10 business days after the uniform standard is adopted, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state; and

      (B) Find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the residents of the state, given the conditions in the state.

      (b) The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state that warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the residents of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the residents of the state outweigh:

      (A) The intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this compact; and

      (B) The presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.

      (c) A compacting state may, at the time of its enactment of this compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in this compact. Such opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently adopted.

      (5) If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective. Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the state. If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV of this compact for withdrawals.

      (6) If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least 15 days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to 90 days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission. However, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances that warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge that prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.

      (7) Not later than 30 days after a rule or operating procedure is adopted, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure. However, the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission’s authority.

      (8) As used in this article, “opt out” means any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in an adopted uniform standard.

 

ARTICLE VIII

COMMISSION RECORDS

AND ENFORCEMENT

 

      (1) The commission shall adopt rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers’ trade secrets. The commission may adopt additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.

      (2) Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission. However, disclosure to the commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, the commission shall not be subject to the compacting state’s laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any commissioner.

      (3) The commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The commission shall notify any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in Article XIV of this compact.

      (4) Any commissioner of a compacting state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise the state’s authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state’s law. The commissioner’s enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the following provisions:

      (a) With respect to the commissioner’s market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the compact except upon a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission.

      (b) Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize the action. However, authorization under this paragraph does not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the commission’s action on such requests.

 

ARTICLE IX

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 

      The commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this compact and that may arise among two or more compacting states, or between compacting states and noncompacting states. The commission shall adopt an operating procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.

 

ARTICLE X

PRODUCT FILING AND APPROVAL

 

      (1) Insurers and third-party filers seeking to have a product approved by the commission shall file the product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the commission. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the insurance department in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.

      (2) The commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to commission rules and operating procedures. The commission shall adopt rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such rules, the commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a product filing or supporting information.

      (3) Any product approved by the commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.

 

ARTICLE XI

REVIEW OF COMMISSION DECISIONS

REGARDING FILINGS

 

      (1) Not later than 30 days after the commission has given notice of a disapproved product or advertisement filed with the commission, the insurer or third-party filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the commission. The commission shall adopt rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law is subject to judicial review in accordance with subsection (4) of Article III of this compact.

      (2) The commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in subsection (1) of this Article.

 

ARTICLE XII

FINANCE

 

      (1) The commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, compacting states and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the commission concerning the performance of its duties is not compromised.

      (2) The commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third-party filer filing a product with the commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the commission’s annual budget.

      (3) The commission’s budget for a fiscal year may not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in Article VII of this compact.

      (4) The commission shall be exempt from all taxation in and by the compacting states.

      (5) The commission may not pledge the credit of any compacting state, except by and with the appropriate legal authority of that compacting state.

      (6) The commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements of all funds under its control. The internal financial accounts of the commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its bylaws. The financial accounts and reports including the system of internal controls and procedures of the commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. Upon the determination of the commission, but no less frequently than every three years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the commission. The commission shall make an annual report to the governor and legislature of the compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The commission’s internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the commissioner of any compacting state upon request. However, any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers’ proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.

      (7) A compacting state does not have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the commission or to any commission funds held under the provisions of this compact.

 

ARTICLE XIII

COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT

 

      (1) Any state is eligible to become a compacting state.

      (2) The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by two compacting states. However, the commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting uniform standards for, reviewing and giving approval or disapproval of products filed with the commission that satisfy applicable uniform standards only after 26 states are compacting states or, alternatively, states representing greater than 40 percent of the premium volume for life insurance, annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance products, based on records of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for the prior year, are compacting states. Thereafter, the compact becomes effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state.

      (3) Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the commission for enactment by the compacting states. An amendment does not become effective and binding upon the commission and the compacting states unless and until all compacting states enact the amendment into law.

 

ARTICLE XIV

WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT

AND TERMINATION

 

      (1)(a) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state. However, a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.

      (b) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in paragraph (e) of this subsection.

      (c) The commissioner of a withdrawing state shall immediately notify the management committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.

      (d) The commission shall notify the other compacting states of the introduction of such legislation within 10 days after its receipt of notice thereof.

      (e) The withdrawing state is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state. The commission’s approval of products and advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the withdrawing state, unless formally rescinded by the withdrawing state in the same manner as provided by the laws of the withdrawing state for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.

      (f) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the effective date of the withdrawing state reenacting the compact.

      (2)(a) If the commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or adopted rules or operating procedures, then the commission may suspend, after notice and hearing as set forth in the bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact on the defaulting state from the effective date of default as fixed by the commission. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in commission rules. The commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the defaulting state’s suspension pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.

      (b) Product approvals by the commission or product self-certifications, or any advertisement in connection with such product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the defaulting state in the same manner as if the defaulting state had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to subsection (1) of this Article.

      (c) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires a reenactment of the compact.

      (3)(a) Dissolution of the compact is effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state that reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.

      (b) Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

 

ARTICLE XV

SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION

 

      (1) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.

      (2) The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed.

 

ARTICLE XVI

BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT

AND OTHER LAWS

 

      (1)(a) This compact does not prevent the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) For any product approved or certified to the commission, the rules, uniform standards and any other requirements of the commission shall constitute the exclusive provisions applicable to the content, approval and certification of such products. For advertisement that is subject to the commission’s authority, any rule, uniform standard or other requirement of the commission that governs the content of the advertisement shall constitute the exclusive provision that a commissioner may apply to the content of the advertisement.

      (B) Remedies available under state law related to breach of contract, tort or other laws not specifically directed to the content of the product;

      (C) State law relating to the construction of insurance contracts; or

      (c) All insurance products filed with individual states shall be subject to the laws of those states.

      (2)(a) All lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and operating procedures adopted by the commission, are binding upon the compacting states.

      (b) All agreements between the commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.

      (c) Upon the request of a party to a conflict over the meaning or interpretation of commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation in dispute.

      (d) In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by that provision upon the commission shall be ineffective as to that compacting state, and those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.
