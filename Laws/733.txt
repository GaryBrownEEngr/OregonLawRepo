      (1) Cash in the possession or control of the insurer, including the true balance of any deposit in a solvent bank or trust company.

      (4) Due premiums, deferred premiums, installment premiums, and written obligations taken for premiums, to the extent allowed by the director.

      (5) The amount recoverable from a reinsurer if credit for reinsurance may be allowed to the insurer under ORS 731.509 or 731.510 and amounts receivable on assumed reinsurance representing funds withheld by a solvent ceding insurer under a reinsurance treaty.

      (7) Other assets considered by the director to be available for the payment of losses and claims, at values determined by the director. [1967 c.359 §208; 1971 c.321 §18; 1979 c.818 §1; 1993 c.447 §69; 2001 c.318 §7]

      (1) Advances to officers, other than policy loans, whether secured or not, and advances to employees, agents and other persons on personal security only.

      (2) Stock of such insurer owned by it, or any material equity therein or loans secured thereby, or any material proportionate interest in such stock acquired or held through the ownership by such insurer of an interest in another firm, corporation or business unit.

      (3) Tangible personal property, except such property as the insurer is otherwise permitted to acquire and retain as an investment under the Insurance Code and which is deemed by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to be available for the payment of losses and claims or which is otherwise expressly allowable, in whole or in part, as an asset.

      (4) The amount, if any, by which the book value of any investment as carried in the ledger assets of the insurer exceeds the value thereof as determined under the Insurance Code. [1967 c.359 §209; 2001 c.318 §8]

 

      733.030 Liabilities in general. In any determination of the financial condition of an insurer, liabilities to be charged against its assets shall be calculated in accordance with the Insurance Code and shall include:

      733.040 Reinsurance credit. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall disallow reinsurance as credit against the liabilities of a ceding insurer if credit against the liabilities of the ceding insurer is not allowed as a credit to the ceding insurer under ORS 731.509 or 731.510. [1967 c.359 §211; 1993 c.447 §70]

 

      733.050 Increase of inadequate reserves. If the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines that an insurer’s reserves, however calculated or estimated, are inadequate, the director shall require the insurer to maintain reserves in such additional amount as is needed to make them adequate. [1967 c.359 §212]

 

      733.060 Unearned premium reserve. (1) Every insurer shall maintain an unearned premium reserve on all policies in force.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may require that such reserves shall be equal to the unearned portions of the gross premiums in force as calculated pro rata on each respective risk from the policy’s date of issue. In the absence of such requirement, the unearned premium reserve shall be equal to the pro rata unearned portions of the gross premiums in force as calculated by an approximation method approved by the director. After adopting a method of computing such reserves, an insurer shall not change methods without approval of the insurance supervisory official of the insurer’s domicile.

      (3) This section does not apply to:

[1967 c.359 §214]

 

      733.080 Reserves for health insurance.

Except for policies of credit health insurance, such reserves for nondisabled lives shall not be less in the aggregate than the pro rata gross unearned premiums for such policies calculated in accordance with ORS 733.060. [1967 c.359 §215; 1971 c.231 §18]

 

      733.090 Unearned premium reserve and fund for title insurance. (1) Each title insurer shall maintain a reserve for unearned premiums on its policies in force, which shall be charged as a liability in any determination of its financial condition. Such unearned premium liability shall be separate from and in addition to the insurer’s liability for incurred but unpaid losses and loss expenses.

      (2) The amount of the unearned premium reserve shall be determined according to accounting procedures approved or required by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (3) A separate and distinct fund, known as the Title Insurance Unearned Premium Reserve Fund, shall be maintained by each title insurer in its treasury, as additional security to holders of its title insurance policies. The amount of the fund shall at least equal the amount of the unearned premium reserve liability determined in accordance with subsection (2) of this section. This fund shall be in addition to the insurer’s deposit with the Department of Consumer and Business Services and deposits required to be maintained with officials of other jurisdictions. The fund, to the extent of the unearned premium reserve on business in this state, shall be invested as provided for funds of a domestic insurer, except that ORS 733.630, 733.670 and 733.690 shall not be applicable to investment of the fund. The remainder of the fund may be similarly invested, or may be invested as permitted by the laws of the insurer’s domicile. The insurer shall keep a separate record of the cash and investments of the fund, giving complete identification of the assets belonging to the fund and showing full particulars as to withdrawals and additions. No title insurance policies shall be issued by an insurer during a period when its unearned premium reserve fund is below the required amount. [1967 c.359 §216; 1999 c.196 §10; 2001 c.318 §9]

 

      733.095 Unearned premium reserve for home protection insurance.

[1981 c.247 §11]

Without limiting the general purport of the foregoing provision, reinsurance of any substantial part of the insurer’s outstanding risks contracted for in fact within four months prior to the date of any such financial statement and canceled in fact within four months after the date of such statement, or reinsurance under which the reinsurer bears no substantial insurance risk or substantial risk of net loss to itself, shall prima facie be deemed to have been arranged for the purpose principally of deception.

      (2) The director shall disallow as an asset any deposit, funds or other assets of the insurer found by the director after a hearing thereon:

      (a) Not to be in good faith the property of the insurer;

      (b) Not freely subject to withdrawal or liquidation by the insurer at any time for the payment or discharge of claims or other obligations arising under its policies; and

      (c) To be resulting from arrangements made principally for the purpose of deception as to the insurer’s financial condition as of the date of any financial statement of the insurer. [1967 c.359 §221; 2005 c.22 §487]

 

      733.150 Alternative accounting for assets and liabilities.

[1967 c.359 §222]

 

      733.160 Valuation of assets other than securities. (1) Each bond or other evidence of debt having a fixed term and rate of interest may be valued as follows, if amply secured and not in default as to principal or interest:

      (a) If purchased at par, at the par value.

      (b) If purchased above or below par, according to an accepted method of valuation approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (2) For the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, the purchase price shall not be a higher amount than the actual market value at the time of purchase, plus actual brokerage, transfer, postage or express charges paid in the acquisition of such bond or other evidence of debt.

      (3) For purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the director may determine the method of calculating values. The method or valuation may not be inconsistent with any applicable method or valuation used by insurers in general or any such method or valuation then currently formulated or approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or its successor organization.

      (4) Real property shall be valued as follows:

      (a) Real property acquired pursuant to a mortgage loan or contract of sale shall be valued at an amount not greater than the unpaid principal of the defaulted loan or contract at the date of such acquisition, together with any taxes and expenses paid or incurred in connection with such acquisition, and the cost of improvements thereafter made by the insurer and any amounts thereafter paid by the insurer on assessments levied for improvements in connection with the property.

      (b) Other real property held by an insurer shall be valued at an amount not in excess of the cost of the acquired property and the cost of improvements thereafter made by the insurer, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.

      (5) Purchase money mortgages on real property referred to in subsection (4)(a) of this section shall be valued in an amount not exceeding the acquisition cost of the real property covered thereby or 90 percent of the fair value of such real property, whichever is less.

      (6) Other assets, other than securities, shall be valued at cost of acquisition less any repaid portion thereof, unless the director determines that another value is proper. [1967 c.359 §223; 1971 c.231 §19; 1993 c.447 §16; 2001 c.318 §11]

 

      733.165 Valuation of securities. (1) Securities held by an insurer, other than bonds or other evidences of debt to which ORS 733.160 applies, must be valued in the discretion of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services at their market value, at their appraised value or at prices determined by the director as representing their fair market value.

      (2) Preferred or guaranteed stocks or shares while paying full dividends may be carried at a fixed value instead of market value, at the discretion of the director and in accordance with any method of valuation approved by the director.

      (3) Stock of a subsidiary corporation of an insurer must not be valued at an amount in excess of the net value thereof as based upon the assets only of the subsidiary that would be eligible under ORS 733.510 to 733.780 for investment of the funds of the insurer directly.

      (4) The director may determine the method of calculating values as provided in this section, but the method or valuation may not be inconsistent with any applicable method or valuation used by insurers in general or any such method of valuation then currently formulated or approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or its successor organization. [1993 c.447 §18; 2001 c.318 §17]

 

      733.170 Accounts and records. An insurer shall keep its books, records, accounts and transaction source data in such manner that the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may readily verify its statements of financial condition and ascertain whether the insurer is unimpaired, has given proper treatment to policyholders and has complied with the Insurance Code. [Formerly 738.430]

 

      733.180 [Formerly 739.075; repealed by 1973 c.435 §27]

      733.200 [Formerly 739.085; repealed by 1973 c.435 §27]

 

      733.210 Director’s determinations. (1) In making any determination or prescribing rules relating to items such as are reported in the form of annual statement and any supplement thereto required to be filed by an insurer, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall give consideration to recommendations made from time to time by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and to customary and general practice in insurance accounting.

      (2) The director may apply and may require insurers to use and comply with standards, practices and procedures established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in its manuals or other publications, including actuarial, accounting and other opinion and reporting requirements. [1967 c.359 §228; 1993 c.447 §20]

 

      733.220 Establishment and regulation of separate accounts to fund life insurance or annuities. (1) A domestic insurer authorized to transact life insurance may establish one or more separate accounts and may allocate thereto amounts, including but not limited to proceeds applied under optional modes of settlement or under dividend options, to provide for life insurance or annuities or benefits incidental thereto, payable in fixed or variable amounts or both.

      (2) The income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to a separate account shall be credited to or charged against the account without regard to other income, gains and losses of the insurer.

      (3) Except with the approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and under the conditions the Director may prescribe as to investments and other matters that shall recognize the guaranteed nature of the benefits, assets representing reserves for benefits guaranteed as to dollar amount and duration, and for funds guaranteed as to principal amount or stated rate of interest, shall not be maintained in a separate account.

      (4) Unless otherwise approved by the director, and notwithstanding ORS 733.160 or 733.165, assets allocated to a separate account shall be valued at their market value on the date of valuation. If there is no readily available market, they shall be valued as provided under the terms of the policy, the rules or other written agreement applicable to the separate account. Except as may be otherwise prescribed by the director under subsection (3) of this section, however, the portion if any of the assets of a separate account equal to the insurer’s reserves for guaranteed benefits and funds shall be valued in accordance with the rules applicable to the insurer’s general assets.

      (5) Amounts allocated to a separate account in the exercise of the power granted by this section are owned by the insurer, and the insurer is not, nor shall it hold itself out to be, a trustee with respect to such amounts. If, and to the extent, it is so provided under the applicable policies, the portion of the assets of a separate account which equals the reserves and other policy liabilities for such account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the insurer conducts.

      (6) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets may be made by an insurer between any of its separate accounts or between any other investment account and one or more of its separate accounts unless:

      (a) In the case of a transfer into a separate account, the transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the policies applicable to the account;

      (b) In the case of other transfers, the director has approved the transfer as being equitable; and

      (c) The transfer is made in the form of cash or, with the approval of the director, securities having a readily determinable market value.

      (7) The same separate account may not be used for both variable annuities and variable life insurance.

      (8) The insurer shall maintain in each separate account assets with a value at least equal to the reserves and other policy liabilities for such account. [1973 c.435 §6; 1993 c.447 §112]

 

      733.230 Transactions of separate accounts registered with Securities and Exchange Commission; application of laws and rules to members of separate account management committee. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law a domestic insurer may:

      (a) With respect to a separate account registered with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission as a unit investment trust, exercise voting rights, in connection with any securities of a regulated investment company registered under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and held in such account, in accordance with instructions from persons having interests in such account, ratably as determined by the insurer; and

      (b) With respect to a separate account registered with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission as a management investment company, establish for such account a committee, board, or other body, the members of which need not be otherwise affiliated with the insurer and may be elected by the vote of persons having interests in such account, ratably as determined by the insurer. Such committee, board or other body may have the power, exercisable alone or in conjunction with others, to manage the separate account and the investment of its assets.

      (2) The insurer or such committee, board or other body may make such other provisions in respect to the separate account as may be considered necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state laws, if the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services approves such provisions as not being hazardous to the insurer’s policyholders or the public in this state.

      (3) Any provision of the Insurance Code or rule of the director applicable to the officers or directors of an insurer and relating to conflicts of interest will also apply to members of a separate account’s committee, board or other similar body. No officer or director of an insurer nor any member of the committee, board or body of a separate account shall receive directly or indirectly any commission or any other compensation with respect to the purchase or sale of assets of the separate account. [1973 c.435 §7; 1997 c.249 §218]

(1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities for all outstanding life insurance policies and annuity and pure endowment contracts of every life insurer doing business in this state, and may certify the amount of any such reserves, specifying the mortality table or tables, rate or rates of interest, and methods, net level premium method or other, used in the calculations of such reserves.

      Sec. 14. For accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under section 12 of this 2015 Act [733.328]. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services by rule shall adopt the minimum standard of valuation for disability, accident and sickness, accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date stated in ORS 743.204 (2) for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance and before the operative date of the valuation manual. [2015 c.547 §14]

      Sec. 15. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) or (4) of this section, for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under section 12 of this 2015 Act [733.328].

      (2) In the absence of a specific valuation requirement, or if a specific valuation requirement in the valuation manual does not, in the opinion of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, comply with the Standard Valuation Law, the insurer shall comply with minimum valuation standards the director adopts by rule.

      (3) The director may engage a qualified actuary at the insurer’s expense to perform an actuarial examination of the insurer and to issue an opinion as to the appropriateness of any reserve assumption or method the insurer uses, or to review and issue an opinion as to an insurer’s compliance with any requirement set forth in the Standard Valuation Law. With respect to provisions in the Standard Valuation Law, the director may rely on the opinion of a qualified actuary that the director of another state, district or territory of the United States employs, contracts with or otherwise engages.

      (4) The director may require an insurer to change any assumption or method that, in the director’s opinion, is necessary to comply with the requirements of the valuation manual or the Standard Valuation Law. The insurer shall adjust the reserves as the director requires. The director may take other disciplinary action in accordance with the requirements for a contested case proceeding under ORS 183. [2015 c.547 §15]

      Sec. 16. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall prescribe the form of the valuation manual. The director shall consider and may prescribe the valuation manual or other form that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners establishes, including instructions that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners prepares for complying with the valuation manual. If the director adopts the valuation manual and instructions that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners establishes, an insurer that submits the opinion required under section 13 of this 2015 Act [733.331] must complete the opinion according to the instructions. The director may require the insurer to file information in addition to the information required in the valuation manual.

      (2) The director shall adopt the valuation manual and specify the operative date of the valuation manual as January 1 of the first calendar year after the first July 1 in which the director determines that all of the following have occurred:

      (a) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the valuation manual with an affirmative vote of at least 42 members, or three-fourths of the members voting, whichever is greater.

      (b) States that represent 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the annual statements submitted in 2008 for accident and health, fraternal, health or life insurance have enacted the Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2009, or legislation that includes substantially similar terms and provisions.

      (c) At least 42 jurisdictions out of the 50 states of the United States, American Samoa, the American Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico have enacted the Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2009, or legislation that includes substantially similar terms and provisions.

      (3) Unless a change in the valuation manual specifies a later effective date, changes to the valuation manual are effective on the date the director specifies in adopting the change. In determining the effective date of a change to the valuation manual, the director may specify the effective date as January 1 of the first calendar year after the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted the change to the valuation manual with an affirmative vote that represents:

      (a) At least three-fourths of the members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners voting, but not less than a majority of the total membership; and

      (b) Members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners who represent jurisdictions totaling more than 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the annual statements submitted for accident and health, fraternal, health or life insurance that were most recently available before the vote described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (4) The valuation manual must specify all of the following:

      (a) Minimum valuation standards for, and definitions of, the policies or contracts that are subject to section 12 of this 2015 Act [733.328]. The minimum valuation standards must be:

      (A) The director’s reserve valuation method for life insurance contracts, other than annuity contracts, that are subject to section 12 of this 2015 Act;

      (B) The director’s annuity reserve valuation method for annuity contracts that are subject to section 12 of this 2015 Act; and

      (C) Minimum reserves for all other policies or contracts that are subject to section 12 of this 2015 Act.

      (b) Policies or contracts or types of policies or contracts that are subject to the requirements of a principle-based valuation under section 17 of this 2015 Act and the minimum valuation standards that are consistent with the requirements.

      (c) For policies and contracts that are subject to a principle-based valuation under section 17 of this 2015 Act:

      (A) Requirements for the format of reports to the director under section 17 (3)(c) of this 2015 Act and information that is necessary to determine if the valuation is appropriate and complies with the Standard Valuation Law;

      (B) Assumptions for risks over which the insurer does not have significant control or influence; and

      (C) Procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial function, and a process for waiving or modifying the procedures in appropriate cases.

      (d) For policies that are not subject to a principle-based valuation under section 17 of this 2015 Act, that the minimum valuation standard must:

      (A) Be consistent with the minimum standard of valuation before the operative date of the valuation manual; or

      (B) Specify reserves that quantify the benefits, guarantees and funding associated with the contracts and the contracts’ risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring.

      (e) The data and the form of the data required under section 18 of this 2015 Act [733.334], to whom the data must be submitted and any related items, including data analyses and reporting of analyses, that may be required.

      (f) Other requirements that include, but are not limited to, requirements that relate to reserve methods, models for measuring risk, generation of economic scenarios, assumptions, margins, use of insurer experience, risk measurement, disclosure, certifications, reports, actuarial opinions and memorandums, transition rules and internal controls. [2015 c.547 §16]

      Sec. 17. (1) As used in this section, “tail risk” means a risk that occurs either when the frequency of low probability events is higher than expected under a normal probability distribution or when there are observed events of very significant size or magnitude.

      (2) An insurer must establish reserves using a principle-based valuation that requires for policies or contracts, as specified in the valuation manual:

      (a) A quantification of the benefits, guarantees and funding associated with the contracts and the contracts’ risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the lifetime of the contracts. For policies or contracts with significant tail risk, the valuation must quantify the tail risk by including assumptions concerning appropriately adverse conditions.

      (b) Assumptions, risk analysis methods, financial models and management techniques that are consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, assumptions, risk analysis methods, financial models and management techniques that the insurer uses within the insurer’s overall risk assessment process, while recognizing potential differences in financial reporting structures and any prescribed assumptions or methods.

      (c) Assumptions that are derived from:

      (A) A prescription in the valuation manual; or

      (B) If the valuation manual does not have a prescription, from other methods that are established using:

      (i) The insurer’s available experience, to the extent that the insurer’s experience is relevant and statistically credible; or

      (ii) Other relevant, statistically credible experience if the insurer’s experience is not available, relevant or statistically credible.

      (d) Margins for uncertainty, including adverse deviation and estimation error, such that the greater the uncertainty the larger the margin and resulting reserve.

      (3) An insurer that uses a principle-based valuation for one or more policies or contracts that are subject to this section, as specified in the valuation manual, shall:

      (a) Establish procedures for corporate governance and for overseeing the actuarial valuation function that are consistent with the procedures described in the valuation manual.

      (b) Provide to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the insurer’s board of directors an annual certification of the effectiveness of internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation. The controls must be designed to ensure that all material risks inherent in the liabilities and associated assets that are subject to the valuation are included in the valuation, and that the insurer makes valuations in accordance with the valuation manual. The insurer shall base the certification on the controls that are in place as of the end of the preceding calendar year.

      (c) Develop, and file with the director upon request, a principle-based valuation report that complies with standards prescribed in the valuation manual.

      (4) A principle-based valuation may include a prescribed formulaic reserve component. [2015 c.547 §17]

      (1) For individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued prior to January 1, 1979, excluding any disability and accidental death benefit in such contracts, the 1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table, or any modification of that table approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and six percent interest for single premium immediate annuity contracts, and four percent interest for all other individual annuity and pure endowment contracts.

      (2) For individual single premium immediate annuity contracts issued on or after January 1, 1979, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, the 1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table or any individual annuity mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is approved by rule adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such contracts, or any modification of these tables approved by the director, and seven and one-half percent interest.

      (3) For individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued on or after January 1, 1979, other than single premium immediate annuity contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, the 1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table or any individual annuity mortality table adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is approved by rule adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such contracts, or any modification of these tables approved by the director, and five and one-half percent interest for single premium deferred annuity and pure endowment contracts and four and one-half percent interest for all other such individual annuity and pure endowment contracts.

      (4) For all annuities and pure endowments purchased prior to January 1, 1979, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits purchased under such contracts, the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table or any modification of this table approved by the director, and six percent interest.

      (5) For all annuities and pure endowments purchased on or after January 1, 1979, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits purchased under such contracts, the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table, or any group annuity mortality table adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that is approved by the director by rule for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such annuities and pure endowments, or any modification of these tables approved by the director, and seven and one-half percent interest. [1991 c.401 §21]

 

      733.310 Interest rates for determining minimum standard for valuation. (1) The interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of the following shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this section:

      (a) All life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date stated in ORS 743.215 for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance;

      (b) All individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1982;

      (c) All annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1982, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; and

      (d) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1982, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts.

      (2) Calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be established as follows:

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, “I”, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent:

      (A) For life insurance:

      I=0.03+W(R1−0.03)+W/2(R2−0.09)

      (B) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options,

      I=0.03+W(R−0.03)

            where R1 is the lesser of R and 0.09, R2 is the greater of R and 0.09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this section and W is the weighting factor defined in this section.

 

      (C) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the formula for life insurance stated in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of 10 years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less.

      (D) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply.

      (E) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply.

      (b) If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this paragraph differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying this paragraph, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined in 1979, and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of the operative date of ORS 743.215 as part of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance.

      (3) Weighting factors shall be as follows:

      (a) The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated in subsection (2) of this section are given in the following tables:

      (A) Weighting Factors for Life Insurance:

 

      Guarantee

      Duration                                        Weighting

      (Years)                                          Factors

      More than 10, but less than 20      0.45

      More than 20                                 0.35

 

 

For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values or both that are guaranteed in the original policy.

      (B) Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options is 0.80.

      (C) Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, shall be as specified in the following tables (i), (ii) and (iii), according to the rules and definitions in the following tables (iv), (v) and (vi):

      (i) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:

 

      Guarantee                                      Weighting Factor

      Duration                                        for Plan Type

      (Years)                                          A         B         C

      5 or less:                                        0.80     0.60     0.50

      More than 5, but not more

      than 10:                                         0.75     0.60     0.50

      More than 10, but not more

      than 20:                                         0.65     0.50     0.45

      More than 20:                                0.45     0.35     0.35

 

      (ii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in table (i) above increased by:

 

            Plan Type

            A         B         C

            0.15     0.25     0.05

 

      (iii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis, other than those with no cash settlement options, that do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis that do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in (i) or derived in (ii) increased by:

 

            Plan Type

            A         B         C

            0.05     0.05     0.05

 

      (iv) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guaranteed duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guaranteed duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.

      (v) Plan type as used in the tables in this subsection is defined as follows:

 

      Plan Type A: At any time the policyholder: (1) may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or (2) may withdraw funds without such adjustment but only in installments over five years or more; or (3) may withdraw funds only as an immediate life annuity; or (4) is not permitted to make a withdrawal.

 

      Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, the policyholder: (1) may withdraw funds only with adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or (2) may withdraw funds without such adjustment but only in installments over five years or more; or (3) is not permitted to make a withdrawal. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over a period of less than five years.

 

      Plan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either: (1) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or (2) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.

 

      (b) An insurer may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this paragraph, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.

      (4) The reference interest rate referred to in subsection (2) of this section is defined as follows:

      (a) For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

      (b) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

      (c) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subsection, with guarantee duration in excess of 10 years, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

      (d) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subsection, with guarantee duration of 10 years or less, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

      (e) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

      (f) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

      (5) In the event that the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds is no longer published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services by rule may adopt an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate. The director shall consider the alternative method adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. An insurer may substitute the alternative method adopted by rule. [1991 c.401 §22]

 

      733.312 Amount of required reserves for life insurance policies. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 733.314 and 733.320, reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of A over B, as follows:

      (a) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due, except that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19 year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy.

      (b) A net one year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first policy year.

      (2) For any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date, which is defined as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium, shall, except as otherwise provided in ORS 733.320, be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in subsection (1) of this section and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in subsection (1) of this section, but with (i) the value defined in subsection (1)(a) of this section being reduced by 15 percent of the amount of the excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. The mortality and interest bases stated in ORS 733.306 and 733.310 shall be used for the purpose of making the comparison.

      (3) Reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method shall be calculated by a method consistent with subsections (1) and (2) of this section for:

      (a) Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;

      (b) Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended;

      (c) Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and

      (d) All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts. [1991 c.401 §23]

 

      733.314 Amount of required reserves for certain annuity and pure endowment contracts. (1) This section applies to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended.

      (2) Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values. [1991 c.401 §24]

 

      733.316 Aggregate reserves. (1) The aggregate reserves of an insurer for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued on or after the operative date stated in ORS 743.204 for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, shall not be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in ORS 733.312, 733.314, 733.320 and 733.322 and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for such policies.

      (2) The aggregate reserves of an insurer for all policies, contracts and benefits shall not be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by ORS 733.304. [1991 c.401 §25; 2015 c.547 §24]

 

      Note: The amendments to 733.316 by section 24, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, apply for a limited period. See section 28, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015 (second note under 733.302). The text that is applicable for the limited period is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      733.316. (1) The aggregate reserves of an insurer for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued on or after the operative date stated in ORS 743.204 for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, may not be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in ORS 733.312, 733.314, 733.320 and 733.322 and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for such policies.

      (2) The aggregate reserves of an insurer for all policies, contracts and benefits may not be less than the aggregate reserves that the appointed actuary determines to be necessary to render the opinion required by ORS 733.304.

 

      733.318 Alternative standards of valuation. (1) Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date stated in ORS 743.204 for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to the operative date.

      (2) Reserves for any category of policies, contracts or benefits as established by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, issued on or after the operative date stated in ORS 743.204 for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for the category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in ORS 733.300 to 733.340 and sections 14 to 17, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided in the policies or contracts.

      (3) An insurer that at any time has adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in ORS 733.300 to 733.340 and sections 14 to 17, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, may, with the approval of the director, adopt any lower standard of valuation. The standard shall not be lower than the minimum provided in ORS 733.300 to 733.340 and sections 14 to 17, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, except that for the purposes of this subsection, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by ORS 733.304 shall not be deemed to be the adoption of such a higher standard of valuation. [1991 c.401 §26; 2015 c.547 §25]

 

      Note: The amendments to 733.318 by section 25, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, apply for a limited period. See section 28, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015 (second note under 733.302). The text that is applicable for the limited period is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      733.318. (1) Reserves for policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date stated in ORS 743.204 for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to the operative date.

      (2) Reserves for any category of policies, contracts or benefits as established by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, issued on or after the operative date stated in ORS 743.204 for the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for the category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in ORS 733.300 to 733.340 and sections 14 to 17, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, may not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided in the policies or contracts.

      (3) An insurer that adopts at any time a standard of valuation that produces greater aggregate reserves than the aggregate reserves calculated according to the minimum standard provided in ORS 733.300 to 733.340 and sections 14 to 17, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, may, with the approval of the director, adopt any lower standard of valuation. The standard may not be lower than the minimum provided in ORS 733.300 to 733.340 and sections 14 to 17, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, except that for the purposes of this subsection, holding additional reserves that the appointed actuary previously determined to be necessary to render the opinion required by ORS 733.304 does not constitute the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.

 

      733.320 Minimum required reserve for certain policies. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, if in any contract year the gross premium charged by an insurer on any life insurance policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subsection are the standards stated in ORS 733.306 and 733.310.

      (2) For any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than the excess premium, subsection (1) of this section shall apply as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for the policy were the method described in ORS 733.312 (1). The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with ORS 733.312, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this section. [1991 c.401 §27]

 

      733.322 Calculation of reserves for plans for which minimum reserves cannot be determined under ORS 733.312, 733.314 or 733.320; rules. (1) For any plan of life insurance that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity that is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in ORS 733.312, 733.314 and 733.320, the reserves held under any such plan must:

      (a) Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and

      (b) Be computed by a method that is consistent with the principles of ORS 733.300 to 733.340 and sections 14 to 17, chapter 547, Oregon Laws 2015, as determined by rules adopted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (2) Any policy, contract or certificate providing life insurance under a plan referred to in subsection (1) of this section must be reviewed and specifically approved by the director before it can be marketed, issued, delivered or used in this state. [1991 c.401 §28]

      (a) Excluding the admitted value of investments in subsidiaries of the insurer;

      (b) Adding the total moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiary or the shareholders’ equity of a noninsurance subsidiary, whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities;

      (b) For the purpose of this subsection, the total investment of the insurer includes:

      (4) With the approval of the director, an insurer may invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one or more subsidiaries. However, after such an investment, the insurer’s combined capital and surplus must be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to the insurer’s financial needs.

      (5) Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one or more subsidiaries that an insurer makes in accordance with subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section are not subject to restrictions or prohibitions set forth in the Insurance Code that would otherwise apply to an insurer’s investments.

      (6) An insurer must determine whether any investment pursuant to subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section meets the applicable requirements on the last day of the month that immediately precedes the day on which the investment is made. The determination must be made prior to the investment by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day the investments were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.
