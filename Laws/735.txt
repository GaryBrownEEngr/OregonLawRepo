      (3) To encourage maximum use, in obtaining essential property insurance, of the normal insurance market provided by authorized insurers.

      (4) To provide for the equitable distribution among authorized insurers of the responsibility for insuring certain insurable property for which essential property insurance cannot be obtained through the normal insurance market by the establishment of the Oregon FAIR Plan Association. [1971 c.321 §2]

 

      735.025 Construction. ORS 735.005 to 735.145 shall be liberally construed to effect the purpose provided in ORS 735.015. [1971 c.321 §3]

 

      735.035 Application. ORS 735.005 to 735.145 apply only to essential property insurance on domestic risks. [1971 c.321 §4]

 

      735.045 Oregon FAIR Plan Association; insurers required to be members; plan of operation. There is hereby created the Oregon FAIR Plan Association. Each insurer that is a member insurer shall become and remain a member of the association as a condition of its authority to transact insurance in this state. The association shall perform its functions in accordance with a plan of operation established pursuant to ORS 735.085, and shall exercise its powers through its board of directors. [1971 c.321 §6]

 

      735.055 Association board of directors; appointment; compensation, expenses of members; quorum. (1) The board of directors of the Oregon FAIR Plan Association shall consist of five members selected by the member insurers, subject to the approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and four persons selected by the Governor, one of whom shall be an insurance producer holding an appointment as an Oregon insurance producer of a member insurer. Of the other three persons appointed by the Governor, one shall be a resident of a county of over 400,000 population and none shall have been an employee or insurance producer of a member insurer. The term of each member shall be as specified in the plan, but in no event for longer than four years. A vacancy on the board shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term in the same manner as for the initial selection.

      (2) In making or approving selections to the board, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall consider among other things whether member insurers are fairly represented.

      (3) A member of the board shall receive no compensation for services as a member. However, a member shall be reimbursed from the assets of the association for actual and necessary travel and other expenses incurred by the member in the performance of duties.

      (b) Assess member insurers the amounts necessary to pay the expenses incurred by the association in meeting its obligations and exercising its duties and powers under ORS 735.005 to 735.145.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section, the assessment of each member insurer for a particular calendar year shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the second preceding calendar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the second preceding calendar year. Each member insurer shall be notified of an assessment not later than the 30th day before the day it is due. If the funds of the association do not provide in any one year an amount sufficient to pay the expenses of the association, the funds available shall be prorated among the expenses and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available. If an assessment would cause a member insurer’s financial statement to reflect an amount of surplus less than the minimum amount required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insured is authorized to transact insurance, the association may, in whole or in part, exempt the member insurer from payment of the assessment or defer payments.

      (3)(a) The maximum assessment of a member insurer for any calendar year shall be two percent of the insurer’s net direct written premiums for the second preceding calendar year.

      (b) The minimum assessment of a member insurer for any calendar year shall be $50.

      (4) Reimburse inspection bureaus, service insurers and employees of the association for expenses incurred in the inspection or insuring of property on behalf of the association, and pay all other expenses the association incurs in carrying out the provisions of ORS 735.005 to 735.145.

      (5) Undertake a continuing public education program in cooperation with member insurers and insurance producers to assure that the plan receives adequate attention.

      (6) Undertake a continuing education program to advise the public of the steps which may be taken to make property more insurable against crime, personal liability and the perils named in ORS 735.005 (3). [1971 c.321 §8; 1979 c.818 §3; 2003 c.364 §89]

      (6) Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to carry out ORS 735.005 to 735.145. [1971 c.321 §9]

The plan of operation, and any amendments thereto, shall become effective upon approval in writing by the director.

      (2) If the association fails to submit a plan that receives the approval of the director as provided in subsection (1) of this section, or if the association after such approval fails to maintain a plan satisfactory to the director, the director shall by rule prescribe a plan of operation that meets the standards provided in subsection (1) of this section. A plan prescribed by the director shall remain in effect until the director by rule provides otherwise.

MARKET ASSISTANCE PLANS; JOINT UNDERWRITING ASSOCIATIONS

 

      735.200 Legislative findings; purpose. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (a) Some businesses and service providers in Oregon have experienced major problems in both the availability and affordability of commercial liability insurance. Premiums for such insurance policies have recently grown as much as 500 percent and the availability of such insurance in Oregon markets has greatly diminished.

      (b) These businesses and service providers are essential to achieve goals such as increased workforce productivity, family self-sufficiency and the maintenance and improvement of the health of the citizens of Oregon. The lack of adequate commercial liability insurance threatens these businesses and services.

      (2) The Legislative Assembly therefore declares it is the purpose of ORS 735.200 to 735.260 to remedy the problem of unavailable commercial liability insurance for these businesses and service providers by authorizing the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to assist in the establishment of a market assistance plan for providing commercial liability insurance for these businesses and service providers, or, if necessary, by requiring all insurers authorized to write commercial liability insurance in Oregon to be members of one or more joint underwriting associations created to provide commercial liability insurance for these businesses and service providers. [1987 c.774 §73]

 

      735.205 Definitions for ORS 735.200 to 735.260. As used in ORS 735.200 to 735.260:

      (1) “Joint underwriting association” means a mechanism requiring casualty insurers doing business in Oregon to provide commercial liability insurance to certain businesses and service providers on either an assigned risk basis or through a joint underwriting pool underwritten to standards adopted under the Insurance Code.

      (2) “Market assistance plan” means a mechanism through which admitted casualty insurers in this state provide commercial liability insurance for classes of risks designated by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. [1987 c.774 §74]

 

      735.210 Formation of market assistance plans; rules. (1) After a public hearing, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may by rule require insurers authorized to write and writing commercial liability insurance in this state to form a market assistance plan to assist businesses and service providers unable to purchase specified classes of commercial liability insurance in adequate amounts from either the admitted or nonadmitted market.

      (2) The market assistance plan shall operate under a plan of operations prepared by admitted insurers, eligible surplus line insurers and insurance producers, and approved by the director. [1987 c.774 §75; 2003 c.364 §90]

 

      735.215 Findings prior to formation of joint underwriting association; hearing. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may mandate the formation of a joint underwriting association under ORS 735.220 if after directing the formation of a market assistance plan and allowing it a reasonable time to alleviate insurance availability problems, the director finds that:

      (a) There exist in Oregon certain businesses or service providers for which no commercial liability insurance is available; and

      (b) There is a need in Oregon for the goods or services provided by these businesses or service providers and the lack of available commercial liability insurance will cause a substantial number of the entities to cease operations within the state.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the lack of availability of insurance is due to legitimate insurance underwriting considerations, including past claims experience, licensing noncompliance or inadequate risk management, formation of a joint underwriting association shall not be appropriate.

      (3) The director may make the findings required under subsection (1) of this section only after conducting a public hearing according to the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183. The director must specify the specific classes of business or lines of insurance determined to be unavailable.

      (4) At least once each year, the director shall hold a public hearing to determine if the classes of business or lines of insurance offered by the joint underwriting association are still unavailable in the voluntary insurance market. If any class or line is found to be available, the joint underwriting association shall cease to underwrite such class of business or line of insurance. [1987 c.774 §76]

 

      735.220 Formation of joint underwriting association; funds. After finding under ORS 735.215 that there is a need in Oregon for a joint underwriting association, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may form and put into operation a temporary, nonprofit, nonexclusive joint underwriting association constituting a legal entity separate and distinct from its members for commercial liability insurance subject to the conditions and limitations contained in the Insurance Code. All funds and reserves of the association shall be separately held and invested. [1987 c.774 §77]

 

      735.225 Membership in joint underwriting association. The joint underwriting association established under ORS 735.220 shall be comprised of all insurers authorized to write and who are writing commercial liability insurance within this state on a direct basis, including the commercial liability portions of multiperil policies. Every such insurer shall remain a member of the association as a condition of its authority to continue to transact insurance in this state. [1987 c.774 §78]

 

      735.230 Rates; approval. The board of directors of the joint underwriting association shall engage the services of an independent actuarial firm to develop and recommend actuarially sound rates, rating plans, rating rules and classifications. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall approve rates filed by the joint underwriting association in accordance with ORS 737.310.

      735.235 Board of directors. The joint underwriting association formed under ORS 735.220 shall be under the administrative control of a seven person board of directors appointed by the Governor. Two directors shall represent insurance carriers participating in the association; one director shall represent insurance producers; three directors shall represent the affected classes of insureds; and one director shall be a public member with no ties to the insurance industry.

[1987 c.774 §81]

 

      735.245 Conditions for policyholder surcharge. (1) Upon a determination of the board of directors that the joint underwriting association will be unable to pay its outstanding lawful obligations as they mature, the board shall certify the existence of this condition to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. A schedule for policyholder surcharges shall be submitted by the board at the time of certification.

      (2) The surcharge schedule shall become final 30 days after certification unless the director finds, after a public hearing, that the surcharge amounts are unreasonable or unjustifiable. Such surcharges may be adjusted to take into consideration the past and prospective loss and expense experience in different geographical areas within the state. Such surcharges shall be in addition to and not in lieu of the premiums charged for the coverages provided.

      (3) Moneys collected in accordance with subsection (2) of this section shall be held in a fund separate from other joint underwriting association funds. Such funds shall be invested in accordance with applicable law governing publicly held trust funds. The association shall file an annual financial statement covering such funds.

      (4) Surcharge funds shall be subject to the control of the board of directors and may be used to satisfy the legal obligations of the joint underwriting association.

      (5) No part of the profit or loss of the joint underwriting association shall inure to the benefit of any member insurer or be an obligation of any member insurer. [1987 c.774 §82]

 

      735.250 Exemption from liability. There shall be no liability or cause of action against any member insurer, self-insurer, or its agents or employees, the joint underwriting association or its agents or employees, members of the board of directors, the Department of Consumer and Business Services or its representatives for any action taken by or statement made by them in performance of their powers and duties under ORS 735.210 to 735.260. [1987 c.774 §83]

 

      735.255 State not liable to pay debts of association. The state is not liable to pay any debts or obligations of any association formed under ORS 735.220 and no person may assert any claim against the state or any of its agencies for any act or omission of the association.

Risk and rate classifications shall be established for all facets of the liquor industry including those who sell at wholesale or retail and the State of Oregon, as allowed by law.
