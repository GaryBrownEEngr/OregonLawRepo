Such insurer may so adopt the filings of a rating organization on part of the classes of risks insured by it and may make its own filings as to other classes which shall be uniform throughout the insurer’s territorial classification. This subsection does not apply to workers’ compensation insurance filings except to the extent that the rating organization filings of rating plans or systems under ORS 737.320 are complete and usable by an insurer without the addition of allowances for expenses, taxes or profit.

A filing subject to subsection (2) of this section that has not been approved or disapproved within the waiting period, or any extension thereof, shall be deemed approved.

      (4) Supporting actuarial data shall accompany every filing of commercial liability insurance rates. The data shall be in sufficient detail to justify the rate level change and shall demonstrate compliance with ORS 737.310 governing the making of rates. [1987 c.774 §48]

The director shall prescribe by rule the statistical plan for workers’ compensation insurance.

      (5)(a) The director shall designate one workers’ compensation statistical agency from the licensed rating organizations as the agent to which all licensed workers’ compensation rating organizations shall report workers’ compensation insurance statistics.

      (6) The ownership of the financial and statistical data submitted to a workers’ compensation statistical agency is vested in the submitting member insurer. The financial and statistical data shall be confidential and may not be disclosed, provided that the ownership rights of an insurer shall not limit access by the director for the purposes of performing the regulatory duties of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. [1969 c.690 §11; 1981 c.535 §17; 1983 c.360 §2; 1987 c.884 §54; 1999 c.235 §2]

 

      737.230 Data must include certain information. The data collected and maintained by each insurer, rating organization or advisory organization pursuant to ORS 737.225 shall be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the statistical significance of differences or correlations relevant to the rating plan definitions and rate differentials.

      737.235 Examining rating systems of insurers; costs. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may make or cause to be made an examination of every insurer transacting any class of insurance to which the provisions of this chapter are applicable to ascertain whether such insurer and every rate and rating system used by it for every such class of insurance complies with the requirements and standards of this chapter.

      (2) The officers, managers, agents and employees of any insurer, under examination, may be examined at any time under oath and shall exhibit all books, records, accounts, documents or agreements governing its method of operation, together with all data, statistics and information of every kind and character collected or considered by such insurer in the conduct of the operations to which such examination relates.

      (3) The reasonable cost of any examination authorized by this section shall be paid by the organization or insurer to be examined including actual necessary transportation and traveling expenses.

      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all reimbursable expenses collected by the director under subsection (3) of this section shall be deposited in the fund created by ORS 705.145 for the payment of expenses incurred in conducting the examinations authorized by this section.

[1969 c.690 §13]

 

      737.255 Authority for cooperative ratings and systems. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of this chapter authorizing insurers to be members or subscribers of rating or advisory organizations or to engage in joint underwriting or joint reinsurance, two or more insurers may act in concert with each other and with others with respect to any matters pertaining to the making of rates or rating systems, the preparation or making of insurance policy or bond forms, underwriting rules, surveys, inspections and investigations, the furnishing of loss or expense statistics or other information and data or carrying on of research. [1969 c.690 §17]

 

      737.265 Unauthorized adherence to rates, rating systems; workers’ compensation insurance policy forms.

The fact that two or more authorized insurers, whether or not members or subscribers of a rating or advisory organization, use, either consistently or intermittently, the rates or rating systems made or adopted by a rating organization, or the underwriting rules or policy or bond forms prepared by a rating or advisory organization, shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding that an agreement to so adhere exists, and may be used only for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any competent evidence of the existence of any such agreement.

      (2) Each insurer transacting workers’ compensation insurance shall adhere to the policy forms filed by the licensed workers’ compensation rating organization of which the insurer is a member and approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. [1969 c.690 §19; 1971 c.385 §4; 1977 c.333 §1; 1981 c.535 §18; 1999 c.235 §3]

      (2) An insurer that provides workers’ compensation to a worker leasing company shall maintain and report to the licensed workers’ compensation rating organization of which the insurer is a member separate statistical experience for each client of the worker leasing company according to the uniform statistical plan prescribed by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services according to ORS 737.225 (4).

      737.275 Preparation of rates, rating systems and other administrative matters by insurers under common ownership. With respect to any matters pertaining to the making of rates or rating systems, the preparation or making of insurance policy or bond forms, underwriting rules, surveys, inspections and investigations, the furnishing of loss or expense statistics or other information and data, or carrying on of research, two or more admitted insurers having a common ownership or operating in this state under common management or control are hereby authorized to act in concert between or among themselves the same as if they constituted a single insurer, and to the extent that such matters relate to co-surety bonds, two or more admitted insurers executing such bonds are hereby authorized to act in concert between or among themselves the same as if they constituted a single insurer.

      737.310 Method of rate making; factors considered; rules. The following standards shall apply to the making and use of rates:

      (1) Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.

      (2) As to all classes of insurance, other than workers’ compensation and title insurance:

      (a) No rate shall be held to be excessive unless:

      (A) Such rate is unreasonably high for the insurance provided; and

      (B) A reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area with respect to the classification to which such rate is applicable.

      (b) No rate shall be held inadequate unless such rate is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and:

      (A) Use or continued use of such rate endangers the solvency of the insurer; or

      (B) The use of such rate by the insurer has, or if continued will have, the effect of destroying competition or creating a monopoly.

      (3) Rates for each classification of coverage shall be based on the claims experience of insurers within Oregon on that classification of coverage unless that experience provides an insufficient base for actuarially sound rates.

      (4) Due consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss experience within this state, to the hazards of conflagration and catastrophe, to a reasonable margin for profit and to contingencies, to dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, to past and prospective expenses specially applicable to this state, and to all other relevant factors, including judgment factors deemed relevant, within this state.

      (5) In addition to subsection (4) of this section, rates for home protection insurance may include provision for unreimbursed costs of risk inspection and for loss costs under policies which are terminated without premium because the related home sale is not made.

      (6) In the case of fire insurance rates, consideration may be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during the most recent five-year period for which such experience is available.

      (7) The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group of insurers with respect to any class of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof for which subdivision or combination separate expenses are applicable.

      (8) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates for casualty, surety or inland marine risks may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions or both. Such standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.

      (9) Due consideration shall be given, in the making and use of rates for all insurance, to investment income earned by the insurer, to insurer profits and to accumulated reserves for vocational rehabilitation services and for claim costs related to orders or awards made pursuant to ORS 656.278.

      (10) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, by rule, shall prescribe the conditions under which a division of payroll between different manual classifications is permitted for purposes of computing workers’ compensation premiums.

      (11)(a) The director shall not approve any workers’ compensation rating system that does not include a plan for rewarding employers, however small, that have good loss experience or programs likely to improve accident prevention. However, this paragraph is not intended to require that all employers be experience rated.

      (b) The director shall not approve any workers’ compensation rating system that does not allow the insurer to include potential third party recovery as one of the variables in the claims reserving process.

      (12) At the time an insurer issues a workers’ compensation insurance policy to an insured for the first time, the insurer shall give written notice to the insured of the rating classifications to which the insured’s employees are to be assigned and shall provide an adequate description of work activities in each classification. In the event an insurer recommences coverage following its termination, the notice required under this subsection must be given only if the gap in coverage exceeds six months.

      (13) If an insurer determines the workers’ compensation insurance policy of an insured needs reclassification, the insurer:

      (a) May bill an additional premium for the revised classification after the insurer has provided the insured at least 60 days’ written notice of the reclassification.

      (b) Shall bill retroactively to policy inception or date of change in insured’s operations for any reclassification that results in a net reduction of premium.

      (c) May, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, retroactively bill an insured for reclassification during the policy year without prior notice of reclassification if the insurer shows by a preponderance of the evidence that:

      (A) The insured knew that the employees were misclassified, or the insured was adequately informed by the insurer of the proper classification for the insured’s employees;

      (B) The insured provided improper or inaccurate information concerning its operations; or

      (C) The insured’s operations changed after the date information on the employees was obtained from the insured.

      (14) In consultation with system participants, the director shall analyze the rating classification system to investigate changes that simplify the system and reduce costs for employers and insurers while preserving rate equity and minimizing the potential for abuse. The director shall give particular emphasis to the method of allocating payroll to rating classifications and to alternatives to methods that require verifiable payroll records. Upon completion of this analysis, the director shall implement appropriate changes to the system.

      (15) The director shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section and may by rule specify procedures relating to rating and ratemaking by workers’ compensation insurers.

      (16) A rate increase based solely upon an insured’s attaining or exceeding 65 years of age shall be presumed to be unfairly discriminatory unless the increase is clearly based on sound actuarial principles or is related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience.

      737.312 Agreements among insurers for assignment of risks; rate modifications. Agreements may be made among insurers with respect to the equitable apportionment among them of insurance which may be afforded applicants who are in good faith entitled to such insurance but who are unable to procure such insurance through ordinary methods. Such insurers may agree among themselves on the use of reasonable rate modifications for such insurance, such agreements and rate modifications to be subject to the approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      737.316 Combining employers for workers’ compensation insurance; conditions.

      (1) All the employers in the group are members of an organization.

      (2) The employers in the group constitute at least 50 percent of the employers in the organization, unless the number of covered workers in the group exceeds 500, in which case the employers in the group must constitute at least 25 percent of the employers in the organization.

      (3) The grouping of employers is likely to substantially improve accident prevention, claims handling for the employers and reduce expenses. [1983 c.706 §6; 1990 c.1 §4]

 

      737.318 Premium audit program for workers’ compensation insurance; rules; penalties. (1) A workers’ compensation insurer shall maintain a premium audit program to aid in achieving equitable premium charges to Oregon employers and for the collection of credible statewide data for ratemaking.

      (d) An appeal process pursuant to ORS 737.505 for employers to question the results of a premium audit. This process must include written notification to the employer that is included in the final premium audit billing that informs the employer of appeal rights to the director under ORS 737.505, of the requirement that a written request to initiate an appeal must be received by the director not later than the 60th day after the employer receives the final premium audit billing and of any other information the director may request by rule; and

      (e) Civil penalties pursuant to ORS 731.988 for violations of prescribed standards of the premium audit system.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 737.505, the provisions of this section apply to all premium audit disputes between employers and insurers in existence on July 20, 1987, regardless of the policy year involved or the date of the final audit billing. [1987 c.884 §8; 1999 c.1020 §5]

 

      737.320 Review of certain filings; effective date of filings; investigation and evaluation of workers’ compensation rate filings. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall review title insurance filings, and each workers’ compensation insurance filing, as soon as reasonably possible after they have been made in order to determine whether they meet the requirements of this chapter.

      (2) The effective date of each title and workers’ compensation insurance filing shall be the date specified therein but not earlier than the 30th day after the date the filing is received by the director or from the date of receipt of the information furnished in support of a filing or specific portions of such filing if such supporting information is required by the director. The waiting period may be extended by the director for not more than 30 days if the director gives written notice within such waiting period to the insurer or rating organization which made the filing that the director needs such additional time for the consideration of such filing or specific portions of such filing. Upon written application by such insurer or rating organization, the director may authorize a filing or specific portions of such filing, which the director has reviewed, to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period. A filing or portions of a filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this chapter unless disapproved by the director within the waiting period or any extension thereof.

      (3) Filings of workers’ compensation rates, rating plans and rating systems by a workers’ compensation rating organization shall be limited to provisions for claim payment approved or established by the director, and shall not include allowances for or recognition of expenses, taxes or profit.

The organization shall also file the workers’ compensation policy forms to be used by its members. The filing shall include a report of investment income.

      (4) Filings of workers’ compensation rates by an insurer shall specify allowances for expenses, taxes and profits.

      (5) The director shall investigate and evaluate all workers’ compensation filings to determine whether the filings meet the requirements of this chapter.

      (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 737.205 (1), the director may require any person to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) of this section if the director has good cause to believe that a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area with respect to the classification to which such rate is applicable.

      (7) The director may require insurers to use, as that portion of a rate filing that constitutes the amount for claim payment, rates prescribed by the director based upon rating information determined pursuant to ORS 731.216 (3). [Amended by 1967 c.359 §310; 1969 c.690 §5; 1973 c.353 §1; 1981 c.535 §20; 1981 c.874 §20; 1985 c.706 §5; 1987 c.373 §83a; 1987 c.884 §51; 1989 c.171 §83; 1989 c.700 §12]

Nothing in this subsection affects retrospective rating plans.

      (2) If the director disapproves a workers’ compensation rate or rating plan and the insurer or rating organization requests a hearing before the director, the burden of proof is upon the insurer or rating organization to prove that the filing meets the requirements of this chapter.

      (3) If the director holds a hearing on an order disapproving a workers’ compensation rate, rating plan or rating system, the insurer or rating or advisory organization filing or using the rate, rating plan or rating system shall pay to the director the just and legitimate costs of the hearing, including actual necessary expenses. [1987 c.884 §49; 2007 c.275 §1]

 

      737.325 Suspension or modification of filing requirement; rules; excess rates for specific risks. (1) Under such rules and regulations as the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services adopts, the director, by written order, may suspend or modify the requirement of filing as to any class of insurance, or subdivision or combination thereof, or as to classes of risks, for which the rates cannot practicably be filed before they are used. Such orders, rules and regulations shall be made known to insurers and rating organizations affected thereby. The director may make such examination as the director deems advisable to ascertain whether any rates affected by such order meet the standards set forth in ORS 737.310.

      (2) Upon the written application of the insured, stating the reasons therefor, filed with the director and approved by the director, a rate in excess of that provided by a filing otherwise applicable may be used on any specific risk. [Amended by 1967 c.359 §311]

      (2) If the director has reason to believe that an insurer or rating or advisory organization is not complying with the requirements and standards of this chapter other than the requirements and standards dealing with rates, rating plans or rating systems, unless the director has reason to believe such noncompliance is willful, the director shall give notice in writing to such insurer or rating or advisory organization stating in what manner such noncompliance is alleged to exist and specifying a reasonable time, not less than 10 days after the date of mailing, in which such noncompliance may be corrected. [1967 c.359 §313; 1969 c.690 §7; 1987 c.774 §144]

The application shall specify the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant.

      (2) If the director finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if the grounds are established, and that such grounds otherwise justify holding such a hearing, the director shall do one of the following:

      (a) Issue an order under ORS 737.045 (1). The director shall not act under this paragraph if the filing concerns a rate, rating plan or rating system subject to ORS 737.320 (1).

      (a) In the case of a fire insurance rating organization, a showing as to its facilities for inspecting and surveying the various municipalities and fire risks in this state and for inspecting and surveying in this state the facilities for the preventing, confining and extinguishing of fires and such other information as the director may require; and

      737.355 Licensing rating organizations generally; licensing workers’ compensation rating organizations; rules; revocation and suspension; fees. (1) If the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services finds that the applicant represents a credible statistical base, is competent, trustworthy and otherwise qualified to act as a rating organization and that its constitution, articles of agreement or association or certificate of incorporation, and its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business conform to the requirements of law, the director shall issue a license specifying the classes of insurance, or subdivision or class of risk or a part or combination thereof for which the applicant is authorized to act as a rating organization. Each application shall be granted or denied in whole or in part by the director within 60 days of the date of its filing with the director.

      (2) The director need not issue a license to each workers’ compensation rating organization that meets the qualifications and requirements of subsection (1) of this section. Instead, the director may issue licenses to one or more qualifying workers’ compensation rating organizations pursuant to a selection process established by rule. At the end of the period for which one or more licenses are issued, the director may do the following pursuant to the selection process established by rule under this subsection:

      (a) Renew a license or issue a license to another workers’ compensation rating organization; and

      (b) Renew or issue licenses to more than one workers’ compensation rating organization.

Notice of proposed changes in such rules and regulations shall be given to subscribers.

      (2) Each rating organization shall furnish its rating services without discrimination to its members and subscribers. Any rating organization may subscribe to or purchase actuarial, technical or other services, and such services shall be available to all members and subscribers without discrimination.

      (3) The reasonableness of any rule or regulation in its application to subscribers, or the refusal of any rating organization to admit an insurer as a subscriber, at the request of any subscriber or any such insurer, shall be reviewed by the director at a hearing held at a place designated by the director and upon at least 10 days’ written notice to such rating organization and to such subscriber or insurer. If the director finds that such rule or regulation is unreasonable in its application to subscribers, the director shall order that such rule or regulation shall not be applicable to subscribers.

If the director finds that the action of the rating organization was justified, the director shall make an order affirming its action.

      (4) No rating organization shall adopt any rule, the effect of which would be to prohibit or regulate the payment of dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers. [Amended by 1967 c.359 §320]

 

      737.365 Cooperative activities among rating organizations and insurers.

If, after a hearing, the director finds that the furnishing of such information or assistance involves any act or practice which is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with this chapter, the director may issue a written order specifying in what respects such act or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with this chapter. If the act or practice thus specified is not modified to comply with such order, the director may issue an order requiring any insurer which makes its own filings or any rating organization to discontinue the use of the statistics or rate-making recommendations furnished to it by such advisory organization.

FICTITIOUS GROUPINGS

 

      737.600 Fictitious grouping for rate purposes prohibited; rules; exceptions. (1) As used in this section, “fictitious grouping” means a grouping by way of membership, license, franchise, contract, agreement or any method other than common ownership, or use and control.

      (2) An insurer may not:

      (a) Make available, through any rating plan or form, property, inland marine, casualty or surety insurance, or any combination thereof, at a preferred rate or premium to any person based upon a fictitious grouping of that person.

      (b) Write or deliver a form, plan or policy of insurance covering a grouping or combination of persons or risks, any of which are within this state, at a preferred rate or form other than that offered to the public generally and persons not in the group, unless the form, plan or policy and the rates or premiums to be charged therefor have been approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The director shall not approve any form, plan or policy, or the rates therefor, that would constitute a violation of paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (3) This section does not apply to:

      (a) Policies of life or health insurance;

      (b) Insurance for public bodies as defined in ORS 30.260;

      (c) Insurance for employers subject to ORS chapter 656 who are primarily engaged in farming. Any contract negotiated by an exempt farming group, including the rate, shall be restricted to members of the group;

      (d) Property and casualty insurance policies for personal, family or household purposes, and not for commercial or business purposes, under the following conditions:

      (A) If the policies are offered to members of an association, including a labor union, which has had an active existence for at least one year, has a constitution and bylaws and is maintained in good faith for purposes other than that of obtaining insurance;

      (B) If the policies are based on premiums that are adequate to support coverage of the group without subsidy by other rate payers; and

      (C) If the insurer does not unfairly discriminate against holders of other insurance policies;

      (e) Liability and property insurance required under ORS 825.160 for persons who apply for or who have received authority issued by the Department of Transportation under ORS chapter 825 to transport logs, poles, pilings, peeler cores, lumber, shingles, veneer, plywood, particle board, wallboard, siding, cordwood in long or short lengths, sawdust, hog fuel, wood chips, wood pellets, bark dust or cut trees that are or will be sold for use as Christmas trees;

      (f) Liability or casualty insurance issued in this state on commercial risks, if:

      (A) The policy requires active participation in a plan of risk management which has established measures and procedures to minimize both the frequency and severity of losses;

      (B) The policy passes on the benefits of reduced losses to plan participants; and

      (C) Rates are actuarially measurable and credible and sufficiently related to actual and expected loss and expense experience of the group so as to assure that nonmembers of the group are not unfairly discriminated against;

      (g) Insurance for child care facilities that are certified in accordance with ORS chapter 329A; or

      (h) Liability insurance for contractors licensed under ORS chapter 701.

      (4) Under ORS 731.244, the director shall make rules necessary for implementation of this section. [Formerly 737.346; 2007 c.210 §1]

 

      737.602 Authorization for insurance for certain projects; premiums; qualifications. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Project” means a construction project, a plant expansion or improvements within Oregon with an aggregate construction value in excess of $90 million that is to be completed within a defined period. The average construction value during the defined period of the project must be at least $18 million per year. “Project” does not mean a series of unrelated construction projects artificially aggregated to satisfy the $90 million requirement.

      (b) “Project sponsor” means public bodies, utilities, corporations and firms undertaking to construct a project in excess of $90 million and conducting business in the State of Oregon.

      (c) “Public body” has the meaning given the term in ORS 30.260.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 279C.530, 656.126, 737.600 or 746.160, an insurer approved to transact insurance in this state, including the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation or an insurer as defined in ORS 656.005, may issue with the prior approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services a policy of insurance covering the project sponsor, the prime contractor under a contract for the construction of the project, any contractors or subcontractors with whom the prime contractor may enter into contracts for the purpose of fulfilling its contractual obligations in construction of the project and any other contractors engaged by a project sponsor to provide architectural or other design services, engineering services, construction management services, other consulting services relating to the design and construction of the project or any combination thereof.

      (3) The following provisions apply to premiums under a policy of insurance described in subsection (2) of this section:

      (a) A project sponsor or a prime contractor may not charge a premium for coverage under a policy of insurance to a contractor or subcontractor with whom the project sponsor or prime contractor enters into a contract or engages for services described in subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) A prime contractor may not charge a project sponsor a premium for coverage under a policy of insurance other than a premium approved by the director under ORS chapter 737 prior to or at the same time as the director approves the project to which the policy applies.

      (c) Charging a premium prohibited by this subsection constitutes the unlawful transaction of insurance in violation of ORS 731.354.

      (4) The director, upon application of any insurer, shall approve the issuance of a policy of insurance to any grouping of the persons described in subsection (2) of this section if:

      (a) The grouping was formed for the purpose of performing a contract or a series of related contracts for the design and construction of a project for the project sponsor;

      (b) The project sponsor can reasonably demonstrate that the formation and operation of the grouping will substantially improve accident prevention and claims handling to the benefit of the project sponsor and the contractors and workers employed by the project sponsor on construction related projects;

      (c) The established rating and auditing standards required by authorized advisory organizations and rating organizations are adhered to;

      (d) The insurer for the grouping guarantees adequate protection to any other insurance producer that demonstrates that without such protection the producer will suffer losses that will constitute a threat to the continuation of the business of the producer;

      (e) The insurer for the grouping guarantees insurance coverage of the classes of insurance issued to the grouping to any contractor who, because of participation in the group, has been unable to maintain the contractor’s normal coverage. The insurer’s obligation under this paragraph shall continue until 12 months after substantial completion of the contractor’s work;

      (f) By permitting this grouping for a project sponsor, greater opportunities will be made available for historically underutilized businesses to bid on the project;

      (g) The project insurers agree to provide not less than 90 days’ notice to all insured parties of the cancellation or any material reduction in coverage for the project;

      (h) The insurance coverage for the grouping contains a severability of interest clause with respect to liability claims between individuals insured under the group policy and includes contractual liability coverage that applies to the various contracts and subcontracts entered into in connection with the project; and

      (i) The insurer places with the Department of Consumer and Business Services a special deposit of $25,000 per $100 million of construction project value, or an amount prescribed by rule of the director, whichever is greater. [1995 c.169 §2; 1999 c.196 §12; 1999 c.482 §1; 2003 c.364 §98; 2003 c.794 §326; 2007 c.241 §28]

      737.604 Rules. In addition to other rulemaking authority of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the director may make rules:

      (1) Stating the necessary attributes that a construction project of a project sponsor and the participants in the project must have in order to qualify for the grouping permitted under ORS 737.602. The rules may include but are not limited to matters regarding an appropriate trust agreement for special deposit and adjustment of the construction project value according to an appropriate cost index; and

      (2) Establishing a process for a state agency or local contract review board created under ORS 279A.060 to evaluate the purchase by a public body of insurance authorized by ORS 737.602, or any agreements related thereto. [1995 c.169 §3; 2003 c.794 §327]
