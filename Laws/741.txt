      (b) The maximum amount of excess moneys that may be held under this subsection is the total administrative and operational expenses of administering the health insurance exchange anticipated by the department for a six-month period. Any moneys received that exceed the maximum shall be applied by the department to reduce the charges imposed by this section.

      (4) Charges shall be based on annual statements and other reports submitted by insurers and state programs as prescribed by the department.

      (5) In addition to charges imposed under subsection (1) of this section, to the extent permitted by federal law the department may impose a fee on insurers and state programs participating in the exchange to cover the cost of commissions of insurance producers that are certified by the department or by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to facilitate the participation of individuals and employers in the exchange.

      (5) The department shall certify as qualified a dental only health plan as permitted by federal law.

      (1) Promote the provision of services through an integrated health home model that reduces unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency department visits.

      (2) Require little or no cost sharing for evidence-based preventive care and services, such as care and services that have been shown to prevent acute exacerbations of disease symptoms in individuals with chronic illnesses.
