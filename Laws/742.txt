      (4) An insurer that is subject to a judicial order of liquidation or rehabilitation.

      (a) Each policyholder who has the right to terminate or otherwise alter the terms of a policy.

      (b) Each certificate holder whose certificate is in force on the proposed effective date of the assumption if the certificate holder has the right to keep the certificate in force without change in benefit following termination of the group policy. The right to keep the certificate in force does not include the right to elect individual coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, section 601 et seq., of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1161 et seq.).

      (c) The transferring insurer’s agents of record on the affected policies.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall prescribe the contents of the notice of transfer, methods by which insurers must give notice of the transfer and notice of opportunity to accept or reject the assumption and methods of response by the policyholders and certificate holders. [1995 c.30 §5]

 

      742.158 Rejection of transfer by policyholder; payment of premium as acceptance of transfer; failure of policyholder to respond to notice. (1) A policyholder or certificate holder described in ORS 742.156 may reject the transfer and novation of the policy under an assumption reinsurance agreement to which ORS 742.150 applies. A policyholder or certificate holder electing to reject the assumption transaction must give notice of rejection according to the manner of response established by rule.

      (2) If the premium notice sent by an assuming insurer to a policyholder or a certificate holder described in ORS 742.156 satisfies the requirements of this subsection, payment of any premium to the assuming insurer during the 12-month period after the notice is received constitutes the policyholder’s acceptance of the transfer to the assuming insurer. Upon such a payment, a novation is effected. The premium notice must state that payment of the premium to the assuming insurer constitutes acceptance of the transfer and must provide a method for the policyholder to pay the premium while reserving the right to reject the transfer. This subsection does not apply to a policy for which premiums are collected on a weekly or monthly basis by an insurance producer who is an agent of the insurer nor to any other insurance not using premium notices.

      (3) After not less than 12 months from the mailing of the first notice of transfer required under ORS 742.156, if the transferring insurer has not received the consent to or rejection of the transfer and assumption from a policyholder or consent by the policyholder has not occurred under subsection (2) of this section, the transferring insurer shall send to the policyholder a second and final notice of transfer. The notice must conform to the requirements established under ORS 742.156 and must also state that the policyholder must accept or reject the transfer not later than the 30th day after the postmark date. Failure by the policyholder to accept or reject the transfer during that period constitutes consent by the policyholder and novation of the contract will be effected. For a policy for which premiums are collected on a weekly or monthly basis by an insurance producer who is an agent of the insurer or for any other insurance not using premium notices, the 12-month period and the 30-day period shall be measured from the date of delivery of the notice of transfer provided under ORS 742.156.

      (4) If a policyholder responds to the notice of transfer by mail, receipt of the response by the transferring insurer occurs on the date the response is postmarked. If a policyholder responds to the notice of transfer by facsimile or other electronic transmission or by registered mail, express delivery or courier service, receipt of the response by the transferring insurer occurs on the date of actual receipt by the transferring insurer.

      (5) If the notice of transfer for a policy for which premiums are collected on a weekly or monthly basis by an insurance producer who is an agent of the insurer or for any other insurance not using premium notices satisfies the requirements of this subsection, payment of any premium to the assuming insurer during the 12-month period after the notice is received constitutes the policyholder’s acceptance of the transfer to the assuming insurer. Upon such a payment, a novation is effected. The notice of transfer must state that payment of the premium to the assuming insurer constitutes acceptance of the transfer and must provide a method for the policyholder to pay the premium while reserving the right to reject the transfer. [1995 c.30 §6; 2003 c.364 §101]

 

      742.160 Effect of novation of policy under assumption reinsurance agreement. If a policyholder consents to a transfer as provided in ORS 742.158, or if a transfer is effected under ORS 742.162, the effect of the novation of the policy subject to the assumption reinsurance agreement is that the transferring insurer is relieved of all insurance obligations or risks transferred under the assumption reinsurance agreement and the assuming insurer becomes directly and solely liable to the policyholder for those insurance obligations and risks. [1995 c.30 §7]

 

      742.162 Transfer and novation of policy effected by director. (1) A transfer and novation effected as provided in this section is not an assumption reinsurance agreement to which ORS 742.150 applies.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may effect a transfer and novation of the policies issued by a domestic insurer if the director determines that the insurer is in hazardous financial condition according to standards established under ORS 731.385, if a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding has been instituted against the insurer or if an administrative supervision proceeding has been instituted against the insurer, and if the director determines that the transfer of the policies is in the best interest of the policyholders. The director may give notice of such a transfer to policyholders that the director determines to be adequate under the circumstances.

      (3) The director may accept a transfer and novation of policies issued by a foreign insurer that insure residents of this state when the transfer and novation are effected by the insurance regulatory official of the domiciliary state of the foreign insurer if the director determines that the domiciliary state has a substantially similar law and if the official has determined that the transfer of the policies is in the best interest of the policyholders and:

      (a) The official has determined that the insurer is in hazardous financial condition;

      (b) A rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding has been instituted against the insurer; or

      (c) An administrative proceeding has been instituted against the insurer for the purpose of supervising, reorganizing or conserving the insurer. [1995 c.30 §8]

 

FIRE INSURANCE

 

      742.200 Fire insurance not to exceed value of property insured. (1) No insurer, insurance producer or insured shall knowingly issue or procure any fire insurance policy upon property within this state for an amount which with any existing insurance exceeds the fair value of the risk insured or of the interest of the insured therein.

      (1) Affords coverage with respect to the peril of fire, not less than the substantial equivalent of the coverage afforded by the provisions of the standard fire insurance policy as required by ORS 742.202;

      (2) After a review under ORS 742.005 by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, is found by the director not to violate ORS 742.005 (2); and

      (3) Is complete as to all its terms without reference to the standard fire insurance policy or any other policy. [Formerly 743.607; 2001 c.85 §1]

 

      742.206 Insuring agreement.

      “Assignment of this policy shall not be valid except with the written consent of this company.

      “This policy is made and accepted subject to the foregoing provisions and stipulations and those hereinafter stated, which hereby are made a part of this policy, together with such other provisions, stipulations and agreements as may be added hereto, as provided in this policy.

      “In witness whereof, this company has executed and attested these presents.

      (2) A homeowner or renter liability or fire insurance policy may not provide coverage for losses arising out of or in connection with child care provided by a registered or certified child care facility.

      (E) A representation that services will be initiated by or under the direction of the insurer within 48 hours after request is made for services.

      (e) All other provisions which are required by the Insurance Code or by rules issued by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (2) A home protection policy shall be noncancelable during the term for which it is originally written, except for nonpayment of the premium charge for the policy or for fraud or misrepresentation of facts material to the issuance of the policy. However, a policy providing coverage while the subject home is being offered for sale is cancelable in accordance with the policy provisions if no sale is made. A home protection policy is not renewable unless its terms provide otherwise.

      (3) The director may adopt rules regarding home protection policies in order to protect the interests of persons affected by the policy contract. The director may not adopt rules specifying the home components or related personal property which must be covered by a home protection policy, except to the extent necessary to:

      (a) Ninety-five percent of the fair market value of the securing property at the time the loan is made, or such higher percentage as may be authorized by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and permitted by the insurer’s domicile, if the obligation insured is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument constituting a first lien or first charge.

      (b) Ninety percent of the fair market value of the securing property at the time the loan is made, or such higher percentage as may be authorized by the director and permitted by the insurer’s domicile, if the obligation insured is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument constituting a junior lien or junior charge. In determining the 90 percent limitation, the full amount of a line of credit to be secured by a junior lien shall be considered the amount of the loan.

      (2) An insurer may provide proof of insurance under this section by issuing a card or, if the insured agrees, through electronic means.

      (3) Nothing in this section requires an insurer to provide proof of insurance at any time other than when the policy is issued or renewed. [1993 c.746 §1; 2013 c.108 §1]

 

      Note: 742.447 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 742 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

(Generally)

 

      742.449 Prohibition on assignment to high risk category on certain grounds. An insurer issuing motor vehicle liability insurance policies in this state may not assign an insured or applicant for insurance to a higher risk category than the person would otherwise be assigned to solely because the person has:

      (1) Let a prior motor vehicle liability policy lapse, unless the person was in violation of ORS 806.010 at any time after the prior policy lapsed; or

      (2) Had driving privileges suspended pursuant to ORS 809.280 (6) or (8) if the suspension is based on a nondriving offense. [1989 c.419 §2; 1991 c.860 §6; 2011 c.355 §22]

 

      742.450 Contents of motor vehicle liability policy; permitted exclusions; rules. (1) Every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued for delivery in this state shall state the name and address of the named insured, the coverage afforded by the policy, the premium charged therefor, the policy period and the limits of liability.

      (4) Every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued for delivery in this state shall provide liability coverage to at least the limits specified in ORS 806.070.

      (5) Every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued for delivery in this state shall provide liability coverage, up to the limits of coverage under the policy for a vehicle owned by the named insured, for the operation by the named insured of a motor vehicle provided to the named insured, without regard to whether the named insured is charged for the use of the motor vehicle, if:

      (a) The motor vehicle is provided to the named insured by a person engaged in the business of repairing or servicing motor vehicles; and

      (b) The motor vehicle is provided to the named insured as a temporary replacement vehicle while the named insured’s vehicle is being repaired or serviced.

      (7) A person may be excluded from coverage under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy as provided in subsection (6) of this section:

      (b) Because of any reason or set of criteria established by the director by rule.

      (8) Every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued for delivery in this state shall contain a provision that provides liability coverage for each family member of the insured residing in the same household as the insured in an amount equal to the amount of liability coverage purchased by the insured. [Formerly 486.541 and then 743.776; 1991 c.768 §3; 1999 c.438 §2; 2007 c.782 §1]

The policy may not be canceled or annulled as to such liability by any agreement between the insurer and the insured after the occurrence of the injury or damage. No statement made by the insured or on behalf of the insured and in violation of the policy shall defeat or void the policy. This section does not apply to motor vehicle liability insurance policies other than those required in connection with ORS 806.060, 806.240 or 806.270. [Formerly 486.551 and then 743.779]

      (2) The satisfaction by the insured of a judgment for injury or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right or duty of the insurer to make payment on account of such injury or damage.

      (3) Any binder issued pending the issuance of a motor vehicle liability insurance policy shall be deemed to fulfill the requirements for such a policy. [Formerly 486.556 and then 743.781]

 

      742.460 Insurer’s right to provide for reimbursement and proration. Any motor vehicle liability insurance policy may provide that the insured shall reimburse the insurer for any payment the insurer would not have been obligated to make under the terms of the policy except for the provisions of ORS 742.450 to 742.464, 806.080 and 806.270 and it may further provide for the prorating of the insurance thereunder with other valid and collectible insurance. [Formerly 486.561 and then 743.782; 1995 c.79 §363]

 

      742.462 Insurer’s right to settle claims. The insurer shall have the right to settle any claim covered by the policy, and if such settlement is made in good faith, the amount thereof shall be deductible from the limits of liability specified in respect to a motor vehicle liability insurance policy. [Formerly 486.564 and then 743.784]

 

      742.464 Excess coverage permitted; combining policies to meet requirements. Any policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability insurance policy under ORS 742.450, 806.080 and 806.270 may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the required coverage, and such excess or additional coverage shall not be subject to the provisions of ORS 742.031, 742.400 and 742.450 to 742.464. With respect to a policy which grants such excess or additional coverage only that part of the coverage which is required by ORS 806.080 and 806.270 is subject to the requirements of those sections. [Formerly 486.566 and then 743.785]

 

      742.466 Disputes over coverage for physical damage; independent appraisal; rules. (1) In the event of a dispute between the insurer and insured under a motor vehicle liability policy concerning coverage for physical damage, if the policy contains a provision authorizing the insured to obtain an independent appraisal by a competent and disinterested person of the physical damage, that provision shall apply. An independent appraisal conducted under this section shall be performed by a person who has been issued a vehicle appraiser certificate under ORS 819.480 or a person who has been issued a vehicle appraiser certificate or license by another state or government body.

      (2) When a motor vehicle liability policy contains a provision for resolving a dispute through appraisal of a motor vehicle insured under the policy, the insurer shall reimburse the insured for the reasonable appraisal costs if the final appraisal decision under the policy provision is greater than the amount of the insurer’s last offer prior to the incurrence of the appraisal costs.

      (3) If a motor vehicle liability policy does not contain a provision described in subsection (1) of this section, then notwithstanding any other provision of the policy, any resolution of the dispute shall be subject to rules adopted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. [Formerly 743.840; 2009 c.65 §4; 2011 c.134 §1]

 

      742.468 Certain policies not considered motor vehicle liability policies. For purposes of statutes mandating kinds or amounts of coverage that motor vehicle liability policies must contain, the following shall not be considered motor vehicle liability policies:

      (1) Comprehensive general liability policies.

(Uninsured Motorist Coverage)

 

      742.500 Definitions for ORS 742.500 to 742.506. As used in ORS 742.500 to 742.506:

      (1) “Bodily injury” has the meaning given that term in ORS 742.504.

      (2) “Insured” has the meaning given that term in ORS 742.504.

      (3)(a) “Motor vehicle” means every self-propelled device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway.

      (b) “Motor vehicle” does not include:

      (A) A device used exclusively on stationary rails or tracks;

      (B) Motor trucks, as defined in ORS 801.355, that have a registration weight, as defined in ORS 803.430, of more than 8,000 pounds, if the insured has employees that operate the trucks and a workers’ compensation law, a disability benefits law or a similar law covers the employees; or

      (C) Farm-type tractors or self-propelled equipment designed for use principally off public highways.

      (4) “Sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages” has the meaning given that term in ORS 742.504.

      (5) “Uninsured motorist coverage” means coverage within the terms and conditions specified in ORS 742.504 that insures the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured for all sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises from owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle in amounts or limits not less than the amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death under ORS 806.070.

      (6) “Uninsured vehicle” has the meaning given that term in ORS 742.504. [Formerly 743.786; 2015 c.5 §1]

 

      742.502 Uninsured motorist coverage; underinsurance coverage. (1) Every motor vehicle liability policy that insures against a loss that a natural person suffers and that results from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death that arises out of owning, maintaining or using a motor vehicle shall provide in the policy or by indorsement on the policy uninsured motorist coverage if the policy is either:

      (a) Issued for delivery in this state; or

      (b) Issued or delivered by an insurer that does business in this state with respect to any motor vehicle then principally used or principally garaged in this state.

      (2)(a) A motor vehicle bodily injury liability policy must have the same limits for uninsured motorist coverage as for bodily injury liability coverage unless a named insured in writing elects lower limits. The insured may not elect limits lower than the amounts prescribed to meet the requirements of ORS 806.070 for bodily injury or death. Uninsured motorist coverage must include underinsurance coverage for bodily injury or death caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle with motor vehicle liability insurance that provides recovery in an amount that is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. Underinsurance coverage must be equal to the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle up to the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage.

      (b) If a named insured elects lower limits, the named insured shall sign a statement to elect lower limits within 60 days after the time the named insured makes the election. The statement must acknowledge that a named insured was offered uninsured motorist coverage with the limits equal to those for bodily injury liability. The statement must have a brief summary that is not part of the insurance contract and that describes what uninsured motorist coverage provides and what the underinsured coverage provides. The summary must also state the price for coverage with limits equal to the named insured’s bodily injury liability limits and the price for coverage with the lower limits the named insured requested. The statement remains in force until a named insured rescinds the statement in writing or until the motor vehicle bodily injury liability limits are changed. The Department of Consumer and Business Services shall approve the form of statement that complies with this paragraph.

      (c) A statement electing lower limits need not be signed if vehicles are either added to or subtracted from a policy or if the policy is amended, renewed, modified or replaced by the same insurer or an insurer within a group of companies that is under common ownership or control, unless the liability limits of the policy are changed.

      (3) The insurer that issues the policy may offer one or more options of uninsured motorist coverage that are larger than the amounts prescribed to meet the requirements of ORS 806.070 and in excess of the limits provided under the policy for motor vehicle bodily injury liability insurance. Offers of uninsured motorist coverage must include underinsurance coverage for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using a motor vehicle with motor vehicle liability insurance that provides recovery in an amount that is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. Underinsurance coverage must be equal to the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises from owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle up to the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage.

      (4) Underinsurance coverage is subject to ORS 742.504 and 742.542.

      (5) Uninsured motorist coverage and underinsurance coverage must provide coverage for bodily injury or death if the amount of liability insurance recovered is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle.

      (6) Uninsured motorist coverage and underinsurance coverage must provide coverage for bodily injury or death if the amount recovered from a self-insurer is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle.

      (7) As used in this section and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, “amount recovered from other motor vehicle liability insurance policies” means the proceeds of liability insurance or the proceeds received from a public body under ORS 30.260 to 30.300 that are recovered by or on behalf of the injured party. Proceeds recovered on behalf of the injured party include proceeds the injured party’s insurer receives as reimbursement for personal injury protection benefits the insurer provides to the injured person, proceeds the medical providers of the injured person receive and proceeds received as attorney fees on the claim of the injured person. If applicable liability insurance policy limits are exhausted upon payment, settlement or judgment by division among two or more injured persons, “amount recovered from other motor vehicle liability insurance policies” means the proceeds that are recovered by or on behalf of the injured person but does not include any proceeds of the liability policy that other injured persons receive. [Formerly 743.789; 1993 c.709 §11; 1997 c.808 §1; 2003 c.220 §1; 2005 c.235 §1; 2007 c.287 §2; 2007 c.782 §2; 2009 c.67 §14; 2015 c.5 §2]

 

      742.504 Required provisions of uninsured motorist coverage.

Determination as to whether the insured, the insured’s heirs or the insured’s legal representative is legally entitled to recover such damages, and if so, the amount thereof, shall be made by agreement between the insured and the insurer, or, in the event of disagreement, may be determined by arbitration as provided in subsection (10) of this section.

      (b) No judgment against any person or organization alleged to be legally responsible for bodily injury, except for proceedings instituted against the insurer as provided in this policy, shall be conclusive, as between the insured and the insurer, on the issues of liability of the person or organization or of the amount of damages to which the insured is legally entitled.

      (B) Any child residing in the household of the named insured if the insured has performed the duties of a parent to the child by rearing the child as the insured’s own although the child is not related to the insured by blood, marriage or adoption; and

      (C) Any other person while occupying an insured vehicle, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the named insured.

      (d) “Insured vehicle,” except as provided in paragraph (e) of this provision, means:

      (B) A nonowned vehicle operated by the named insured or spouse if a resident of the same household, provided that the actual use thereof is with the permission of the owner of the vehicle and the vehicle is not owned by nor furnished for the regular or frequent use of the insured or any member of the same household.

      (e) “Insured vehicle” does not include a trailer of any type unless the trailer is a described vehicle in the policy.

      (f) “Occupying” means in or upon or entering into or alighting from.

      (g) “Phantom vehicle” means a vehicle that causes bodily injury to an insured arising out of a motor vehicle accident that is caused by a vehicle that has no physical contact with the insured or the vehicle the insured is occupying at the time of the accident, provided:

      (A) The identity of either the operator or the owner of the phantom vehicle cannot be ascertained;

      (B) The facts of the accident can be corroborated by competent evidence other than the testimony of the insured or any person having an uninsured motorist claim resulting from the accident; and

It shall be a disputable presumption that a vehicle is uninsured in the event the insured and the insurer, after reasonable efforts, fail to discover within 90 days from the date of the accident, the existence of a valid and collectible motor vehicle bodily injury liability insurance applicable at the time of the accident.

      (B) The described limits have been offered in settlement, the insurer has refused consent under paragraph (a) of this subsection and the insured protects the insurer’s right of subrogation to the claim against the tortfeasor;

      (C) The insured gives credit to the insurer for the unrealized portion of the described liability limits as if the full limits had been received if less than the described limits have been offered in settlement, and the insurer has consented under paragraph (a) of this subsection; or

Proof of claim shall be made upon forms furnished by the insurer unless the insurer fails to furnish the forms within 15 days after receiving notice of claim.

      (b) Upon reasonable request of and at the expense of the insurer, the injured person shall submit to physical examinations by physicians, naturopathic physicians, physician assistants or nurse practitioners selected by the insurer and shall, upon each request from the insurer, execute authorization to enable the insurer to obtain medical reports and copies of records.

      (6) If, before the insurer makes payment of loss hereunder, the insured or the legal representative of the insured institutes any legal action for bodily injury against any person or organization legally responsible for the use of a vehicle involved in the accident, a copy of the summons and complaint or other process served in connection with the legal action shall be forwarded immediately to the insurer by the insured or the legal representative of the insured.

      (7)(a) The limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to “each person” is the limit of the insurer’s liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of any one accident and, subject to the above provision respecting each person, the limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to “each accident” is the total limit of the company’s liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by two or more persons as the result of any one accident.

      (b) Any amount payable under the terms of this coverage because of bodily injury sustained in an accident by a person who is an insured under this coverage shall be reduced by the amount paid and the present value of all amounts payable on account of the bodily injury under any workers’ compensation law, disability benefits law or any similar law.

The insured shall cooperate so as to permit the insurer to proceed by subrogation or assignment to prosecute the claim against the uninsured motorist.

      (8) No action shall lie against the insurer unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured or the legal representative of the insured has fully complied with all the terms of this policy.

      (9)(a) With respect to bodily injury to an insured:

      (A) While occupying a vehicle owned by a named insured under this coverage, the insurance under this coverage is primary.

      (B) While occupying a vehicle not owned by a named insured under this coverage, the insurance under this coverage shall apply only as excess insurance over any primary insurance available to the occupant that is similar to this coverage, and this excess insurance coverage shall then apply only to the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle.

      (b) With respect to bodily injury to an insured while occupying any motor vehicle used as a public or livery conveyance, the insurance under this coverage shall apply only as excess insurance over any other insurance available to the insured that is similar to this coverage, and this excess insurance coverage shall then apply only to the amount by which the applicable limit of liability of this coverage exceeds the sum of the applicable limits of liability of all other insurance.

      (10) If any person making claim hereunder and the insurer do not agree that the person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle because of bodily injury to the insured, or do not agree as to the amount of payment that may be owing under this coverage, then, in the event the insured and the insurer elect by mutual agreement at the time of the dispute to settle the matter by arbitration, the arbitration shall take place as described in ORS 742.505. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided, however, that the costs to the insured of the arbitration proceeding do not exceed $100 and that all other costs of arbitration are borne by the insurer. “Costs” as used in this provision does not include attorney fees or expenses incurred in the production of evidence or witnesses or the making of transcripts of the arbitration proceedings. The person and the insurer each agree to consider themselves bound and to be bound by any award made by the arbitrators pursuant to this coverage in the event of such election. At the election of the insured, the arbitration shall be held:

      (a) In the county and state of residence of the insured;

      (b) In the county and state where the insured’s cause of action against the uninsured motorist arose; or

      (c) At any other place mutually agreed upon by the insured and the insurer.

      (11) In the event of payment to any person under this coverage:

      (a) The insurer shall be entitled to the extent of the payment to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment that may result from the exercise of any rights of recovery of the person against any uninsured motorist legally responsible for the bodily injury because of which payment is made;

      (b) The person shall hold in trust for the benefit of the insurer all rights of recovery that the person shall have against such other uninsured person or organization because of the damages that are the subject of claim made under this coverage, but only to the extent that the claim is made or paid herein;

      (c) If the insured is injured by the joint or concurrent act or acts of two or more persons, one or more of whom is uninsured, the insured shall have the election to receive from the insurer any payment to which the insured would be entitled under this coverage by reason of the act or acts of the uninsured motorist, or the insured may, with the written consent of the insurer, proceed with legal action against any or all persons claimed to be liable to the insured for the injuries. If the insured elects to receive payment from the insurer under this coverage, then the insured shall hold in trust for the benefit of the insurer all rights of recovery the insured shall have against any other person, firm or organization because of the damages that are the subject of claim made under this coverage, but only to the extent of the actual payment made by the insurer;

      (d) The person shall do whatever is proper to secure and shall do nothing after loss to prejudice such rights;

      (e) If requested in writing by the insurer, the person shall take, through any representative not in conflict in interest with the person, designated by the insurer, such action as may be necessary or appropriate to recover payment as damages from such other uninsured person or organization, such action to be taken in the name of the person, but only to the extent of the payment made hereunder.

      (b) If the injured person is usually engaged in a remunerative occupation and if disability continues for at least 14 days, 70 percent of the loss of income from work during the period of the injured person’s disability until the date the person is able to return to the person’s usual occupation.

      (2) With respect to the insured person and members of that person’s family residing in the same household, an insurer may offer forms of coverage for the benefits required by subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c) of this section with deductibles of up to $250.

      (a) The amount of the hospital charges multiplied by the adjusted cost-to-charge ratio specified for the hospital; or

      (b) Ninety percent of the hospital charges. [2003 c.813 §4; 2005 c.341 §4; 2011 c.707 §1]

[Formerly 743.810]

 

      742.528 Notice of denial of payment of benefits. An insurer who denies payment of personal injury protection benefits to or on behalf of an insured shall:

      (1) Provide written notice of the denial, within 60 calendar days of receiving a claim from the provider, to the insured, stating the reason for the denial and informing the insured of the method for contesting the denial; and

      (2) Provide a copy of the notice of the denial, within 60 calendar days of receiving a claim from the provider, to a provider of services under ORS 742.524 (1)(a). [Formerly 743.812; 1993 c.265 §1]

 

      742.529 Payment based on incorrect determination of responsibility; notice; repayment. If personal injury protection benefits are paid based on information that appeared to establish proof of loss and the insurer paying the benefits later determines the insurer was not responsible for the payment, the insurer shall give notice and explanation to the provider that the payment was incorrectly issued. Immediately after receiving the notice and explanation the provider shall promptly repay the insurer. [2007 c.692 §3]

 

      742.530 Exclusions from coverage. (1) The insurer may exclude from the coverage for personal injury protection benefits any injured person who:

      (b) Is participating in any prearranged or organized racing or speed contest or practice or preparation for any such contest; or

[Formerly 743.815; 2005 c.341 §2]

 

      742.532 Benefits may be more favorable than those required by ORS 742.520, 742.524 and 742.530. Nothing in ORS 742.518 to 742.542 is intended to prevent an insurer from providing more favorable benefits than the personal injury protection benefits described in ORS 742.520, 742.524 and 742.530. [Formerly 743.820]

 

      742.534 Reimbursement of other insurers paying benefits; arbitrating issues of liability and amount of reimbursement. (1) Except as provided in ORS 742.544, every authorized motor vehicle liability insurer whose insured is or would be held legally liable for damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident by a person for whom personal injury protection benefits have been furnished by another such insurer, or for whom benefits have been furnished by an authorized health insurer, shall reimburse such other insurer for the benefits it has so furnished if it has requested such reimbursement, has not given notice as provided in ORS 742.536 that it elects recovery by lien in accordance with that section and is entitled to reimbursement under this section by the terms of its policy. Reimbursement under this subsection, together with the amount paid to injured persons by the liability insurer, shall not exceed the limits of the policy issued by the insurer.

      (2) In calculating such reimbursement, the amount of benefits so furnished shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person for whom benefits have been so furnished, and the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of damages legally recoverable by the person.

      (3) Disputes between insurers as to such issues of liability and the amount of reimbursement required by this section shall be decided by arbitration.

      (4) Findings and awards made in such an arbitration proceeding are not admissible in any action at law or suit in equity.

      (5) If an insurer does not request reimbursement under this section for recovery of personal injury protection payments, then the insurer may only recover personal injury protection payments under the provisions of ORS 742.536 or 742.538. [Formerly 743.825; 1993 c.709 §7; 2007 c.392 §1]

 

      742.536 Notice of claim or legal action to insurer; insurer to elect manner of recovery of benefits furnished; lien of insurer. (1) If an authorized motor vehicle liability insurer has furnished personal injury protection benefits, or an authorized health insurer has furnished benefits, to a person who was injured in a motor vehicle accident and the injured person makes a claim, or brings legal action, for damages for injuries against any other person, the injured person shall give notice of the claim or legal action to the insurer by personal service or by registered or certified mail. Service of a copy of the summons and complaint or copy of other process served in connection with the legal action is sufficient notice to the insurer, in which case a return showing service of the notice must be filed with the clerk of the court but is not a part of the record except to give notice.

      (2) An insurer may elect to seek reimbursement as provided in this section for benefits the insurer has furnished to the injured person out of any recovery the injured person obtains from a claim or legal action if the insurer has not been a party under ORS 742.534 to an interinsurer reimbursement proceeding with respect to benefits the insurer furnished to the injured person and the insurer is entitled by the terms of the insurer’s policy to the benefit of this section. The insurer shall give written notice of an election under this subsection by personal service or by registered or certified mail within 30 days after receiving the notice or knowledge of the claim or legal action to the person who made the claim or brought the legal action and to the person against whom the injured person made a claim or brought legal action. In the case of a legal action, a return showing service of the notice of election must be filed with the clerk of the court but is not a part of the record except to give notice to the claimant and the defendant of the lien of the insurer.

      (3) If the insurer serves a written notice of the insurer’s election under subsection (2) of this section and, if applicable, files a return showing service:

      (a) Subject to ORS 742.544, an insurer has a lien, for not more than the amount of benefits the insurer furnished, against an injured person’s recovery in an action for damages, less a proportionate amount of not more than 100 percent of the expenses, costs and attorney fees the injured person incurred in connection with the recovery. The proportionate amount must be calculated as the ratio between the amount of the lien before a reduction under this paragraph and the amount of the recovery.

      (b) The injured person shall include the benefits the insurer furnished as damages in a claim or legal action.

      (c) In the case of a legal action, the action must be taken in the name of the injured person.

      (4) As used in this section, “makes a claim” means delivers a written demand for a specific amount of damages that meets requirements reasonably established by the director’s rule. [Formerly 743.828; 2019 c.460 §1]

 

      742.538 Subrogation rights of insurers to certain amounts received by injured person; recovery actions against persons causing injury. If a motor vehicle liability insurer has furnished personal injury protection benefits, or a health insurer has furnished benefits, to a person who was injured in a motor vehicle accident and the interinsurer reimbursement benefit of ORS 742.534 is not available under the terms of that section, the insurer has not elected recovery by lien as provided in ORS 742.536, and the insurer is entitled by the terms of the insurer’s policy to the benefit of this section:

      (1) Subject to ORS 742.544, the insurer is entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment that results from the exercise of any rights of recovery the injured person has against any person legally responsible for the accident, to the extent of the benefits the insurer furnished less the insurer’s share of expenses, costs and attorney fees the injured person incurred in connection with the recovery.

      (2) The injured person shall hold in trust for the benefit of the insurer the amount to which the insurer is entitled under this section, which may not exceed the amount of benefits the insurer furnished.

      (3) The injured person shall do whatever is proper to secure, and may not prejudice, the rights an insurer has under this section.

      (4) If requested in writing by the insurer, the injured person shall take, in the injured person’s name and through any representative the insurer designates who is not in conflict in interest with the injured person, such action as is necessary or appropriate to recover the amounts to which the insurer is entitled under this section, including amounts for the injured person’s share of expenses, costs and attorney fees that the insurer incurred in connection with the recovery.

      (5) In calculating respective shares of expenses, costs and attorney fees under this section, the basis of allocation must be the respective proportions borne to the total recovery by:

      (a) Benefits the insurer furnished; and

      (b) The total recovery less the benefits the insurer furnished.

      (6) The injured person shall execute and deliver to the insurer instruments and papers as are appropriate to secure the rights and obligations of the insurer and the injured person as established by this section.

      (7) Any provisions in a motor vehicle liability insurance policy or health insurance policy giving rights to the insurer relating to subrogation or the subject matter of this section must be construed and applied in accordance with the provisions of this section. [Formerly 743.830; 2019 c.460 §2]

 

      742.540 Rules. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall have authority to issue such rules as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of ORS 742.518 to 742.542. [Formerly 743.833]

 

      742.542 Effect of personal injury protection benefits paid. Payment by a motor vehicle liability insurer of personal injury protection benefits for its own insured shall be applied in reduction of the amount of damages that the insured may be entitled to recover from the insurer under uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for the same accident but may not be applied in reduction of the uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage policy limits. [Formerly 743.835; 1997 c.808 §10]

 

      742.544 Reimbursement for benefits paid. (1)(a) As used in this subsection, “total amount of the recovery” means the amount that a person injured in a motor vehicle accident recovers from:

      (A) Underinsured motorist benefits described in ORS 742.502 (2);

      (B) Liability insurance coverage the injured person receives from other parties involved in the motor vehicle accident;

      (C) Personal injury protection benefits or health insurance benefits; and

      (D) Any other payment by or on behalf of the party that caused the motor vehicle accident.

      (b) An insurer may not receive a reimbursement or subrogation for personal injury protection benefits or health benefits the insurer provided to a person injured in a motor vehicle accident from any recovery the injured person obtains in an action for damages except to the extent that:

      (A) The injured person first receives full compensation for the injured person’s injuries; and

      (B) The reimbursement or subrogation is paid only from the total amount of the recovery in excess of the amount that fully compensates for the injured person’s injuries.

      (2) For purposes of this section, the following rebuttable presumptions apply:

      (a) The amount of any judgment that an injured person obtains is the amount necessary to fully compensate for the injured person’s injuries.

      (b) An injured person has received full compensation for the injured person’s injuries if the amount of the recovery is less than the coverage available to the injured person from the sum of benefits paid under another person’s motor vehicle liability policy, under an underinsured motorist policy described in ORS 742.502 (2), as personal injury protection payments and from any other source of payment from or on behalf of the party whose fault caused the injuries.

      (c) An injured person has not received full compensation for the injured person’s injuries if the injured person recovers an amount that is equal to the coverage available to the injured person from the sum of benefits paid under another person’s motor vehicle liability policy, under an underinsured motorist policy described in ORS 742.502 (2), as personal injury protection payments and from any other source of payment from or on behalf of the party whose fault caused the injuries.

      (3) An insurer may not deny or refuse to provide benefits that are otherwise available to an injured person because of the potential the injured person has to make a claim or bring an action against another person or enter into a settlement with another person.

      (4) A person with whom an injured person enters into a settlement or from whom the injured person obtains a judgment in connection with a claim or action may not name an insurer that seeks a reimbursement or subrogation under ORS 742.536 or 742.538 as a payee on a check, draft or other form of payment in satisfaction of the claim or judgment.

      (5) An insurer may not delay, withhold or reduce benefits to an injured person because of an act or omission for which a third party is or may be liable or as a means of enforcing or attempting to enforce a claim for reimbursement or subrogation.

      (6) An insurer that receives a reimbursement for benefits the insurer provided to an injured person shall apply the amount of the reimbursement as a credit against any lifetime maximum benefit set forth for the injured person in the policy, benefit plan or contract under which the insurer paid the benefits.

      (7) A provision in a policy, benefit plan or contract that permits reimbursement or subrogation other than as provided in this section is void and unenforceable.

      (8) This section does not:

      (a) Prohibit insurers from coordinating benefits;

      (b) Limit an insurer’s right to seek reimbursement or subrogation to recover, without reduction, amounts the insurer paid for property damage;

      (c) Limit an insurer that provided coverage against underinsured motorists from pursuing a claim against a party at fault; or

      (d) Require a person to repay more than the amount of personal injury protection benefits that the person actually received. [1993 c.709 §9; 2015 c.5 §5; 2019 c.460 §4]

 

      742.546 Required disclosure in release for bodily injuries related to personal injury protection benefits. (1) When a motor vehicle liability insurer obtains a release for bodily injuries within 60 calendar days following an accident from a person who is eligible to receive personal injury protection benefits under ORS 742.518 to 742.542, the release must state that, subject to the motor vehicle liability insurer’s applicable limits of liability, the rights of an insurer furnishing personal injury protection to recover payments made for medical benefits from the motor vehicle liability insurer are not impaired.

      (2) Nothing in this section impairs the rights of a motor vehicle liability insurer to contest a recovery claim from an insurer furnishing personal injury protection, based upon liability or the reasonableness or necessity of medical benefits paid by the insurer furnishing personal injury protection. [2009 c.545 §2]

 

      Note: 742.546 and 742.548 were added to and made a part of the Insurance Code by legislative action but were not added to ORS chapter 742 or any series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      742.548 Required language in disclosure; conditions for rescission of release. If a representative of a motor vehicle liability insurer obtains a release for a claim of bodily injuries in person from a person who is eligible to receive personal injury protection benefits under ORS 742.518 to 742.542:

      (1) The representative of the insurer must provide the eligible person with a clear and conspicuous notice substantially similar to the following, which shall be incorporated into the insurer’s release or provided in a separate document:

______________________________________________________________________________

      THE DOCUMENT YOU ARE BEING ASKED TO SIGN IS A BINDING CONTRACT THAT CONCLUDES YOUR CLAIM(S) AGAINST THE PARTIES IT IDENTIFIES. AFTER YOU SIGN IT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY FURTHER CLAIM(S) AGAINST THESE PARTIES.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (2) The eligible person may rescind the release if the person provides the insurer written notice of rescission no later than five business days after the execution of the release and then promptly performs all other requisite acts for rescission of a contract. For the purposes of this subsection, notice of rescission is provided to an insurer on the date and time shown on a properly addressed proof of mailing or electronic transmission. [2009 c.545 §3]

 

      Note: See note under 742.546.

 

(Total Loss)

 

      742.554 Disclosures required by insurer to motor vehicle owner when insurer declares vehicle total loss. When an insurer declares a motor vehicle a total loss and offers to make a cash settlement to an insured or third-party owner of the motor vehicle, the insurer shall provide the insured or third-party owner:

      (1) Any valuation or appraisal reports relied upon by the insurer to determine value; and

      (2) A written statement in a form provided by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services that includes:

      (a) Information about total loss, vehicle valuation and the duties of the insurer; and

      (b) The manner in which and under what circumstances the insured may contact the Division of Financial Regulation of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. [2009 c.65 §2; 2017 c.17 §55]

 

      Note: 742.554 and 742.558 were added to and made a part of the Insurance Code by legislative action but were not added to ORS chapter 742 or any series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      742.558 Dispute resolution process for total loss vehicles. (1) An insurer shall pay the insured or third-party owner of a motor vehicle the amount of the motor vehicle’s value that is not in dispute if the insurer declares the motor vehicle a total loss and the insurer and the insured or third-party owner are unable to agree on the value of the motor vehicle. Acceptance of payment of the undisputed amount neither waives the rights of the insured or third-party owner under the policy nor prevents the insured or third-party owner from pursuing a claim for additional amounts. Payment of the undisputed amount by the insurer does not waive any rights of the insurer under the policy.

      (2) An insurer is not obligated to pay the undisputed amount under subsection (1) of this section until the insured or third-party owner of the motor vehicle:

      (a) Agrees to execute documents sufficient to transfer ownership of the motor vehicle to the insurer; and

      (b) Authorizes the insurer, at the insurer’s expense, to move the motor vehicle to a disclosed location selected by the insurer, where the motor vehicle will remain available for inspection and evaluation for not fewer than 14 calendar days.

      (3) After the expiration of the 14-day period under subsection (2) of this section, the insurer may proceed with the salvage sale of the motor vehicle. [2009 c.65 §3]

      (3) “Nonpayment of premium” means failure of the named insured to discharge when due any of the insured’s obligations in connection with the payment of premiums on the policy, or any installment of such premium, whether the premium is payable directly to the insurer or an insurance producer who is its agent or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit.

      (4) “Nonrenewal” means a notice by an insurer to the named insured that the insurer is unwilling to renew a policy.

      (5) “Policy” means any insurance policy that provides automobile liability coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, automobile medical payments coverage or automobile physical damage coverage on individually owned private passenger vehicles, including pickup and panel trucks and station wagons, that are not used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers, nor rented to others.

      (6) “Renewal” or “to renew” means to continue coverage for an additional policy period upon expiration of the current policy period of a policy. Any policy with a policy period or term of less than six months shall for the purpose of ORS 742.560 to 742.572 be considered as if written for a policy period or term of six months. Any policy written for a term longer than one year or any policy with no fixed expiration date shall for the purpose of ORS 742.560 to 742.572 be considered as if written for successive policy periods or terms of one year but not extending beyond the actual term for which the policy was written.

An insurer may not cancel a policy for the reason that the driving privileges of the named insured or operator were suspended pursuant to ORS 809.280 (6) or (8) if the suspension was based on a nondriving offense.

      (2) This section shall not apply to any policy or coverage which has been in effect less than 60 days at the time notice of cancellation is mailed or delivered by the insurer unless it is a renewal policy.

      (3) This section shall not apply to nonrenewal. [Formerly 743.905; 1991 c.860 §7a; 2011 c.355 §23]

      742.566 Renewal of policies; replacement policy in lieu of renewal; requirements for refusal to renew. (1) An insurer shall offer renewal of a policy to an insured, contingent upon payment of premium as stated in the offer, unless the insurer mails or delivers to the named insured, at the address shown in the policy, at least 30 days’ advance notice of nonrenewal. The notice must contain or be accompanied by a statement of the reason or reasons for nonrenewal.

      (2)(a) If an insurer offers to an insured, in lieu of a renewal, a replacement policy from a different company that is part of a group of companies that is under the same ownership or control as the insurer, any new terms, rates and policy provisions in the replacement policy take effect on the renewal date if the insurer sends the insured and any insurance producer with whom the insured previously dealt notice at least 45 days before the renewal date. The notice must include the replacement policy or a description of any terms in the replacement policy that differ from the policy that the insurer will not renew.

      (b) An insured may cancel a replacement policy at any point before the replacement policy becomes effective.

      (c) Earned premium for any period of time in which a replacement policy was in effect before a cancellation must be calculated pro rata at the lower of the current rate or the previous year’s rate.

      (d) If an insured accedes to a replacement policy, any increase in premium or change in policy terms is effective on the day after the previous policy expires.

      (e) The notice required under this subsection applies only if the company that offers a replacement policy is different from the company that issued the policy that would otherwise be subject to renewal.

      (3) An insurer need not notify the named insured or any other insured of nonrenewal of the policy if the insurer has mailed or delivered a notice of expiration or cancellation on or prior to the 30th day preceding expiration of the policy period.

      (4) Notwithstanding an insurer’s failure to comply with this section, the policy terminates on the effective date of any replacement or succeeding automobile insurance policy, with respect to any automobile designated in both policies.

      (5) An insurer may not refuse to renew a policy for the reason that the driving privileges of the named insured or any operator either resident in the same household or who customarily operates an automobile insured under the policy were suspended pursuant to ORS 809.280 (6) or (8) if the suspension was based on a nondriving offense. [Formerly 743.916; 1991 c.860 §7b; 2011 c.355 §24; 2017 c.250 §1]

      742.570 Notifying insured under canceled or unrenewed policy of eligibility for participation in insurance pool. When automobile bodily injury and property damage liability coverage is canceled, other than for nonpayment of premium, or in the event of failure to renew automobile bodily injury and property damage liability coverage to which ORS 742.566 applies, the insurer shall notify the named insured of possible eligibility for automobile liability insurance through any insurance pool or facility operating in this state, whether voluntarily or under statute or rule. Such notice shall accompany or be included in the notice of cancellation or the notice of intent not to renew. [Formerly 743.925]

 

      742.572 Immunity from liability of persons furnishing information regarding cancellation or nonrenewal of policies. There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or against any insurer, its authorized representative, its agents, its employees, or any firm, person or corporation furnishing to the insurer information as to reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal, for any statement made by any of them in any written notice of cancellation or nonrenewal, or in any other communication, oral or written, specifying the reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal, or providing of information pertaining thereto, or for statements made or evidence submitted at any hearings conducted in connection therewith.

      (6) Notwithstanding any provision in the owner’s insurance policy, while the vehicle is under the operation and control of a person, other than the vehicle’s registered owner, pursuant to a personal vehicle sharing program, or is otherwise under the control of a personal vehicle sharing program:

      (5) “Renewal” or “renew” means the issuance of, or the offer to issue by an insurer, a policy succeeding a policy previously issued and delivered by the same insurer or the issuance of a certificate or notice extending the terms of an existing policy for a specified period beyond its expiration date. [Formerly 743.940; 2003 c.364 §104]

 

      742.702 Grounds for cancellation; notice. (1) Except as provided in ORS 742.710, a contract of commercial liability insurance may not be canceled by an insurer before the expiration of the policy, except on one or more of the following grounds:

      (a) Nonpayment of premium.

      (b) Fraud or material misrepresentation made by or with the knowledge of the named insured in obtaining the policy, continuing the policy or in presenting a claim under the policy.

      (c) Substantial increase in the risk of loss after insurance coverage has been issued or renewed, including but not limited to an increase in exposure due to rules, legislation or court decision.

      (d) Failure to comply with reasonable loss control recommendations.

      (e) Substantial breach of contractual duties, conditions or warranties.

      (f) Determination by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services that the continuation of a line of insurance or class of business to which the policy belongs will jeopardize a company’s solvency or will place the insurer in violation of the insurance laws of Oregon or any other state.

      (g) Loss or decrease in reinsurance covering the risk.

      (h) Any other reason approved by the director by rule.

      (2) Cancellation of a commercial liability policy shall not be effective until at least 10 working days after the insured receives a written notice of cancellation. The notice shall state the effective date of and the reason for cancellation and shall inform the insured of the hearing rights established by ORS 742.704.

      (3) This section does not apply to policies canceled because of action by an insurer under ORS 731.482. [Formerly 743.942]

 

      742.704 Hearing. Within 30 days after receiving a notice of cancellation under ORS 742.702, an insured may request a hearing before the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The purpose of this hearing shall be limited to establishing the existence of the proof or evidence given by the insurer in its notice of cancellation. The burden of proving the reason for cancellation shall be upon the insurer. [Formerly 743.944]

 

      742.706 Renewal; nonrenewal. (1) If an insurer offers or purports to renew a commercial liability policy, but on terms less favorable to the insured or at higher rates, the new terms or rates may take effect on the renewal date, if the insurer provides the insured, and the insurance producer if any, 45 days’ written notice. If the insurer does not provide such notice, the insured may cancel the renewal policy within 45 days after receipt of the notice or delivery of the renewal policy. Earned premium for the period of time the renewal policy was in force shall be calculated pro rata at the lower of the current or previous year’s rate. If the insured accepts the renewal, any premium increase or changes in terms shall be effective immediately following the prior policy’s expiration date.

      (2) Nonrenewal of a commercial liability policy shall not be effective until at least 45 days after the insured receives a written notice of nonrenewal. If, after an insurer provides a notice of nonrenewal as described in this subsection, the insurer extends the policy 90 days or less, an additional notice of nonrenewal is not required with respect to the extension.

      (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply:

      (a) If the change is a rate, form or plan filed with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and applicable to the entire line of insurance or class of business to which the policy belongs; or

      (b) To a premium increase based on the altered nature or extent of the risk insured against.

      (4) If a commercial liability policy is issued for a term longer than one year, and for additional consideration a premium is guaranteed, the insurer may not refuse to renew the policy or increase the premium for the term of that policy. [Formerly 743.946; 2003 c.364 §105; 2005 c.102 §1]

 

      742.708 Proof of receipt of notice. A post office certificate of mailing to the named insured at the named insured’s last-known address shall constitute conclusive proof that the named insured received the notice of cancellation or nonrenewal on the third calendar day after the date of the certificate of mailing. [Formerly 743.948]

 

      742.710 Exemptions from provisions of ORS 742.700 to 742.708. (1) ORS 742.700 to 742.708 do not apply to:

      (a) Any commercial liability insurance policy that has not been previously renewed if the policy has been in effect less than 60 days at the time notice of cancellation is mailed or otherwise delivered.
