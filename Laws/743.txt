      (a) Specify all information a carrier must submit as part of a rate filing under this section; and

      (4) The director, after conducting an actuarial review of the rate filing, may approve a proposed premium rate for a health benefit plan for small employers or for an individual health benefit plan if, in the director’s discretion, the proposed rates are:

      (a) Actuarially sound;

      (b) Reasonable and not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory; and

      (c) Based upon reasonable administrative expenses.

      (f) Changes in the insurer’s health care cost containment and quality improvement efforts since the insurer’s last rate filing for the same category of health benefit plan.

      (h) Any public comments received under ORS 743.019 pertaining to the standards set forth in subsection (4) of this section and this subsection.

      (6) The requirements of this section do not supersede other provisions of law that require insurers, health care service contractors or multiple employer welfare arrangements providing health insurance to file schedules or tables of premium rates or proposed premium rates with the director or to seek the director’s approval of rates or changes to rates.

      (1) A spouse may effectuate such insurance upon the other spouse.

      (2) Any person having an insurable interest in the life of a minor, or any person upon whom a minor is dependent for support and maintenance, may effectuate insurance upon the life of or pertaining to such minor.

      (a) Is closely related to the adult by blood or by law or has a substantial interest in the adult engendered by love and affection; and

      (b) Has a lawful and substantial interest in having the life, health and bodily safety of the adult continue. [Formerly 743.027]

 

      743.039 Alteration of application for life or health insurance. (1) An application for a life insurance policy may not provide for alterations by any person other than the applicant in either the application or the policy to be issued thereon with respect to the amount of insurance, classification of risk, plan of insurance or the benefits unless the application contains a statement that no such changes are effective until approved in writing by the applicant.

      (2) No alteration of any written application for any health insurance policy shall be made by any person other than the applicant without the written consent of the applicant, except that insertions may be made by the insurer, for administrative purposes only, in such manner as to indicate clearly that such insertions are not to be ascribed to the applicant.

      (2) If the beneficiary, assignee or other payee under any policy made in violation of this section receives from the insurer any benefits thereunder accruing upon the death, disablement or injury of the individual insured, the individual insured or the individual’s executor or administrator, as the case may be, may maintain an action to recover such benefits from the person so receiving them.

      (3) An insurer shall be entitled to rely upon all statements, declarations and representations made by an applicant for insurance relative to the matter of insurable interest.

      743.041 Payment discharges insurer. Whenever the proceeds of or payments under a life or health insurance policy become payable in accordance with the terms of such policy, or the exercise of any right or privilege under such policy, and the insurer makes payment in accordance with the terms of the policy or in accordance with any written assignment of the policy, the person so designated as being entitled to the proceeds or payments shall be entitled to receive them and to give full acquittance therefor, and such payments shall fully discharge the insurer from all claims under the policy unless, before payment is made, the insurer has received at its home office written notice by or on behalf of some other person that such other person claims to be entitled to such proceeds or payments or some interest in the policy.

Any such assignment shall entitle the insurer to deal with the assignee as the owner or pledgee of the policy in accordance with the terms of the assignment, until the insurer has received at its home office written notice of termination of the assignment or pledge, or written notice by or on behalf of some other person claiming some interest in the policy in conflict with the assignment. [Formerly 743.087]

      (3) The person paying the consideration for such insurance shall have all rights conferred by the policy to loan value at any time during the premium-paying period, but not at maturity, notwithstanding such person has no insurable interest in the life of the person insured.

      743.046 Exemption of proceeds of individual life insurance other than annuities. (1) When a policy of insurance is effected by any person on any person’s own life or on another life in favor of some person other than that person having an insurable interest in the life insured, the lawful beneficiary thereof, other than that person or that person’s legal representative, is entitled to its proceeds against the creditors or representatives of the person effecting the policy.

      (2) The person to whom a policy of life insurance is made payable may maintain an action thereon in the person’s own name.

      (3) A policy of life insurance payable to a beneficiary other than the estate of the insured, having by its terms a cash surrender value available to the insured, is exempt from execution issued from any court in this state and in the event of bankruptcy of such insured is exempt from all demands in legal proceeding under such bankruptcy.

      (4) Subject to the statute of limitations, the amount of any premiums paid in fraud of creditors for such insurance, with interest thereon, shall inure to their benefit from the proceeds of the policy. The insurer issuing the policy shall be discharged of all liability thereon by payment of its proceeds in accordance with its terms unless, before such payment, the insurer has received at its home office written notice by or in behalf of some creditor, with specifications of the amount claimed, claiming to recover for certain premiums paid in fraud of creditors.

      (5) The insured under any policy within this section shall not be denied the right to change the beneficiary when such right is expressly reserved in the policy.

      (6) This section does not apply to annuity policies. [Formerly 739.405 and then 743.099]

 

      743.047 Exemption of proceeds of group life insurance. (1) A policy of group life insurance or the proceeds thereof payable to a person or persons other than the individual insured or the individual’s estate shall be exempt from debts and claims of creditors or representatives of the individual insured and, in the event of bankruptcy of the individual insured, from all demands in legal proceedings under such bankruptcy.

      (2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to group life insurance issued to a creditor covering the creditor’s debtors to the extent that such proceeds are applied to payment of the obligation for the purpose of which the insurance was so issued. [Formerly 743.102]

 

      743.048 [Formerly 736.315; renumbered 742.018]

 

      743.049 Exemption of proceeds of annuity policies; assignability of rights. (1) The benefits, rights, privileges and options which are due or prospectively due an annuitant under any annuity policy issued before, on or after June 8, 1967, shall not be subject to execution, nor shall the annuitant be compelled to exercise any such rights, powers or options, nor shall creditors be allowed to interfere with or terminate the policy, except:

      (a) As to amounts paid for or as premium on any such annuity with intent to defraud creditors, with interest thereon, and of which the creditor has given the insurer written notice at its home office prior to the making of the payments to the annuitant out of which the creditor seeks to recover. Any such notice shall specify the amount claimed or such facts as will enable the insurer to ascertain such amount, and shall set forth such facts as will enable the insurer to ascertain the annuity policy, the annuitant and the payments sought to be avoided on the ground of fraud.

      (b) The total exemption of benefits presently due and payable to any annuitant periodically or at stated times under all annuity policies under which the person is an annuitant shall not at any time exceed $500 per month for the length of time represented by such installments. Such periodic payments in excess of $500 per month shall be subject to garnishee execution to the same extent as are wages and salaries.

      (c) If the total benefits presently due and payable to any annuitant under all annuity policies under which the person is an annuitant shall at any time exceed payment at the rate of $500 per month, the court may order such annuitant to pay to a judgment creditor or apply on the judgment, in installments, the portion of such excess benefits as to the court may appear just and proper, after due regard for the reasonable requirements of the judgment debtor and family, if dependent upon the judgment debtor, as well as any payments required to be made by the annuitant to other creditors under prior court orders.

      (2) If the policy so provides, the benefits, rights, privileges or options accruing under the policy to a beneficiary or assignee shall not be transferable nor subject to commutation, and if the benefits are payable periodically or at stated times, the same exemptions and exceptions contained in this section for the annuitant shall apply with respect to such beneficiary or assignee. [Formerly 743.105; 1991 c.182 §3]

 

      743.050 Exemption of proceeds of health insurance. Except as may otherwise be expressly provided by the policy, the proceeds or avails of all health insurance policies and of provisions providing benefits on account of the insured’s disability which are supplemental to life insurance policies, issued before, on or after June 8, 1967, shall be exempt from all liability for any debt of the insured, and from any debt of the beneficiary existing at the time the proceeds are made available for the use of the beneficiary.

POLICY LANGUAGE SIMPLIFICATION

 

      743.100 Short title. ORS 743.100 to 743.109 may be cited as the Life and Health Insurance Policy Language Simplification Act. [Formerly 743.350]

 

      743.101 Purpose. (1) The purpose of the Life and Health Insurance Policy Language Simplification Act is to establish minimum standards for language used in policies and certificates of life insurance and health insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this state in order to facilitate ease of reading.

      (2) ORS 743.100 to 743.109 is not intended to increase the risk assumed by insurers or to supersede their obligation to comply with the substance of other Insurance Code provisions applicable to insurance policies. ORS 743.100 to 743.109 is not intended to impede flexibility and innovation in the development of policy forms or content or to lead to the standardization of policy forms or content. [Formerly 743.353]

 

      743.102 [1967 c.359 §367; renumbered 743.047 in 1989]

 

      743.103 Definitions for ORS 743.100 to 743.109. As used in ORS 743.100 to 743.109, “policy” has the meaning given in ORS 731.122 and, in addition, includes a certificate issued pursuant to a group insurance policy delivered or issued for delivery in this state. [Formerly 743.357]

 

      743.104 Scope of ORS 743.100 to 743.109. (1) ORS 743.100 to 743.109 apply to all policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state, except:

      (a) Any policy that is a security subject to federal jurisdiction.

      (b) Any group policy covering a group of 1,000 or more lives at date of issue, other than a group credit life insurance policy or a group credit health insurance policy. However, this paragraph shall not exempt any certificate issued pursuant to a group policy.

      (c) Any group annuity contract that serves as a funding vehicle for a pension, profit-sharing or deferred compensation plan.

      (d) Any form used in connection with, as a conversion from, as an addition to, or, pursuant to a contractual provision, in exchange for, a policy delivered or issued for delivery on a form approved or permitted to be issued prior to the date the form must be approved under section 9, chapter 708, Oregon Laws 1979.

      (e) The renewal of a policy delivered or issued for delivery prior to the date the policy form must be approved under section 9, chapter 708, Oregon Laws 1979.

      (f) Any certificate issued pursuant to a group policy not delivered or issued for delivery in this state.

      (2) A non-English language policy will be deemed to comply with ORS 743.106 if the insurer certifies that the policy is translated from an English language policy that complies with ORS 743.106. [Formerly 743.362]

 

      743.105 [1967 c.359 §368; renumbered 743.049 in 1989]

 

      743.106 Reading ease standards for life and health insurance policies. (1) No policy form shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless:

      (a) The policy text achieves a score of 40 or more on the Flesch reading ease test, or an equivalent score on any comparable test as provided in subsection (3) of this section;

      (b) The policy, except for specification pages, schedules and tables is printed in not less than 12-point type, 13-point leading for health benefit plans, as defined in ORS 743B.005, and 10-point type, 11-point leading for all other policies;

      (c) The style, arrangement and overall appearance of the policy give no undue prominence to any portion of the text, including the text of any indorsements or riders; and

      (d) The policy contains a table of contents or an index of the principal sections of the policy, if the policy has more than 3,000 words of text printed on three or less pages, or regardless of the number of words if the policy has more than three pages.

      (2) For the purposes of this section, a Flesch reading ease test score shall be calculated as follows:

      (a) For policy forms containing 10,000 words or less of text, the entire form shall be analyzed. For policy forms containing more than 10,000 words, two 200-word samples per page may be analyzed instead of the entire form. The samples shall be separated by at least 20 printed lines.

      (b) The number of words and sentences in the text shall be counted and the total number of words divided by the total number of sentences. The figure obtained shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.015.

      (c) The total number of syllables in the text shall be counted and divided by the total number of words. The figure obtained shall be multiplied by a factor of 84.6.

      (d) The sum of the figures computed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection subtracted from 206.835 equals the Flesch reading ease test score for the policy form.

      (e) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, the following procedures shall be used:

      (A) A contraction, hyphenated word or numbers and letters, when separated by spaces, shall be counted as one word.

      (B) A unit of words ending with a period, semicolon or colon shall be counted as a sentence.

      (C) A “syllable” means a unit of spoken language consisting of one or more letters of a word as divided by an accepted dictionary. If the dictionary shows two or more equally acceptable pronunciations of a word, the pronunciation containing fewer syllables may be used.

      (f) As used in this section, “text” includes all written matter except the following:

      (A) The name and address of the insurer; the name, number or title of the policy; the table of contents or index; captions and subcaptions; specification pages; schedules or tables; and

      (B) Policy language drafted to conform to the requirements of any state or federal law, regulation or agency interpretation; policy language required by any collectively bargained agreement; medical terminology; and words that are defined in the policy. However, the insurer shall identify the language or terminology excepted by this subparagraph and shall certify in writing that the language or terminology is entitled to be excepted by this subparagraph.

      (3) Any other reading test may be approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services as an alternative to the Flesch reading ease test if it is comparable in result to the Flesch reading ease test.

      (4) Each policy filing shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an officer of the insurer stating that the policy meets the minimum required reading ease score on the test used, or stating that the score is lower than the minimum required but should be authorized in accordance with ORS 743.107. To confirm the accuracy of a certification, the director may require the submission of further information.

      (5) At the option of the insurer, riders, indorsements, applications and other forms made a part of the policy may be scored as separate forms or as part of the policy with which they may be used. [Formerly 743.365; 2015 c.515 §5]

 

      743.107 When director may authorize lower standards. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may authorize a lower score than the Flesch reading ease test score required by ORS 743.106 when, in the director’s sole discretion, the director finds that a lower required score:

      (1) Will provide a more accurate reflection of the readability of a policy form;

      (2) Is warranted by the nature of a particular policy form or type or class of policy forms; or

      (3) Is caused by certain policy language drafted to conform to the requirements of any state law, regulation or agency interpretation. [Formerly 743.368]

 

      743.108 [1967 c.359 §369; renumbered 743.050 in 1989]

 

      743.109 Approval of certain policy forms containing specified provisions; conditions for approval. A policy form meeting the requirements of ORS 743.106 shall not be disapproved because of other provisions of the Insurance Code that specify the content of policies, if the policy form provides the policyholders and claimants protection not less favorable than they would be entitled to under such provisions.

      743.150 Scope of ORS 743.150, 743.153 and 743.156. This section and ORS 743.153 and 743.156 apply only to policies of life insurance, other than group life insurance. [1967 c.359 §372]

 

      743.153 Statement of benefits. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision stating the amount of benefits payable or the method to be used or procedure to be followed in determining such amount, the manner of payment and the consideration therefor. [Formerly 739.310]

 

      743.154 Acceleration of death benefits; rules. (1) A life insurance policy or a rider to a life insurance policy may provide for the acceleration of death benefits as part of the life insurance coverage. For purposes of this section, accelerated death benefits are benefits that:

      (a) Are payable to the policy owner or certificate holder during the lifetime of the insured, in anticipation of death or upon the occurrence of specified life-threatening or catastrophic conditions as defined by the policy or rider;

      (b) Reduce the death benefit otherwise payable under the life insurance policy; and

      (c) Are payable upon the occurrence of a single qualifying event that results in the payment of a benefit amount fixed at the time of acceleration.

      (2) For purposes of this section, a qualifying event is one or more of the following:

      (a) A medical condition that will result in a drastically limited life span, as specified in the policy or rider, not exceeding 24 months.

      (b) A medical condition that has required or requires extraordinary medical intervention, such as a major organ transplant or continuous artificial life support, without which the insured would die.

      (c) Any condition that usually requires continuous confinement in an eligible institution, as defined in the policy or rider, if the insured is expected to remain there for the rest of the insured’s life.

      (d) A medical condition that in the absence of extensive or extraordinary medical treatment will result in a drastically limited life span. Such conditions may include but are not limited to one or more of the following:

      (A) Coronary artery disease resulting in an acute infarction or requiring surgery;

      (B) Permanent neurological deficit resulting from cerebral vascular accident;

      (C) End-stage renal failure; or

      (D) Human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

      (e) Any other event determined by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to be life-threatening.

      (3) A policy or rider that provides for the acceleration of death benefits:

      (a) Must also provide for the continuation of the policy as to the amount of the death benefit that is not accelerated.

      (b) Must allow the policy owner or the certificate holder to request payment at any time during the period that the qualifying event continues.

      (4) A policy or rider that provides for the acceleration of death benefits under this section shall not be described or marketed by an insurer as long term care insurance or as providing long term care benefits.

      (5) The director shall adopt rules establishing minimum benefits, criteria for the payment of accelerated benefits, disclosure requirements and actuarial standards. [1991 c.571 §2; 1993 c.17 §1; 2019 c.280 §15]

 

      743.156 Statement of premium. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision separately stating the premium for each benefit provision of the policy for which such separate statement is necessary, as determined by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, to give adequate disclosure of the terms of the policy. [1967 c.359 §374]

 

(Individual Life Insurance Policies)

 

      743.159 Scope of ORS 743.162 to 743.243. ORS 743.162 to 743.243 apply only to policies of life insurance other than group life insurance, and do not apply to annuity or pure endowment policies. Such sections apply to such policies that are policies of variable life insurance, except to the extent the provisions of such sections are obviously inapplicable to variable life insurance or are in conflict with other provisions of such sections that are expressly applicable to variable life insurance. [1967 c.359 §375; 1973 c.435 §16]

 

      743.162 Payment of premium. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision relating to the time and place of payment of premium. [1967 c.359 §376]

 

      743.165 Grace period. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that a grace period of 30 days, or, at the option of the insurer, of one month of not less than 30 days, or of four weeks in the case of industrial life insurance policies the premiums for which are payable more frequently than monthly, shall be allowed within which the payment of any premium after the first may be made, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in full force. The insurer may impose an interest charge not in excess of six percent per annum for the number of days of grace elapsing before the payment of the premium. If a claim arises under the policy during such period of grace the amount of any premium due or overdue, together with interest and any deferred installment of the annual premium, may be deducted from the policy proceeds. [1967 c.359 §377]

 

      743.168 Incontestability. (1) A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that the policy shall be incontestable after it has been in force for two years from its date of issue during the lifetime of the insured, except for nonpayment of premiums. At the option of the insurer the two-year limit within which the policy may be contested shall not apply to the provisions for benefits in the event of total and permanent disability and provisions which grant additional insurance specifically against death by accident.

      (2) A provision in a life insurance policy providing that such policy shall be incontestable after a specified period shall preclude only a contest of the validity of the policy, and shall not preclude the assertion at any time of defenses based upon provisions in the policy which exclude or restrict coverage, whether or not such restrictions or exclusions are excepted in such provision. [1967 c.359 §378]

 

      743.171 Incontestability and limitation of liability after reinstatement. (1) A reinstated policy of life insurance may be contested on account of fraud or misrepresentation of facts material to the reinstatement only for the same period following reinstatement, and with the same conditions and exceptions, as the policy provides with respect to contestability after original issuance.

      (2) When any policy of life insurance is reinstated, such reinstated policy may exclude or restrict liability to the same extent that such liability could have been or was excluded or restricted when the policy was originally issued, and such exclusion or restriction shall be effective from the date of reinstatement. [1967 c.359 §379]

 

      743.174 Entire contract. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that the policy constitutes the entire contract between the parties. [1967 c.359 §380]

 

      743.177 Statements of insured. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that all statements made by or on behalf of the insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties, and that no such statement shall be used in defense of a claim under the policy unless contained in a written application and unless a copy of such application is indorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued. [1967 c.359 §381]

 

      743.180 Misstatement of age. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that if it is found at any time before final settlement under the policy that the age of the insured or of any other person whose age is considered in determining the premium or benefit accruing under the policy has been misstated, the amount payable or benefit accruing under the policy shall be such as the premium would have purchased at the correct age or ages, or the premium may be adjusted and credit given to the insured or to the insurer, according to the insurer’s published rate at date of issue. [1967 c.359 §382]

 

      743.183 Dividends. (1) A life insurance policy other than a nonparticipating policy shall contain a provision that the policy shall participate in the divisible surplus of the insurer annually, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year. Any policy containing provision for participation beginning at the end of the first or the second policy year may provide that dividends for either or both of such years shall be paid subject to the payment of the premium for the next ensuing year. The owner of the policy shall have the right each year to have the dividend arising from such participation paid in cash, and if the policy provides other dividend options, it shall further provide which dividend option is effective if the owner does not elect one of such options on or before the expiration of the period of grace allowed for the payment of the premium.

      (2) In participating industrial life insurance policies, in lieu of the provision required in subsection (1) of this section, there shall be a provision that, beginning not later than the end of the fifth policy year, the policy shall participate annually in the divisible surplus in the manner set forth in the policy.

      (3) This section does not apply to any form of paid-up insurance or temporary insurance or endowment insurance issued or granted in exchange for lapsed or surrendered policies. [1967 c.359 §383]

 

      743.186 Policy loan. (1) A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that after three full years’ premiums have been paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security thereof, an amount equal to or, at the option of the party entitled thereto, less than the loan value of the policy, at a rate of interest not exceeding the maximum rate permitted by the policy loan provision. The interest rate provision shall comply with ORS 743.187. The loan value of the policy shall be equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, less any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining such cash surrender value including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may also provide that:

      (a) Interest on any indebtedness that is 90 or more days past due shall be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the rate applicable to the existing indebtedness; and

      (b) Except as provided in ORS 743.187, if the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, the policy shall terminate and become void upon 30 days’ notice by the insurer mailed to the last-known address of the insured or other policy owner and of any assignee of record at the home office of the insurer.

      (2) The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application therefor.

      (3) The policy, at the insurer’s option, may provide for automatic premium loan.

      (4) This section does not apply to term insurance policies or term insurance benefits provided by rider or supplemental policy provisions, or to industrial life insurance policies. [1967 c.359 §384; 1975 c.575 §1; 1981 c.412 §18; 2001 c.318 §12]

 

      743.187 Maximum interest rate on policy loan; adjustable interest rate. (1) Except as provided otherwise in this section, the maximum interest rate in the policy loan provision required by ORS 743.186 shall be eight percent per year. The insurer may include in the policy loan provision, in lieu of a fixed maximum interest rate, a provision for an adjustable interest rate. The adjustable interest rate provision must comply with this section. A limitation on interest rates under state law, other than a limitation contained in the Insurance Code, shall not apply to interest rates for life insurance policy loans unless the limitation specifically applies to life insurance policy loans.

      (2) The adjustable interest rate provision:

      (a) Shall state in substance that in accordance with the policy and the law of the jurisdiction in which the policy is delivered, the insurer will establish from time to time the interest rate for an existing or a new policy loan; and

      (b) Shall set forth the dates on which the insurer will determine policy loan interest rates. These determination dates shall be at regular intervals no longer than one year and no shorter than three months.

      (3) The maximum interest rate permitted for a policy loan under the adjustable interest rate provision shall be established by the provision as the higher of:

      (a) The interest rate used to calculate cash surrender values under the policy during the same period, plus one percent; and

      (b) The Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., for the calendar month which precedes by two months the month in which the determination date for the policy loan interest rate falls. However, if the Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that the Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates is no longer an appropriate rate for this purpose, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services by rule may establish the method of determining the rate under this paragraph. The director’s rule, to the maximum extent reasonable, shall be consistent with the pertinent actions of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

      (4) On any date specified in the adjustable interest rate provision of the policy for determining the policy loan interest rate:

      (a) The insurer may increase the existing rate if the maximum rate permitted by the provision exceeds the existing rate by at least one-half of one percent. The increase shall not be less than one-half of one percent or more than the amount by which the permitted maximum rate exceeds the existing rate; and

      (b) The insurer shall decrease the existing rate if the existing rate exceeds the maximum rate permitted by the provision by at least one-half of one percent. The decrease shall not be less than the amount by which the existing rate exceeds the permitted maximum rate.

      (5) The insurer under the adjustable interest rate provision shall give notice of the policy loan interest rate and related matters to the policy owner and all other persons entitled to notice by the policy, as follows:

      (a) In the case of a loan other than for payment of a premium to the insurer, the insurer shall give notice of the initial interest rate on the loan when the loan is made.

      (b) In the case of a loan for payment of a premium to the insurer, the insurer shall give notice of the initial interest rate on the loan as soon as reasonably practicable after the loan is made. However, the insurer need not give this notice when an additional premium loan is made at the same interest rate then applicable to an existing premium loan to the borrower.

      (c) In the case of a policy with an outstanding loan, the insurer shall give notice of each increase in the loan interest rate reasonably in advance of the increase.

      (d) Notices given under this subsection shall include in substance the information required by subsection (2) of this section.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 743.186, a policy shall not terminate in a particular policy year solely because a change in the policy loan interest rate during that year caused the total indebtedness under the policy to reach the policy loan value. The policy shall remain in force during that year unless and until it would have terminated in the absence of any policy loan interest rate change during that year. [1981 c.412 §20]

 

      743.189 Reinstatement. A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that if in the event of a default in premium payments the value of the policy has been applied to provide a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, and if this benefit is currently in force and the original policy has not been surrendered to the insurer and canceled, and if a period of not more than three years has elapsed since the default (or two years in the case of an industrial life insurance policy), the policy may be reinstated upon furnishing evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer and payment of arrears of premiums and payment or reinstatement of any other indebtedness to the insurer under the policy, with interest at a rate not exceeding the maximum permitted by the policy loan provision. [1967 c.359 §385; 1981 c.412 §21]

 

      743.192 Payment of claim; payment of interest upon failure to pay proceeds. (1) A life insurance policy shall contain a provision that when the policy becomes a claim by the death of the insured, settlement shall be made upon receipt of due proof of death and of the interest of the claimant.

      (2) If the insurer fails to pay the proceeds of or make payment under the policy within 30 days after receipt of due proof of death and of the interest of the claimant, and if the beneficiary elects to receive a lump sum settlement, the insurer shall pay interest on any money due and unpaid after expiration of the 30-day period. The insurer shall compute the interest from the date of the insured’s death until the date of payment, at a rate not lower than that paid by the insurer on other withdrawable policy owner funds. At the end of the 30-day period, the insurer shall notify the named beneficiary or beneficiaries at their last-known address that interest at the applicable rate will be paid on the lump sum proceeds from the date of death of the insured.

      (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow an insurer to withhold payment of money payable under a life insurance policy to any named beneficiary for a period longer than reasonably necessary to transmit the payment. [1967 c.359 §386; 1983 c.754 §2]

 

      743.195 Installment payments. A life insurance policy shall contain a table showing the amounts of installments, if any, by which its proceeds may be payable. [1967 c.359 §387]

 

      743.198 Title. A life insurance policy shall contain a title briefly and correctly describing the policy. If an industrial life insurance policy, it shall have the words “industrial policy” imprinted on the face thereof as part of the descriptive matter. [1967 c.359 §388]

 

      743.201 Beneficiary of industrial policies. An industrial life insurance policy shall have the name of the beneficiary designated thereon, or in the application or other form if attached to the policy, with a reservation of the right to designate or change the beneficiary after the issuance of the policy unless such beneficiary has been irrevocably designated. The policy may also provide that no designation or change of beneficiary shall be binding on the insurer until indorsed on the policy by the insurer, and that the insurer may refuse to indorse the name of any proposed beneficiary who does not appear to the insurer to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. The policy may also provide that if the beneficiary designated in the policy does not make a claim under the policy or does not surrender the policy with due proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which shall not be less than 30 days after the death of the insured, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured, or is a minor, or dies before the insured, or is not legally competent to give a valid release, then the insurer may make any payment thereunder to the executor or administrator of the insured, or to any relative of the insured by blood or legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto by reason of having been named beneficiary, or by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention or burial of the insured. The policy may also include a similar provision applicable to any other payment due under the policy. [1967 c.359 §389]

 

      743.204 Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance; applicability. (1) ORS 743.204 to 743.222 may be cited as the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance.

      (2) The operative date of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance as to any policy is the earlier of:

      (a) January 1, 1948; or

      (b) The date specified in a written notice, filed with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services by the insurer, of election to comply with the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance as to such policy as of the specified date.

      (3) The Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance shall not apply to:

      (a) Any reinsurance, group insurance, pure endowment, annuity or reversionary annuity policy.

      (b) Any term policy or renewal thereof, of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy. For this purpose, the age at death for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at death of the oldest life.

      (c) Any term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, if each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in ORS 743.215 and 743.216, is less than the adjusted premium so calculated on a term policy or renewal thereof of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits or endowment benefits, which is issued at the same age, for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of 20 years or less that expires before age 71 and for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy. For this purpose, the age at death for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at death of the oldest life.

      (d) Any policy which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, and for which policy the cash surrender value or present value of paid-up nonforfeiture benefit calculated for the beginning of any policy year as specified in ORS 743.210, 743.213, 743.215 and 743.216 does not exceed two and one-half percent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of such year. [Formerly 739.340; 1977 c.320 §13; 1981 c.609 §12]

 

      743.207 Required provisions relating to nonforfeiture. (1) A life insurance policy shall contain in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this section, and which are essentially in compliance with ORS 743.221:

      (a) That in the event of default in any premium payment the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of the amount required by ORS 743.213. In lieu of this stipulated benefit the insurer may substitute, upon proper request made not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, another paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which is actuarially equivalent and provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefit or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefit.

      (b) That upon surrender of the policy within 60 days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary life insurance or five full years in the case of industrial life insurance, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of the amount required by ORS 743.210.

      (c) That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit will become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default.

      (d) That, if the policy has become paid up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary life insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial life insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of the amount required by ORS 743.210.

      (e)(A) In the case of all policies other than those provided for in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first 20 policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter. Such values and benefits shall be calculated on the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy. At the option of the insurer such table may also show such values and benefits for any year or years beyond the 20th policy year.

      (B) In the case of policies which provide, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, for unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than by change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate and method used in calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy.

      (f)(A) A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered.

      (B) An explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.

      (C) If a detailed statement of the method of computation of the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits shown in the policy is not stated in the policy, a statement that the method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered.

      (D) A statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are shown for consecutive years in the policy.

      (2) Any of the provisions set forth in subsection (1) of this section, or portions of the provisions, not applicable by reason of the particular plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.

      (3) The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy. [Formerly 739.345; 1981 c.609 §13]

 

      743.210 Determination of cash surrender values; applicability to certain policies. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, any cash surrender value available under a life insurance policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by ORS 743.207, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of:

      (a) The present value on such anniversary of the adjusted premiums, as defined in ORS 743.215 and 743.216, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary; and

      (b) The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.

      (2) This subsection applies to a life insurance policy issued on or after the operative date defined in ORS 743.215 which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium. For such a policy, the cash surrender value shall be an amount not less than the cash surrender value required by subsection (1) of this section for a policy otherwise similar to the subject policy but without such rider or supplemental policy provision, plus the cash surrender value required by subsection (1) of this section for a policy which provides only the benefits provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision in the subject policy.

      (3) This subsection applies to a family life insurance policy issued on or after the operative date defined in ORS 743.215 which policy defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured with a term that expires before age 71 of the spouse. For such a policy, the cash surrender value shall be an amount not less than the cash surrender value required by subsection (1) of this section for a policy otherwise similar to the subject policy but without such term insurance on the life of the spouse, plus the cash surrender value required by subsection (1) of this section for a policy which provides only the benefits provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse in the subject policy.

      (4) Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary under any policy which has been paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy which has been continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by ORS 743.207, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy. [Formerly 739.350; 1981 c.609 §14]

 

      743.213 Determination of paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under a life insurance policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by ORS 743.207 in the absence of the condition that premiums have been paid for at least a specified period. [Formerly 739.355; 1981 c.609 §15]

 

      743.215 Calculation of adjusted premiums. (1) This section applies to all life insurance policies issued on or after the operative date defined in this subsection for the issuing insurer. After January 1, 1982, any insurer may file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section with regard to any number of plans of insurance after a specified date before January 1, 1989. The specified date shall be the operative date of this subsection for the plan or plans, but if an insurer elects to make this subsection operative before January 1, 1989, for fewer than all plans, the insurer must comply with rules adopted by the director. There is no limit to the number of times that an insurer may make the election. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for the insurer shall be January 1, 1989.

      (2) Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, the adjusted premiums referred to in ORS 743.210 for any life insurance policy to which this section applies shall be calculated as provided in this subsection, on an annual basis, as a uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. This percentage shall be such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall equal the sum of:

      (a) The present value at the policy issue date of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;

      (b) One percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average of the amounts of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; and

      (c) One hundred twenty-five percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as defined in subsection (3) of this section. For this purpose, any excess of the nonforfeiture net level premium over four percent of such uniform or average amount of insurance shall be disregarded.

      (3) The nonforfeiture net level premium referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall equal the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue and on each anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due.

      (4) In the case of policies which provide, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, for unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than by change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy at the date of issue. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated as provided in subsection (5) of this section on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8) of this section, the recalculated future adjusted premiums referred to in subsection (4) of this section shall be calculated as provided in this subsection, on an annual basis, as a uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. This percentage shall be such that the present value, at the date of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall equal A plus B minus C, where these amounts are defined as follows:

      (a) “A” equals the present value, as of the date of change, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

      (b) “B” equals the additional expense allowance, if any, for the policy, as defined in subsection (6) of this section.

      (c) “C” equals the cash surrender value under the policy, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy, as of the date of change.

      (6) The additional expense allowance at the date of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, as referred to in subsection (5) of this section, shall equal the sum of:

      (a) One percent of the excess, if positive, of the average of the amounts of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to the change, over the average of the amounts of insurance, as defined before the change, at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to the last previous change or the policy issue date if there has been no change.

      (b) One hundred twenty-five percent of the change, if positive, in the amount of the nonforfeiture net level premium from the amount applicable prior to the change in policy benefits or premiums to the amount of the recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium determined from subsection (7) of this section as of the date of the change in policy benefits or premiums.

      (7) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium referred to in subsection (6) of this section shall equal Y divided by Z, where these amounts are defined as follows:

      (a) “Y” equals the sum of:

      (A) The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value at the date of change of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy, on or subsequent to the date of the change, on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and

      (B) The present value at the date of change of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

      (b) “Z” equals the present value at the date of change of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy, on or subsequent to the date of change, on which a premium falls due.

      (8) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the provisions of this subsection shall apply in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance determined so that, in each policy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as for an otherwise similar policy of a higher nongraded amount or amounts of insurance issued on the standard basis. Adjusted premiums and present values for a policy on such a substandard basis may be calculated as if the policy were issued to provide such a higher nongraded amount or amounts of insurance on the standard basis.

      (9) Except as provided in subsection (10) of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance shall, for all policies of life insurance to which this section applies, be calculated on the mortality and interest bases as follows:

      (a) For ordinary life insurance mortality:

      (A) The Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table shall be used; or

      (B) At the option of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors may be used instead of such table without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors.

      (b) For industrial life insurance mortality, the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table shall be used.

      (c) For all policies issued in a particular calendar year, an interest rate shall be used which does not exceed the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in subsection (11) of this section, for policies issued in that year.

      (10) The following provisions shall also apply, for policies to which this section applies, to the calculation of premiums and values referred to in the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance:

      (a) At the option of the insurer, such calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of an interest rate which does not exceed the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in subsection (11) of this section, for policies issued in the last preceding calendar year.

      (b) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by ORS 743.207, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and interest rate used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions.

      (c) An insurer shall calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up additions, on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.

      (d) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary life insurance, and not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial life insurance.

      (e) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of premiums and values may be based on appropriate modifications of the mortality tables referred to in subsection (9) of this section and in this subsection.

      (f) Any ordinary life mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved under rules issued by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors, or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table.

      (g) Any industrial life mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved under rules issued by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.

      (11) The nonforfeiture interest rate for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall equal 125 percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent.

      (12) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter or ORS chapter 743A, for any previously approved policy form, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not of itself require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form. [1981 c.609 §17; 1983 c.282 §1]

 

      743.216 Adjusted premiums; applicability. This section applies only to life insurance policies issued before the operative date defined in ORS 743.215. For such policies:

      (1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the adjusted premiums referred to in ORS 743.210 shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:

      (a) The present value at the policy issue date of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

      (b) Two percent of the amount of insurance if the insurance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount as defined in subsection (2) of this section if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy.

      (c) Forty percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year. For this purpose, any excess of the adjusted premium over four percent of the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount shall be disregarded.

      (d) Twenty-five percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy for the same uniform or the same equivalent uniform amount of insurance with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age, whichever is less. For this purpose, any excess of the adjusted premium over four percent of the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount shall be disregarded.

      (2) In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount of the subject policy for the purpose of this section shall be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the subject policy. However, in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age 10, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the subject policy prior to the attainment of age 10 were the amount provided by the subject policy at age 10.

      (3) The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be calculated in accordance with this subsection. The amounts specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall be calculated separately. Each such amount shall be calculated as specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. However, for the purposes of subsection (1)(b), (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be equal to the excess of the uniform or equivalent uniform amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The adjusted premiums for the entire policy shall equal the sum of:

      (a) The adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits; and

      (b) During the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, the adjusted premiums for such term insurance benefits.

      (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection and subsection (5) of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance shall for all policies of ordinary life insurance to which this section applies be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table. Such calculations for any category of ordinary life insurance issued on female lives may, however, be based on an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection and subsection (7) of this section, such calculations of adjusted premiums and present values for all policies of industrial life insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half percent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. The following exceptions pertain:

      (a) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than 130 percent of the rates of mortality according to the respective table.

      (b) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (5) This subsection applies only to policies of ordinary life insurance to which this section applies and which are issued on or after the operative date of this subsection as defined in subsection (6) of this section. For such policies, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance shall, except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. Such calculations for any category of ordinary life insurance issued on female lives may, however, be based on an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. Such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent, except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent may be used for policies issued from January 1, 1974, to December 31, 1977, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent may be used for policies issued on or after January 1, 1978, and with the further exception that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent may be used. The following exceptions pertain:

      (a) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table.

      (b) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.

      (6) After August 9, 1961, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of subsection (5) of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1966. After the filing of such notice, such specified date shall be the operative date of subsection (5) of this section for the insurer with respect to the ordinary life policies it thereafter issues. If an insurer makes no such election, such operative date for the insurer shall be January 1, 1966.

      (7) This subsection applies only to policies of industrial life insurance to which this section applies and which are issued on or after the operative date of this subsection as defined in subsection (8) of this section. For such policies, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance shall, except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. Such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent, except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent may be used for policies issued from January 1, 1974, to December 31, 1977, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent may be used for policies issued on or after January 1, 1978, and with the further exception that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent may be used. The following exceptions pertain:

      (a) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.

      (b) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.

      (8) After September 2, 1963, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of subsection (7) of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1968. After the filing of such notice, such specified date shall be the operative date of subsection (7) of this section for the insurer with respect to the industrial life insurance policies it thereafter issues. If an insurer makes no such election, such operative date for the insurer shall be January 1, 1968. [Formerly 739.360; 1973 c.636 §6; 1977 c.320 §14; 1981 c.609 §16]

 

      743.218 Requirements for determination of future premium amounts or minimum values. In the case of policies of life insurance which provide for determination of future premium amounts by the insurer on the basis of current estimates of future experience, or policies of life insurance which are of such a nature that minimum values cannot in the judgment of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services be determined by the methods otherwise described in the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, the following requirements shall apply:

      (1) The director must be satisfied that the policy benefits are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance;

      (2) The director must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of the policy are not misleading to prospective policyholders or insureds; and

      (3) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the policy must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the policy as calculated by a method consistent with the principles of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, as determined under rules issued by the director. [1981 c.609 §18]

 

      743.219 Supplemental rules for calculating nonforfeiture benefits. (1) Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under a life insurance policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary date shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary.

      (2) All values referred to in the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance may be calculated on the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death.

      (3) The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall not be less than the amounts used to provide the additions. [Formerly 739.365; 1981 c.609 §19]

 

      743.221 Cash surrender values upon default in premium payment. (1) This section shall apply to all life insurance policies issued on or after January 1, 1986.

      (2) Any cash surrender value available in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary under a life insurance policy to which this section applies shall be in an amount which does not differ, by more than two-tenths of one percent of the amount of insurance, if uniform, or the average of the amounts of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years, from A plus B minus C, where these amounts are defined as follows:

      (a) “A” equals the basic cash value on such anniversary as defined in subsection (3) of this section.

      (b) “B” equals the present value on such anniversary of any existing paid-up additions.

      (c) “C” equals the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy on such anniversary.

      (3)(a) The basic cash value referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall equal the present value, on a particular subject policy anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy if there had been no premium default, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, less the present value on such anniversary of the nonforfeiture factors, as defined in subsection (4) of this section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary. The basic cash value shall be taken as zero if this calculation produces a negative result.

      (b) Supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits and family coverage, as described in ORS 743.210 or 743.216, whichever is applicable to the policy, shall affect the basic cash value in the same manner as is provided in ORS 743.210 or 743.216 for their effect on the cash surrender values.

      (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the nonforfeiture factor referred to in subsection (3) of this section shall for each policy year equal a percentage of the adjusted premium for that policy year as defined in ORS 743.215 or 743.216, whichever is applicable to the policy. This percentage must:

      (A) Be uniform for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of:

      (i) The fifth policy anniversary; and

      (ii) The first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, at least equal to two-tenths of one percent of the amount of insurance, if uniform, or of the average of the amounts of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; and

      (B) Be such that no percentage after the later policy anniversary defined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies to fewer than five consecutive policy years.

      (b) No basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy as defined in ORS 743.215 or 743.216, whichever is applicable to the policy, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors defined in this subsection in the calculation of the basic cash value.

      (5) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the compliance of the policy with the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance. The cash surrender values referred to in this section shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.

      (6)(a) Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the manner specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts under the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance.

      (b) The amounts of any cash surrender values and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those described in ORS 743.222 shall conform with the principles of this section. [1981 c.609 §21]

 

      743.222 Policy benefits and premiums that shall be disregarded in calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 743.210, in ascertaining minimum cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits required by the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, benefits and their respective premiums provided for in a life insurance policy shall be disregarded where the benefits are payable:

      (a) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;

      (b) In the event of total and permanent disability;

      (c) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;

      (d) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance would not apply;

      (e) As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child’s age is 26, is uniform in amount after the child’s age is one, and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; or

      (f) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits.

      (2) No benefits such as are described in subsection (1) of this section are required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. [Formerly 739.370; 1981 c.609 §20]

 

      743.225 Prohibited provisions. No life insurance policy shall contain any of the following provisions:

      (1) A provision limiting the time within which any action at law or suit in equity may be commenced to less than three years after the cause of action or suit accrues.

      (2) A provision by which the policy purports to be issued or to take effect more than six months before the original application for the insurance was made.

      (3) A provision for forfeiture of the policy for failure to repay any loan on the policy or any interest on such loan while the total indebtedness on the policy is less than the loan value thereof. [Formerly 739.315]

 

      743.228 Acts of corporate insured or beneficiary with respect to policy. (1) Whenever a corporation organized under the laws of this state or qualified to do business in this state has caused to be insured the life of any director, officer, agent or employee, or whenever such corporation is named as a beneficiary in or assignee of any life insurance policy, due authority to effect, assign, release, relinquish, convert, surrender, change the beneficiary or take any other or different action with reference to such insurance shall be sufficiently evidenced to the insurer by a written statement under oath showing that such action has been approved by a majority of the board of directors. Such a statement shall be signed by the president and secretary of the corporation and bear the corporate seal.

      (2) Such a statement shall be binding upon the corporation and shall protect the insurer concerned in any act done or suffered by it upon the faith thereof without further inquiry into the validity of the corporate authority or the regularity of the corporate proceedings.

      (3) No person shall be disqualified by reason of interest in the subject matter from acting as a director or as a member of the executive committee of such a corporation on any corporate act touching such insurance. [Formerly 739.415]

 

      743.230 Variable life policy provisions. A variable life insurance policy shall contain in substance the following provisions:

      (1) A provision that there will be a period of grace of 30 days within which payment of any premium after the first may be made, during which period of grace the policy will continue in full force. If a claim arises under the policy during such period of grace, the amount of any premiums due or overdue, together with interest not in excess of six percent per annum and any deferred installment of the annual premium, may be deducted from the policy proceeds. The policy may contain a statement of the basis for determining any variation in benefits that may occur as a result of the payment of premium during the period of grace.

      (2) A provision that the policy will be reinstated at any time within three years from the date of a default in premium payments, unless the cash surrender value has been paid or the period of extended insurance has expired, upon the production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer and the payment of an amount not exceeding the greater of:

      (a) All overdue premiums and any other indebtedness to the insurer upon said policy with interest at a rate not exceeding six percent per annum; and

      (b) One hundred ten percent of the increase in cash surrender value resulting from reinstatement.

      (3) A provision for cash surrender values and paid-up insurance benefits available as nonforfeiture options in the event of default in a premium payment after premiums have been paid for a specified period. If the policy does not include a table of figures for the options so available, the policy shall provide that the insurer will furnish, at least once in each policy year, a statement showing the cash value as of a date no earlier than the next preceding policy anniversary.

      (a) The method of computation of cash values and other nonforfeiture benefits shall be as described either in the policy or in a statement filed with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and shall be actuarially appropriate to the variable nature of the policy.

      (b) The method of computation must result, if the net investment return credited to the policy at all times from the date of issue equals the specified investment increment factor, with premiums and benefits determined accordingly under the terms of the policy, in cash values and other nonforfeiture benefits at least equal to the minimum values required by the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for a policy with such premiums and benefits. The method of computation may disregard incidental minimum guarantees as to the dollar amounts payable. Incidental minimum guarantees include, but are not limited to, a guarantee which provides that the amount payable at death or maturity shall be at least equal to the amount that would be payable if the net investment return credited to the policy at all times from the date of issue is equal to the specified investment increment factor.

      (4) A provision specifying the investment increment factor to be used in computing the dollar amount of variable benefits or other variable payments or values under the policy, and guaranteeing that expense and mortality results will not adversely affect such dollar amounts. [1973 c.435 §18]

 

      743.231 “Profit-sharing policy” defined. “Profit-sharing policy” means:

      (1) A life insurance policy which by its terms expressly provides that the policyholder will participate in the distribution of earnings or surplus other than earnings or surplus attributable, by reasonable and nondiscriminatory standards, to the participating policies of the insurer and allocated to the policyholder on reasonable and nondiscriminatory standards; or

      (2) A life insurance policy the provisions of which, through sales material or oral presentations, are interpreted by the insurer to prospective policyholders as entitling the policyholder to the benefits described in subsection (1) of this section. [Formerly 739.705]

 

      743.234 “Charter policy” or “founders policy” defined. “Charter policy” or “founders policy” means:

      (1) A life insurance policy which by its terms expressly provides that the policyholder will receive some preferential or discriminatory advantage or benefit not available to persons who purchase insurance from the insurer at future dates or under other circumstances; or

      (2) A life insurance policy the provisions of which, through sales material or oral presentations, are interpreted by the insurer to prospective policyholders as entitling the policyholder to the benefits described in subsection (1) of this section. [Formerly 739.710]

 

      743.237 “Coupon policy” defined. “Coupon policy” means a life insurance policy which provides a series of pure endowments maturing periodically in amounts not exceeding the gross annual policy premiums. The term “pure endowment” or “endowment” is used in its accepted actuarial sense, meaning a benefit becoming payable at a specific future date if the insured person is then living. [Formerly 739.715]

 

      743.240 Profit-sharing, charter or founders policies prohibited. No profit-sharing, charter or founders policy shall be issued or delivered in this state. [Formerly 739.720]

 

      743.243 Restrictions on form of coupon policy. Coupon policies issued or delivered in this state shall be subject to the following provisions:

      (1) No detachable coupons or certificates or passbooks may be used. No other device may be used which tends to emphasize the periodic endowment benefits or which tends to create the impression that the endowments represent interest earnings or anything other than benefits which have been purchased by part of the policyholder’s premium payments.

      (2) Each endowment benefit must have a fixed maturity date and payment of the endowment benefit shall not be contingent upon the payment of any premium becoming due on or after such maturity date.

      (3) The endowment benefits must be expressed in dollar amounts rather than as percentages of other quantities or in other ways, both in the policy itself and in the sale thereof.

      (4) A separate premium for the periodic endowment benefits must be shown in the policy adjacent to the rest of the policy premium information and must be given the same emphasis in the policy and in the sale thereof as that given the rest of the policy premium information. This premium shall be calculated with mortality, interest and expense factors which are consistent with those for the basic policy premium. [1967 c.359 §403]

 

      743.245 Variable life insurance policy provisions. A variable life insurance policy shall contain a provision stating the essential features of the procedures to be followed by the insurer in determining benefits thereunder. Such a policy, and any certificate evidencing such a policy, shall contain on its first page a clear and prominent statement to the effect that benefits thereunder are variable. [1973 c.435 §14]

 

      743.247 Notice to variable life insurance policyholders. An insurer issuing individual variable life insurance policies shall mail to each policyholder at least once in each policy year after the first, at the last address of the policyholder known to the insurer:

      (b) In the case of a life insurance policy, the dollar amount of the death benefit. [1973 c.435 §15]

 

(Individual Annuity and Pure Endowment Policies)

 

      743.252 Scope of ORS 743.255 to 743.273. ORS 743.255 to 743.273 apply only to annuity and pure endowment policies, other than reversionary annuity policies except as provided in ORS 743.273, and other than group annuity policies, and shall not apply to reversionary or deferred annuity benefits included in life insurance policies. Such sections apply to such policies that are variable annuity policies, except to the extent the provisions of such sections are obviously inapplicable to variable annuities or are in conflict with other provisions of such sections that are expressly applicable to variable annuities. [1967 c.359 §404; 1973 c.435 §19]

 

      743.255 Grace period for annuities. An annuity or pure endowment policy shall contain a provision that there shall be a period of grace of one month, but not less than 30 days, within which any stipulated payment to the insurer falling due after the first such payment may be made, subject at the option of the insurer to an interest charge thereon at the rate specified in the policy but not exceeding six percent per annum for the number of days of grace elapsing before such payment, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in full force. In case a claim arises under the policy on account of death prior to expiration of the period of grace before the overdue payment to the insurer or the deferred payments of the current policy year, if any, are made, the amount of such payments, with interest on any overdue payments, may be deducted from any amount payable under the policy in settlement. [1967 c.359 §405]

 

      743.258 Incontestability. If any statement other than those relating to age, sex and identity are required as a condition to issuing an annuity or pure endowment policy, the policy shall contain a provision that the policy shall be incontestable after it has been in force during the lifetime of the person or of each of the persons as to whom such statements are required, for a period of two years from its date of issue, except for nonpayment of stipulated payments to the insurer. At the option of the insurer the two year limit within which the policy may be contested shall not apply to any provisions relative to benefits in the event of disability and any provisions which grant insurance specifically against death by accident or accidental means. [1967 c.359 §406]

 

      743.261 Entire contract. An annuity or pure endowment policy shall contain a provision that the policy, including a copy of the application if indorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties. [1967 c.359 §407]

 

      743.264 Misstatement of age or sex. An annuity or pure endowment policy shall contain a provision that if the age or sex of the person or persons upon whose life or lives the policy is made, or of any of them, has been misstated, the amount payable or benefits accruing under the policy shall be such as the stipulated payment or payments to the insurer would have purchased according to the correct age or sex, and that if the insurer has made any overpayment or overpayments on account of any such misstatement, the amount thereof with interest at the rate specified in the policy but not exceeding six percent per annum may be charged against the current or next succeeding payment or payments to be made by the insurer under the policy. [1967 c.359 §408]

 

      743.267 Dividends. If an annuity or pure endowment policy is participating, it shall contain a provision that the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion any divisible surplus accruing on the policy. [1967 c.359 §409]

 

      743.268 Advancement of policy loans. (1) An insurer may advance a policy loan equal to or less than the loan value of an annuity policy or a pure endowment policy if:

      (a) The policy premium is not in default beyond the grace period for payment;

      (b) The insured has properly assigned or pledged the policy on the sole security thereof; and

      (c) The interest rate provision complies with ORS 743.187 and does not exceed the maximum interest rate permitted by the policy loan provision.

      (2) An insurer may establish a minimum loan amount that may not exceed $1,000.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the loan value of the policy shall be equal to the cash surrender value of the policy, less any existing indebtedness and interest due that is not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value, plus any interest then accrued but not credited.

      (4) Subsection (3) of this section does not apply to a policy for which the loan value is established by federal law. When the loan value is established by federal law, the policy shall indicate the loan value as a dollar amount, a percentage of the cash surrender value or a combination of both.

      (5) Except as provided in ORS 743.187, if the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, the policy shall terminate and become void upon 30 days’ notice by the insurer mailed to the last-known address of the insured or other policy owner and of any assignee of record at the home office of the insurer. However, if there is any remaining cash surrender value under the policy after deducting the total indebtedness on the policy, an insurer may not terminate the policy.

      (6) A insurer may provide for automatic premium loans in an annuity policy or a pure endowment policy.

      (7) An annuity policy or a pure endowment policy may reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application for the loan if the insurer makes a written request to and receives written approval from the chief insurance regulator of the state of domicile of the insurer prior to exercising a deferral. [2005 c.185 §5]

 

      743.269 Periodic payments for period certain. An annuity policy meeting the requirements of this section may provide that periodic payments shall be made under the policy for a period certain. Payments under such a policy shall begin on a date less than 13 months after the date on which the insurer issues the policy. The policy shall provide that payments will be made for a period of five years or more. The periodic payments may be fixed or variable in amount. If such policy offers commuted values on the annuity, such values must be based on an interest rate not more than one percent in excess of the interest rates that were used in determining the payments when the annuity was purchased. [1995 c.632 §2]

 

      743.270 Reinstatement. An annuity or pure endowment policy shall contain a provision that the policy may be reinstated at any time within one year from a default in making stipulated payments to the insurer, unless the cash surrender value has been paid, but all overdue stipulated payments and any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy shall be paid or reinstated with interest at the rate specified in the policy but not exceeding six percent per annum, and in cases where applicable the insurer may also include a requirement of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer. [1967 c.359 §410]

 

      743.271 Periodic stipulated payments on variable annuities. A variable annuity policy requiring periodic stipulated payments to the insurer shall contain in substance the following provisions:

      (1) A provision that there will be a period of grace of 30 days within which any stipulated payment to the insurer after the first may be made, during which period of grace the policy will continue in full force. The policy may include a statement of the basis for determining the date as of which any such payment received during the period of grace will be applied.

      (2) A provision that, at any time within one year from the date of a default in making periodic stipulated payments to the insurer during the life of the annuitant, and unless the cash surrender value has been paid, the policy may be reinstated upon payment to the insurer of the overdue payments and all indebtedness to the insurer on the policy, with interest. The policy may include a statement of the basis for determining the date as of which the amount to cover such overdue payments and indebtedness will be applied.

      (3) A provision specifying the options available in the event of a default in a periodic stipulated payment. Such options may include an option to surrender the policy for a cash value as determined by the policy, and shall include an option to receive a paid-up annuity if the policy is not surrendered for cash, the amount of the paid-up annuity being determined by applying the value of the policy at the annuity commencement date in accordance with the terms of the policy. [1973 c.435 §21]

 

      743.272 Computing benefits. (1) A variable annuity policy shall specify the investment increment factors to be used in computing the dollar amount of variable benefits or other variable payments or values under the policy, and may guarantee that expense or mortality results or both will not adversely affect such dollar amounts. In the case of an individual variable annuity policy under which the expense or mortality results may adversely affect the dollar amount of benefits, the expense and mortality factors shall be correspondingly specified in the policy. “Expense” as used in this subsection may exclude some or all taxes, as specified in the policy.

      (2) In computing the dollar amount of variable benefits or other policy payments or values:

      (a) The annual net investment increment assumption shall not exceed five percent, except with the approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services; and

      (b) To the extent that the level of benefits may be affected by future mortality results, the mortality factor shall be determined from the Annuity Mortality Table for 1949, Ultimate, or any modification of that table not having a lower life expectancy at any age or, if approved by the director, from another table. [1973 c.435 §22]

 

      743.273 Standard provisions of reversionary annuities. A policy of reversionary annuity shall contain in substance the following provisions:

      (1) The provisions specified in ORS 743.255 to 743.267, except that under ORS 743.255 the insurer may at its option provide for an equitable reduction of the amount of the annuity payments in settlement of an overdue payment in lieu of providing for deduction of the overdue payment from an amount payable upon settlement under the policy.

      (2) A provision that the policy may be reinstated at any time within three years from the date of default in making stipulated payments to the insurer, upon production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer, and upon the condition that all overdue payments and any indebtedness to the insurer on account of the policy be paid or reinstated with interest at the rate specified in the policy but not exceeding six percent per annum. [1967 c.359 §411]

 

      743.275 Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual Deferred Annuities; application. (1) ORS 743.275 to 743.295 may be cited as the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual Deferred Annuities.

      (2) The Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual Deferred Annuities does not apply to:

      (a) Reinsurance.

      (b) A group annuity policy purchased under a retirement or deferred compensation plan established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both. This exclusion does not apply, however, to a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the federal Internal Revenue Code.

      (c) A premium deposit fund.

      (d) A variable annuity policy.

      (e) An investment annuity policy.

      (f) An immediate annuity policy.

      (g) A deferred annuity policy after annuity payments have commenced.

      (h) A reversionary annuity.

      (i) A policy delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the insurer issuing the policy. [1977 c.320 §2; 2003 c.370 §1]

 

      743.278 Required provisions in annuity policies; exception. (1) An annuity policy shall contain in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions that in the opinion of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services are at least as favorable to the policyholder:

      (a) That upon the termination of considerations under the policy, or upon the written request of the policyholder, the insurer shall grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, of the value specified in ORS 743.284 and 743.287.

      (b) That, if the policy provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity or any other time, the insurer shall pay upon surrender of the policy on or before the start of annuity payments, in lieu of a paid-up annuity benefit, a cash surrender benefit of the amount specified in ORS 743.284 and 743.287. The insurer may reserve the right to defer the payment of the cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy, if the insurer makes a written request and receives written approval from the director. The request shall address the necessity and equitability to all policyholders of the deferral.

      (c) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum guaranteed paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the policy, together with sufficient information to determine the amount of the benefits.

      (d) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the policy is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the insurer to the policy, any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the policy.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a deferred annuity policy may provide that if no considerations have been received for two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the policy arising from prior considerations paid would be less than $20 monthly, the insurer at its option may terminate the policy by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit. The value shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the policy for determining the paid-up annuity benefit. By this payment the insurer shall be relieved of further obligations under the policy. [1977 c.320 §3; 2003 c.370 §2]

 

      743.281 [1977 c.320 §4; repealed by 2003 c.370 §9]

 

      743.284 Computation of benefits. (1) Any paid-up annuity benefit available under an annuity policy shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. The present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the policy for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the policy.

      (2) For annuity policies that provide cash surrender benefits, the cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of the portion of the policy maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit that would be provided under the policy at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender, reduced by appropriate amounts reflecting any previous withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the policy. The present value shall be calculated using an interest rate not more than one percent higher than the interest rate specified in the policy for accumulating the net considerations to determine maturity value, shall be decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy, including interest due and accrued, and shall be increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the policy. In no event shall the cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount on the date of surrender. The death benefit under an annuity policy that provides cash surrender benefits shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.

      (3) For annuity policies that do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of the paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity may not be less than the present value of the portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefits provided under the policy arising from considerations paid before the policy is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity. The present value shall be calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the policy for accumulating the net considerations to determine the value, and shall be increased by any additional amounts credited by the insurer to the policy. For annuity policies that do not provide any death benefits before annuity payments start, present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the policy for determining the maturity value of paid-up annuity benefit. In no event, however, shall the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. [1977 c.320 §5; 2003 c.370 §5]

 

      743.287 Commencement of annuity payments at optional maturity dates; calculation of benefits. (1) For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under ORS 743.284 (2) and (3) in the case of annuity policies under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be considered to be the latest date for which such election is permitted by the policy, but not later than the policy anniversary next following the annuitant’s 70th birthday or the 10th anniversary of the policy, whichever is later.

      (2) Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the policy anniversary of a policy with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the start of the policy year in which termination of considerations occurs. [1977 c.320 §6; 2003 c.370 §6]

 

      743.290 Notice of nonpayment of certain benefits to be included in annuity policy. An annuity policy that does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the start of annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the policy that the benefits are not provided. [1977 c.320 §7; 2003 c.370 §7]

 

      743.293 Minimum forfeiture amounts for annuity policies; rules. (1) The minimum values as specified in ORS 743.284 and 743.287 of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity policy shall be based on minimum nonforfeiture amounts as described in this section.

      (2) The minimum nonforfeiture amount at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to that time at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4) of this section of the net considerations previously paid, decreased by the sum of the following:

      (a) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4) of this section;

      (b) An annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4) of this section;

      (c) Any premium tax paid by the insurer for the policy, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subsection (4) of this section; and

      (d) The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy, including interest due and accrued.

      (3) For purposes of subsection (2) of this section, the net considerations for a given policy year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount equal to 87.5 percent of the gross considerations credited to the policy during that policy year.

      (4)(a) The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the rate established under paragraph (b) of this subsection. The rates established shall be specified in the policy if the interest rate is reset.

      (b) The following provisions apply to the rate:

      (A) The rate shall be the five-year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date certain or an average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent, that is specified in the policy and that is no longer than 15 months prior to the policy issue date or redetermination date under paragraph (c) of this subsection, reduced by 125 basis points.

      (B) The resulting interest rate under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may not be less than one percent.

      (c) The interest rate shall apply to an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the policy. The basis is the date certain or an average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.

      (5) During the period or term that a policy provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in subsection (4)(b) of this section by up to an additional 100 basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value on the policy issue date and at each redetermination date thereafter, may not exceed the market value of the benefit. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. If a demonstration is not acceptable to the director, the director may disallow or limit the additional reduction.

      (6) The director may adopt rules to implement subsection (5) of this section and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for policies that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other policies that the director determines justify an adjustment. [2003 c.370 §4]

 

      743.295 Effect of certain life insurance and disability benefits on minimum nonforfeiture amounts. (1) For an annuity policy that includes, by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that exceed the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall equal the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion, computed as if each portion were a separate policy.

      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 743.284 and 743.287, additional benefits payable in the event of total and permanent disability, as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts and paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits required by the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual Deferred Annuities. The inclusion of such benefits may not be required in any paid-up benefits unless the additional benefits would separately require minimum nonforfeiture amounts and paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits. [1977 c.320 §8; 2003 c.370 §8]

 

      743.298 Penalties, fees or charges; rules. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 743.275 to 743.295, the Department of Consumer and Business Services may adopt rules to regulate the penalties, fees or other charges that an insurer imposes for a withdrawal, before maturity or after the owner or annuitant dies, from an individual deferred annuity policy.

      (2) In adopting rules under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall consider:

      (a) Standards, regulations, rules, policies or guidelines that other states, public and private national organizations and other bodies apply to impositions of the types of penalties, fees or charges described in subsection (1) of this section;

      (b) Whether the penalty, fee or charge the insurer imposes is appropriate for and suited to achieving the insurer’s stated purpose in imposing the penalty, fee or charge;

      (c) How an insurer calculates the penalty, fee or charge;

      (d) The benefits to which the penalty, fee or charge applies;

      (e) Whether the insurer could take actions other than imposing a penalty, fee or charge in order to achieve the purpose for which the insurer imposed the penalty, fee or charge;

      (f) When insurers may or do not impose penalties, fees or charges for withdrawals before maturity or after the owner or annuitant dies;

      (g) Limitations on the amount of the insurer’s penalty, fee or charge; and

      (h) Other aspects, facts, circumstances or elements that the department deems relevant. [2015 c.85 §2]

[1967 c.359 §414]

 

      743.312 Grace period. A group life insurance policy shall contain a provision that the policyholder is entitled to a grace period of 31 days for the payment of any premium due except the first, during which grace period the death benefit coverage shall continue in force, unless the policyholder shall have given the insurer written notice of discontinuance in advance of the date of discontinuance and in accordance with the terms of the policy. The policy may provide that the policyholder shall be liable to the insurer for the payment of a pro rata premium for the time the policy was in force during such grace period. [1967 c.359 §415]

      (2) If the insurer fails to pay the proceeds of or make payment under the policy within 30 days after receipt of due proof of death and of the interest of the claimant, and if the beneficiary elects to receive a lump sum settlement, the insurer shall pay interest on any money due and unpaid after expiration of the 30-day period. The insurer shall compute the interest from the date of the insured’s death until the date of payment, at a rate not lower than that paid by the insurer on other withdrawable policy owner funds. At the end of the 30-day period, the insurer shall notify the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries at their last-known address that interest at the applicable rate will be paid on the lump sum proceeds from the date of death of the insured.

      (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow an insurer to withhold payment of money payable under a group life insurance policy to any designated beneficiary for a period longer than reasonably necessary to transmit the payment. [1967 c.359 §420; 1983 c.754 §3]

 

      743.330 Issuance of certificates.

[1967 c.359 §421]

 

      743.333 Termination of individual coverage. A group life insurance policy shall contain a provision that if the insurance, or any portion of it, on a person covered under the policy ceases because of termination of employment or of membership in the class or classes eligible for coverage under the policy, such person shall be entitled to have issued by the insurer, without evidence of insurability, an individual policy of life insurance without disability or other supplementary benefits, provided application for the individual policy shall be made, and the first premium paid to the insurer, within 31 days after such termination, and provided further that:

      (1) The individual policy shall, at the option of such person, be on any one of the forms, except term insurance, then customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for;

      (2) The individual policy shall be in an amount not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of such termination, less the amount of any life insurance for which such person is or becomes eligible under the same or any other group policy within 31 days after such termination, provided that any amount of insurance which shall have matured on or before the date of such termination as an endowment payable to the person insured, whether in one sum or in installments or in the form of an annuity, shall not, for the purposes of this provision, be included in the amount which is considered to cease because of such termination; and

      (3) The premium on the individual policy shall be at the insurer’s then customary rate applicable to the form and amount of the individual policy, to the class of risk to which such person then belongs, and to the age attained on the effective date of the individual policy. [1967 c.359 §422]

 

      743.336 Termination of policy or class of insured persons. A group life insurance policy shall contain a provision that if the group policy terminates or is amended so as to terminate the insurance of any class of insured persons, every person insured thereunder at the date of such termination whose insurance terminates and who has been so insured for at least five years prior to such termination date shall be entitled to have issued by the insurer an individual policy of life insurance, subject to the same conditions and limitations as are provided by ORS 743.333, except that the group policy may provide that the amount of such individual policy shall not exceed the smaller of:

      (1) The amount of the person’s life insurance protection ceasing because of the termination or amendment of the group policy, less the amount of any life insurance for which the person is or becomes eligible under any group policy issued or reinstated by the same or another insurer within 31 days after such termination; and

      (2) $10,000. [1967 c.359 §423; 1989 c.784 §16]

 

      743.339 Death during period for conversion to individual policy. A group life insurance policy shall contain a provision that if a person insured under the group policy dies during the period within which the person would have been entitled to have an individual policy issued in accordance with ORS 743.333 or 743.336 and before such an individual policy shall have become effective, the amount of life insurance which the person would have been entitled to have issued under such individual policy shall be payable as a claim under the group policy, whether or not application for the individual policy or the payment of the first premium therefor has been made. [1967 c.359 §424]

 

      743.342 Statement furnished to insured under credit life insurance policy. A group credit life insurance policy shall contain a provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder for delivery to each debtor insured under the policy a form which will contain a statement that the life of the debtor is insured under the policy and that any death benefit paid thereunder by reason of death shall be applied to reduce or extinguish the indebtedness. [1967 c.359 §425]

 

      743.345 Assignability of group life policies.

      743.354 Requirements for certain group life policies issued to trustees of certain funds; rules. (1) An insurer shall not offer in this state a policy of group life insurance that is described in this section and insures persons in this state, or shall not offer coverage under such a policy, whether the policy is to be issued in this or another state, unless the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines that the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section are satisfied.

      Note: 743.356 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 743 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      (a) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services finds that:

      (A) The issuance of the policy is in the best interest of the public;

      (B) The issuance of the policy would result in economies of acquisition or administration; and

      (C) The benefits are reasonable in relation to the premiums charged;

      (a) Insurance in connection with a loan or other credit transaction of more than 10 years’ duration; or

      (4) The policy shall contain a provision as follows, which shall be a separate paragraph under the same caption as, and immediately following, the provision set forth in subsection (1) or (3) of this section: “No claim for loss incurred or disability, as defined in the policy, commencing after two years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.” [1967 c.359 §430; 1969 c.159 §1]

The insurer shall state in the notice the reason for its refusal to renew this policy.” [1967 c.359 §431; 1989 c.784 §19; 2001 c.943 §9; 2013 c.681 §13]

The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin more than 10 days after such date. In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions indorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.”

      (2) The last sentence of the provision set forth in subsection (1) of this section may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums until at least age 50 or, in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. [1967 c.359 §432; 2001 c.943 §10; 2003 c.364 §108; 2013 c.681 §13a]

The period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.

Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate or reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.” [1967 c.359 §435]

All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.”

      (2) The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the provision set forth in subsection (1) of this section at the option of the insurer:

Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.”

      (b) “Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical or surgical services may, at the insurer’s option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.” [1967 c.359 §437]

If the insured changes occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.” [1967 c.359 §442]

(1) A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for _____ (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $___ (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities), the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or to the estate of the insured.”

      (2) In lieu of the provisions set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the policy may contain a provision as follows: “OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this company is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, the beneficiary or the estate of the insured, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.” [1967 c.359 §444]

 

      743.459 Insurance with other insurers; expense incurred benefits. (1) A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the ‘like amount’ of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.”

      (2) If the policy provision set forth in subsection (1) of this section is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set forth in ORS 743.462, there shall be added to the caption of the provision set forth in subsection (1) of this section the phrase “EXPENSE INCURRED BENE- FITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the policy provision set forth in this section with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability statute), whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the policy provision set forth in this section no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.” [1967 c.359 §445]

 

      743.462 Insurance with other insurers; other than expense incurred benefits. (1) A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the indemnities thus determined.”

      (2) If the policy provision set forth in subsection (1) of this section is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set forth in ORS 743.459, there shall be added to the caption of the provision set forth in subsection (1) of this section the phrase “OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the policy provision set forth in this section with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability statute), whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the policy provision set forth in this section no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.” [1967 c.359 §446]

 

      743.465 Relation of earnings to insurance. (1) A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or the average monthly earnings of the insured for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.”

      (2) The policy provision set forth in subsection (1) of this section may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums until at least age 50 or, in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time coverage,” approved as to form by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations. [1967 c.359 §447]

 

      743.468 Unpaid premium. A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.” [1967 c.359 §448]

 

      743.471 Cancellation. A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy by written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to the last address of the insured as shown by the records of the insurer. The notice must state the reason for cancellation and the date on which the cancellation shall be effective. Except as provided under the ‘GRACE PERIOD’ provision of this policy for nonpayment of premium, cancellation shall not become effective earlier than the 30th day after the date of the notice. After the policy has been continued beyond its original term, the insured may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed by the use of the short rate table last filed with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of cancellation.” [1967 c.359 §449; 1989 c.784 §20]

 

      743.472 Permissible reasons for cancellation or refusal to renew. An insurer selling individual health insurance policies may cancel or refuse to renew an individual health insurance policy only if the insurer makes a determination to cancel or not to renew all policies of the same type and form as the individual policy, or if the ground for cancellation or nonrenewal is any of the following and is stated as a provision of the policy:

      (1) A fraudulent or material misstatement made by the applicant in an application for the health policy. A material misstatement is subject to any time limit, as specified by law and included in the policy, for voiding the policy on the basis of a misstatement. For purposes of this subsection, a misstatement may include an incorrect statement or a misrepresentation, omission or concealment of fact;

      (2) Excess or other insurance in the same insurer, as described in ORS 743.456;

      (3) Nonpayment of premium; or

      (4) Any other reason specified by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services by rule. [1989 c.784 §18; 1991 c.182 §5]

 

      Note: 743.472 was added to and made a part of 743.405 to 743.498 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      743.474 Conformity with state statutes. A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on such date hereby is amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such statutes.” [1967 c.359 §450]

 

      743.477 Illegal occupation. A health insurance policy may contain a provision as follows: “ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any loss to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being engaged in an illegal occupation.” [1967 c.359 §451]

      743.483 Arrangement of provisions. The provisions of a health insurance policy that are the subject of ORS 743.408 to 743.477, or any corresponding provisions that are used in lieu thereof in accordance with the Insurance Code, shall be printed in the consecutive order of such sections or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered or issued. [1967 c.359 §453; 2009 c.11 §95; 2011 c.9 §94]

 

      743.486 Scope of term “insured” in statutory policy provisions. As used in ORS 743.402 to 743.498, the word “insured” shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits and rights provided therein. [1967 c.359 §454; 2011 c.9 §95]

 

      743.489 Extension of coverage beyond policy period; effect of misstatement of age. If any health insurance policy contains a provision establishing, as an age limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the policy will not be effective, and if such date falls within a period for which premium is accepted by the insurer or if the insurer accepts a premium after such date, the coverage provided by the policy shall continue in force subject to any right of cancellation until the end of the period for which premium has been accepted. In the event the age of the insured has been misstated and if, according to the correct age of the insured, the coverage provided by the policy would not have become effective, or would have ceased prior to the acceptance of such premium or premiums, then the liability of the insurer shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums paid for the period not covered by the policy. [Formerly 741.170]

 

      743.492 Policy return and premium refund provision. Every health insurance policy except single premium nonrenewable policies shall have printed on its face or attached thereto a notice stating in substance that the person to whom the policy is issued shall be permitted to return the policy within 10 days of its delivery to the purchaser and to have the premium paid refunded if, after examination of the policy, the purchaser is not satisfied with it for any reason. If a policyholder or purchaser pursuant to such notice returns the policy to the insurer at its home or branch office or to the insurance producer through whom it was purchased, it shall be void from the beginning and the parties shall be in the same position as if no policy had been issued. [Formerly 741.180; 2003 c.364 §109]

 

      743.495 Use of terms “noncancelable” or “guaranteed renewable”; synonymous terms. (1) No health insurance policy shall contain the following unqualified terms except as provided in this subsection:

      (a) The unqualified terms “noncancelable” or “noncancelable and guaranteed renewable” may be used only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force for life by the timely payment of premiums set forth in the policy, during which period the insurer has no right to make unilaterally any change in any provision of the policy while the policy is in force.

      (b) The unqualified term “guaranteed renewable,” except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, may be used only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force for life by the timely payment of premiums, during which period the insurer has no right to make unilaterally any change in any provision of the policy while the policy is in force, except that the insurer may make changes in premium rates by classes.

      (2) The limitations prescribed in subsection (1) of this section on the use of the term “noncancelable” shall also apply to any synonymous term such as “not cancelable” and such limitations on the use of the term “guaranteed renewable” shall also apply to any synonymous term such as “guaranteed continuable.” [Formerly 741.190]

 

      743.498 Statement in policy of cancelability or renewability. (1) A health insurance policy which is noncancelable or guaranteed renewable as those terms are used in ORS 743.495, except that the insured’s right is for a limited period of more than one year rather than for life, shall contain the applicable one of the following statements, or such other statement which, in the opinion of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, is equally clear or more definite as to the subject matter:

      (a) “THIS POLICY IS NONCANCELABLE ______” (designating the applicable period such as, for example, “to age ___ (specify),” or “for the period of ___ (specify) years from date of issuance”) if the policy is noncancelable for such period.

      (b) “THIS POLICY IS GUARANTEED RENEWABLE ______” (designating the applicable period such as, for example, “to age ___ (specify),” or “for the period of ___ (specify) years from date of issuance”) if the policy is guaranteed renewable for such period.

      (2) Except for policies meeting the conditions specified in ORS 743.495 or subsection (1) of this section, and except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a health insurance policy shall contain the applicable one of the following statements, or such other statement which, in the opinion of the director, is equally clear or more definite as to the subject matter:

      (a) “THIS POLICY MAY BE CANCELED BY THE INSURER ONLY FOR A REASON PERMITTED BY LAW” if the policy contains a provision for cancellation by the insurer.

      (b) “THE INSURER MAY REFUSE TO RENEW THIS POLICY ONLY FOR A REASON PERMITTED BY LAW” if the policy is not guaranteed renewable.

      (3) The limitations and requirements as to the use of terms contained in ORS 743.495 and this section shall not prohibit the use of other terms for policies having other guarantees of renewability, provided such terms, in the opinion of the director are accurate, clear and not likely to be confused with the terms contained in ORS 743.495 and this section, and are incorporated in a concise statement relating to the guarantees of renewability.

      (4) The statement required by this section shall be printed in a type not smaller than the type used for captions. It shall appear prominently on the first page of the policy and shall be a part of the brief description if the policy has a brief description on its first page.

(1) An insurer may not offer a policy of group health insurance described in ORS 731.098 (3) that insures persons in this state or offer coverage under such a policy, whether the policy is to be issued in this or another state, unless the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines that the requirements of this section and ORS 731.098 (3) are satisfied.

      (2) The director shall determine with respect to a policy whether the trustees are the policyholder. If the director determines that the trustees are the policyholder and if the policy is issued or proposed to be issued in this state, the policy is subject to the Insurance Code. If the director determines that the trustees are not the policyholder, the evidence of coverage that is issued or proposed to be issued in this state to a participating employer, labor union or association shall be deemed to be a group health insurance policy subject to the provisions of the Insurance Code. The director may determine that the trustees are not the policyholder if:

      (a) The evidence of coverage issued or proposed to be issued to a participating employer, labor union or association is in fact the primary statement of coverage for the employer, labor union or association; and

      (b) The trust arrangement is under the actual control of the insurer.

      (3) An insurer shall submit evidence to the director showing that the requirements of subsection (2) of this section and ORS 731.098 (3) are satisfied. The director shall review the evidence and may request additional evidence as needed.

      (4) An insurer shall submit to the director any changes in the evidence submitted under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) The director may adopt rules to carry out this section. [1989 c.784 §12; 2005 c.22 §494; 2013 c.681 §56]

      (2) A carrier may offer a health benefit plan to a guaranteed association if the plan provides health benefits covering 500 or more members or dependents of members of the association.

      (3) When a carrier offers coverage to a guaranteed association under subsection (2) of this section, the carrier shall offer coverage to all members of the association and all dependents of the members of the association without regard to the actual or expected health status of any member or any dependent of a member of the association.

      (a) For the initial 12-month period of coverage, the carrier shall submit to the director a certified statement that the premium rates charged to the guaranteed association are actuarially sound. The statement must be signed by an actuary certifying the accuracy of the rating methodology as established by the American Academy of Actuaries.

      (b) For any subsequent 12-month period of coverage, according to a rating methodology as established by the American Academy of Actuaries.

      (5) A member of a guaranteed association may apply for coverage offered by a carrier under subsection (2) of this section only:

      (a) If the member has been an active member of the association for no less than 30 days;

      (b) During an annual open enrollment period offered by the association; and

      (c) After meeting any additional eligibility requirements agreed upon by the association and the carrier.

      (9) Under a policy issued to cover any other risk or class of risks which, in the discretion of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, may be properly eligible for blanket health insurance. The discretion of the director may be exercised on an individual risk basis or class of risks basis, or both. [Formerly 743.534]

 

      743.537 Required provisions for blanket health insurance policies. A blanket health insurance policy shall contain provisions which in the opinion of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services are not less favorable to the policyholder and the individual insureds than the provisions described in ORS 743.411, 743.423, 743.426, 743.429, 743.432, 743.438 and 743.441.

[1967 c.359 §467]

 

      743.543 Payment of benefits under blanket health insurance policies. All benefits under a blanket health insurance policy shall be payable to the person insured, or to the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of the person, or to the estate of the person, except that if the person insured is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, such benefits may be made payable to the parent, guardian or other person actually supporting the person. However, the policy may provide that all or a portion of any indemnities provided by such policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical or surgical services may, at the option of the insurer and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services; but the policy may not require that the services be rendered by a particular hospital or person. Payment so made shall discharge the obligation of the insurer with respect to the amount of insurance so paid. [1967 c.359 §468]

 

      743.546 Exemption of policy form approval for blanket health insurance policies.

      (2) Coverage under a student health insurance policy may be mandatory for all students at the institution, voluntary for all students at the institution, or mandatory for defined classes of students and voluntary for other classes of students. As used in this subsection, “classes” refers to undergraduates, graduate students, domestic students, international students or other like classifications. Any differences based on a student’s nationality may be established only for the purpose of complying with federal law in effect when the policy is issued.

      (3) When coverage under a student health insurance policy is mandatory, the policyholder may allow any student subject to the policy to decline coverage if the student provides evidence acceptable to the policyholder that the student has similar health coverage.

      (4) A student health insurance policy may provide for any student to purchase optional supplemental coverage.

      (5) Student health insurance coverage for athletic injuries may:

      (a) Exclude coverage for injuries of students who have not obtained medical release for a similar injury; and

      (b) Be provided in excess of or in addition to any other coverage under any other health insurance policy, including a student health insurance policy.

      (6) A student health insurance policy may provide that coverage under the policy is secondary to any other health insurance for purposes of guidelines established under ORS 743B.475.

      (7) A student health insurance policy may provide, on request by the policyholder, that all or any portion of any indemnities provided by such policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical or surgical services may, at the insurer’s option, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services. However, the amount of any such payment shall not exceed the amount of benefit provided by the policy with respect to the service or billing of the provider of aid. The amount of such payments pursuant to one or more assignments shall not exceed the amount of expenses incurred on account of such hospitalization or medical or surgical aid.

      (8) An insurer providing student health insurance as primary coverage may negotiate and enter into contracts for alternative rates of payment with providers and offer the benefit of such alternative rates to insureds who select such providers. An insurer may utilize such contracts by offering a choice of plans at the time an insured enrolls, one of which provides benefits only for services by members of a particular provider organization with whom the insurer has an agreement. If an insured chooses such a plan, benefits are payable only for services rendered by a member of that provider organization, unless such services were requested by a member of such organization or are rendered as the result of an emergency.

      (9) Payments made under subsection (8) of this section shall discharge the insurer’s obligation with respect to the amount of insurance paid.

      (10) An insurer shall provide each student health insurance policyholder with a current roster of institutional and professional providers under contract to provide services at alternative rates under the group policy and shall also make such lists available for public inspection during regular business hours at the insurer’s principal office within this state.

      (11) As used in this section, “student health insurance”:

      (a) Means that form of health insurance under a policy issued to a college, school or other institution of learning, a school district or districts, or school jurisdictional unit, or recognized student government at a public university listed in ORS 352.002, or to the head, principal or governing board of any such educational unit, who or which shall be deemed the policyholder, that is available exclusively to students at the college, school or other institution.

      (b) Does not include a student health benefit plan as defined in ORS 743.551. [1995 c.623 §2; 2011 c.637 §289; 2013 c.681 §15]

 

      743.551 Student health benefit plans; rules. (1) As used in this section, “student health benefit plan” means a plan that is subject to rules adopted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under 42 U.S.C. 18118(c).

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall by rule and in a manner consistent with federal law in effect on January 1, 2017, adopt requirements for student health benefit plans. [2013 c.681 §4; 2017 c.152 §3]

      743.650 Long Term Care Insurance Act; purpose; application. (1) ORS 743.650 to 743.665 may be known and cited as the “Long Term Care Insurance Act.”

      (2) The purpose of ORS 743.650 to 743.665 is to:

      (a) Promote the public interest in long term care insurance;

      (b) Promote the availability of long term care insurance policies;

      (c) Protect applicants for long term care insurance from unfair or deceptive sales or enrollment practices;

      (d) Establish standards for long term care insurance;

      (e) Facilitate public understanding and comparison of long term care insurance policies;

      (f) Facilitate flexibility and innovation in the development of long term care insurance coverage; and

      (g) Ensure that Oregon residents who purchase insurance for long term care shall have access to policies providing for a comprehensive range of benefits.

      (3) The requirements of ORS 743.650 to 743.665, 748.603 and 750.055 apply to policies and certificates delivered or issued for delivery in this state on or after December 31, 1989. ORS 743.650 to 743.665, 748.603 and 750.055 are not intended to supersede the obligations of entities subject to ORS 743.650 to 743.665, 748.603 and 750.055 to comply with the substance of other applicable insurance laws insofar as such laws do not conflict with ORS 743.650 to 743.665, 748.603 and 750.055, except that laws and rules designed and intended to apply to Medicare supplement insurance policies shall not be applied to long term care insurance. A policy that is not advertised, marketed or offered as long term care insurance or nursing home insurance is not required to meet the requirements of ORS 743.650 to 743.665, 748.603 and 750.055. [1989 c.1022 §§1,2,3; 2007 c.486 §1]

For qualified long term care insurance, the “benefit trigger” is the determination that an insured is a chronically ill individual, as defined in section 7702B(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (3) “Certificate” means any certificate issued under a group long term care insurance policy, if the policy has been delivered or issued for delivery in this state.

Prior to advertising, marketing or offering the policy within this state, the association or associations, or the insurer of the association or associations shall file evidence with the director that the association or associations have been organized and maintained in good faith for purposes other than that of obtaining insurance; have been in active existence for at least one year; and have a constitution and bylaws that provide that:

      (i) The association or associations hold regular meetings not less than annually to further purposes of the members;

      (ii) Except for credit unions, the association or associations collect dues or solicit contributions from members; and

      (iii) The members have voting privileges and representation on the governing board and committees; and

      (d) A group other than as described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection, subject to a finding by the director that:

      (A) The issuance of the group policy is not contrary to the best interest of the public;

      (B) The issuance of the group policy would result in economies of acquisition or administration; and

      (C) The benefits are reasonable in relation to the premiums charged.

      (5) “Long term care insurance” means any insurance policy or rider advertised, marketed, offered or designed to provide coverage for not less than 24 consecutive months for each covered person on an expense incurred, indemnity, prepaid or other basis; for one or more necessary or medically necessary services, including but not limited to nursing, diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance or personal care services, provided in a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital. “Long term care insurance” includes group and individual annuities and life insurance policies or riders that provide directly or supplement long term care insurance. “Long term care insurance” also includes a policy or rider that provides for payment of benefits based upon cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity, and qualified long term care insurance contracts. Long term care insurance may be issued by insurers; fraternal benefit societies; nonprofit health, hospital and medical service corporations; prepaid health plans; or health maintenance organizations, health care service contractors or any similar organization to the extent they are otherwise authorized to issue life or health insurance. “Long term care insurance” does not include any insurance policy that is offered primarily to provide basic Medicare supplement coverage, basic hospital expense coverage, basic medical-surgical expense coverage, hospital confinement indemnity coverage, major medical expense coverage, disability income or related asset protection coverage, catastrophic coverage, accident only coverage, specified disease or specified accident coverage or limited benefit coverage. With regard to life insurance, “long term care insurance” does not include life insurance policies that accelerate the death benefit specifically for one or more of the qualifying events of terminal illness, medical conditions requiring extraordinary medical intervention or permanent institutional confinement, and that provide the option of a lump-sum payment for those benefits and when neither the benefits nor the eligibility for the benefits is conditioned upon the receipt of long term care. Notwithstanding any other provision of ORS 743.650 to 743.665, any product advertised, marketed or offered as long term care insurance is subject to ORS 743.650 to 743.665.

      (6) “Policy” means any policy, contract, subscriber agreement, rider or indorsement delivered or issued for delivery in this state by an insurer; fraternal benefit society; nonprofit health, hospital or medical service corporation; prepaid health plan; or health maintenance organization, health care service contractor or any similar organization.

      (7) “Qualified long term care insurance” means:

      (a) The portion of a life insurance contract that provides long term care insurance coverage by rider or as part of the contract and that satisfies the requirements of section 7702B(b) and (e) of the Internal Revenue Code; or

      (b) Individual or group long term care insurance as defined in this section that meets all of the following requirements of section 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code:

      (A) The only insurance protection provided under the contract is coverage of qualified long term care services. A contract shall not fail to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph by reason of payments being made on a per diem or other periodic basis without regard to the expenses incurred during the period to which the payments relate.

      (B) The contract does not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items to the extent that the expenses are reimbursable under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, or would be reimbursable but for the application of a deductible or coinsurance amount. The requirements of this subparagraph do not apply to expenses that are reimbursable under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act only as a secondary payer. A contract does not fail to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph by reason of payments being made on a per diem or other periodic basis without regard to the expenses incurred during the period to which the payments relate.

      (C) The contract is guaranteed renewable within the meaning of section 7702B(b)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (D) The contract does not provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged as collateral for a loan, or borrowed except as provided in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph.

      (E) All refunds of premiums, and all policyholder dividends or similar amounts, under the contract are to be applied as a reduction in future premiums or to increase future benefits, except that a refund on the event of death of the insured or a complete surrender or cancellation of the contract cannot exceed the aggregate premiums paid under the contract.

      (F) The contract meets the consumer protection provisions set forth in section 7702B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. [1989 c.1022 §4; 1993 c.744 §30; 1995 c.79 §364; 2007 c.486 §2; 2011 c.69 §3; 2016 c.11 §3]

 

      743.653 Prohibition on certain policies. Group long term care insurance coverage may not be offered to a resident of this state under a group policy issued in another state to a group described in ORS 743.652 (4)(d), unless this state or another state having statutory and regulatory long term care insurance requirements substantially similar to those adopted in this state has made a determination that such requirements have been met. [1989 c.1022 §5; 1991 c.67 §199; 2007 c.486 §3; 2011 c.69 §4]

      743.655 Rules; disclosure; contents of policy. (1)(a) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall adopt rules that include standards for full and fair disclosure setting forth the manner, content and required disclosures for the sale of long term care insurance policies, terms of renewability, initial and subsequent conditions of eligibility, nonduplication of coverage provisions, coverage of dependents, preexisting conditions, termination of insurance, program for public understanding, continuation or conversion, probationary periods, limitations, exceptions, reductions, elimination periods, underwriting at time of application, requirements for replacement, recurrent conditions and definitions of terms and that include required procedures for internal and external review of whether the conditions of a benefit trigger have been met.

      (b) In adopting rules under this section, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services must give timely notice to, and shall consider recommendations from the Director of Human Services.

      (2) A long term care insurance policy may not:

      (a) Be canceled, nonrenewed or otherwise terminated on the grounds of the age or the deterioration of the mental or physical health of the insured individual or certificate holder;

      (b) Contain a provision establishing a new waiting period in the event existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new or other form within the same company, except with respect to an increase in benefits voluntarily selected by the insured individual or group policyholder;

      (c) Provide coverage for skilled nursing care only or provide significantly more coverage for skilled care in a facility than coverage for lower levels of care;

      (d) Exclude coverage for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias;

      (e) Be nonrenewed or otherwise terminated for nonpayment of premiums until 31 days overdue and then only after notice of nonpayment is given the policyholder prior to expiration of the 31 days, except as otherwise provided by rule; or

      (f) Be sold to provide less than 24 months’ coverage.

      (3)(a) A long term care insurance policy or certificate other than a policy or certificate issued to a group described in ORS 743.652 (4)(a), (b) or (c) may not use a definition of “preexisting condition” that is more restrictive than the following: “Preexisting condition” means a condition for which medical advice or treatment was recommended by, or received from a provider of health care services, within six months preceding the effective date of coverage of an insured person.

      (b) A long term care insurance policy or certificate other than a policy or certificate thereunder issued to a group described in ORS 743.652 (4)(a), (b) or (c) may not exclude coverage for a loss or confinement that is the result of a preexisting condition unless the loss or confinement begins within six months following the effective date of coverage of an insured person.

      (c) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may extend the limitation periods set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection as to specific age group categories or specific policy forms upon findings that the extension is in the best interest of the public.

      (d) The definition of preexisting condition does not prohibit an insurer from using an application form designed to elicit the complete health history of an applicant, over the 10 years immediately prior to the date of application, and, on the basis of the answers on the application, from underwriting in accordance with that insurer’s established underwriting standards. Unless otherwise provided in the policy or certificate, a preexisting condition, regardless of whether it is disclosed on the application, need not be covered until the waiting period described in paragraph (b) of this subsection expires. A long term care insurance policy or certificate may not exclude or use waivers or riders of any kind to exclude, limit or reduce coverage or benefits for specifically named or described preexisting diseases or physical conditions beyond the waiting period described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (4) A long term care insurance policy may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state if the policy:

      (a) Conditions eligibility for any benefits on a prior hospitalization requirement;

      (b) Conditions eligibility for benefits provided in an institutional care setting on the receipt of a higher level of institutional care; or

      (c) Conditions eligibility for any benefits other than waiver of premium or post-confinement, post-acute care or recuperative benefits on a prior institutionalization requirement.

      (5)(a) A long term care insurance policy containing post-confinement, post-acute care or recuperative benefits must clearly label in a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate titled “Limitations or Conditions of Eligibility for Benefits” all such limitations or conditions, including any required number of days of confinement.

      (b) A long term care insurance policy or rider that conditions eligibility of noninstitutional benefits on the prior receipt of institutional care may not require a prior institutional stay of more than 30 days.

      (6) Individual long term care insurance applicants shall have the right to return the policy or certificate within 30 days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, the applicant is not satisfied for any reason. Long term care insurance policies and certificates must have a notice prominently printed on the first page or attached thereto stating in substance that the applicant has the right to return the policy or certificate within 30 days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, other than a certificate issued pursuant to a policy issued to a group described in ORS 743.652 (4)(a), the applicant is not satisfied for any reason. This subsection also applies to denials of applications. Any refund must be made within 30 days of the return or denial.

      (7)(a)(A) An outline of coverage shall be delivered to a prospective applicant for long term care insurance at the time of initial solicitation through means that prominently direct the attention of the recipient to the document and its purpose.

      (B) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services by rule must prescribe a standard format, including style, arrangement and overall appearance, and the content of an outline of coverage.

      (C) In the case of solicitations by an insurance producer, the insurance producer must deliver the outline of coverage prior to the presentation of an application or enrollment form.

      (D) In the case of direct response solicitations, the outline of coverage must be presented in conjunction with any application or enrollment form.

      (E) In the case of a policy issued to a group described in ORS 743.652 (4)(a), an outline of coverage is not required to be delivered as long as the information described in paragraph (b) of this subsection is contained in other materials related to the enrollment. Upon request, these other materials must be made available to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.

      (b) The outline of coverage must include:

      (A) A description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy;

      (B) A statement of the principal exclusions, reductions and limitations contained in the policy;

      (C) A statement of the terms under which the policy or certificate, or both, may be continued in force or discontinued, including any reservation in the policy of a right to change premium. Continuation or conversion provisions of group coverage shall be specifically described;

      (D) A statement that the outline of coverage is a summary only, not a contract of insurance, and that the policy or group master policy contains governing contractual provisions;

      (E) A description of the terms under which the policy or certificate may be returned and premium refunded;

      (F) A brief description of the relationship of cost of care and benefits; and

      (G) A statement that discloses to the policyholder or certificate holder whether the policy is intended to be qualified long term care insurance as defined in ORS 743.652.

      (8) A certificate issued pursuant to a group long term care insurance policy if the policy is delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall include:

      (a) A description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy;

      (b) A statement of the principal exclusions, reductions and limitations contained in the policy; and

      (c) A statement that the group master policy determines governing contractual provisions.

      (9) If an application for a long term care insurance policy or certificate is approved, the insurer must deliver the policy or certificate to the applicant no later than 30 days after the date of approval.

      (10) At the time of policy delivery, a policy summary must be delivered for an individual life insurance policy that provides long term care benefits within the policy or by rider. In the case of direct response solicitations, the insurer must deliver the policy summary upon the applicant’s request, but regardless of request must make delivery not later than at the time of policy delivery. In addition to complying with all applicable requirements, the summary must also include the provisions required in this subsection. The required provision may be incorporated into a basic illustration or into the life insurance policy summary if required by rule. The following provisions must be included in the summary:

      (a) An explanation of how the long term care benefit interacts with other components of the policy, including deductions from death benefits;

      (b) An illustration of the amount of benefits, the length of benefits and the guaranteed lifetime benefits, if any, for each covered person;

      (c) Any exclusions, reductions and limitations on benefits of long term care;

      (d) A statement that any long term care inflation protection option required by rule is not available under the policy; and

      (e) If applicable to the policy type, the following:

      (B) A disclosure of guarantees related to long term care costs of insurance charges; and

      (C) Current and projected maximum lifetime benefits.

      (11) When a long term care benefit that is funded through a life insurance policy by an acceleration of the death benefit is in benefit payment status, the insurer must provide a monthly report to the policyholder. The report must include:

      (a) Any long term care benefits paid out during the month;

      (b) An explanation of any changes in the policy, such as death benefits or cash values, owing to payment of long term care benefits; and

      (c) The amount of long term care benefits existing or remaining.

      (a) Provide a written explanation of the reasons for the denial; and

      (b) Make available all information directly related to the denial.

      (13) Long term care insurance policies shall include a clear description of the process for appealing and resolving disputes regarding whether the conditions of a benefit trigger have been met.

      (15) Rules adopted pursuant to ORS 743.650 to 743.665 shall be in accordance with the provisions of ORS chapter 183.

      (16) This section is exempt from ORS 743A.001. [1989 c.1022 §§6,7; 1991 c.67 §200; 2003 c.364 §110; 2007 c.486 §4; 2011 c.69 §5]

 

      743.656 Eligibility for benefits; providers required to be covered. (1) No long term care insurance policy shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the policy determines eligibility for benefits through a determination that is not more restrictive than requiring that:

      (a) The policyholder be functionally impaired and needing assistance in any three or more activities of daily living as defined by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, by rule, after consultation with the Director of Human Services.

      (b) Benefits must be payable when the beneficiary is receiving covered services from any of the following providers approved by the insurer:

      (A) Nursing home;

      (B) Assisted living;

      (C) Home care; and

      (D) Adult foster care.

      (c) The insurer shall approve nursing home, assisted living, home care, adult foster home and any other providers of covered services by using standards that have been submitted to and approved by the director in consultation with the Director of Human Services.

      743.657 [1967 c.359 §498; renumbered 742.238 in 1989]

 

      743.658 Notice of lapse or termination; rules. (1)(a) An insurer may not issue an individual long term care insurance policy until the insurer receives from an applicant for the policy:

      (A) A written designation of the full name and residential address of at least one person, in addition to the applicant, to whom the insurer can send notice of a lapse or termination of the policy because of a failure to pay a premium; or

      (B) A written waiver that the applicant has signed and dated and in which the applicant elects not to designate another person to whom an insurer can send the notice described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. The waiver must read substantially as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

      I understand that I have a right to designate at least one other person other than myself to receive notice of lapse or termination of this insurance policy for failing to pay a premium. I understand that the insurer will not send a notice until 30 days after a premium is due and remains unpaid. I elect NOT to designate a person other than myself to receive this notice.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (b) At least once every two years an insurer shall notify a policy owner of the policy owner’s right to change the person the policy owner designates to receive the notice described in paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection.

      (c) An applicant’s designation of another person to receive the notice described in paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection does not constitute the other person’s acceptance of a liability for services an insurer provides to an insured under an individual long term care insurance policy.

      (d) If a policy owner pays premiums for an individual long term care insurance policy by means of a payroll deduction or a deduction from a pension payment, the requirement to obtain a designation from the policy owner as provided in paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection does not apply until 60 days after the policy owner stops paying premiums through a payroll deduction or a deduction from a pension payment.

      (2) In addition to the requirement specified in subsection (1) of this section, an individual long term care insurance policy must provide for reinstating coverage after a lapse if the insurer receives proof that the policy owner was cognitively impaired or had a loss of functional capacity before the expiration of any grace period for premium payments that is set forth in the policy. An insured may request reinstatement under this subsection within five months after the insurance policy lapsed and the insurer may require the insured to pay all past due premiums. For purposes of this subsection, the standard for determining cognitive impairment or a loss of functional capacity may not be more stringent than any criteria set forth in the insurance policy for determining cognitive impairment or a loss of functional capacity for the purposes of showing eligibility for benefits.

      (3) A notice that an individual life insurance policy, individual long term care insurance policy or individual disability income policy has lapsed because of a failure to pay a premium is effective only if the insurer:

      (a) Sends a written notice at least 30 days before the date of the lapse;

      (b) Accompanies the notice with an explanation of the reason for the lapse; and

      (c) Sends the notice:

      (A) By first class mail, postage prepaid, to the last-known address of the policy owner and designee, if any; or

      (B) To the last-known electronic mail address for the policy owner and designee, if any, that is in the insurer’s records, provided that the policy owner and designee consent to receive notices related to the policy owner’s insurance policy electronically.

      (4) This section does not apply to an individual life insurance policy, an individual long term care insurance policy or an individual disability income policy that requires a premium payment each month or at more frequent intervals.

      (5) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may adopt rules to implement the requirements of this section. [2015 c.91 §2]

 

      Note: 743.658 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 743 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      743.660 [1967 c.359 §499; renumbered 742.240 in 1989]

 

      743.662 Rescission of policy and denial of claims. (1) For a policy or certificate that has been in force for less than six months, an insurer may rescind a long term care insurance policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long term care insurance claim upon a showing of a misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance for coverage.

      (2) For a policy or certificate that has been in force for at least six months but less than two years, an insurer may rescind a long term care insurance policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long term care insurance claim upon a showing of a misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance for coverage and also pertains to the condition for which benefits are sought.

      (3) After a policy or certificate has been in force for two years, the policy or certificate is not contestable upon the ground of misrepresentation alone. The policy or certificate may be contested only upon a showing that the insured knowingly and intentionally misrepresented relevant facts relating to the insured’s health.

      (4) A long term care insurance policy or certificate may not be field issued based on medical or health status. A policy or certificate is field issued for the purposes of this subsection if the policy or certificate is issued by an insurance producer or a third party administrator pursuant to underwriting authority granted to the insurance producer or third party administrator by an insurer.

      (5) If an insurer has paid benefits under the long term care insurance policy or certificate, the insurer may not recover the benefit payments in the event that the policy or certificate is rescinded.

      (6) This section does not apply to the remaining death benefit of a life insurance policy in the event of the death of the insured if the policy accelerates benefits for long term care, but this section otherwise applies to a life insurance policy that accelerates benefits for long term care. In the event of the death of an insured, the remaining death benefits under the life insurance policy are governed by ORS 743.168.

      (7) This section is exempt from ORS 743A.001. [2007 c.486 §6]

      743.664 Offer of nonforfeiture benefit; rules. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a long term care insurance policy may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the policyholder or certificate holder has been offered the option of purchasing a policy or certificate including a nonforfeiture benefit. The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy. If the policyholder or certificate holder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer must provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that is available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates.

      (2) When a group long term care insurance policy is issued, the offer required in subsection (1) of this section must be made to the group policyholder. However, if the policy is issued as group long term care insurance as described in ORS 743.652 (4)(d), other than to a continuing care retirement community or similar entity, the offering shall be made to each proposed certificate holder.

      (3) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services by rule shall specify:

      (a) The type or types of nonforfeiture benefits to be offered as part of long term care insurance policies and certificates;

      (b) The standards for nonforfeiture benefits; and

      (c) The standards governing contingent benefits upon lapse, including a determination of the specified period of time during which a contingent benefit upon lapse will be available and the substantial premium increase that triggers a contingent benefit upon lapse as described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (4) This section is exempt from ORS 743A.001. [2007 c.486 §7; 2011 c.69 §6]

 

      743.665 Prompt pay requirements; rules. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall adopt by rule prompt payment requirements for long term care insurance. The rules shall include a definition of “claim” and a definition of “clean claim.” In adopting the rules, the director shall consider the prompt payment requirements in long term care insurance model acts developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

      (f) Elimination periods;

      (g) Requirements for replacement;

      (h) Recurrent conditions; and

      (i) Definitions of terms.

      (3) Provisions established by the director governing eligibility for Medicare supplement insurance shall not be limited to persons qualifying for Medicare by reason of age.

      (4) The director may adopt by rule standards that specify prohibited policy provisions not otherwise specifically authorized by statute which, in the opinion of the director, are unjust, unfair or unfairly discriminatory to any person insured or proposed for coverage under a Medicare supplement policy.

      (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law of this state, a Medicare supplement policy may not deny a claim for losses incurred more than six months from the effective date of coverage for a preexisting condition. The policy may not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician or naturopathic physician within six months before the effective date of coverage.

      (6) The director shall adopt by rule standards for benefits and claims payment under Medicare supplement policies. [1989 c.255 §§3,4; 1993 c.113 §3; 2017 c.356 §97]

 

      743.684 Filing of policy; loss ratio standards; insurance producer compensation. (1) Every insurer providing group Medicare supplement insurance benefits to a resident of this state pursuant to ORS 743.682 shall file a copy of the master policy and any certificate used in this state in accordance with the filing requirements and procedures applicable to group Medicare supplement policies issued in this state. However, no insurer shall be required to make a filing earlier than 30 days after insurance was provided to a resident of this state under a master policy issued for delivery outside this state.

      (2) Medicare supplement policies shall return benefits which are reasonable in relation to the premium charged. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall adopt by rule minimum standards for loss ratios of Medicare supplement policies on the basis of incurred claims experience, or incurred health care expenses where coverage is provided by a health maintenance organization on a service rather than reimbursement basis, and earned premiums in accordance with accepted actuarial principles and practices. Every entity providing Medicare supplement policies or certificates in this state shall file annually its rates, rating schedule and supporting documentation demonstrating that it is in compliance with the applicable loss ratio standards of this state. All filings of rates and rating schedules shall demonstrate that the actual and expected losses in relation to premiums comply with the requirements of ORS 743.680 to 743.689.

      (3) No entity shall provide compensation to insurance producers which is greater than the renewal compensation which would have been paid on an existing policy if the existing policy is replaced by another policy with the same company where the new policy benefits are substantially similar to the benefits under the old policy and the old policy was issued by the same insurer or insurer group. [1989 c.255 §5; 2003 c.364 §111]

 

      743.685 Outline of coverage; information brochure; rules. (1) In order to provide for full and fair disclosure in the sale of Medicare supplement policies, no Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall be delivered in this state unless an outline of coverage is delivered to the applicant at the time application is made.

      (2) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall prescribe the format and content of the outline of coverage required by subsection (1) of this section. The director shall consult with the Governor’s Commission on Senior Services concerning the content and format of the outline of coverage, especially in reference to the ease with which senior citizens may understand the form and compare the coverage provided under the policy to which the outline of coverage refers. For purposes of this section, “format” means style, arrangements and overall appearance, including such items as the size, color and prominence of type and arrangement of text and captions. The outline of coverage required by subsection (1) of this section shall include at least the following:

      (a) A description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy;

      (b) A statement of the renewal provisions, including any reservation by the insurer of a right to change premiums and disclosure of the existence of any automatic renewal premium increases based on the policyholder’s age; and

      (c) A statement that the outline of coverage is a summary of the policy issued or applied for and that the policy should be consulted to determine governing contractual provisions.

      (3) Insurers shall fill out the standardized form and have the completed information included on the form approved by the director before selling supplemental Medicare coverage in this state.

      (4) In the purchase or renewal of a Medicare supplement policy, a copy of the outline of coverage must be used in explaining policy coverage to a purchaser and shall be provided to the applicant at the time the sales presentation is made. The completed outline of coverage shall be considered part of the sales presentation materials for the purposes of ORS 742.009.

      (5) The insurer shall obtain acknowledgment of receipt or certify delivery of the outline of coverage at the time of sale.

      (6) The director may adopt by rule a standard form and the contents of an informational brochure for persons eligible for Medicare, which is intended to improve the buyer’s ability to select the most appropriate coverage and improve the buyer’s understanding of Medicare. Except in the case of direct response insurance policies, the director may require by rule that the information brochure be provided to any prospective insureds eligible for Medicare concurrently with delivery of the outline of coverage. With respect to direct response insurance policies, the director may require by rule that the prescribed brochure be provided upon request to any prospective insureds eligible for Medicare, but in no event later than the time of policy delivery.

      (7) The director may adopt by rule captions or notice requirements, determined to be in the public interest and designed to inform prospective insureds that particular insurance coverages are not Medicare supplement coverages, for all health insurance policies sold to persons eligible for Medicare, other than:

      (a) Medicare supplement policies; or

      (b) Disability income policies.

      (8) The director may adopt rules governing the full and fair disclosure of the information in connection with the replacement of health insurance policies, subscriber contracts or certificates by persons eligible for Medicare. [1989 c.255 §6; 1993 c.113 §2; 1997 c.96 §2]

 

      743.686 Right to return of policy; premium refund. Medicare supplement policies or certificates shall have a notice prominently printed on the first page of the policy or certificate or attached thereto stating in substance that the applicant shall have the right to return the policy or certificate within 30 days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, the applicant is not satisfied for any reason. Any refund made pursuant to this section shall be paid directly to the applicant by the insurer in a timely manner. [1989 c.255 §7]

 

      743.687 Advertising. Every insurer, health care service plan or other entity providing Medicare supplement insurance or benefits in this state shall provide a copy of any Medicare supplement advertisement intended for use in this state whether through written, radio or television medium to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services of this state for review or approval by the director to the extent it may be required under state law. [1989 c.255 §8]

 

      743.688 Rules. Rules adopted pursuant to ORS 743.680 to 743.689 shall be subject to the provisions of ORS chapter 183. [1989 c.255 §9]

 

      743.689 Director’s authority upon violation of ORS 743.680 to 743.689. In addition to any other applicable penalties for violations of the Insurance Code, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may require insurers violating any provision of ORS 743.680 to 743.689 or rules adopted pursuant to ORS 743.680 to 743.689 to cease marketing any Medicare supplement policy or certificate in this state which is related directly or indirectly to a violation or may require such insurer to take such actions as are necessary to comply with the provisions of ORS 743.680 to 743.689, or both.
