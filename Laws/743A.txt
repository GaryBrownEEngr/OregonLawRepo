If prior approval is not required, group health insurers and issuers of individual health benefit plans that are not grandfathered health plans shall permit providers, policyholders or persons acting on their behalf to make advance inquiries regarding the appropriateness of a particular admission to a treatment program. Group health insurers and issuers of individual health benefit plans that are not grandfathered health plans shall provide a timely response to such inquiries. Noncontracting providers must cooperate with these procedures to the same extent as contracting providers to be eligible for reimbursement.

      (g) Health maintenance organizations may limit the receipt of covered services by enrollees to services provided by or upon referral by providers contracting with the health maintenance organization.

      (3) This section does not prohibit a group health insurer or issuer of an individual health benefit plan that is not a grandfathered health plan from managing the provision of benefits through common methods, including but not limited to selectively contracted panels, health plan benefit differential designs, preadmission screening, prior authorization of services, utilization review or other mechanisms designed to limit eligible expenses to those described in subsection (2)(b) of this section.

      (8) The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt by rule standards for the certification provided under subsection (7) of this section to ensure that a certified provider organization offers a distinct and specialized program for the treatment of mental or nervous conditions.

      (9) The Oregon Health Authority may adopt by rule an application fee or a certification fee, or both, to be imposed on any provider organization that applies for certification under subsection (7) of this section. Any fees collected shall be paid into the Oregon Health Authority Fund established in ORS 413.101 and shall be used only for carrying out the provisions of subsection (7) of this section.

      (10) The intent of the Legislative Assembly in adopting this section is to reserve benefits for different types of care to encourage cost effective care and to ensure continuing access to levels of care most appropriate for the insured’s condition and progress. This section does not prohibit an insurer from requiring a provider organization certified by the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (7) of this section to meet the insurer’s credentialing requirements as a condition of entering into a contract.

      (11) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Oregon Health Authority, after notice and hearing, may adopt reasonable rules not inconsistent with this section that are considered necessary for the proper administration of this section.
