      (D) Review may involve prior approval, concurrent review of the continuation of treatment, post-treatment review or any combination of these. However, if prior approval is required, provision shall be made to allow for payment of urgent or emergency admissions, subject to subsequent review. If prior approval is not required, group health insurers shall permit providers, policyholders or persons acting on their behalf to make advance inquiries regarding the appropriateness of a particular admission to a treatment program. Group health insurers shall provide a timely response to such inquiries. Noncontracting providers must cooperate with these procedures to the same extent as contracting providers to be eligible for reimbursement.

      (g) Health maintenance organizations may limit the receipt of covered services by enrollees to services provided by or upon referral by providers contracting with the health maintenance organization. Health maintenance organizations and health care service contractors may create substantive plan benefit and reimbursement differentials at the same level as, and subject to limitations no more restrictive than, those imposed on coverage or reimbursement of expenses arising out of other medical conditions and apply them to contracting and noncontracting providers.

      (3) This section does not prohibit a group health insurer from managing the provision of benefits through common methods, including but not limited to selectively contracted panels, health plan benefit differential designs, preadmission screening, prior authorization of services, utilization review or other mechanisms designed to limit eligible expenses to those described in subsection (2)(b) of this section.

      (4) The Legislative Assembly finds that health care cost containment is necessary and intends to encourage health insurance plans designed to achieve cost containment by ensuring that reimbursement is limited to appropriate utilization under criteria incorporated into the insurance, either directly or by reference.

      (5) This section does not prevent a group health insurer from contracting with providers of health care services to furnish services to policyholders or certificate holders according to ORS 743B.460 or 750.005, subject to the following conditions:

      (a) A group health insurer is not required to contract with all providers that are eligible for reimbursement under this section.

      (9) The Oregon Health Authority may adopt by rule an application fee or a certification fee, or both, to be imposed on any provider organization that applies for certification under subsection (7) of this section. Any fees collected shall be paid into the Oregon Health Authority Fund established in ORS 413.101 and shall be used only for carrying out the provisions of subsection (7) of this section.

      (10) The intent of the Legislative Assembly in adopting this section is to reserve benefits for different types of care to encourage cost effective care and to ensure continuing access to levels of care most appropriate for the insured’s condition and progress. This section does not prohibit an insurer from requiring a provider organization certified by the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (7) of this section to meet the insurer’s credentialing requirements as a condition of entering into a contract.

      (11) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Oregon Health Authority, after notice and hearing, may adopt reasonable rules not inconsistent with this section that are considered necessary for the proper administration of this section.
