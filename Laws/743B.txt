      743B.010 Issuance of group health benefit plan to affiliated group of employers; determination of number of employees for purpose of determining eligibility as small employer. (1) If an affiliated group of employers is treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a carrier may issue a single group health benefit plan to the affiliated group on the basis of the number of employees in the affiliated group if the group requests such coverage.

      (2) Subsequent to the issuance of a health benefit plan to a small employer, other than a plan issued through the health insurance exchange, a carrier shall determine annually the number of employees of the employer for purposes of determining the employer’s ongoing eligibility as a small employer.

      (3)(a) ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 shall continue to apply to a health benefit plan issued outside of the exchange to a small employer until the plan anniversary date following the date the employer no longer meets the definition of a small employer.

      (b) ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 shall continue to apply to an employer that receives coverage through the exchange until the employer no longer receives coverage through the exchange and is no longer a small employer. [Formerly 743.733]

 

      743B.011 Group health benefit plans subject to provisions of specified laws; exemptions. (1) Every health benefit plan shall be subject to the provisions of ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013, if the plan provides health benefits covering one or more employees of a small employer and if any one of the following conditions is met:

      (a) Any portion of the premium or benefits is paid by a small employer or any employee is reimbursed, whether through wage adjustments or otherwise, by a small employer for any portion of the health benefit plan premium unless the reimbursement is made through a qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement, as defined in section 9831 of the Internal Revenue Code; or

      (b) The health benefit plan is treated by the employer or any of the employees as part of a plan or program for the purposes of section 106, section 125 or section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

      (2) Except as otherwise provided by ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 or other law, no health benefit plan offered to a small employer shall:

      (a) Inhibit a carrier from contracting with providers or groups of providers with respect to health care services or benefits; or

      (b) Impose any restriction on the ability of a carrier to negotiate with providers regarding the level or method of reimbursing care or services provided under health benefit plans.

      (3)(a) A carrier may provide different health benefit plans to different categories of employees of a small employer when the employer has chosen to establish different categories of employees in a manner that does not relate to the actual or expected health status of such employees or their dependents. The categories must be based on bona fide employment-based classifications that are consistent with the employer’s usual business practice.

      (b) Except as provided in ORS 743B.012 (7), a carrier that offers coverage to a small employer shall offer coverage to all eligible employees of the small employer.

      (c) If a small employer elects to offer coverage to dependents of eligible employees, the carrier shall offer coverage to all dependents of eligible employees.

      (4) An insurer may not deny, delay or terminate participation of an individual in a group health benefit plan or exclude coverage otherwise provided to an individual under a group health benefit plan based on a preexisting condition of the individual. [Formerly 743.734; 2017 c.152 §9]

 

      743B.012 Requirement to offer all health benefit plans to small employers; offering of plan by carriers; exceptions. (1) As a condition of transacting business in the small employer health insurance market in this state, a carrier shall offer small employers all of the carrier’s health benefit plans, approved by the Department of Consumer and Business Services for use in the small employer market, for which the small employer is eligible.

      (2) A carrier shall issue to a small employer any health benefit plan that is offered by the carrier if the small employer applies for the plan and agrees to make the required premium payments and to satisfy the other provisions of the health benefit plan.

      (3) A multiple employer welfare arrangement, professional or trade association or other similar arrangement established or maintained to provide benefits to a particular trade, business, profession or industry or their subsidiaries may not issue coverage to a group or individual that is not in the same trade, business, profession or industry as that covered by the arrangement. The arrangement shall accept all groups and individuals in the same trade, business, profession or industry or their subsidiaries that apply for coverage under the arrangement and that meet the requirements for membership in the arrangement. For purposes of this subsection, the requirements for membership in an arrangement may not include any requirements that relate to the actual or expected health status of the prospective enrollee.

      (4) A carrier shall, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, accept applications from and offer coverage to a small employer group covered under an existing health benefit plan regardless of whether a prospective enrollee is excluded from coverage under the existing plan because of late enrollment. When a carrier accepts an application for a small employer group, the carrier may continue to exclude the prospective enrollee excluded from coverage by the replaced plan until the prospective enrollee would have become eligible for coverage under that replaced plan.

      (5) A carrier is not required to accept applications from and offer coverage pursuant to subsection (2) of this section if the department finds that acceptance of an application or applications would endanger the carrier’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations or result in financial impairment of the carrier.

      (6) A carrier shall actively market all health benefit plans that are offered by the carrier to small employers in the geographical areas in which the carrier makes coverage available or provides benefits.

      (7)(a) Subsection (2) of this section does not require a carrier to offer coverage to or accept applications from:

      (A) A small employer if the small employer is not physically located in the carrier’s approved service area;

      (B) An employee of a small employer if the employee does not work or reside within the carrier’s approved service areas; or

      (C) Small employers located within an area where the carrier reasonably anticipates, and demonstrates to the department, that it will not have the capacity in its network of providers to deliver services adequately to the enrollees of those small employer groups because of its obligations to existing small employer group contract holders and enrollees.

      (b) A carrier that does not offer coverage pursuant to paragraph (a)(C) of this subsection may not offer coverage in the applicable service area to new employer groups other than small employers until the carrier resumes enrolling groups of new small employers in the applicable area.

      (8) For purposes of ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013, except as provided in this subsection, carriers that are affiliated carriers or that are eligible to file a consolidated tax return pursuant to ORS 317.715 shall be treated as one carrier and any restrictions or limitations imposed by ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 apply as if all health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this state by the affiliated carriers were issued by one carrier. However, any insurance company or health maintenance organization that is an affiliate of a health care service contractor located in this state, or any health maintenance organization located in this state that is an affiliate of an insurance company or health care service contractor, may treat the health maintenance organization as a separate carrier and each health maintenance organization that operates only one health maintenance organization in a service area in this state may be considered a separate carrier.

      (9) A carrier that elects to discontinue offering all of its health benefit plans to small employers under ORS 743B.013 (3)(e) or elects to discontinue renewing all such plans is prohibited from offering health benefit plans to small employers in this state for a period of five years from:

      (a) The date of notice to the department pursuant to ORS 743B.013 (3)(e); or

      (b) If notice is not provided under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the date on which the department provides notice to the carrier that the department has determined that the carrier has effectively discontinued offering health benefit plans to small employers in this state.

      (10) The department may, in accordance with ORS 743B.129, shorten the period of prohibition described in subsection (9) of this section if necessary to ensure, in all geographic areas of this state, that:

      (a) A competitive health insurance market exists;

      (b) Small employers have a reasonable number of health insurance options available to them; and

      (c) Consumers who purchase insurance are protected. [Formerly 743.736; 2017 c.206 §4]

 

      743B.013 Requirements for small employer health benefit plans. (1) A health benefit plan issued to a small employer:

      (B) May not cancel coverage under the plans for 180 days after the date of the notice required under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph if coverage is discontinued in the entire state or in a specified service area, except that:

      (ii) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may specify a cancellation date other than the cancellation date specified in this subparagraph if the carrier is subject to a delinquency proceeding, as defined in ORS 734.014; and

      (C) May not cancel coverage under the plans for 90 days after the date of the notice required under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph if coverage is discontinued in a specified service area because of an inability to reach an agreement with the health care providers or organization of health care providers to provide services under the plans within the service area.

      (g) The carrier discontinues both offering and renewing a health benefit plan, other than a grandfathered health plan, for all small employers in this state or in a specified service area within this state, other than a plan discontinued under paragraph (f) of this subsection.

      (h) The carrier discontinues both offering and renewing a grandfathered health plan for all small employers in this state or in a specified service area within this state, other than a plan discontinued under paragraph (f) of this subsection.

      (i) With respect to plans that are being discontinued under paragraph (g) or (h) of this subsection, the carrier must:

      (A) Offer in writing to each small employer covered by the plan, all other health benefit plans that the carrier offers to small employers in the specified service area.

      (A) Not be in the best interests of the enrollees; or

      (B) Impair the carrier’s ability to meet contractual obligations.

      (k) In the case of a small employer health benefit plan that delivers covered services through a specified network of health care providers, there is no longer any enrollee who lives, resides or works in the service area of the provider network.

      (L) In the case of a health benefit plan that is offered in the small employer market only to one or more bona fide associations, the membership of an employer in the association ceases and the termination of coverage is not related to the health status of any enrollee.

      (4) A carrier may modify a small employer health benefit plan at the time of coverage renewal. The modification is not a discontinuation of the plan under subsection (3)(e), (g) and (h) of this section.

      (5) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (3) of this section to the contrary, a carrier may not rescind the coverage of an enrollee in a small employer health benefit plan unless:

      (a) The enrollee or a person seeking coverage on behalf of the enrollee:

      (A) Performs an act, practice or omission that constitutes fraud; or

      (B) Makes an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact as prohibited by the terms of the plan;

      (b) The carrier provides at least 30 days’ advance written notice, in the form and manner prescribed by the department, to the enrollee; and

In determining minimum participation requirements, a carrier shall count only those employees who are not covered by an existing group health benefit plan, Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, Indian Health Service or a publicly sponsored or subsidized health plan, including but not limited to the medical assistance program under ORS chapter 414.

      (b) A carrier may not deny a small employer’s application for coverage under a health benefit plan based on participation or contribution requirements but may require small employers that do not meet participation or contribution requirements to enroll during the open enrollment period beginning November 15 and ending December 15.

      (8) Premium rates for small employer health benefit plans, except grandfathered health plans, are subject to the following provisions:

      (a) Each carrier must file with the department the initial geographic average rate and any changes in the geographic average rate with respect to each health benefit plan issued by the carrier to small employers.

      (b)(A) The variations in premium rates charged during a rating period for health benefit plans issued to small employers must be based solely on the factors specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.

All other factors must be applied in the same actuarially sound way to all small employer health benefit plans.

      (B) The variations in premium rates described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may be based only on one or more of the following factors as prescribed by the department by rule:

      (i) The ages of enrolled employees and their dependents, except that the rate for adults may not vary by more than three to one;

      (ii) The level at which enrolled employees and dependents of enrolled employees engage in tobacco use, except that the rate may not vary by more than 1.5 to one; and

      (iii) Adjustments to reflect differences in family composition.

      (C) A carrier shall apply the carrier’s schedule of premium rate variations as approved by the department and in accordance with this paragraph. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the premium rate established by a carrier for a small employer health benefit plan applies uniformly to all employees of the small employer enrolled in that plan.

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the variation in premium rates between different health benefit plans offered by a carrier to small employers must be based solely on objective differences in plan design or coverage, age, tobacco use and family composition and must not include differences based on the risk characteristics of groups assumed to select a particular health benefit plan.

      (d) A carrier may not increase the rates of a health benefit plan issued to a small employer more than once in a 12-month period. Annual rate increases are effective on the plan anniversary date of the health benefit plan issued to a small employer. The percentage increase in the premium rate charged to a small employer for a new rating period may not exceed the sum of the following:

      (A) The percentage change in the geographic average rate measured from the first day of the prior rating period to the first day of the new period; and

      (B) Any adjustment attributable to changes in age and differences in family composition.

      (9) Premium rates for grandfathered health plans are subject to requirements prescribed by the department by rule.

      (10) In connection with the offering for sale of any health benefit plan to a small employer, each carrier shall make a reasonable disclosure as part of the carrier’s solicitation and sales materials of:

      (a) The full array of health benefit plans that are offered to small employers by the carrier;

      (b) The authority of the carrier to adjust rates and premiums, and the extent to which the carrier considers age, tobacco use, family composition and geographic factors in establishing and adjusting rates and premiums; and

      (c) The benefits and premiums for all health insurance coverage for which the employer is qualified.

      (11)(a) Each carrier shall maintain at the carrier’s principal place of business a complete and detailed description of the carrier’s rating practices and renewal underwriting practices relating to the carrier’s small employer health benefit plans, including information and documentation that demonstrate that the carrier’s rating methods and practices are based upon commonly accepted actuarial practices and are in accordance with sound actuarial principles.

      (b) A carrier offering a small employer health benefit plan shall file with the department at least once every 12 months an actuarial certification that the carrier is in compliance with ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 and that the rating methods of the carrier are actuarially sound. Each certification must be in a uniform form and manner and must contain such information as specified by the department. The carrier shall retain a copy of each certification at the carrier’s principal place of business. A carrier is not required to file the actuarial certification under this paragraph if the department has approved the carrier’s rate filing within the preceding 12-month period.

      (c) A carrier shall make the information and documentation described in paragraph (a) of this subsection available to the department upon request. Except as provided in ORS 743.018 and except in cases of violations of ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013, the information is proprietary and trade secret information and is not subject to disclosure to persons outside the department except as agreed to by the carrier or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (12) A carrier may not provide any financial or other incentive to any insurance producer that would encourage the insurance producer to sell health benefit plans of the carrier to small employer groups based on a small employer group’s anticipated claims experience.

      (13) For purposes of this section, the date a small employer health benefit plan is continued is the anniversary date of the first issuance of the health benefit plan.

      (14) A carrier shall include a provision that offers coverage to all eligible employees of a small employer and to all dependents of the eligible employees to the extent the employer chooses to offer coverage to dependents.

      (15) All small employer health benefit plans must contain special enrollment periods during which eligible employees and dependents may enroll for coverage, as provided by federal law and rules adopted by the department.

      (16) A small employer health benefit plan may not impose annual or lifetime limits on the dollar amount of essential health benefits. [Formerly 743.737; 2017 c.479 §16a; 2017 c.701 §23]

 

      743B.020 Eligible employees and small employers; rules. (1) The Department of Consumer and Business Services shall adopt by rule a method for determining whether:

      (a) An employee is an eligible employee as defined in ORS 743B.005; and

      (b) An employer is a small employer as defined in ORS 743B.005.

      (2) The method adopted by the department under subsection (1) of this section must be consistent with corresponding federal requirements for the Small Business Health Options Program as defined in ORS 741.300. [2015 c.515 §3a]

 

      Note: 743B.020 was added to and made a part of the Insurance Code by legislative action but was not added to ORS chapter 743B or any series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      743B.225 Continuity of care. (1) As used in this section, “continuity of care” means the feature of a health benefit plan under which an enrollee who is receiving care from an individual provider is entitled to continue with care with the individual provider for a limited period of time after the medical services contract terminates.

      (2) An insurer offering managed health insurance or preferred provider organization insurance in this state shall provide continuity of care to an enrollee under a health benefit plan if:

      (a) A medical services contract or other contract for an individual provider’s services is terminated;

      (b) The provider no longer participates in the provider network; and

      (c) The insurer does not cover services when services are provided to enrollees by the individual provider or covers services at a benefit level below the benefit level specified in the plan for out-of-network providers.

      (3) In order to obtain continuity of care, an enrollee must request continuity of care from the insurer.

      (4) An enrollee of a health benefit plan is entitled to continuity of care when the following conditions are met:

      (a) The enrollee is undergoing an active course of treatment that is medically necessary and, by agreement of the individual provider and the enrollee, it is desirable to maintain continuity of care; and

      (b) The contractual relationship between the individual provider and the insurer described in subsection (2) of this section with respect to the plan covering the enrollee has ended, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section.

      (7) Except as provided for pregnancy in subsection (8) of this section, an enrollee who is entitled to continuity of care shall receive the care until the earlier of the following dates:

      (a) The day following the date on which the active course of treatment entitling the enrollee to continuity of care is completed; or

      (b) The 120th day after the date of notification by the insurer to the enrollee of the termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider, as required by subsection (9) of this section.

      (8) An enrollee who is undergoing care for a pregnancy and who becomes entitled to continuity of care after commencement of the second trimester of the pregnancy shall receive the care until the later of the following dates:

      (a) The 45th day after the birth; or

      (b) As long as the enrollee continues under an active course of treatment, but not later than the 120th day after the date of notification by the insurer to the enrollee of the termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider as required by subsection (9) of this section.

      (9) An insurer shall give written notice of the termination of the contractual relationship between the insurer and the individual provider and of the right to obtain continuity of care to those enrollees that the insurer knows or reasonably should know are under the care of the individual provider. The notice may be given prior to the date on which the termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider takes effect only if the insurer gives notice in a good faith belief that the termination will take effect as stated in the notice. In any event, the notice shall be given to those enrollees not later than the 10th day after the date on which the termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider takes effect. If the insurer first learns the identity of an affected enrollee after the date of termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider or after the date on which the insurer gave notice to the other affected enrollees, then the insurer shall give a notice of termination to the affected enrollee not later than the 10th day after learning that enrollee’s identity.

      (10) For the purpose of notifying an enrollee under subsection (7)(b) or (8)(b) of this section:

      (a) The date of notification by the insurer is the earlier of the date on which the enrollee receives the notice or the date on which the insurer receives or approves the request for continuity of care.

      (b) If an individual provider belongs to a provider group, the provider group may deliver the notice if the insurer agrees that the provider group may do so and if the notice clearly provides the information that the plan is required to provide to the enrollee under subsection (9) of this section.

      (11) A health benefit plan may condition continuity of care upon the requirement that the individual provider adhere to the medical services contract between the provider and the insurer and accept the contractual reimbursement rate applicable at the time of contract termination or, if the contractual reimbursement rate was not based on a fee for service, a rate equivalent to the contractual rate. [Formerly 743.854]

 

      743B.227 Referrals to specialists. (1) If an insurer offers a health benefit plan that requires, as a condition of coverage for specialty care services, a referral by a physician who is authorized under the plan or under the medical services contract between the physician and the insurer to refer an enrollee to specialty care services, the insurer must include the requirements of this section in the plan. The requirements apply only to benefits for which the member is contractually eligible under the plan. The requirements are as follows:

      (a) The plan must establish and implement a procedure for standing referrals, so that an enrollee is not required to obtain approval from the authorized physician for each appointment with a specialist after the initial appointment.

      (b) The plan must allow a standing referral for an enrollee if the authorized physician determines that the enrollee needs continuing care from a specialist.

      (c) The plan must allow an enrollee to request and obtain a second medical opinion or consultation from a second physician who is a network provider and who is authorized to make decisions regarding the need for a referral to a specialist. If the plan does not have a network provider available to give a second medical opinion or consultation, the plan must allow the enrollee to obtain the opinion or consultation from a similarly qualified physician who is not a network provider. The plan may not impose a charge for the second medical opinion or consultation that is greater than the cost that the enrollee would otherwise pay for an initial medical opinion or consultation from the second physician.

      (2) A specialist to whom an enrollee is referred must make regular reports to the authorized physician under subsection (1) of this section in accordance with best practices for coordinated care as established by the insurer. [Formerly 743.856]

      (3) An insurer may pay a claim using a credit card or electronic funds transfer payment method that imposes on the provider a fee or similar charge to process the payment if:
