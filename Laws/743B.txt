EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE

 

      743B.010 Issuance of group health benefit plan to affiliated group of employers; determination of number of employees for purpose of determining eligibility as small employer. (1) If an affiliated group of employers is treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a carrier may issue a single group health benefit plan to the affiliated group on the basis of the number of employees in the affiliated group if the group requests such coverage.

      (2) Subsequent to the issuance of a health benefit plan to a small employer, other than a plan issued through the health insurance exchange, a carrier shall determine annually the number of employees of the employer for purposes of determining the employer’s ongoing eligibility as a small employer.

      (3)(a) ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 shall continue to apply to a health benefit plan issued outside of the exchange to a small employer until the plan anniversary date following the date the employer no longer meets the definition of a small employer.

      (b) ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 shall continue to apply to an employer that receives coverage through the exchange until the employer no longer receives coverage through the exchange and is no longer a small employer. [Formerly 743.733]

(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, every health benefit plan shall be subject to the provisions of ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013, if the plan provides health benefits covering one or more employees of a small employer and if any one of the following conditions is met:

      (a) Any portion of the premium or benefits is paid by a small employer or any employee is reimbursed, whether through wage adjustments or otherwise, by a small employer for any portion of the health benefit plan premium; or

      (b) The health benefit plan is treated by the employer or any of the employees as part of a plan or program for the purposes of section 106, section 125 or section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

      (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to:

      (a) An individual health benefit plan for which a portion of the premium is reimbursed through a qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement as defined in section 9831 of the Internal Revenue Code; or

      (b) An individual health benefit plan that is considered to be integrated with a health reimbursement arrangement or other account-based group health plan authorized by federal law.

      (3) Except as otherwise provided by ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 or other law, no health benefit plan offered to a small employer shall:

      (a) Inhibit a carrier from contracting with providers or groups of providers with respect to health care services or benefits; or

      (b) Impose any restriction on the ability of a carrier to negotiate with providers regarding the level or method of reimbursing care or services provided under health benefit plans.

      (4)(a) A carrier may provide different health benefit plans to different categories of employees of a small employer when the employer has chosen to establish different categories of employees in a manner that does not relate to the actual or expected health status of such employees or their dependents. The categories must be based on bona fide employment-based classifications that are consistent with the employer’s usual business practice.

      (b) Except as provided in ORS 743B.012 (7), a carrier that offers coverage to a small employer shall offer coverage to all eligible employees of the small employer.

      (c) If a small employer elects to offer coverage to dependents of eligible employees, the carrier shall offer coverage to all dependents of eligible employees.

      (5) An insurer may not deny, delay or terminate participation of an individual in a group health benefit plan or exclude coverage otherwise provided to an individual under a group health benefit plan based on a preexisting condition of the individual.

      743B.012 Requirement to offer all health benefit plans to small employers; offering of plan by carriers; exceptions. (1) As a condition of transacting business in the small employer health insurance market in this state, a carrier shall offer small employers all of the carrier’s health benefit plans, approved by the Department of Consumer and Business Services for use in the small employer market, for which the small employer is eligible.

      (2) A carrier shall issue to a small employer any health benefit plan that is offered by the carrier if the small employer applies for the plan and agrees to make the required premium payments and to satisfy the other provisions of the health benefit plan.

      (3) A multiple employer welfare arrangement, professional or trade association or other similar arrangement established or maintained to provide benefits to a particular trade, business, profession or industry or their subsidiaries may not issue coverage to a group or individual that is not in the same trade, business, profession or industry as that covered by the arrangement. The arrangement shall accept all groups and individuals in the same trade, business, profession or industry or their subsidiaries that apply for coverage under the arrangement and that meet the requirements for membership in the arrangement. For purposes of this subsection, the requirements for membership in an arrangement may not include any requirements that relate to the actual or expected health status of the prospective enrollee.

      (4) A carrier shall, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, accept applications from and offer coverage to a small employer group covered under an existing health benefit plan regardless of whether a prospective enrollee is excluded from coverage under the existing plan because of late enrollment. When a carrier accepts an application for a small employer group, the carrier may continue to exclude the prospective enrollee excluded from coverage by the replaced plan until the prospective enrollee would have become eligible for coverage under that replaced plan.

      (5) A carrier is not required to accept applications from and offer coverage pursuant to subsection (2) of this section if the department finds that acceptance of an application or applications would endanger the carrier’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations or result in financial impairment of the carrier.

      (6) A carrier shall actively market all health benefit plans that are offered by the carrier to small employers in the geographical areas in which the carrier makes coverage available or provides benefits.

      (7)(a) Subsection (2) of this section does not require a carrier to offer coverage to or accept applications from:

      (A) A small employer if the small employer is not physically located in the carrier’s approved service area;

      (B) An employee of a small employer if the employee does not work or reside within the carrier’s approved service areas; or

      (C) Small employers located within an area where the carrier reasonably anticipates, and demonstrates to the department, that it will not have the capacity in its network of providers to deliver services adequately to the enrollees of those small employer groups because of its obligations to existing small employer group contract holders and enrollees.

      (b) A carrier that does not offer coverage pursuant to paragraph (a)(C) of this subsection may not offer coverage in the applicable service area to new employer groups other than small employers until the carrier resumes enrolling groups of new small employers in the applicable area.

      (8) For purposes of ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013, except as provided in this subsection, carriers that are affiliated carriers or that are eligible to file a consolidated tax return pursuant to ORS 317.715 shall be treated as one carrier and any restrictions or limitations imposed by ORS 743B.010 to 743B.013 apply as if all health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this state by the affiliated carriers were issued by one carrier. However, any insurance company or health maintenance organization that is an affiliate of a health care service contractor located in this state, or any health maintenance organization located in this state that is an affiliate of an insurance company or health care service contractor, may treat the health maintenance organization as a separate carrier and each health maintenance organization that operates only one health maintenance organization in a service area in this state may be considered a separate carrier.

      (9) A carrier that elects to discontinue offering all of its health benefit plans to small employers under ORS 743B.013 (3)(e) or elects to discontinue renewing all such plans is prohibited from offering health benefit plans to small employers in this state for a period of five years from:

      (a) A competitive health insurance market exists;

      (b) Small employers have a reasonable number of health insurance options available to them; and

      (c) Consumers who purchase insurance are protected. [Formerly 743.736; 2017 c.206 §4]

      (b) A carrier may not deny a small employer’s application for coverage under a health benefit plan based on participation or contribution requirements but may require small employers that do not meet participation or contribution requirements to enroll during the open enrollment period beginning November 15 and ending December 15.

      (ii) The level at which enrolled employees and dependents of enrolled employees engage in tobacco use, except that the rate may not vary by more than 1.5 to one; and

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the variation in premium rates between different health benefit plans offered by a carrier to small employers must be based solely on objective differences in plan design or coverage, age, tobacco use and family composition and must not include differences based on the risk characteristics of groups assumed to select a particular health benefit plan.

      (d) A carrier may not increase the rates of a health benefit plan issued to a small employer more than once in a 12-month period.

      (4) An enrollee of a health benefit plan is entitled to continuity of care when the following conditions are met:

      (a) The enrollee is undergoing an active course of treatment that is medically necessary and, by agreement of the individual provider and the enrollee, it is desirable to maintain continuity of care; and

      (7) Except as provided for pregnancy in subsection (8) of this section, an enrollee who is entitled to continuity of care shall receive the care until the earlier of the following dates:

      (a) The day following the date on which the active course of treatment entitling the enrollee to continuity of care is completed; or

      (b) The 120th day after the date of notification by the insurer to the enrollee of the termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider, as required by subsection (9) of this section.

      (8) An enrollee who is undergoing care for a pregnancy and who becomes entitled to continuity of care after commencement of the second trimester of the pregnancy shall receive the care until the later of the following dates:

      (9) An insurer shall give written notice of the termination of the contractual relationship between the insurer and the individual provider and of the right to obtain continuity of care to those enrollees that the insurer knows or reasonably should know are under the care of the individual provider. The notice may be given prior to the date on which the termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider takes effect only if the insurer gives notice in a good faith belief that the termination will take effect as stated in the notice. In any event, the notice shall be given to those enrollees not later than the 10th day after the date on which the termination of the contractual relationship with the individual provider takes effect.

      (11) A health benefit plan may condition continuity of care upon the requirement that the individual provider adhere to the medical services contract between the provider and the insurer and accept the contractual reimbursement rate applicable at the time of contract termination or, if the contractual reimbursement rate was not based on a fee for service, a rate equivalent to the contractual rate. [Formerly 743.854]

 

      743B.227 Referrals to specialists. (1) If an insurer offers a health benefit plan that requires, as a condition of coverage for specialty care services, a referral by a physician who is authorized under the plan or under the medical services contract between the physician and the insurer to refer an enrollee to specialty care services, the insurer must include the requirements of this section in the plan. The requirements apply only to benefits for which the member is contractually eligible under the plan. The requirements are as follows:

      (a) The plan must establish and implement a procedure for standing referrals, so that an enrollee is not required to obtain approval from the authorized physician for each appointment with a specialist after the initial appointment.

      (b) The plan must allow a standing referral for an enrollee if the authorized physician determines that the enrollee needs continuing care from a specialist.

      (c) The plan must allow an enrollee to request and obtain a second medical opinion or consultation from a second physician who is a network provider and who is authorized to make decisions regarding the need for a referral to a specialist. If the plan does not have a network provider available to give a second medical opinion or consultation, the plan must allow the enrollee to obtain the opinion or consultation from a similarly qualified physician who is not a network provider. The plan may not impose a charge for the second medical opinion or consultation that is greater than the cost that the enrollee would otherwise pay for an initial medical opinion or consultation from the second physician.

      (2) A specialist to whom an enrollee is referred must make regular reports to the authorized physician under subsection (1) of this section in accordance with best practices for coordinated care as established by the insurer. [Formerly 743.856]

PAYMENT OF CLAIMS

 

      743B.450 Prompt payment of claims; limits on use of electronic payment methods; rules. (1) Except as provided in this subsection, when a claim under a health benefit plan is submitted to an insurer by a provider on behalf of an enrollee, the insurer shall pay a clean claim or deny the claim not later than 30 days after the date on which the insurer receives the claim. If an insurer requires additional information before payment of a claim, not later than 30 days after the date on which the insurer receives the claim, the insurer shall notify the enrollee and the provider in writing and give the enrollee and the provider an explanation of the additional information needed to process the claim. The insurer shall pay a clean claim or deny the claim not later than 30 days after the date on which the insurer receives the additional information.

      (2) A contract between an insurer and a provider may not include a provision governing payment of claims that limits the rights and remedies available to a provider under this section and ORS 743B.452 or has the effect of relieving either party of its obligations under this section and ORS 743B.452.

      (3) An insurer may pay a claim using a credit card or electronic funds transfer payment method that imposes on the provider a fee or similar charge to process the payment if:

      (a) The insurer notifies the provider, in advance, of the fee or other charges associated with the use of the credit card or electronic funds transfer payment method;

      (b) The insurer offers the provider an alternative payment method that does not impose fees or similar charges on the provider; and

      (c) The provider or a designee of the provider elects to accept a payment of the claim using the payment method.

      (4) An insurer shall establish a method of communicating to providers the procedures and information necessary to complete claim forms. The procedures and information must be reasonably accessible to providers.

      (5) This section does not create an assignment of payment to a provider.

      (6) Each insurer shall report to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services on its compliance under this section according to requirements established by the director.

      (7) The director shall adopt by rule a definition of “clean claim” and shall consider the definition of “clean claim” used by the federal Department of Health and Human Services for the payment of Medicare claims. [Formerly 743.911]

 

      743B.451 Refund of paid claims. (1) As used in this section, “refund” means the return, either directly or through an offset to a future claim, of some or all of a payment already received by a health care provider.

      (2) Except in the case of fraud or abuse of billing, and except as provided in subsections (3) and (5) of this section, a health insurer may not:

      (a) Request from a health care provider a refund of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim unless the health insurer:

      (A) Requests the refund in writing on or before the last day of the period specified by the contract with the health care provider or 18 months after the date the payment was made, whichever is earlier; and

      (B) Specifies in the written request why the health insurer believes the provider owes the refund.

      (b) Request that a contested refund be paid earlier than six months after the health care provider receives the request.

      (3) A health insurer may not do the following for reasons related to coordination of benefits with another health insurer or entity responsible for payment of a claim:

      (a) Request from a health care provider a refund of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim unless the health insurer:

      (A) Requests the refund in writing within 30 months after the date the payment was made;

      (B) Specifies in the written request why the health insurer believes the provider owes the refund; and

      (C) Includes in the written request the name and mailing address of the other health insurer or entity that has primary responsibility for payment of the claim.

      (b) Request that a contested refund be paid earlier than six months after the provider receives the request.

      (4) If a health care provider fails to contest a refund request in writing to the health insurer within 30 days after receiving the request, the request is deemed accepted and the provider must pay the refund within 30 days after the request is deemed accepted. If the provider has not paid the refund within 30 days after the request is deemed accepted, the health insurer may recover the amount through an offset to a future claim.

      (5) A health insurer may at any time request from a health care provider a refund of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim if:

      (a) A third party, including a government entity, is found responsible for satisfaction of the claim as a consequence of liability imposed by law; and

      (b) The health insurer is unable to recover directly from the third party because the third party has already paid or will pay the provider for the health care services covered by the claim.

      (6) If a contract between a health insurer and a health care provider conflicts with this section, the provisions of this section prevail. However, nothing in this section prohibits a health care provider from choosing at any time to refund to a health insurer any payment previously made to satisfy a claim.

      (7) This section neither permits nor precludes a health insurer from recovering from a subscriber, enrollee or beneficiary any amounts paid to a health care provider for benefits to which the subscriber, enrollee or beneficiary was not entitled under the terms and conditions of the health plan, insurance policy or other benefit agreement.

      (8) This section applies to health benefit plans. [Formerly 743.912]

(1) An insurer that fails to pay a claim to a provider within the timelines established in ORS 743B.450 shall pay simple interest of 12 percent per annum on the unpaid amount of the claim that is due and owing, accruing from the date after the payment was due until the claim is paid. Interest on any overdue payment for a claim begins to accrue on the 31st day after:

      (a) The date on which the insurer received the claim; or

      (b) The date the insurer receives the requested additional information.

      (2) The interest is payable with the payment of the claim. An insurer is not required to pay interest that is in the amount of $2 or less on any claim.

      (3) The availability of interest under subsection (1) of this section is in addition to and not in lieu of administrative actions and penalties that may be imposed by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services under the Insurance Code. [Formerly 743.913]

 

      743B.453 Underpayment of claims. (1) Except in the case of fraud and except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a health care provider may not:

      (a) Request additional payment from a health insurer to satisfy a claim unless the provider:

      (A) Requests the additional payment in writing on or before the last day of the period specified by the contract or 18 months after the date the claim was denied or payment intended to satisfy the claim was made, whichever is earlier; and

      (B) Specifies in the written request why the provider believes the health insurer owes the additional payment.

      (b) Request that an additional payment be paid earlier than six months after the health insurer receives the request.

      (2) A health insurer may not consider a health care provider’s claim untimely if the claim is made no later than 12 months after a different insurer:

      (a) Denied the claim in whole or in part; or

      (b) Requested a refund of an erroneous payment made on the claim.

      (3) A health care provider may not do the following for reasons related to coordination of benefits with another health insurer or entity responsible for payment of a claim:

      (a) Request additional payment from a health insurer to satisfy a claim unless the provider:

      (A) Requests the additional payment in writing within 30 months after the date the claim was denied or payment intended to satisfy the claim was made;

      (B) Specifies in the written request why the provider believes the health insurer owes the additional payment; and

      (C) Includes in the written request the name and mailing address of the other health insurer or entity that has disclaimed responsibility for payment of the claim.

      (b) Request that the additional payment be paid earlier than six months after the health insurer receives the request.

      (4) If a contract between a health insurer and a health care provider conflicts with this section, the provisions of this section prevail. However, nothing in this section prohibits a health insurer from choosing at any time to make additional payments to a health care provider to satisfy a claim.

      (5) This section applies to health benefit plans. [Formerly 743.917]
