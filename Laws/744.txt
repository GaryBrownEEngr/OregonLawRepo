The person must apply and otherwise qualify for the license in the same manner as a person who initially applies for the license.

      (5) A person licensed as a surplus lines insurance producer in the person’s home state is eligible for a nonresident surplus lines insurance producer license in the manner provided for nonresident insurance producer licenses in subsection (1) of this section.

      (6) The director is the attorney in fact of a person to whom a license is issued under this section, and upon whom all legal process in any action or proceeding against the person may be served. Any legal process against the person that is served upon the director has the same legal force and validity as if served upon the person. The authority of the director under this subsection continues as long as any liability remains outstanding in this state. The director becomes the attorney in fact of the person on the date that the director issues the nonresident insurance producer license to the person.

(1) An individual who applies for a resident insurance producer license in this state who is or was previously licensed as an insurance producer for the same lines of authority in another state is not required to complete any prelicensing education or examination. The exemption under this subsection is available only if the individual is currently licensed in the other state or if the application is received by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services not later than the 90th day after the applicant’s previous license was terminated and if the other state issues a certification that, at the time of termination, the applicant was in good standing in that state or the state’s Producer Database maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, its affiliates or subsidiaries indicate that the applicant is or was licensed in good standing for the class of insurance requested.

      (2) A person licensed as an insurance producer in another state who moves to this state must apply for a resident insurance producer license not later than the 90th day after the date on which the person established legal residence in order to qualify for a resident insurance producer license pursuant to ORS 744.059. Neither prelicensing education nor an examination is required of a person to whom this subsection applies in order to obtain a license in a class of insurance described in ORS 744.062 if the person held a license in that class in the other state, except when the director has determined otherwise by rule.

      (3) An individual who holds an industry designation described in this subsection is not required to complete prelicensing education or the examination required in ORS 744.058 if the director is satisfied, by examination or otherwise, that the applicant is knowledgeable in the particulars of the applicable provisions of the Insurance Code.

The renewal fee is due on the last day of the month in which the second anniversary of the initial issuance date of the license occurs and on the second anniversary following each renewal. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may establish another renewal period for the purpose of coordination with any national registration or licensing system.

Continuing education shall not be required for:

      (a) Any person to whom a license is issued without examination pursuant to ORS 744.067 (5);

      (5) In connection with establishing continuing education requirements under subsection (4) of this section, the director may make arrangements, including contracting with a private service, for establishing and operating a program and standards for approving and registering continuing education programs and their providers.

      (6) An individual insurance producer who allows the insurance producer license to lapse may apply to the director to reinstate the same license within 12 months from the due date for renewal without having to take and pass a written examination, but the insurance producer must pay an amount for the reinstatement that is equal to double the unpaid renewal fee for any renewal fee paid after the due date and must complete any continuing education requirements not satisfied to date, including the period for which the license was lapsed. A license reinstated under this subsection is effective upon the date that the director grants the reinstatement.

      (7) An individual insurance producer who is unable to comply with license renewal procedures due to military service or another extenuating circumstance such as a long term medical disability may request a waiver from compliance with those procedures. The insurance producer may also request a waiver of any examination requirement or any penalty imposed for failure to comply with renewal procedures.

The director may require the temporary licensee to have a suitable sponsor who is a licensed insurance producer or insurer and who assumes responsibility for all acts of the temporary licensee and may impose other similar requirements designed to protect insureds and the public. The director may revoke a temporary license if the interest of insureds or the public is endangered.

      744.354 Disclosure by life settlement provider, broker or investment agent to policy owner. (1) With an application for a life settlement, a life settlement provider or life settlement broker shall provide the owner with at least the following disclosures no later than the time the application for the life settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures must be provided in a separate document that is signed by the owner and the life settlement provider or life settlement broker, and must provide the following information:

      (a) There are possible alternatives to life settlement contracts, including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the owner’s life insurance policy.

      (b) A life settlement broker represents exclusively the owner, and not the insurer or the life settlement provider, and owes a fiduciary duty to the owner, including a duty to act according to the owner’s instructions and in the best interest of the owner.

      (c) Some or all of the proceeds of the life settlement may be taxable under federal and state income tax, and assistance should be sought from a professional tax adviser.

      (d) Proceeds of the life settlement may be subject to the claims of creditors.

      (e) Receipt of proceeds from a life settlement contract may affect the owner’s eligibility for public assistance or other government benefits or entitlements, and advice should be obtained from appropriate agencies. Receipt of proceeds from a life settlement contract may reduce the owner’s risk of becoming impoverished and becoming dependent on public assistance or other government benefits or entitlements.

      (f) The owner has the right to rescind a life settlement contract before the earlier of 60 calendar days after the date upon which the life settlement contract is executed by all parties or 30 calendar days after the life settlement proceeds have been paid to the owner, as provided in ORS 744.364 (3). Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given, and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid on account of the life settlement within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the life settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment by the owner or the owner’s estate of all life settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest of the life settlement within 60 days of the insured’s death.

      (g) Funds will be sent to the owner within three business days after the life settlement provider has received the insurer or group administrator’s written acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated.

      (h) Entering into a life settlement contract may prevent the owner from qualifying for new life insurance coverage in the future and may cause other rights or benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or certificate, to be forfeited by the owner. Assistance should be sought from a financial adviser.

      (i) The following language: “All medical, financial or personal information solicited or obtained by a life settlement provider or life settlement broker about an insured, including the insured’s identity or the identity of family members, a spouse or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to effect the life settlement between the owner and the life settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every two years.”

      (j) Following execution of a life contract, the insured may be contacted for the purpose of determining the insured’s health status and to confirm the insured’s residential or business street address and telephone number, or as otherwise provided in ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992. This contact is limited to once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less. All such contacts shall be made only by a life settlement provider licensed in the state in which the owner resided at the time of the life settlement, or by the authorized representative of a duly licensed life settlement provider.

      (2) Prior to or concurrently with the disclosures required under subsection (1) of this section, the owner shall be given a brochure describing the process of life settlements. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall develop and approve a form for the brochure.

      (3) A life settlement provider shall provide the owner with at least the following disclosures no later than the date the life settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in the life settlement contract or in a separate document signed by the owner and provide the following information:

      (a) The affiliation, if any, between the life settlement provider and the issuer of the insurance policy to be settled;

      (b) The name, business address and telephone number of the life settlement provider;

      (c) Any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the life settlement provider and the life settlement purchaser;

      (d) If an insurance policy to be settled has been issued as a joint policy or involves family riders or any coverage of a life other than the insured under the policy to be settled, information about the possible loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy and the need to consult with the owner’s insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy for advice on the proposed life settlement;

      (e) The dollar amount of the current death benefit payable to the life settlement provider under the policy or certificate. If known, disclosure of the availability of any additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar amount of any accidental death and dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate and the extent to which the owner’s interest in those benefits will be transferred as a result of the life settlement contract;

      (f) If the funds will be escrowed with an independent third party during the transfer process, the name, business address and telephone number of the independent third party escrow agent, and the fact that the owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents;

      (g) The name, business address and telephone number of the life settlement broker;

      (h) A full, complete and accurate description of all offers, counter-offers, acceptances and rejections relating to the proposed life settlement contract;

      (i) A written disclosure of any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the life settlement broker and any person making an offer in connection with the proposed life settlement contracts;

      (j) The amount and method of calculating the broker’s compensation. Compensation includes anything of value paid or given to a life settlement broker for the placement of a policy; and

      (k) When any portion of the life settlement broker’s compensation, as described in paragraph (j) of this subsection, is taken from a proposed life settlement offer, disclosure of the total amount of the life settlement offer and the percentage of the life settlement offer comprised by the life settlement broker’s compensation.

      (4) If the life settlement provider transfers ownership or changes the beneficiary of the insurance policy, the provider shall communicate in writing the change in ownership or beneficiary to the insured within 20 days after the change.

      (5) A life settlement provider or its life settlement investment agent shall provide the life settlement purchaser with at least the following disclosures prior to the date the life settlement purchase agreement is signed by all parties. The disclosures must be conspicuously displayed in any life purchase contract or in a separate document signed by the life settlement purchaser and life settlement provider or life settlement investment agent, and must make the following disclosures to the life settlement purchaser:

      (a) The purchaser shall receive no returns, such as dividends and interest, until the insured dies and a death claim payment is made.

      (b) The actual annual rate of return on a life settlement contract is dependent upon an accurate projection of the insured’s life expectancy and the actual date of the insured’s death. An annual guaranteed rate of return is not determinable.

      (c) The settled life insurance contract should not be considered a liquid purchase since it is impossible to predict the exact timing of its maturity and the funds probably are not available until the death of the insured. There is no established secondary market for resale of these products by the purchaser.

      (d) The purchaser may lose all benefits or may receive substantially reduced benefits if the insurer goes out of business during the term of the life investment.

      (e) The purchaser is responsible for payment of the insurance premium or other costs related to the policy, if required by the terms of the life purchase agreement. These payments may reduce the purchaser’s return. If a party other than the purchaser is responsible for the payment, the name and address of that party also shall be disclosed.

      (f)(A) The purchaser is responsible for payment of the insurance premiums or other costs related to the policy.

      (j)(A) Group policies may contain limitations or caps in the conversion rights, and additional premiums may have to be paid if the policy is converted.

      (B) The name of the party responsible for the payment of the additional premiums.

      (C) If a group policy is terminated and replaced by another group policy, there may be no right to convert the original coverage.

      (k) The risks associated with policy contestability, including but not limited to the risk that the purchaser will have no claim or only a partial claim to death benefits should the insurer rescind the policy within the contestability period.

      (L) Whether the purchaser will be the owner of the policy in addition to being the beneficiary and if the purchaser is the beneficiary only and not also the owner, the special risks associated with that status, including but not limited to the risk that the beneficiary may be changed or the premium may not be paid.

      (m) The experience and qualifications of the person who determines the life expectancy of the insured, the information this projection is based on and the relationship of the projection maker to the life settlement provider, if any.

      (6) Disclosure to a life settlement purchaser shall include distribution of a brochure describing the process of investment in life settlements, in a form to be developed and approved by the director.

      (7) A life settlement provider or its life settlement investment agent shall provide the life settlement purchaser with at least the following disclosures no later than at the time of the assignment, transfer or sale of all or a portion of an insurance policy. The disclosures must be contained in a document signed by the life settlement purchaser and life settlement provider or life settlement investment agent, and must make the following disclosures to the life settlement purchaser:

      (c) Whether or not premium payments or other costs related to the policy have been waived. If waived, whether or not the investor is responsible for payment of the premiums if the insurer that wrote the policy terminates the waiver after purchase, and the amount of those premiums.

      (d) The type of policy offered or sold, such as whole life, term life, universal life or a group policy certificate, any additional benefits contained in the policy and the current status of the policy.

      (e) If the policy is term insurance, the special risks associated with term insurance, including but not limited to the purchaser’s responsibility for additional premiums if the owner continues the term policy at the end of the current term.

      (f) If the policy is contestable.

      (g) If the insurer that wrote the policy has any additional rights that could negatively affect or extinguish the purchaser’s rights under the life settlement contract, what these rights are and under what conditions these rights are activated.

      (h) The name and address of the person responsible for monitoring the insured’s condition. A description of how often the monitoring of the insured’s condition is done, how the date of death is determined and how and when this information is transmitted to the purchaser.

      (8) The life settlement purchase agreement is voidable by the purchaser at any time within three days after the disclosures mandated by subsection (7) of this section are received by the purchaser. [2009 c.711 §11]

      744.364 Life settlement contract requirements. (1)(a) A life settlement provider entering into a life settlement contract shall first obtain:

      (A) If the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed physician, a naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685, a physician assistant licensed under ORS 677.505 to 677.525 or a nurse practitioner licensed under ORS 678.375 to 678.390 that the owner is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a life settlement contract; and

The notice must be accompanied by the documents required by paragraph (c) of this subsection.

      (c) The life settlement provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection, a copy of the owner’s application for the life settlement contract, the notice required under paragraph (b) of this subsection and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life policy that is the subject of the life transaction.

      (d) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a life settlement provider or life settlement broker within 30 calendar days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. The insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on a form approved by the director. The insurer shall accept an original or facsimile or electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the owner. Failure by the insurer to meet its obligations under this subsection is a violation of the Insurance Code.

      (e) Prior to or at the time of execution of the life settlement contract, the life settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the life settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the life settlement contract, that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that the owner is entering into the life settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal illness or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal illness or chronic illness and that the terminal illness or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.

      (f) If a life settlement broker performs any of the activities required of the life settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section that were performed by the broker.

      (2) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee is privileged and confidential under ORS 705.137.

      (3)(a) All life settlement contracts entered into in this state must provide the owner with an absolute right to rescind the contract before the earlier of 60 calendar days after the date upon which the life settlement contract is executed by all parties or 30 calendar days after the life settlement proceeds have been sent to the owner under subsection (5) of this section.

      (b) The life settlement provider may condition rescission upon the owner both giving notice and repaying to the life settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the life settlement provider in connection with or as a consequence of the life settlement.

      (c) If the insured dies during the rescission period, the life settlement contract is deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment within 60 calendar days of the death of the insured to the life settlement provider or purchaser of all life settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest that have been paid by the life settlement provider or purchaser.

      (d) In the event of any rescission, if the life settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a life settlement broker in connection with the rescinded transaction, the life settlement broker shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the life settlement provider within five business days following receipt of written demand from the life settlement provider. The demand must be accompanied by either the owner’s notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the owner, or the notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the applicable rescission period.

      (b) Within three business days after the date the escrow agent receives the document, or from the date the life settlement provider receives the documents, if the owner erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider, the provider shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the life settlement into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

      (c) Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary forms to the life settlement provider or related provider trust or other designated representative of the life settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent’s receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the owner.

      (6) Failure to pay the owner the full contract amount for the life settlement contract within the time set forth under subsection (5) of this section renders the life settlement contract voidable by the owner until the time full payment is tendered to and accepted by the owner.

      (F) A final order, judgment or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the owner, adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner’s assets; or

      (c) The owner enters into a life settlement contract more than two years after the date of issuance of a policy and, with respect to the policy, at all times prior to the date that is two years after policy issuance, the following conditions are met:

      (4) An insurer may not, as a condition of responding to a request for verification of coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant to a life settlement contract, require that the owner, insured, life settlement provider or life settlement broker sign any forms, disclosures, consent or waiver form that has not been expressly approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services for use in connection with life settlement contracts in this state.

      (5) Upon receipt of a properly completed request for a change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer shall respond in writing within 30 calendar days with written acknowledgement confirming that the change has been effected or specifying the reasons why the requested change cannot be processed. The insurer may not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary and may not otherwise seek to interfere with any life settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state.

For the purposes of this subsection, “recklessly” means engaging in conduct in conscious and clearly unjustifiable disregard of a substantial likelihood of the existence of the relevant facts or risks, such disregard involving a gross deviation from acceptable standards of conduct.

      744.372 Advertising of life settlement contracts; rules. (1) This section applies to any advertising of life settlement contracts, life purchase agreements or related products or services intended for dissemination in this state, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state. When disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section is interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.

      (2) Every licensee must establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, form and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products and services. All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed or presented, is the responsibility of the licensees, as well as the individual who created or presented the advertisement. A system of control must include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the licensee who disseminate advertisements, of the requirements of this section and the requirements adopted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services in the use of any advertisements not furnished by the licensee.

      (3) Advertisements must be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement must be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It may not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive.

      (4) An advertisement may not use the name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the named company or policy-holder consents to the usage in a form prescribed by the director.

      (5) An advertisement may not represent that premium payments will not be required to be paid on the life insurance policy that is the subject of a life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement in order to maintain that policy, unless that is the fact.

      (6) An advertisement may not state or imply that a life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement, benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled or managed by the licensee, or receives any payment or other consideration from the licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact must be disclosed in the advertisement.

      (7) When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement, all pertinent information must be retained for a period of five years after its use.

      (8) An advertisement may not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement must be identified.

      (9) An advertisement may not directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of this state or of the United States government endorses, approves or favors:

      (a) Any licensee or its business practices or methods of operation;

      (b) The merits, desirability or advisability of any life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement;

      (c) Any life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement; or

      (d) Any life insurance policy or life insurance company.

      (10) The director may adopt rules to implement this section. [2009 c.711 §16]

 

      744.374 Enforcement of life settlement contract provisions; reporting of violations; required antifraud initiatives. (1) A person may not knowingly or intentionally interfere with the enforcement of the provisions of ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992 or investigations of suspected or actual violations of ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992.

      (2) A person in the business of life settlements may not knowingly or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust to participate in the business of life settlements.

      (3) Life settlements contracts and purchase agreement forms and applications for life settlements, regardless of the form of transmission, must contain the following statement or a substantially similar statement: “Any person who knowingly presents false information in this application is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison.”

      (4) The lack of a statement as required in subsection (3) of this section does not constitute a defense in any investigation or prosecution for an act violating any provision of ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992.

      (5) Any person engaged in the business of life settlements having knowledge or a reasonable suspicion that a fraudulent life settlement act is being, will be or has been committed must provide to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services information as required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the director.

      (6) Any other person having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent life settlement act is being, will be or has been committed may provide to the director the information required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the director.

      (7)(a) No civil liability is imposed on and no cause of action arises from a person’s furnishing information concerning suspected, anticipated or completed fraudulent life settlement acts or suspected or completed fraudulent insurance acts, if the information is provided to or received from:

      (B) Federal, state or local law enforcement or regulatory officials or their employees, agents or representatives;

      (E) The life insurer that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured.

      (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply to statements made with actual malice. In an action brought against a person for filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a fraudulent life settlement act, the party bringing the action must plead specifically any allegation that paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply because the person filing the report or furnishing the information did so with actual malice.

      (c) A person furnishing information as identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992 and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this paragraph, a proceeding is “substantially justified” if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it was initiated. However, such an award does not apply to a person furnishing information concerning the person’s own fraudulent life settlement acts.

      (d) This section does not abrogate or modify common law or statutory privileges or immunities enjoyed by a person described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (8) The documents and evidence obtained by the director in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent life settlement acts are privileged and confidential under ORS 705.137.

      (9) This section does not:

      (a) Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of other law enforcement or regulatory agencies to investigate, examine and prosecute suspected violations of law;

      (b) Prevent or prohibit a person from disclosing voluntarily information concerning life settlement fraud to a law enforcement or regulatory agency other than the Department of Consumer and Business Services; or

      (c) Limit the powers granted elsewhere by the laws of this state to the director or any other state department or agency to investigate and examine possible violations of law and to take appropriate action against wrongdoers.

      (10)(a) Life settlement providers and life settlement brokers must have in place antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, prosecute and prevent fraudulent life settlement acts. At the discretion of the director, the director may order, or a licensee may request and the director may grant, such modifications of the required initiatives described in paragraph (b) of this subsection as necessary to ensure an effective antifraud program. The modifications may be more or less restrictive than the required initiatives as long as the modifications may reasonably be expected to accomplish the purpose of this section.

      (b) Antifraud initiatives must include:

      (A) Fraud investigators, who may be life settlement provider or life settlement broker employees or independent contractors; and

      (B) An antifraud plan, which must be submitted to the director. The antifraud plan must include, but is not limited to:

      (i) A description of the procedures for detecting and investigating possible fraudulent life settlement acts and procedures for resolving material inconsistencies between medical records and insurance applications;

      (ii) A description of the procedures for reporting possible fraudulent life settlement acts to the director;

      (iii) A description of the plan for antifraud education and training of underwriters and other personnel; and

      (iv) A description or chart outlining the organizational arrangement of the antifraud personnel who are responsible for investigating and reporting possible fraudulent life settlement acts and investigating unresolved material inconsistencies between medical records and insurance applications.

      (c) Antifraud plans submitted to the director are privileged and confidential under ORS 705.137. [2009 c.711 §17]

      744.382 Prohibitions on finder’s fee, solicitations, discrimination. (1) A licensee may not pay or offer to pay a finder’s fee, commission or other compensation to a person described in this subsection, in connection with a policy insuring the life of an individual with a terminal illness or condition. The prohibition under this subsection applies with respect to payments or offers of payment to:

      (a) The physician, naturopathic physician, attorney or accountant of the policyholder, of the certificate holder or of the insured individual when the individual is other than the policyholder or certificate holder.

      (b) Any person other than a physician, naturopathic physician, attorney or accountant described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, who provides medical, legal or financial planning services to the policyholder, to the certificate holder or to the insured individual when the individual is other than the policyholder or certificate holder.

      (c) Any person other than one described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection who acts as an agent of the policyholder, certificate holder or insured individual.

      (2) A licensee may not solicit an investor who could influence the treatment of the illness or condition of the individual whose life would be the subject of a life settlement contract.

      (3) All information solicited or obtained from a policyholder or certificate holder by a licensee is subject to ORS 746.600 to 746.690. For purposes of this subsection, a licensee is considered an insurance-support organization within the meaning of ORS 746.600.

      (4) A licensee may not discriminate in the making of a life settlement contract on the basis of race, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age, familial status or occupation or discriminate between persons who have dependents and persons who do not have dependents.

      744.384 Rules; standards. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may adopt rules for the purpose of carrying out ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992. In addition:

      (1) The director may establish standards for evaluating reasonableness of payments under life settlement contracts for persons who are terminally ill or chronically ill. The authority includes but is not limited to regulation of discount rates used to determine the amount paid in exchange for assignment, transfer, sale, devise or bequest of a benefit under a life insurance policy insuring the life of a person who is terminally ill or chronically ill. For the purpose of the standards, the director shall consider payments made in regional and national life settlement markets, to the extent such information is available, as well as model standards developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

      (2) The director may establish trade practice standards by rule for the purpose of regulating advertising and solicitation of life settlement contracts.

      (3) The director may adopt rules governing the relationship and responsibilities of both insurers and life settlement providers, life settlement brokers and life settlement investment agents during the settlement of a life insurance policy or certificate.

      744.505 Adjuster license required. (1) Except as provided in ORS 744.515, a person shall not act or attempt to act as an adjuster of losses claimed under insurance policies, whether acting for the insurer or the insured, unless the person holds a valid license issued by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services that authorizes the person to act as an adjuster.
