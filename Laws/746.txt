      (1) In the case of life insurance policies, paying bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance, provided that any such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to policyholders and for the best interests of the insurer and its policyholders;

      (2) In the case of industrial life insurance policies, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the insurer, in an amount which fairly represents the saving in collection expense;

      (3) Readjustment of the rate of premium for a group life or health insurance policy based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first or any subsequent policy year, which may be made retroactive only for such policy year;

      (5) Practices authorized pursuant to ORS 733.220 and 733.230;

      (6) The issuing of life or health insurance policies on a salary savings, bank draft, preauthorized check or payroll deduction plan or similar plan at a reduced rate reasonably related to the savings made by use of such plan; or

      (7) The issuing of life or health insurance policies at rates less than the usual premium rates for such policies, or using modifications of premium rates based on amount of insurance, if such issuance or modification does not result in reduction in premium rates in excess of savings in administration and issuance expenses reasonably attributable to such policies. [Formerly 736.825; 1983 c.740 §254; 2003 c.364 §133]

      (2) Discrimination by an insurer in the application of its underwriting standards or rates based solely on an individual’s physical disability is prohibited, unless such action is based on sound actuarial principles or is related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience. For purposes of this subsection, “physical disability” shall include, but not be limited to, blindness, deafness, hearing or speaking impairment or loss, or partial loss, of function of one or more of the upper or lower extremities.

      (3) Discrimination by an insurer in the application of its underwriting standards or rates based solely upon an insured’s or applicant’s attaining or exceeding 65 years of age is prohibited, unless such discrimination is clearly based on sound actuarial principles or is related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience.

      (4)(a) An insurer may not, on the basis of the status of an insured or prospective insured as a victim of domestic violence or sexual violence, do any of the following:

      (A) Deny, cancel or refuse to issue or renew an insurance policy;

      (B) Demand or require a greater premium or payment;

      (C) Designate domestic violence or sexual violence, physical or mental injuries sustained as a result of domestic violence or sexual violence or treatment received for such injuries as a condition for which coverage will be denied or reduced;

      (D) Exclude or limit coverage for losses or deny a claim; or

      (E) Fix any lower rate for or discriminate in the fees or commissions of an insurance producer for writing or renewing a policy.

      (b) The fact that an insured or prospective insured is or has been a victim of domestic violence or sexual violence shall not be considered a permitted underwriting or rating criterion.

      (c) Nothing in this subsection prohibits an insurer from taking an action described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the action is otherwise permissible by law and is taken in the same manner and to the same extent with respect to all insureds and prospective insureds without regard to whether the insured or prospective insured is a victim of domestic violence or sexual violence.

      (d) An insurer that complies in good faith with the requirements of this subsection shall not be subject to civil liability due to such compliance.

      (e) For purposes of this subsection, “domestic violence” means the occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:

      (5) If the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services has reason to believe that an insurer in the application of its underwriting standards or rates is not complying with the requirements of this section, the director shall, unless the director has reason to believe the noncompliance is willful, give notice in writing to the insurer stating in what manner such noncompliance is alleged to exist and specifying a reasonable time, not less than 10 days after the date of mailing, in which the noncompliance may be corrected.

      (6)(a) If the director has reason to believe that noncompliance by an insurer with the requirements of this section is willful, or if, within the period prescribed by the director in the notice required by subsection (5) of this section, the insurer does not make the changes necessary to correct the noncompliance specified by the director or establish to the satisfaction of the director that such specified noncompliance does not exist, the director may hold a hearing in connection therewith. Not less than 10 days before the date of such hearing the director shall mail to the insurer written notice of the hearing, specifying the matters to be considered.

      (b) If, after the hearing, the director finds that the insurer’s application of its underwriting standards or rates violates the requirements of this section, the director may issue an order specifying in what respects such violation exists and stating when, within a reasonable period of time, further such application shall be prohibited. If the director finds that the violation was willful, the director may suspend or revoke the certificate of authority of the insurer.

      (7) Affiliated workers’ compensation insurers having reinsurance agreements which result in one carrier ceding 80 percent or more of its workers’ compensation premium to the other, while utilizing different workers’ compensation rate levels without objective evidence to support such differences, shall be presumed to be engaging in unfair discrimination.

(1) In cities of 300,000 or more, and except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, no insurer shall make or permit any unfair discrimination between risks of essentially the same degree of hazard in the issuance of burglary and theft or robbery insurance policies or casualty insurance policies which insure against liability to persons arising out of the use or control of real or personal property other than motor vehicles.

      (2) Property insured or persons insured against liability arising out of use or control of real or personal property other than motor vehicles, if comparable in other respects in exposures to the peril insured against, shall not be deemed to be of different hazard solely because of the geographic location of the property or the place of residence or business of the person to be insured.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section an insurer may make or permit discrimination between risks of essentially the same degree of hazard in the issuance of insurance policies described in subsection (1) of this section if the insurer, at the time of the discrimination, insures a percentage of the similar risks at least equal to the ratio that its premiums for the respective line of business as reported in the annual statement required by ORS 731.574 for the second preceding calendar year bears to the total premium for the same line of business as reported by all insurers in the annual statements required by ORS 731.574 for the second preceding calendar year, within a square one mile on each side centered upon the location of the property, insurance in regard to which the insurer declines to issue.

      (2) Decline to provide coverage or limit coverage; or

(1) Notwithstanding ORS 737.600, but subject to all other rate filing requirements of ORS chapter 737, an insurer may combine for dividend purposes the experience of a group of employers covered for workers’ compensation insurance by the insurer, subject to applicable rules adopted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, if:

      (a) All the employers in the group are members of an organization.

      (b) The employers in the group constitute at least 50 percent of the employers in the organization, unless the number of covered workers in the group exceeds 500, in which case the employers in the group must constitute at least 25 percent of the employers in the organization.

      (c) The grouping of employers is likely to substantially improve accident prevention, claims handling for the employers and reduce expenses.

      (2) This section does not apply to an organization of employers for which organization a workers’ compensation policy was lawfully issued before October 4, 1977. The policy required by ORS 656.419 shall contain for each employer covered thereby the information required by ORS 656.419 (2).

      (2) The director shall make reasonable rules regarding such dividend groupings as an aid to the effectuation and enforcement of the Insurance Code. Such rules shall have as their purpose the prevention of misrepresentation, unfair discrimination and other unfair trade practices, and may among other things require that:

      (a) Such a grouping comprises substantially homogeneous risks.

      (b) The organization under the auspices of which such a grouping is made has been in existence for at least two years and was formed for purposes other than that of obtaining insurance.

      (c) A substantial improvement in loss prevention or claims handling will be a likely result of such a grouping.

      (d) Information regarding eligibility for participation in the grouping and the system for allocation of dividends among the participants be filed with the director.

      (3) An insurer shall not unfairly discriminate in the allocation of dividends among the participants in such a dividend grouping.

      (4) The system for allocation of dividends among the participants may provide for allocation at a fixed percentage of premiums, or may provide for variations in the percentage of premiums paid as dividends, or may provide for other variations in determining the amounts of dividends allocated to participants. The variations may be based on loss or expense factors or on other reasonable considerations, such as risk size, risk location or industry or trade hazard classification, that have a probable effect on losses or expenses.

      (5) Failure to apply in a consistent manner the dividend allocation system specified in an insurer’s dividend declaration shall be prima facie evidence of unfair discrimination. [1977 c.405 §4; 1983 c.706 §4; 1999 c.59 §230]

 

      746.155 Applicability of ORS 746.145 and 746.150. ORS 746.145 and 746.150 do not apply to groupings or combinations of persons or risks by way of common ownership or common use and control as permitted under ORS 737.600. [1977 c.405 §2]

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, no person, either within or outside of this state, directly or indirectly, shall enter into any contract, understanding or combination with any insurer or manager, agent or representative thereof for the purpose of, nor shall any such persons or insurers, jointly or severally do any act or engage in any practice for the purpose of:

      (1) Controlling the rates to be charged, or the commissions or other compensations to be paid, for insuring any risk or class of risks in this state;

      (2) Discriminating against or differentiating from any insurer, manager or agent, by reason of the plan or method of transacting business or the affiliation or nonaffiliation with any board or association of insurers, managers, agents or representatives; or

      (3) Doing anything which is detrimental to free competition in the business or injurious to the insuring public. [Formerly 736.615]

      (a) Solicit the sale of insurance for the protection of real or personal property after a person indicates interest in securing a loan or credit extension, until the depository institution has agreed to make the loan or credit extension;

      (b) Refuse to accept a written binder issued by an insurance producer as proof that temporary insurance exists covering the real or personal property that is the subject matter of, or security for, a loan or extension of credit, and that a policy of insurance will be issued covering that property. A written binder issued by an insurance producer or insurer covering real or personal property that is the subject matter of, or security for, a loan or extension of credit shall be effective until a policy of insurance is issued in lieu thereof, including within its terms the identical insurance bound under the binder and the premium therefor, or until notice of the cancellation of the binder is received by the borrower and the depository institution extending credit or offering the loan. When a depository institution closes on a binder under ORS 742.043, the insurance producer or insurer issuing the binder shall be bound to provide a policy of insurance, equivalent in coverage to the coverage set forth in the binder, within 60 days from the date of the binder. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply when prohibited by federal or state statute or regulations; or

      (c) Use or disclose to any other insurance producer, other than the original insurance producer, the information relating to a policy of insurance furnished by a borrower unless the original insurance producer fails to deliver a policy of insurance within 60 days prior to expiration to the depository institution without first procuring the written consent of the borrower.

      (2) As used in this section, “depository institution” means a financial institution as that term is defined in ORS 706.008. [1977 c.742 §4; 1987 c.916 §10; 2003 c.363 §12; 2003 c.364 §144a]

 

      746.200 [Formerly 736.735; repealed by 1977 c.742 §9]

 

      746.201 Depository institution to obtain required property insurance when borrower does not; notice required. (1) In a contract or loan agreement, or in a separate document accompanying the contract or loan agreement and signed by the mortgagor, borrower or purchaser, that provides for a loan or other financing secured by the mortgagor’s, borrower’s or purchaser’s real or personal property and that authorizes the secured party to place insurance on the property when the mortgagor, borrower or purchaser fails to maintain the insurance as required by the contract or loan agreement or the separate document, a warning in substantially the following form shall be set forth in 10-point type:

______________________________________________________________________________

WARNING

      Unless you provide us with evidence of the insurance coverage as required by our contract or loan agreement, we may purchase insurance at your expense to protect our interest. This insurance may, but need not, also protect your interest. If the collateral becomes damaged, the coverage we purchase may not pay any claim you make or any claim made against you. You may later cancel this coverage by providing evidence that you have obtained property coverage elsewhere.

      You are responsible for the cost of any insurance purchased by us. The cost of this insurance may be added to your contract or loan balance. If the cost is added to your contract or loan balance, the interest rate on the underlying contract or loan will apply to this added amount. The effective date of coverage may be the date your prior coverage lapsed or the date you failed to provide proof of coverage.

      The coverage we purchase may be considerably more expensive than insurance you can obtain on your own and may not satisfy any need for property damage coverage or any mandatory liability insurance requirements imposed by applicable law.

______________________________________________________________________________

      (2) Substantial compliance by a secured party with subsection (1) of this section constitutes a complete defense to any claim arising under the laws of this state challenging the secured party’s placement of insurance on the real or personal property in which the secured party has a security interest, for the protection of the secured party’s interest in the property.

      (3) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require any secured party to place or maintain insurance on real or personal property in which the secured party has a security interest, and the secured party shall not be liable to the mortgagor, borrower or purchaser or to any other party as a result of the failure of the secured party to place or maintain such insurance.

      (4) The failure of a secured party prior to January 1, 1996, to include in a contract or loan agreement, or in a separate document accompanying the contract or loan agreement, the notice set forth in subsection (1) of this section shall not be admissible in any court or arbitration proceeding or otherwise used to prove that a secured party’s actions with respect to the placement or maintenance of insurance on real or personal property in which the secured party has a security interest are or were unlawful or otherwise improper. A secured party shall not be liable to the mortgagor, borrower or purchaser or to any other party for placing such insurance in accordance with the terms of an otherwise legal contract or loan agreement with the mortgagor, borrower or purchaser entered into prior to January 1, 1996. [1977 c.742 §5; 1995 c.313 §3; 2003 c.363 §13]

      (1) “Affiliate” means any company that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with another company.

      (2) “Customer” means an individual who purchases, applies to purchase or is solicited to purchase insurance products primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

      (3) “Depository institution” means a financial institution as that term is defined in ORS 706.008. [2003 c.363 §2]

 

      Note: 746.213 to 746.219 were added to and made a part of the Insurance Code by legislative action but were not added to ORS chapter 746 or any series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      746.215 Regulation of depository institutions with regard to insurance sales or solicitations. (1) A depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution that lends money or extends credit may not:

      (a) As a condition precedent to the lending of money or extension of credit, or any renewal thereof, require that the person to whom the money or credit is extended, or whose obligation a creditor is to acquire or finance, negotiate any policy or renewal thereof through a particular insurer or group of insurers or insurance producer or group of insurance producers.

      (b) Reject an insurance policy solely because the policy has been issued or underwritten by a person who is not associated with the depository institution or affiliate when insurance is required in connection with a loan or the extension of credit.

      (c) As a condition for extending credit or offering any product or service that is equivalent to an extension of credit, require that a customer obtain insurance from a depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution, or from a particular insurer or insurance producer. This paragraph does not prohibit a depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution from informing a customer or prospective customer that insurance is required in order to obtain a loan or credit, that loan or credit approval is contingent upon the procurement by the customer of acceptable insurance or that insurance is available from the depository institution or an affiliate of the depository institution.

      (d) Unreasonably reject an insurance policy furnished by the customer or borrower for the protection of the property securing the credit or loan. A rejection is not considered unreasonable if it is based on reasonable standards that are uniformly applied and that relate to the extent of coverage required and to the financial soundness and the services of an insurer. The standards may not discriminate against any particular type of insurer or call for rejection of an insurance policy because the policy contains coverage in addition to that required in the credit transaction.

      (e) Require that any customer, borrower, mortgagor, purchaser, insurer or insurance producer pay a separate charge in connection with the handling of any insurance policy required as security for a loan on real estate, or pay a separate charge to substitute the insurance policy of one insurer for that of another. A charge prohibited in this paragraph does not include the interest that may be charged on premium loans or premium advancements in accordance with the terms of the loan or credit document. This paragraph does not apply to charges that would be required when the depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution is the licensed insurance producer providing the insurance.

      (f) Require any procedures or conditions of an insurer or insurance producer not customarily required of insurers or insurance producers affiliated or in any way connected with the depository institution.

      (g) Use an advertisement or other insurance promotional material that would cause a reasonable person to mistakenly believe that the federal government or the state is responsible for the insurance sales activity of, or stands behind the credit of, the depository institution or its affiliate.

      (h) Use an advertisement or other insurance promotional material that would cause a reasonable person to mistakenly believe that the federal government or the state guarantees any returns on insurance products or is a source of payment on any insurance obligation of or sold by the depository institution or its affiliate.

      (i) Act as an insurance producer unless properly licensed in accordance with ORS 744.062, 744.063 or 744.064.

      (j) Pay or receive any commission, brokerage fee or other compensation as an insurance producer, unless the depository institution or affiliate holds a valid insurance producer license for the applicable class of insurance. However, an unlicensed depository institution or affiliate may make a referral to a licensed insurance producer if the depository institution or affiliate does not negotiate, sell or solicit insurance. In the case of a referral of a customer, however, the unlicensed depository institution or affiliate may be compensated for the referral only if the compensation is a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the customer purchases the insurance product from the licensed insurance producer. Any depository institution or affiliate that accepts deposits from the public in an area in which such transactions are routinely conducted in the depository institution may receive for each customer referral no more than a one-time, nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the referral results in a transaction.

      (k) Solicit or sell insurance, other than credit insurance or flood insurance, unless the solicitation or sale is completed through documents separate from any credit transactions.

      (L) Except as provided in ORS 746.201, include the expense of insurance premiums, other than credit insurance premiums or flood insurance premiums, in the primary credit transaction without the express written consent of the customer.

      (m) Solicit or sell insurance unless the insurance sales activities of the depository institution or affiliate are, to the extent practicable, physically separated from areas where retail deposits are routinely accepted by depository institutions.

      (n) Solicit or sell insurance unless the depository institution or affiliate maintains separate and distinct books and records relating to the insurance transactions, including all files relating to and reflecting consumer complaints.

      (2) A depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution that lends money or extends credit and that solicits insurance primarily for personal, family or household purposes shall disclose to the customer in writing that the insurance related to the credit extension may be purchased from an insurer or insurance producer of the customer’s choice, subject only to the depository institution’s right to reject a given insurer or insurance producer as provided in subsection (1)(d) of this section. The disclosure shall inform the customer that the customer’s choice of insurer or insurance producer will not affect the credit decision or credit terms in any way, except that the depository institution may impose reasonable requirements concerning the creditworthiness of the insurer and the extent of coverage chosen as provided in subsection (1)(d) of this section. [2003 c.363 §3; 2005 c.22 §497]

 

      Note: See note under 746.213.

 

      746.217 Disclosures to customers. (1) A depository institution that sells insurance, and any person that sells insurance on behalf of a depository institution, or on the premises of a depository institution where the depository institution is engaged in the business of taking deposits or making loans, shall disclose to the customer in writing, when practicable and in a clear and conspicuous manner, prior to a sale, that the insurance:

      (a) Is not a deposit;

      (b) Is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other federal government agency;

      (c) Is not guaranteed by the depository institution or an affiliate of the depository institution if applicable, or any person that is selling insurance if applicable; and

      (d) When appropriate, involves investment risk, including the possible loss of value.

      (2) The requirements of subsection (1) of this section apply:

      (a) To an affiliate of a depository institution only to the extent that it sells insurance on the premises of a depository institution where the depository institution is engaged in the business of taking deposits or making loans or on behalf of a depository institution.

      (b) When an individual purchases insurance primarily for personal, family or household purposes and only to the extent that the disclosure would be accurate.

      (3) For the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, a person is selling insurance on behalf of a depository institution, whether on the premises of the depository institution or at another location, if either one of the following applies:

      (a) The person represents to the customer that the sale of the insurance is by or on behalf of the depository institution; or

      (b) The depository institution refers a customer to the person that sells insurance and the depository institution has a contractual arrangement to receive commissions or fees derived from the sale of insurance resulting from the referral. [2003 c.363 §4]

 

      Note: See note under 746.213.

 

      746.219 Investigatory powers. (1) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may examine and investigate the insurance activities of any person that the director believes may be in violation of ORS 746.213, 746.215 or 746.217. Upon request and reasonable notice, a person shall make its insurance books and records available to the director and the director’s staff for inspection. An affected person may submit to the director a complaint or material pertinent to the enforcement of ORS 746.213, 746.215 and 746.217.

      (2) Nothing in ORS 746.213, 746.215 or 746.217 prevents a depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution that lends money or extends credit or other lender or seller from placing insurance on real or personal property in the event the customer, borrower, mortgagor or purchaser fails to provide insurance required under the terms of the loan or credit document.

      (3) ORS 746.213, 746.215 and 746.217 do not apply to credit-related insurance. [2003 c.363 §5]

 

      Note: See note under 746.213.

 

      746.220 Debtor’s option in furnishing credit life or credit health insurance. When credit life insurance or credit health insurance, as defined in ORS 743.371, is required as additional security for any indebtedness, the debtor shall, upon request to the creditor, have the option of furnishing the required amount of insurance through existing policies of insurance owned or controlled by the debtor or of procuring and furnishing the required coverage through any authorized insurer. [Formerly 739.615]

 

      746.222 [1993 c.130 §5; 1999 c.987 §20; repealed by 2013 c.698 §42 and 2013 c.640 §20]

      (a) Misrepresenting facts or policy provisions in settling claims;

      (b) Failing to acknowledge and act promptly upon communications relating to claims;

A licensee may provide the notice within a reasonable time after the date the licensee establishes a customer relationship if:

      (A) Establishing the customer relationship is not at the customer’s election; or

      (B) Providing notice not later than the date that the licensee establishes a customer relationship would substantially delay the customer’s transaction and the customer agrees to receive the notice at a later time.

      (b) To a consumer other than as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, before the licensee discloses any personal information about the consumer pursuant to the requirements of ORS 746.665, unless the disclosure meets one or more of the conditions specified in ORS 746.665.

      (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a licensee shall provide a clear and conspicuous notice to a customer that accurately reflects the licensee’s privacy policies and practices not less than annually during the continuation of the relationship described in subsection (1)(a) of this section. For the purpose of this subsection, a notice is given annually if the notice is given at least once in any period of 12 consecutive months during which the relationship exists. A licensee may define the period of 12 consecutive months, but the licensee must apply the period to the customer on a consistent basis.

      (b) A licensee need not provide the notice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection each year if the licensee provides personal information to an unaffiliated third party only in accordance with ORS 746.665 and does not change the policies and practices related to disclosing personal information about which the licensee last notified customers in accordance with this section. If the licensee changes the licensee’s privacy policies and practices, the licensee shall notify customers in accordance with this section.

      (3) The privacy notice required by subsections (1) and (2) of this section must be in writing and must be clear and conspicuous. The notice may be provided in electronic form if the recipient agrees.

      (i) Any disclosure that the licensee makes under subsection (4) of this section.

      (j) A description of the rights established under ORS 746.640 and 746.645 and the manner in which such rights may be exercised.

When describing the categories of parties to whom disclosure is made, the licensee shall state only that the licensee makes disclosures to other affiliated parties or nonaffiliated third parties, as applicable, as authorized by law.

      (5) In lieu of the notice required in subsection (3) of this section, the licensee may provide to a consumer an abbreviated notice, in writing or in electronic form if the consumer agrees, informing the consumer that:

      (b) Such information as well as other personal or privileged information subsequently collected by the licensee may in certain circumstances be disclosed to third parties without authorization;

      (c) A right of access and correction exists with respect to all personal information collected; and

      (d) The licensee shall provide the notice prescribed in subsection (3) of this section to the consumer upon request.

      (9) A licensee may provide a joint notice from the licensee and one or more of the licensee’s affiliates or other financial institutions, as identified in the notice, as long as the notice is accurate with respect to the licensee and the other institutions. A licensee may also provide a notice on behalf of a financial institution.

      (10) The obligations imposed by this section upon a licensee may be satisfied by another licensee authorized to act on behalf of the first licensee.

      (11) For purposes of this section and ORS 746.630 and 746.665, an individual is not the consumer of a licensee solely because the individual is covered under a group life insurance policy issued by the licensee or is a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan that the licensee administers or sponsors or for which the licensee acts as a trustee, insurer or fiduciary, if:

      (a) The licensee provides to the policyholder the initial, annual and revised notices under this section; and

      (b) The licensee does not disclose to a nonaffiliated third party personal information about the individual other than as permitted by ORS 746.665.

      (12) When an individual becomes a consumer of a licensee under subsection (11) of this section, this section and ORS 746.630 and 746.665 apply to the licensee with respect to the individual. [1981 c.649 §6; 2001 c.377 §26; 2003 c.87 §10; 2003 c.364 §155; 2017 c.365 §1]

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, when an adverse underwriting decision is based in whole or in part on credit history or insurance score, the insurer or insurance producer responsible for the decision must provide the consumer proposed for coverage with the specific reason or reasons for the adverse underwriting decision in writing.

[1981 c.649 §12; 2003 c.87 §15; 2003 c.364 §161; 2003 c.788 §2a; 2005 c.489 §7; 2011 c.500 §42]

 

      746.655 Information concerning previous adverse underwriting decisions. No insurer, insurance producer or insurance-support organization may seek information in connection with an insurance transaction concerning any previous adverse underwriting decision experienced by an individual, or any previous insurance coverage obtained by an individual through a residual market mechanism, unless the inquiry also requests the reasons for any previous adverse underwriting decision or the reasons why insurance coverage was previously obtained through a residual market mechanism. [1981 c.649 §13; 2003 c.364 §162]

 

      746.660 Basing adverse underwriting decision on previous adverse decision. No insurer or insurance producer may base an adverse underwriting decision in whole or in part on:

      (1) The fact of a previous adverse underwriting decision or on the fact that an individual previously obtained insurance coverage through a residual market mechanism. However, an insurer or insurance producer may base an adverse underwriting decision on further information obtained from an insurer or insurance producer responsible for a previous adverse underwriting decision.

      (2) Personal information received from an insurance-support organization whose primary source of information is insurers. However, an insurer or insurance producer may base an adverse underwriting decision on further personal information obtained as the result of information received from such an insurance-support organization. [1981 c.649 §14; 2003 c.364 §163]

 

      746.661 Use of credit history or insurance score. (1) An insurer that issues personal insurance policies in this state:

      (a) May not cancel or nonrenew personal insurance that has been in effect for more than 60 days based in whole or in part on a consumer’s credit history or insurance score.

      (b) May use a consumer’s credit history to decline coverage of personal insurance in the initial underwriting decision only in combination with other substantive underwriting factors. An offer of placement with an affiliate insurer does not constitute a declination of insurance coverage.

      (c) May not use the following types of credit history to decline coverage of personal insurance, calculate an insurance score or determine personal insurance premiums or rates:

      (A) The absence of credit history or the inability to determine the consumer’s credit history, if the insurer has received accurate and complete information from the consumer, unless the insurer does one of the following:

      (i) If the insurer presents information that the absence of credit history or the inability to determine the consumer’s credit history relates to the risk for the insurer, uses the absence of a credit history or inability to determine a consumer’s credit history as allowed by rules adopted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services;

      (ii) Treats the consumer as if the applicant or insured has neutral credit history, as defined by the insurer; or

      (iii) Excludes the use of credit information as a factor and uses only other underwriting criteria.

      (B) Credit inquiries not initiated by the consumer or inquiries requested by the consumer for the consumer’s own credit information.

      (C) Inquiries identified on a consumer’s credit report relating to insurance coverage.

      (D) Multiple lender inquiries identified as being from the home mortgage industry and made within 30 days of one another, unless only one inquiry is considered.

      (E) Multiple lender inquiries identified as being from the automobile lending industry and made within 30 days of one another, unless only one inquiry is considered.

      (F) The consumer’s total available line of credit. However, an insurer may consider the total amount of outstanding debt in relation to the total available line of credit.

      (d) May not rerate an existing policy or rerate a customer based on a customer’s credit history or the credit history component of a customer’s insurance score when the marital status of the customer changes due to death or divorce.

      (2)(a) If an insurer uses the consumer’s credit history or insurance score at any time in the rating of a personal insurance policy, the consumer may request, no more than once per insurer per policy line annually, that the insurer rerate the consumer according to the standards that the insurer would apply if the consumer were initially applying for the same insurance policy.

      (b) The insurer shall rerate the consumer within 30 days after receiving a request from the consumer. After rerating the consumer based upon the request, the insurer may not use credit information from rerating to increase the premium on any personal insurance policy the consumer holds. If the consumer qualifies for a more favorable rating category, the insurer shall reduce the premiums on all the personal insurance policies the consumer holds in the related policy line for which the consumer’s credit history and insurance score would entitle the consumer to lower premiums if the consumer were applying for a new policy. The effective date of any rate change is the date of the consumer’s request.

      (c) If a request to rerate a policy is received within 60 days prior to a renewal date, or if the difference between the current rate and the improved rate is less than $10, the insurer may provide the consumer with the difference between the current rate and the improved rate over the remainder of the current period as a credit upon renewal. If the policy is canceled or not renewed, the insurer shall refund the unearned premium. Any existing claim-related discounts or surcharges shall carry forward for each rerated policy.

      (3) If an insurer uses disputed credit history to determine eligibility for coverage of personal insurance and places a consumer with an affiliate that charges higher premiums or offers less favorable policy terms:

      (a) The insurer shall rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term; and

      (b) The policy, as reissued or rerated, shall provide the premiums and policy terms for which the consumer would have been eligible if accurate credit history had been used to determine eligibility.

      (4) If an insurer charges higher premiums due to disputed credit history, the insurer shall rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term. As rerated, the insurer shall charge the consumer the same premiums the consumer would have been charged if accurate credit history had been used to calculate an insurance score.

      (5) Subsections (3) and (4) of this section apply only if the consumer resolves the credit dispute under the process set forth in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681) and notifies the insurer in writing that the dispute has been resolved.

      (6) Except as provided in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, an insurer may only use rating factors other than credit history or insurance score to rerate the policy at renewal. [2003 c.788 §4; 2005 c.464 §1; 2009 c.422 §1]

 

      746.662 Filing of insurance scoring models. (1) An insurer may not use credit history to determine personal insurance eligibility, premiums or rates for coverage unless the insurer has filed the insurance scoring models used by the insurer with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. An insurance scoring model includes all attributes and factors used in the calculation of an insurance score.

      (2) Insurance scoring models filed with the director under subsection (1) of this section are confidential and not subject to disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478. [2003 c.788 §5]

 

      746.663 Cancellation or nonrenewal of personal insurance policies based on credit history or insurance score. (1) An insurer that issues personal insurance policies in this state may not cancel or nonrenew a policy of personal insurance based in whole or in part on a consumer’s credit history or insurance score.

      (2) If, prior to January 1, 2004, an insurer has assigned a consumer to a less favorable rating category for a policy of personal insurance based in whole or in part on the consumer’s credit history or insurance score, the consumer may request, no more than once annually, that the insurer rerate the consumer according to the standards that the insurer would apply to the consumer if the consumer were initially applying for the same personal insurance on or after January 1, 2004.

      (3) An insurer that receives a request under subsection (2) of this section may not consider that the consumer was assigned to a less favorable rate category when the insurer rerates the consumer.

      (4) If an insurer uses disputed credit history to determine eligibility for coverage of personal insurance and places a consumer with an affiliate that charges higher premiums or offers less favorable policy terms:

      (a) The insurer shall rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term; and

      (b) The policy, as reissued or rerated, shall provide the premiums and policy terms for which the consumer would have been eligible if accurate credit history had been used to determine eligibility.

      (5) If an insurer charges higher premiums due to disputed credit history, the insurer shall rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term. As rerated, the insurer shall charge the consumer the same premiums the consumer would have been charged if accurate credit history had been used to calculate an insurance score.

      (6) Subsections (4) and (5) of this section apply only if the consumer resolves the credit dispute under the process set forth in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681) and notifies the insurer in writing that the dispute has been resolved.

      (7) Except as provided in subsections (2), (4) and (5) of this section, an insurer may only use rating factors other than credit history or insurance score to rerate the policy at renewal. [2003 c.788 §7]

[1981 c.649 §19; 1987 c.490 §57; 2003 c.364 §166]

 

      746.686 Use of prior claim or inquiry in determination to issue or renew homeowner insurance policy; rules. (1) When a consumer applies for a homeowner insurance policy, an insurer may not use:

      (a) A prior claim of the consumer or a claim relating to the property to be insured, when the date of loss of the claim is more than five years preceding the date of application, to determine whether to issue the policy or to determine rates or other terms and conditions of the policy. This paragraph does not apply when the insurer uses claim experience of the consumer or of the property to provide a discount to the consumer.

      (b) The first claim that the consumer made on a homeowner insurance policy within the five-year period immediately preceding the date of application to determine whether to issue the policy.

      (c) A prior claim relating to the property to be insured that occurred prior to purchase of the property by the consumer, when the consumer demonstrates to the insurer’s satisfaction that the risk associated with damage resulting from the accident or occurrence that gave rise to the prior claim has been mitigated, to determine whether to issue the policy or to determine rates or other terms and conditions of the policy. For purposes of this paragraph, a risk is mitigated if the consumer has fully restored the damaged property and has repaired, replaced, restored or eliminated the condition, system or use of the property that was the underlying cause of the loss.

      (2) When renewing a homeowner insurance policy, an insurer may not use:

      (a) A prior claim of the consumer or a claim relating to the property to be insured, when the date of loss of the claim is more than five years before the upcoming renewal date, to determine whether to renew the policy or to determine rates or other terms and conditions of the policy. This paragraph does not apply when the insurer uses claim experience of the consumer or of the property to provide a discount to the consumer at renewal.

      (b) The first claim of the consumer made within the five-year period immediately preceding the upcoming renewal date to determine whether to renew the policy.

      (3) An insurer or insurance producer may not use an inquiry made by any means by the consumer to the insurer or to an insurance producer regarding the terms, conditions or coverage of an insurance policy, including an inquiry about an actual loss or claim filing process, to determine whether to issue or renew a policy or to determine rates or other terms and conditions of a policy if the consumer is not making a claim as part of the inquiry. An insurer or insurance producer may verify whether the consumer is making a claim as part of the inquiry. If the consumer affirms that the inquiry is not a claim, the insurer or insurance producer may rely on the affirmation to rebut a later assertion to the contrary. This subsection does not apply to an inquiry by a consumer relating to the possibility of a third party claim against the consumer. The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may adopt rules establishing procedures to implement this subsection.

      (4) This section does not prohibit an insurer from taking any underwriting or rating action that is:

      (a) Based on the known condition or use of the property;

      (b) Based on fraudulent acts of the consumer; or

      (c) Otherwise allowed by law. [2005 c.489 §4]

 

      746.687 Cancellation of homeowner insurance policy. (1) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, an insurer may cancel a homeowner insurance policy before the expiration of the policy only for one or more of the following reasons:

      (a) Nonpayment of premium;

      (b) Fraud or material misrepresentation affecting the policy or in the presentation of a claim under the policy;

      (c) Violation of any of the terms and conditions of the policy;

      (d) Substantial increase in the risk of loss after insurance coverage has been issued or renewed, including but not limited to an increase in exposure due to rules, legislation or court decision; or

      (e) Determination by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services that the continuation of a line of insurance or class of business to which the policy belongs will jeopardize an insurer’s solvency or place the insurer in violation of the insurance laws of Oregon or any other state, whether because of a loss or decrease in reinsurance covering the risk or other reason determined by the director.

      (2) The insurer shall give the policyholder written notice of the cancellation, including the effective date of the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation.

      (3) The insurer must mail or deliver a notice of cancellation to the policyholder at the address shown in the policy:

      (a) At least 10 days prior to the effective date of cancellation, if the cancellation is for the reason described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section.

      (b) At least 30 days prior to the effective date of cancellation, if the cancellation is for the reason described in subsection (1)(c), (d) or (e) of this section.

      (4) An insurer shall mail or deliver to a policyholder, at the address shown in the policy, a notice of renewal or nonrenewal of a homeowner insurance policy at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the policy period. This subsection does not apply when the policy is in lapse status under the terms of the policy.

      (5) Proof of mailing notice of cancellation or nonrenewal to the policyholder at the address shown in the policy is sufficient proof of notice under this section.

      (6) This section does not apply to a homeowner insurance policy that has been in effect fewer than 60 days at the time the notice of cancellation is mailed or delivered by the insurer unless it is a renewal policy. An insurer may not use the fact that a claim was filed on the policy within the 60-day period as a basis for canceling the policy within the 60-day period, for increasing the premium rate or for altering the terms of the policy during the current policy term. An insurer may, within the 60-day period, use any other information consistent with the insurer’s rating or underwriting program, including but not limited to, conditions or uses of the property discovered by the insurer, as a basis for cancellation or for offering to continue coverage at an increased rate or on different terms. At renewal of the policy, the insurer may treat a claim that occurred within the 60-day period the same as any other claim occurring during the policy period for the purposes of rating, nonrenewing and altering the terms of the policy. [2005 c.489 §5]

 

      746.688 Use of loss history reports; notice to consumer. (1) An insurer or insurance producer shall notify a consumer that the insurer or insurance producer will request a loss history report relating to the consumer or property to be insured before the insurer or insurance producer may obtain the report. The notice may be oral, in writing or in the same medium as the medium in which previous communication between the consumer and the insurer or insurance producer has been conducted.

      (2) An insurance producer may provide a single notice under subsection (1) of this section to a consumer if the insurance producer makes loss history inquiries of one or more insurers in response to a request by the consumer relating to a homeowner insurance policy.

      (3) An insurer that uses loss history reports for underwriting or rating homeowner insurance shall instruct the insurer’s insurance producers that an insurance producer must notify the consumer that the insurance producer has requested a loss history report before the insurance producer may obtain the report.

      (4) An insurer that uses a loss history report of a consumer when considering an application for a homeowner insurance policy shall notify the consumer during the application process that the consumer may request a free copy of the loss history report from the consumer reporting agency and a written statement describing the insurer’s use of the report. The notice to the applicant may be in writing or in the same medium as the medium in which the application is made. The written statement must contain the following explanations:

      (a) The ways in which the insurer uses loss history reports;

      (b) How often the insurer reviews a consumer’s loss history report; and

      (c) The procedures a consumer may use to obtain additional information. [2005 c.489 §6]

 

      746.690 Obtaining information under false pretenses prohibited. No person shall knowingly and willfully obtain information about an individual from an insurer, insurance producer or insurance-support organization under false pretenses. [1981 c.649 §20; 2003 c.364 §167]

 

      746.990 [Repealed by 1967 c.359 §704]
