      748.130 Principal office; publications; annual statement synopsis; complaints. (1) The principal office of any domestic society shall be located in this state. The meetings of its supreme governing body may be held in any state, district, province or territory in which the society has at least one lodge or in any other location as determined by the supreme governing body, and all business transacted at the meetings shall be as valid in all respects as if the meetings were held in this state.

      (c) The names and residences of the incorporators and the names, residences and official titles of all the officers, trustees, directors or other persons who are to have and exercise the general control of the management of the affairs and funds of the society until their successors are elected by the supreme governing body; and

The bond with sureties approved by the director shall be in an amount, not less than $300,000 nor more than $1,500,000 as required by the director. All documents filed are to be in English.

      (3) No preliminary certificate of authority granted under the provisions of this section shall be valid after one year from its date or after any further period, not exceeding one year, as may be authorized by the director upon cause shown, unless the 500 applicants required have been secured and the organization has been completed as provided in this chapter. The articles of incorporation and all other proceedings thereunder shall become null and void in one year from the date of the preliminary certificate of authority, or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society has completed its organization and received a certificate of authority to do business as provided in this chapter.

      (4) Upon receipt of a preliminary certificate of authority from the director, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its tables of rates and shall issue to each applicant a receipt for the amount collected. No society shall incur any liability other than for the return of the advance premium, nor issue any certificate, nor pay, allow or offer or promise to pay or allow, any benefit to any person until:

      (a) Actual bona fide applications for benefits have been secured on not less than 500 applicants, and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society;

      (b) At least 10 lodges have been established into which the 500 applicants have been admitted;

The advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization and if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one year, as provided in this chapter, the premiums shall be returned to the applicants.

      (5) The director may make any examination and require any further information that the director deems advisable. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the society has complied with all the provisions of law, the director shall issue to the society a certificate of authority to that effect and that the society is authorized to transact business pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The certificate of authority shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of the society at the date of the certificate. The director shall cause a record of the certificate of authority to be made. A certified copy of the record may be given in evidence with like effect as the original certificate of authority.

      748.136 Officers, governors, directors; exemption from liability; indemnification; insurance. (1) The officers and members of the supreme governing body or any subordinate body of a society shall not be personally liable for any benefits provided by a society.

      (2) Any person may be indemnified and reimbursed by any society for expenses reasonably incurred by, and liabilities imposed upon, the person in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, or threat of any action, suit or proceeding, in which the person may be involved by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the society or of any firm, corporation or organization which the person served in any capacity at the request of the society. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a person shall not be indemnified or reimbursed:

      (a) In relation to any matter in such action, suit or proceeding as to which the person shall finally be adjudged guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee or agent of the society; or

      (b) In relation to any matter in such action, suit or proceeding, or threat of such action, suit or proceeding, which has been made the subject of a compromise settlement.

      (3) A person described in subsection (2) of this section may be indemnified if:

      (a) The person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society; and

      (b) In a criminal action or proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct of the person was unlawful.

      (4) The determination whether the conduct of the person met the standard required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement in relation to any matter described in subsection (2) of this section may be made only by the supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of no contest, as to the person shall not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement. The right of indemnification and reimbursement described in this section shall not be exclusive of other rights to which the person may be entitled as a matter of law and shall inure to the benefit of the person’s heirs, executors and administrators.

      (5) A society shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the society, or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other firm, corporation or organization against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such capacity or arising out of the person’s status as such, whether or not the society would have the power to indemnify the person against liability under this section. [1987 c.490 §10]

 

      748.139 Waiver of provisions by subordinate body. The laws of the society may provide that no subordinate body, nor any of its subordinate officers or members shall have the power or authority to waive any of the provisions of the laws of the society. This provision shall be binding on the society and every member and beneficiary of a member. [1987 c.490 §11]

 

      748.140 [Formerly 740.100; repealed by 1987 c.490 §58]

 

      748.142 Amendment of society laws. (1) A domestic society may amend its laws in accordance with the provisions thereof by action of its supreme governing body at any regular or special meeting thereof or, if its laws so provide, by referendum. The referendum may be held in accordance with the provisions of its laws by the vote of the voting members of the society, by the vote of delegates or representatives of voting members or by the vote of local lodges. A society may provide for voting by mail. No amendment submitted for adoption by referendum shall be adopted unless, within six months from the date of submission, a majority of the members voting have signified their consent to the amendment by one of the methods specified in this chapter.

      (2) No amendment to the laws of any domestic society shall take effect unless approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The director shall approve the amendment if the director finds that it has been duly adopted and is not inconsistent with any requirement of the laws of this state or with the character, objects and purposes of the society. Unless the director shall disapprove any such amendment within 60 days after the filing, the amendment shall be considered approved. The approval or disapproval of the director shall be in writing and mailed to the secretary or corresponding officer of the society at its principal office. In case the director disapproves the amendment, the reasons shall be stated in the written notice.

      (3) Within 90 days from the approval by the director, all such amendments, or a synopsis thereof, shall be furnished to all members of the society either by mail or by publication in full in the official publication of the society. The affidavit of any officer of the society or of anyone authorized by it to mail any amendments, or synopses thereof, stating facts which show that the amendments have been duly addressed and mailed, shall be prima facie evidence that the amendments, or synopsis thereof, have been furnished to the addressee.

      (4) Every foreign or alien society authorized to do business in this state shall file with the director a duly certified copy of all amendments of, or additions to, its laws within 90 days after the enactment of the amendments.

      (5) Printed copies of the laws as amended, certified by the secretary or corresponding officer of the society, shall be prima facie evidence of the legal adoption thereof. [1987 c.490 §12]

 

      748.144 Creation and operation of other organizations and entities. (1) A society may create, maintain and operate, or may establish organizations to operate, not-for-profit institutions to further the purposes permitted by ORS 748.121 (2)(b). Such institutions may furnish services free or at a reasonable charge. Any real or personal property owned, held or leased by the society for this purpose shall be reported in every annual statement.

      (2) No society shall own or operate funeral homes or undertaking establishments. [1987 c.490 §13]

      (c) A certificate of the officers, duly verified by their respective oaths, that the consolidation or merger has been approved by a two-thirds vote of the supreme governing body of each society, the vote being conducted at a regular or special meeting of each body, or, if the society’s laws so permit, by mail; and

      (d) Evidence that at least 60 days prior to the action of the supreme governing body of each society, the text of the contract has been furnished to all members of each society either by mail or by publication in full in the official publication of each society.

      (2) If the director finds that the contract is in conformity with the provisions of this section, that the financial statements are correct and that the consolidation or merger is just and equitable to the members of each society, the director shall approve the contract and issue a certificate to that effect. Upon approval, the contract shall be in full force and effect unless any society which is a party to the contract is incorporated under the laws of any other state or territory. In such event the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved as provided by the laws of such state or territory and a certificate of approval filed with the director of this state or, if the laws of such state or territory contain no such provision, then the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved by the director of insurance of such state or territory and a certificate of approval filed with the director of this state.

      (3) Upon the consolidation or merger becoming effective as provided in this chapter, all the rights, franchises and interests of the consolidated or merged societies in and to every species of property, real, personal or mixed, and things in action thereunto belonging shall be vested in the society resulting from or remaining after the consolidation or merger without any other instrument, except that conveyances of real property may be evidenced by proper deeds, and the title to any real estate or interest therein, vested under the laws of this state in any of the societies consolidated or merged, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the consolidation or merger, but shall vest absolutely in the society resulting from or remaining after consolidation or merger.

      (4) The affidavit of any officer of the society or of anyone authorized by it to mail any notice or document, stating that the notice or document has been duly addressed and mailed, shall be prima facie evidence that the notice or document has been furnished the addressees.

      (2) A society shall specify in its rules those persons who may be issued, or covered by, the contractual benefits in subsection (1) of this section, consistent with providing benefits to members and their dependents.

[1987 c.490 §19]

      748.211 Benefit contract; certificate. (1) Every society authorized to do business in this state shall issue to each owner of a benefit contract a certificate specifying the amount of benefits provided. The certificate, together with any riders or indorsements attached to it, the laws of the society, the application for membership, the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant, and all amendments to each, shall constitute the benefit contract, as of the date of issuance, between the society and the owner, and the certificate shall so state. The laws of the society need not be stated in full in the certificate, except as provided in this section. A copy of the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, shall be indorsed upon or attached to the certificate. All statements on the application shall be representations and not warranties. Any waiver of this provision shall be void.

      (2) Any changes, additions or amendments to the laws of the society duly made or enacted subsequent to the issuance of the certificate, shall bind the owner and the beneficiaries, and shall govern and control the benefit contract in all respects the same as though the changes, additions or amendments had been made prior to and were in force at the time of the application for insurance, except that no change, addition or amendment shall destroy or diminish benefits which the society contracted to give the owner as of the date of issuance.

      (3) Any person upon whose life a benefit contract is issued prior to attaining the age of majority shall be bound by the terms of the application and certificate and by all the laws and rules of the society to the same extent as though the age of majority had been attained at the time of application.

      (4) A society shall provide in its laws that if its reserves as to all or any class of certificates become impaired, its board of directors or corresponding body may require that there be paid by the owner to the society the amount of the owner’s equitable proportion of the deficiency as ascertained by its board, and that if the payment is not made:

      (a) It shall stand as an indebtedness against the certificate and draw interest not to exceed the rate specified for certificate loans under the certificates; or

      (b) In lieu of or in combination with paragraph (a) of this subsection, the owner may accept a proportionate reduction in benefits under the certificate.

      (5) The society may specify the manner of the election of the alternatives specified in subsection (4) of this section and which alternative is to be presumed if no election is made.

      (6) Copies of any of the documents mentioned in this section, certified by the secretary or corresponding officer of the society, shall be received in evidence of the terms and conditions of the documents.

      (7) No certificate shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless a copy of the form has been filed with and approved by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and is subject to withdrawal of approval, in the manner provided for like policies issued by life and health insurers in this state. Every life, accident, health or disability insurance certificate and every annuity certificate issued on or after one year from January 1, 1988, shall meet the standard contract provision requirements not inconsistent with this chapter for like policies issued by life and health insurers in this state, except that a society may provide for a grace period for payment of premiums of one full month in its certificates. The certificates shall also contain a provision stating the amount of premiums which are payable under the certificate and a provision reciting or setting forth the substance of any sections of the society’s laws or rules in force at the time of issuance of the certificate which, if violated, shall result in the termination or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. In addition, except for contracts issued on a variable basis as authorized by ORS 748.409, the certificate shall contain a provision stating the substance of the society’s laws required under subsections (4) and (5) of this section. If the laws of the society provide for expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate shall also contain a provision that any member so expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance, shall have the privilege of maintaining the certificate in force by continuing payment of the required premium.

      (8) Benefit contracts issued on the lives of persons below the society’s minimum age for adult membership may provide for transfer of control or ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate. A society may require approval of an application for membership in order to effect this transfer, and may provide in all other respects for the regulation, government and control of the certificates and all rights, obligations and liabilities incident thereto and connected therewith. Ownership rights prior to the transfer shall be specified in the certificate.

      (9) A society may specify the terms and conditions on which benefit contracts may be assigned. [1987 c.490 §20; 1991 c.182 §13]
