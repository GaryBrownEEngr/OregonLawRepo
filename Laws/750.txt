INSOLVENCY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE CONTRACTOR

 

      750.085 Offer of replacement coverage upon order of liquidation; procedure; rules. (1) If a final order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency has been entered with respect to a health care service contractor by a court of competent jurisdiction in the domicile of the health care service contractor, subscribers of the health care service contractor must be offered replacement coverage as provided in this section.

      (2) All insurers and health care service contractors that participated with the insolvent health care service contractor in the open enrollment process at the last regular open enrollment period for a group shall offer members of the group that are subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor an open enrollment period that the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services establishes by rule, commencing on the date on which the final order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency was entered. Each of the insurers and health care service contractors shall offer the subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor the same coverages and rates that the insurer or health care service contractor had offered to members of the group at the group’s last regular open enrollment period.

      (3) If no other insurer or health care service contractor offered health insurance coverage to a group or groups whose members are enrolled with the insolvent health care service contractor, or if the other insurers and health care service contractors lack sufficient health care delivery resources to assure that health care services will be available and accessible to all of the group subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall equitably allocate the contract or contracts for the group or groups among all health care service contractors that operate within a portion of the service area of the insolvent health care service contractor. The director shall take into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health care service contractor. Each health care service contractor to which a group or groups are so allocated shall offer to each such group the existing coverage of the health care service contractor, at rates determined by the health care service contractor in accordance with the health care service contractor’s existing rating methodology. Each health care service contractor to whom a group or groups are allocated may reevaluate the group or groups at the end of the contractual period or at the end of six months after the allocation, whichever occurs first, in order to determine the appropriate premium for each such group.

      (4) The director shall equitably allocate the nongroup subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor that are unable to obtain other coverage among all health care service contractors that operate within a portion of the service area of the insolvent health care service contractor. The director shall take into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health care service contractor. Each health care service contractor to which nongroup subscribers are allocated shall offer the health care service contractor’s existing individual or conversion coverage to nongroup subscribers, at rates determined in accordance with the health care service contractor’s existing rating methodology. A health care service contractor that does not offer direct nongroup enrollment may aggregate all of the allocated nongroup subscribers into one group for rating and coverage purposes.

      (2) Each contract between a health care service contractor and a provider of health care services shall provide that if the health care service contractor fails to pay for covered health care services as set forth in the subscriber’s evidence of coverage or contract, the subscriber is not liable to the provider for any amounts owed by the health care service contractor.

      (3) If the contract between the contracting provider and the health care service contractor has not been reduced to writing or fails to contain the provisions required by subsection (2) of this section, the subscriber is not liable to the contracting provider for any amounts owed by the health care service contractor.

      (a) Deductible, copayment or coinsurance amounts.

      (b) Health care services not covered by the health care service contractor.

      (c) Health care services rendered after the termination of the contract between the health care service contractor and the provider, unless the health care services were rendered during the confinement in an inpatient facility and the confinement began prior to the date of termination or unless the provider has assumed post-termination treatment obligations under the contract.

      (6) Nothing in this section prohibits a subscriber from seeking noncovered health care services from a provider and accepting financial responsibility for these services.

      (7) No health care service contractor shall limit the right of a provider of health care services to contract with the patient for payment of services not within the scope of the coverage offered by the health care service contractor. [1989 c.783 §3]

      (4) As a guarantee of the due execution of the trust obligation under the benefit plan or plans to be entered into by the trust in accordance with ORS 750.301 to 750.341, the trust must make and maintain a deposit with the Department of Consumer and Business Services as provided in this subsection. The deposit required under this subsection is in addition to the capital and surplus or other amount required to be possessed and maintained by the trust under subsection (3) of this section and may not be included in or counted toward the required capital and surplus or other amount. The following provisions apply to the deposit:

      (a) As a condition of obtaining a certificate of multiple employer welfare arrangement, a trust shall make an initial deposit in an amount that is the greater of $50,000 or the amount of the deposit required under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

At the beginning of the second, third and fourth calendar quarters after such a trust receives its certificate of multiple employer welfare arrangement, the current required amount of the deposit to be maintained by the trust shall be calculated by determining the average monthly amount of claims paid during the preceding quarter. Beginning with the fifth calendar quarter following the issuance of its certificate of multiple employer welfare arrangement, the trust shall maintain the deposit as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

An association or group of employers may provide health benefits in this state through a multiple employer welfare arrangement established in another state if the association or group of employers first obtains a certificate of multiple employer welfare arrangement in this state. Such a multiple employer welfare arrangement is a foreign multiple employer welfare arrangement.
