      (h) The adequacy of the reserves of the health care service contractor.

      (i) The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The director may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of combined capital and surplus whenever in the judgment of the director the investment so warrants.

INSOLVENCY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE CONTRACTOR

 

      750.085 Offer of replacement coverage upon order of liquidation; procedure; rules. (1) If a final order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency has been entered with respect to a health care service contractor by a court of competent jurisdiction in the domicile of the health care service contractor, subscribers of the health care service contractor must be offered replacement coverage as provided in this section.

      (2) All insurers and health care service contractors that participated with the insolvent health care service contractor in the open enrollment process at the last regular open enrollment period for a group shall offer members of the group that are subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor an open enrollment period that the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services establishes by rule, commencing on the date on which the final order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency was entered. Each of the insurers and health care service contractors shall offer the subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor the same coverages and rates that the insurer or health care service contractor had offered to members of the group at the group’s last regular open enrollment period.

      (3) If no other insurer or health care service contractor offered health insurance coverage to a group or groups whose members are enrolled with the insolvent health care service contractor, or if the other insurers and health care service contractors lack sufficient health care delivery resources to assure that health care services will be available and accessible to all of the group subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall equitably allocate the contract or contracts for the group or groups among all health care service contractors that operate within a portion of the service area of the insolvent health care service contractor. The director shall take into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health care service contractor. Each health care service contractor to which a group or groups are so allocated shall offer to each such group the existing coverage of the health care service contractor, at rates determined by the health care service contractor in accordance with the health care service contractor’s existing rating methodology. Each health care service contractor to whom a group or groups are allocated may reevaluate the group or groups at the end of the contractual period or at the end of six months after the allocation, whichever occurs first, in order to determine the appropriate premium for each such group.

      (4) The director shall equitably allocate the nongroup subscribers of the insolvent health care service contractor that are unable to obtain other coverage among all health care service contractors that operate within a portion of the service area of the insolvent health care service contractor. The director shall take into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health care service contractor. Each health care service contractor to which nongroup subscribers are allocated shall offer the health care service contractor’s existing individual or conversion coverage to nongroup subscribers, at rates determined in accordance with the health care service contractor’s existing rating methodology. A health care service contractor that does not offer direct nongroup enrollment may aggregate all of the allocated nongroup subscribers into one group for rating and coverage purposes.

(1) For the purpose of this section only, and only in the event of a finding of impairment by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or of a final order of liquidation, as described in ORS 750.085, any covered health care service furnished within the state by a provider to a subscriber of a health care service contractor shall be considered to have been furnished pursuant to a contract between the provider and the health care service contractor with whom the subscriber was enrolled when the services were furnished.

      (2) Each contract between a health care service contractor and a provider of health care services shall provide that if the health care service contractor fails to pay for covered health care services as set forth in the subscriber’s evidence of coverage or contract, the subscriber is not liable to the provider for any amounts owed by the health care service contractor.

      (3) If the contract between the contracting provider and the health care service contractor has not been reduced to writing or fails to contain the provisions required by subsection (2) of this section, the subscriber is not liable to the contracting provider for any amounts owed by the health care service contractor.

      (4) No contracting provider or agent, trustee or assignee of the contracting provider may maintain a civil action against a subscriber to collect any amounts owed by the health care service contractor for which the subscriber is not liable to the contracting provider under this section.

      (5) Nothing in this section impairs the right of a provider to charge, collect from, attempt to collect from or maintain a civil action against a subscriber for any of the following:

      (a) Deductible, copayment or coinsurance amounts.

      (b) Health care services not covered by the health care service contractor.

      (c) Health care services rendered after the termination of the contract between the health care service contractor and the provider, unless the health care services were rendered during the confinement in an inpatient facility and the confinement began prior to the date of termination or unless the provider has assumed post-termination treatment obligations under the contract.

      (6) Nothing in this section prohibits a subscriber from seeking noncovered health care services from a provider and accepting financial responsibility for these services.

      (7) No health care service contractor shall limit the right of a provider of health care services to contract with the patient for payment of services not within the scope of the coverage offered by the health care service contractor. [1989 c.783 §3]
