The amount of the fee shall equal the amount that the commission finds and determines to be necessary, together with the amount of all other fees paid or payable to the commission by such public utilities and telecommunications providers in the current calendar year, to defray the costs of performing the duties imposed by law upon the commission with respect to the public utilities and telecommunications providers.

      (2) In each calendar year the percentage rate of the fee required to be paid by public utilities shall be determined by orders entered by the commission on or after March 1 of each year. Notice of the orders shall be given to each utility. The utility shall pay to the commission the fee or portion thereof so computed upon the date specified in the notice. The date of payment shall be at least 15 days after the date of mailing of the notice.

      (3) The fee payable under subsection (1) of this section by each public utility may not be less than $10, or more than forty-five hundredths of one percent of the utility’s gross operating revenues derived within this state in the preceding calendar year.

The percentage amount shall be determined by order of the commission not less than 60 days prior to the calendar year upon which the fee is based. The fee shall be payable to the commission not later than April 1 of the year following that calendar year.

      (b) A telecommunications provider shall collect the fee payable under subsection (1) of this section by charging an apportioned amount to each of the provider’s retail customers. The amount of the charge shall be described on the retail customer’s bill in a manner determined by the provider.

      (c) In the event a telecommunications utility has an approved rate that includes the fee required under subsection (1) of this section and separately charges retail customers for the fee described in this section, at the time the utility begins collecting the charge the utility shall file with the commission a rate schedule reducing rates in an amount projected to equal the amount separately charged to customers.

      (5) The commission may use any of its investigatory and enforcement powers provided under this chapter for the purpose of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section.

COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE

 

      756.500 Complaint; persons entitled to file; contents; amendments. (1) Any person may file a complaint before the Public Utility Commission, or the commission may, on the commission’s own initiative, file such complaint. The complaint shall be against any person whose business or activities are regulated by some one or more of the statutes, jurisdiction for the enforcement or regulation of which is conferred upon the commission. The person filing the complaint shall be known as the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is filed shall be known as the defendant.

      (2) It is not necessary that a complainant have a pecuniary interest in the matter in controversy or in the matter complained of, but the commission shall not grant any order of reparation to any person not a party to the proceedings in which such reparation order is made.

      (3) The complaint shall state all grounds of complaint on which the complainant seeks relief or the violation of any law claimed to have been committed by the defendant, and the prayer of the complaint shall pray for the relief to which the complainant claims the complainant is entitled.

      (4) The complaint may, at any time before the completion of taking of evidence, be amended by order of the commission. However, if a charge not contained in the original complaint or a prior amended complaint is sought to be made by any such amendment, the defendant shall be given a reasonable time to investigate the new charge and answer the amended complaint. The final hearing shall, if necessary, be continued until some date after the defendant has had a reasonable time to investigate and be prepared to meet the amended complaint.

      (5) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, any public utility or telecommunications utility may make complaint as to any matter affecting its own rates or service with like effect as though made by any other person, by filing an application, petition or complaint with the commission. [Formerly 756.520; 1987 c.447 §91; 1995 c.733 §68]

 

      756.505 [Repealed by 1971 c.655 §250]

      756.512 Notice of complaint to defendant; responsive pleadings; setting cause for hearing. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall serve a copy of the complaint upon the defendant, and shall give the defendant at least 10 days within which to respond to the complaint. Within the time so fixed, or such further time as the commission shall fix, the defendant shall file an answer to the complaint, taking issue on such parts of the complaint as the defendant desires and setting forth such additional matter as shall be pertinent to the matter in controversy. Such additional matter shall be deemed denied without the filing of any other pleading by the complainant. After the filing of the answer the commission shall set the matter for hearing, giving the defendant at least 10 days’ written notice of the time and place of the hearing, unless the commission for good reason stated in the notice, fixes a shorter time. Amendment of any answer may be permitted by order of the commission.

      (2) If the defendant fails to file a responsive pleading or otherwise appear within the time prescribed in subsection (1) of this section, or if the responsive pleading filed raises no issue of law or fact, the commission may act on the complaint without a hearing. [Formerly 756.530]

 

      756.515 Investigations and hearings on commission’s own motion; hearings for aggrieved persons. (1) Whenever the Public Utility Commission believes that any rate may be unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or that any service is unsafe or inadequate, or is not afforded, or that an investigation of any matter relating to any public utility or telecommunications utility or other person should be made, or relating to any person to determine if such person is subject to the commission’s regulatory jurisdiction, the commission may on motion summarily investigate any such matter, with or without notice.

      (2) If after making such investigation the commission is satisfied that sufficient grounds exist to warrant a hearing being ordered upon any such matter, the commission shall furnish any public utility or telecommunications utility or other person interested a statement notifying it of the matters under investigation, which statement shall be accompanied by a notice fixing the time and place for hearing upon such matters in the manner provided in ORS 756.512 for notice of complaint.

      (3) Thereafter proceedings shall be had and conducted in reference to the matters investigated in like manner as though complaint had been filed with the commission relative thereto, and the same orders may be made in reference thereto as if such investigation had been made on complaint.

      (4) The commission may, after making an investigation on the commission’s motion, but without notice or hearing, make such findings and orders as the commission deems justified or required by the results of such investigation. Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section such findings and orders have the same legal force and effect as any other finding or order of the commission.

      (5) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, any party aggrieved by an order entered pursuant to subsection (4) of this section may request the commission to hold a hearing to determine whether the order should continue in effect. Any such request for hearing shall be submitted to the commission not later than 15 days after the date of service of the order, and the commission shall hold the hearing not later than 60 days after receipt of such a request for hearing.

      (6) If the commission receives a request for hearing pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, the order is suspended pending the outcome of the hearing unless the commission finds that the order is necessary for the public health or safety or to prevent the dissipation of assets of a business or activity subject to the commission’s regulatory jurisdiction.

      (2) At any time before the final taking of evidence in a proceeding, any person may apply to the commission for permission to appear and participate in the proceeding. The commission shall determine the interest of the applicant in the proceeding and shall grant the application, subject to appropriate conditions, if the commission determines that such appearance and participation will not unreasonably broaden the issues or burden the record, and otherwise may deny the application.

      (3) This section does not apply to any person who might have been an original party in a proceeding before the commission if that person is required by statute to file a pleading or other response in the proceeding within a specified time. [1971 c.655 §42]

      (3) Depositions may be taken within or without the State of Oregon by the commission, or any other person authorized to administer oaths, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the rules of the commission.

Witnesses appearing pursuant to subpoena, other than the parties or their officers or employees, or employees of the commission, shall receive fees and mileage as prescribed by law for witnesses in ORS 44.415 (2). If the commission certifies that the testimony of a witness was relevant and material, any person who paid fees and mileage to that witness shall be reimbursed by the commission and from moneys referred to in ORS 756.360, subject to the limitations provided in ORS 756.360.

      756.549 Self-incrimination of witnesses in commission proceedings. (1) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing evidence in any proceeding held by the Public Utility Commission on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to prosecution, penalty or forfeiture if:

      (a) The person has been directed by the commission to testify or produce evidence under oath;

      (b) The person claims, at the time the person is directed by the commission to testify or produce evidence, that the testimony or evidence required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to prosecution, penalty or forfeiture; and

      (2) Any investigation, hearing or other proceeding involving the issuance of an order of the commission that has not been finally determined when a transfer of any interests of a person is effected may be continued and finally determined, notwithstanding any such transfer of interest.

      (2) ORS 183.482 (3) does not apply to judicial review of an order of the Public Utility Commission. At any time after filing a petition for judicial review of a final order of the commission in a contested case, the petitioner may apply to the Court of Appeals for a stay of the order until the final disposition of the appeal. The court may grant a stay for cause shown. As a condition of granting a stay, the court may require a bond or other security, or impose such other conditions as the court deems appropriate. A stay may be granted only after notice to the commission and opportunity for hearing. Any bond required by the court must be executed in favor of the commission for the benefit of interested persons, and may be enforced by the commission or by any interested person.
