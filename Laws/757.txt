      (2) Prior to the effective date, the commission may suspend the effective date of such contracts or schedules for an additional period of not more than 120 days in order to determine the reasonableness of such contracts or schedules, taking into consideration the services being provided, the costs and risks of service, the availability and costs of alternative forms of service and other reasonable considerations, including the impact on existing customers of the utilities furnishing electricity and natural gas and on the public generally.

      (3) If the contract or schedule is not suspended, or if the contract or schedule is determined reasonable by the commission after suspension, the contract or schedule shall not be subject to further commission review during its term or such other period as the commission may specify, except as provided in ORS 757.009.

      (4) In any proceeding before the commission to determine the reasonableness of contracts or schedules proposed under this section, the burden shall be upon the proponent of the contract or schedule to establish its reasonableness. [1989 c.999 §§4a,4c; 2003 c.82 §5]

      (a) With respect to any or all customers, if the commission finds that the activities of such person have an adverse effect upon the customers of public utilities furnishing electricity or natural gas and the benefits of such regulation outweigh any adverse effect on the public generally; or

      (b) With respect to any customer receiving service not exceeding 500 million British thermal units per year or any residential customer, if the commission finds that such person has engaged in unjust or unreasonable practices with respect to the services or rates available to the customer and the customer has no reasonable alternative to the services provided.

      (2) The commission shall not regulate persons under subsection (1)(a) of this section with respect to contracts that became effective prior to the date of service of the complaint or with respect to heating systems already in place on the date of service of the complaint if the commission determines that continued expansion will increase the efficiency of those systems. [1989 c.999 §§4b,4d; 2003 c.82 §6]

(1) Every public utility shall file with the Public Utility Commission, within a time to be fixed by the commission, schedules which shall be open to public inspection, showing all rates, tolls and charges which it has established and which are in force at the time for any service performed by it within the state, or for any service in connection therewith or performed by any public utility controlled or operated by it.

      (2) Every public utility shall file with and as part of every such schedule all rules and regulations that in any manner affect the rates charged or to be charged for any service. Every public utility shall also file with the commission copies of interstate rate schedules and rules and regulations issued by it or to which it is a party.

      (3) Where a schedule of joint rates or charges is or may be in force between two or more public utilities, such schedules shall in like manner be printed and filed with the commission. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §70]

 

      757.210 Hearing to establish new schedules; alternative regulation plan. (1)(a) Whenever any public utility files with the Public Utility Commission any rate or schedule of rates stating or establishing a new rate or schedule of rates or increasing an existing rate or schedule of rates, the commission may, either upon written complaint or upon the commission’s own initiative, after reasonable notice, conduct a hearing to determine whether the rate or schedule is fair, just and reasonable. The commission shall conduct the hearing upon written complaint filed by the utility, its customer or customers, or any other proper party within 60 days of the utility’s filing; provided that no hearing need be held if the particular rate change is the result of an automatic adjustment clause. At the hearing the utility shall bear the burden of showing that the rate or schedule of rates proposed to be established or increased or changed is fair, just and reasonable. The commission may not authorize a rate or schedule of rates that is not fair, just and reasonable.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “automatic adjustment clause” means a provision of a rate schedule that provides for rate increases or decreases or both, without prior hearing, reflecting increases or decreases or both in costs incurred, taxes paid to units of government or revenues earned by a utility and that is subject to review by the commission at least once every two years.

      (2)(a) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to rate changes under an approved alternative form of regulation plan, including a resource rate plan under ORS 757.212.

      (b) Any alternative form of regulation plan shall include provisions to ensure that the plan operates in the interests of utility customers and the public generally and results in rates that are just and reasonable and may include provisions establishing a reasonable range for rate of return on investment. In approving a plan, the commission shall, at a minimum, consider whether the plan:

      (A) Promotes increased efficiencies and cost control;

      (B) Is consistent with least-cost resources acquisition policies;

      (C) Yields rates that are consistent with those that would be obtained following application of ORS 757.269;

      (D) Is consistent with maintenance of safe, adequate and reliable service; and

      (E) Is beneficial to utility customers generally, for example, by minimizing utility rates.

      (c) As used in this subsection, “alternative form of regulation plan” means a plan adopted by the commission upon petition by a public utility, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that sets rates and revenues and a method for changes in rates and revenues using alternatives to cost-of-service rate regulation.

      (d) Prior to implementing a rate change under an alternative form of regulation plan, the utility shall present a report that demonstrates the calculation of any proposed rate change at a public meeting of the commission.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 757.212, the commission, at any time, may order a utility to appear and establish that any, or all, of its rates in a plan authorized under subsection (2) of this section are in conformity with the plan and are just and reasonable. Except as provided in ORS 757.212, such rates, and the alternative form of regulation plan under which the rates are set, also shall be subject to complaint under ORS 756.500.

      (4) Periodically, but not less often than every two years after the implementation of a plan referred to in subsection (2) of this section, the commission shall submit a report to the Legislative Assembly that shows the impact of the plan on rates paid by utility customers.

      (5) The commission and staff may consult at any time with, and provide technical assistance to, utilities, their customers, and other interested parties on matters relevant to utility rates and charges. If a hearing is held with respect to a rate change, the commission’s decisions shall be based on the record made at the hearing. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §70a; 1981 c.715 §1; 1985 c.550 §2; 1987 c.447 §97; 1987 c.613 §1; 1989 c.5 §§3,23; 1995 c.785 §1; 2001 c.913 §3; 2005 c.845 §5; 2011 c.137 §3]

 

      757.212 Resource rate plans; customers who may elect to be exempt; order approving plan; effect of approving plan; rules. (1) For purposes of this section:

      (a) “Resource rate plan” means a plan by a public utility to construct a generating plant or to enter into a wholesale power purchase or sales agreement with a term that is longer than one year.

      (b) “Site” means:

      (A) Buildings or other related structures that are interconnected by facilities owned by a single public utility customer and that are served through a single electric meter; or

      (B) A single contiguous area of land containing buildings or other structures that are separated by not more than 1,000 feet, such that:

      (i) Each building or structure included in the site is not more than 1,000 feet from at least one other building or structure in the site;

      (ii) Buildings and structures in the site, and land containing and connecting buildings and structures in the site, are owned by a public utility customer who is billed for electricity use at the buildings and structures; and

      (iii) Land shall be considered to be contiguous even if there is an intervening public or railroad right of way, provided that rights-of-way land on which municipal infrastructure facilities exist, such as street lighting, sewerage transmission and roadway controls, shall not be considered contiguous.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission may approve a resource rate plan as an alternative form of regulation plan under ORS 757.210. A public utility must make a separate tariff filing for each proposed resource rate plan. If the commission approves a resource rate plan by a public utility based on the construction of a generating plant, the order approving the plan must state how the commission will reflect the costs and revenues of the generating plant in the utility’s rates during all or a portion of the expected useful life of the generating plant. If the commission approves a resource rate plan based on a wholesale power purchase or sales agreement with a term longer than one year, the order approving the plan must state how the commission will reflect the costs and revenues under the wholesale power purchase or sales agreement in the utility’s rates during all or a portion of the term of the agreement.

      (3) A customer receiving electricity from a public utility may elect to be exempt from the costs and benefits of a resource rate plan for any single site at which the customer has had a peak load in excess of nine megawatts in any hour during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date on which the public utility files a tariff under this section. A public utility filing a tariff under this section must give written notice of the provisions of this subsection to all of its customers that are eligible to make an election under this subsection. The notice must be given within three days after the tariff is filed. An election under this subsection must be made by a customer within 30 days after the tariff is filed.

      (4) A public utility customer that elects to be exempt under subsection (3) of this section may also elect to be exempt from the costs and benefits of a resource rate plan for any single site at which the customer has had a peak load in excess of one megawatt in any hour during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date on which the public utility files a tariff under this section. An election under this subsection must be made as part of the election under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) The commission shall ensure that customers making an election under subsection (3) or (4) of this section are charged the market cost for all electricity that is required to replace the electricity that would otherwise have been provided under the resource rate plan, and that the election does not result in increased costs or risks to the public utility or to other customers of the public utility.

      (6) The commission, by rule, may allow customers of a public utility other than those customers described in subsection (3) of this section to elect to be exempt from the costs and benefits of a resource rate plan.

      (7) If the commission approves a resource rate plan, the order of the commission must also address:

      (a) The extent to which the public utility will use power from the generating plant or from the power purchase or sales agreement to serve its retail customers in Oregon;

      (b) The allocation of power available from the generating plant or power purchase or sales agreement among different classes of the public utility’s customers;

      (c) The ratemaking consequences of the generating plant or power purchase or sales agreement, including the consequences of variations in the amount of power that is actually available after the plan is in operation compared with the amount of power that was anticipated to be available at the time the plan was approved; and

      (d) Any other issue the commission chooses to consider.

      (8) If the commission approves a resource rate plan, the commission may not thereafter review the costs and rates specific to the resource rate plan or other obligations of the public utility under the plan, or consider any complaint under ORS 756.500 seeking review of the costs and rates specific to the resource rate plan or other obligations of the public utility under the plan, except for the purpose of determining whether the public utility is in compliance with the plan and has established rates in accordance with the plan.

      (9) A resource rate plan and a public utility’s rates under a resource rate plan are not subject to ORS 757.355.

      (10) The commission may not set aside or modify an order approving a resource rate plan unless the public utility operating under the plan approves the setting aside or modification. [2001 c.913 §2; 2005 c.638 §8]

 

      Note: 757.212 was added to and made a part of 757.205 to 757.220 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      757.215 Commission authorized to suspend new rates or order interim rates during hearings; revenues collected under unapproved rates to be refunded; order after hearing. (1) The Public Utility Commission may, pending such investigation and determination, order the suspension of the rate or schedule of rates, provided the initial period of suspension shall not extend more than six months beyond the time when such rate or schedule would otherwise go into effect. If the commission finds that the investigation will not be completed at the expiration of the initial suspension, the commission may enter an order further suspending such rate or schedule for not more than three months beyond the last day of the initial suspension.

      (2) This section does not prevent the commission and the utility from entering into a written stipulation at any time extending any period of suspension.

      (3) After full hearing, whether completed before or after such rate or schedule has gone into effect, the commission may make such order in reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after such rate or schedule has become effective.

      (4) If the commission is required to or determines to conduct a hearing on a rate or schedule of rates filed pursuant to ORS 757.210, but does not order a suspension thereof, any increased revenue collected by the utility as a result of such rate or rate schedule becoming effective shall be received subject to being refunded. If the rate or rate schedule thereafter approved by the commission is for a lesser increase or for no increase, the utility shall refund the amount of revenues received that exceeds the amount approved as nearly as possible to the customers from whom such excess revenues were collected, by a credit against future bills or otherwise, in such manner as the commission orders.

      (5) The commission may in a suspension order authorize an interim rate or rate schedule under which the utility’s revenues will be increased by an amount deemed reasonable by the commission, not exceeding the amount requested by the utility. Any such interim increase for a public utility as defined in ORS 757.005 that produces, transmits, delivers or furnishes heat, light or power shall be effected by rates designed to increase the utility’s revenues without materially changing the revenue relationships among customer classes or between the revenues derived from demand charges and from energy charges. An interim rate or rate schedule shall remain in effect until terminated by the commission. Upon completion of the hearing and decision, the commission shall order the utility to refund that portion of the increase in the interim rate or schedule that the commission finds is not justified. Any refund of an interim increase under this subsection shall be based upon an analysis of the utility’s earnings for a period reasonably representative of the period during which the interim increase was in effect. Refunds shall be made as nearly as possible to the customers against whom the interim rates were charged, by credits against future bills or in such other manner as the commission orders.

      (6) Refunds ordered by the commission under subsection (4) or (5) of this section shall include interest on the amount determined to be subject to refund from the date such interim rate or rate schedules took effect. [Amended by 1981 c.715 §2; 1991 c.964 §1]

 

      757.220 Notice of schedule changes required; exception for alternative regulation. No change shall be made in any schedule, including schedules of joint rates, except upon 30 days’ notice to the Public Utility Commission. All changes shall be plainly indicated upon existing schedules, or by filing new schedules in lieu thereof 30 days prior to the time they are to take effect. However, the commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes without requiring the 30 days’ notice by filing an order specifying the changes to be made and the time when they shall take effect. This section does not apply to rate changes authorized under an alternative form of regulation plan under ORS 757.210 (2). [Amended by 1995 c.785 §2]

 

      757.225 Utilities required to collect for their services in accordance with schedules. No public utility shall charge, demand, collect or receive a greater or less compensation for any service performed by it within the state, or for any service in connection therewith, than is specified in printed rate schedules as may at the time be in force, or demand, collect or receive any rate not specified in such schedule. The rates named therein are the lawful rates until they are changed as provided in ORS 757.210 to 757.220. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §71; 1985 c.550 §3; 1991 c.67 §204]

 

      757.227 Rate mitigation for certain electric company rate increases. (1) As used in this section, “electric company” has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission shall require that an electric company mitigate a rate increase payable by a class of customers described in subsection (5) of this section if:

      (a) The increase results from a transition to an electric company’s generally applicable cost-based rate from the rates established under the contracts described in subsection (5) of this section; and

      (b) The increase in the cost of electricity to that class of customers by reason of the transition will exceed 50 percent during the first 12 calendar months after the transition occurs.

      (3) The commission shall require an electric company to mitigate a rate increase under this section by means of a schedule of rate credits for the class of customers described in subsection (5) of this section. The rate credits provided by an electric company under the schedule shall automatically decrease each year to the lowest credit necessary to avoid a rate increase that is greater than 50 percent in any subsequent year. Rate credits under this section may not be provided for more than seven years after the transition occurs.

      (4) For the purpose of determining the increase in the cost of electricity to a class of customers by reason of a transition described in subsection (2)(a) of this section, the commission shall:

      (a) Include the total charges for electricity service, including all special charges and credits other than the rate credit provided under this section; and

      (b) Exclude any local taxes or fees paid by the class of customers.

      (5) This section applies only to customers of an electric company that purchase electricity at metering points that before the transition described in subsection (2)(a) of this section were eligible for rates that were set under contracts entered into before 1960 and remained unchanged throughout the period of the contract.

      (6) The full cost of providing rate credits under this section shall be spread equally among all other customers of the electric company. [2005 c.594 §3]

 

      757.230 Control of commission over classification of services and forms of schedules; rules. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall provide for a comprehensive classification of service for each public utility, and such classification may take into account the quantity used, the time when used, the purpose for which used, the existence of price competition or a service alternative, the services being provided, the conditions of service and any other reasonable consideration. Based on such considerations the commission may authorize classifications or schedules of rates applicable to individual customers or groups of customers. The service classifications and schedule forms shall be designed consistently with the requirements of ORS 469.010. Each public utility is required to conform its schedules of rates to such classification. If the commission determines that a tariff filing under ORS 757.205 results in a rate classification primarily related to price competition or a service alternative, the commission, at a minimum, shall consider the following:

      (a) Whether the rate generates revenues at least sufficient to cover relevant short and long run costs of the utility during the term of the rates;

      (b) Whether the rate generates revenues sufficient to insure that just and reasonable rates are established for remaining customers of the utility;

      (c) For electric and natural gas utilities:

      (A) Whether it is appropriate to incorporate interruption of service in the utility’s rate agreement with the customer; and

      (B) Whether the rate agreement requires the utility to acquire new resources to serve the load; and

      (d) For electric utilities, for service to load not previously served, the effect of the rate on the utility’s average system cost through the residential exchange provision of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act of 1980, Public Law 96-501, as amended.

      (2) The commission may prescribe such changes in the form in which the schedules are issued by any public utility as may be found to be expedient. The commission shall adopt rules which allow any person who requests notice of tariff filings described under subsection (1) of this section to receive such notice. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §72; 1977 c.682 §1; 1987 c.900 §1]

 

      757.235 [Amended by 1953 c.285 §2; repealed by 1981 c.715 §3]

 

      757.240 Filing schedules in business office. (1) A copy of so much of all schedules, including schedules of joint rates and charges, as the Public Utility Commission deems necessary for the use of the public shall be printed in plain type and kept on file in every business office of such public utility, open to the public, and in such form and place as to be readily accessible to the public for convenient inspection.

      (2) Copies of all new schedules shall be filed in every business office of such public utility 30 days prior to the time the schedules are to take effect, unless the commission prescribes a shorter time. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §73]

 

      757.245 Establishment of joint rates. (1) A public utility may establish reasonable through service and joint rates and classifications with other public utilities. Public utilities establishing joint rates shall establish just and reasonable regulations and practices in connection therewith and just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof as between the public utilities participating therein, which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of such participating public utilities, and every unjust and unreasonable rate, classification, regulation, practice and division is prohibited.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission may, and shall, whenever deemed by the commission to be necessary or desirable in the public interest, after full hearing upon complaint, or upon the commission’s own initiative without complaint, establish through service, classifications and joint rates, the divisions of such rates and the terms and conditions under which such through service shall be rendered. If any tariff or schedule canceling any through service or joint rate or classification without the consent of all the public utilities parties thereto or authorization by the commission is suspended by the commission for investigation, the burden of proof is upon the public utilities proposing such cancellation to show that it is consistent with the public interest.

      (3) Whenever, after full hearing upon complaint or upon the commission’s own initiative without complaint, the commission is of the opinion that the divisions of joint rates between the public utilities are or will be unjust, unreasonable, inequitable or unduly preferential or prejudicial as between the public utilities parties thereto, whether agreed upon by such public utilities or otherwise established, the commission shall, by order, prescribe the just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several public utilities. In cases where the joint rate was established pursuant to the finding or order of the commission and the divisions thereto are found by the commission to have been unjust, unreasonable or inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial, the commission may also by order determine what, for the period subsequent to the filing of the complaint or petition or the making of the order of investigation, would have been the just, reasonable and equitable division thereof to be received by the several public utilities and require adjustment to be made in accordance therewith.

      (4) In so prescribing and determining the divisions of joint rates, the commission shall give due consideration, among other things, to:

      (a) The efficiency with which the public utilities concerned are operated;

      (b) The amount of revenue to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes and a fair return on their public utility property held for and used in service;

      (c) The importance to the public of the services of such public utilities;

      (d) Whether any particular participating public utility is an originating, intermediate or delivering utility; and

      (e) Any other fact or circumstance which ordinarily would entitle one public utility to a greater or less proportion of the joint rate than another. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §74]

 

      757.247 Tariff schedules for energy resource measures; rules. (1) The Public Utility Commission may authorize a public utility, upon application of the utility, to file and place into effect a tariff schedule establishing rates or charges for the cost of energy resource measures provided to an individual property owner or customer pursuant to an agreement entered into between the individual property owner or customer and the public utility. Energy resource measures provided under this section may include:

      (a) The installation of renewable energy generation facilities on the property of property owners or the premises of customers;

      (b) The implementation of energy conservation measures, including measures that are not cost-effective;

      (c) The installation of equipment or devices or the implementation of measures that enable demand reduction, peak load reduction, improved integration of renewable energy generation or more effective utilization of energy resources;

      (d) Loans for the purposes described in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection; and

      (e) Direct payments to third parties for the purposes described in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection.

      (2) Subject to the agreement entered into between the individual property owner or customer and the public utility, a tariff schedule placed into effect under this section may include provisions for:

      (a) The payment of the rates or charges over a period of time;

      (b) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a reasonable rate of return on any investment made by the public utility;

      (c) The application of any payment obligation to successive owners of the property to which the energy resource measure is attached or to successive customers located at the premises to which the energy resource measure is attached; and

      (d) The application of the payment obligation to the current property owner or customer alone, secured by methods agreed to by the property owner or customer and the public utility.

      (3) Application of a tariff schedule under this section is subject to approval by the commission.

      (4) If a payment obligation applies to successive property owners or customers as described in subsection (2)(c) of this section, a public utility shall record a notice of the payment obligation in the records maintained by the county clerk under ORS 205.130. The commission may prescribe by rule other methods by which the public utility shall notify property owners or customers of such payment obligations.

      (5) A public utility may use moneys obtained through a rate established under ORS 757.603 (2)(a) to provide a renewable energy generation facility to a property owner or customer under this section. A public utility may not charge interest to a property owner or customer for a renewable energy generation facility acquired with moneys obtained through a rate established under ORS 757.603 (2)(a).

      (6) Agreements entered into and tariff schedules placed into effect under this section are not subject to ORS 470.500 to 470.710, 757.612 or 757.689. [1991 c.268 §2; 2007 c.885 §3; 2013 c.344 §1]

 

      757.250 Standards and appliances for measuring service; rules. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall ascertain and prescribe for each kind of public utility suitable and convenient standard commercial units of service. These shall be lawful units for the purposes of this chapter.

      (2) The commission shall ascertain and fix adequate and serviceable standards for the measurement of quality, pressure, initial voltage or other conditions pertaining to the supply of the service rendered by any public utility and prescribe reasonable regulations for examination and testing of such service and for the measurement thereof. It shall establish reasonable rules, regulations, specifications and standards to secure the accuracy of all meters and appliances for the measurements, and every public utility is required to carry into effect all orders issued by the commission relative thereto. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §75]

 

      757.255 Testing of measuring appliances; rules; fees. (1) The Public Utility Commission may provide for the examination and testing of any and all appliances used for the measuring of any service of a public utility, and may provide by rule that no such appliance shall be installed and used for the measuring of any service of any public utility until it has been examined and tested by the commission and found to be accurate.

      (2) The commission shall declare and establish a reasonable fee governing the cost of such examination and test, which shall be paid to the commission by the public utility.

      (3) The commission shall declare and establish reasonable fees for the testing of such appliances on the application of the customer, the fee to be paid by the customer at the time of the customer’s request, but to be repaid to the customer by the commission and to be paid by the public utility if the appliance is found defective or incorrect to the disadvantage of the customer or used beyond such reasonable limit as may be prescribed by the commission.

      (4) All fees collected under the provisions of this section shall be paid by the commission into the State Treasury.

      (5) The commission may purchase such materials, apparatus and standard measuring instruments for the examination and tests as the commission deems necessary. [Amended by 1971 c.655 §76]

 

      757.259 Amounts includable in rate schedule; deferral; limit in effect on rates by amortization; rules. (1) In addition to powers otherwise vested in the Public Utility Commission, and subject to the limitations contained in this section, under amortization schedules set by the commission, a rate or rate schedule:

      (a) May reflect:

      (A) Amounts lawfully imposed retroactively by order of another governmental agency; or

      (B) Amounts deferred under subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) Shall reflect amounts deferred under subsection (3) of this section if the public utility so requests.

      (2) Upon application of a utility or ratepayer or upon the commission’s own motion and after public notice, opportunity for comment and a hearing if any party requests a hearing, the commission by order may authorize deferral of the following amounts for later incorporation in rates:

      (a) Amounts incurred by a utility resulting from changes in the wholesale price of natural gas or electricity approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;

      (b) Balances resulting from the administration of Section 5(c) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act of 1980;

      (c) Direct or indirect costs arising from any purchase made by a public utility from the Bonneville Power Administration pursuant to ORS 757.663, provided that such costs shall be recovered only from residential and small-farm retail electricity consumers;

      (d) Amounts accruing under a plan for the protection of short-term earnings under ORS 757.262 (2); or

      (e) Identifiable utility expenses or revenues, the recovery or refund of which the commission finds should be deferred in order to minimize the frequency of rate changes or the fluctuation of rate levels or to match appropriately the costs borne by and benefits received by ratepayers.

      (3) Upon request of the public utility, the commission by order shall allow deferral of amounts provided as financial assistance under an agreement entered into under ORS 757.072 for later incorporation in rates.

      (4) The commission may authorize deferrals under subsection (2) of this section beginning with the date of application, together with interest established by the commission. A deferral may be authorized for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on or after the date of application. However, amounts deferred under subsection (2)(c) and (d) or (3) of this section are not subject to subsection (5), (6), (7), (8) or (10) of this section, but are subject to such limitations and requirements that the commission may prescribe and that are consistent with the provisions of this section.

      (5) Unless subject to an automatic adjustment clause under ORS 757.210 (1), amounts described in this section shall be allowed in rates only to the extent authorized by the commission in a proceeding under ORS 757.210 to change rates and upon review of the utility’s earnings at the time of application to amortize the deferral. The commission may require that amortization of deferred amounts be subject to refund. The commission’s final determination on the amount of deferrals allowable in the rates of the utility is subject to a finding by the commission that the amount was prudently incurred by the utility.

      (6) Except as provided in subsections (7), (8) and (10) of this section, the overall average rate impact of the amortizations authorized under this section in any one year may not exceed three percent of the utility’s gross revenues for the preceding calendar year.

      (7) The commission may allow an overall average rate impact greater than that specified in subsection (6) of this section for natural gas commodity and pipeline transportation costs incurred by a natural gas utility if the commission finds that allowing a higher amortization rate is reasonable under the circumstances.

      (8) The commission may authorize amortizations for an electric utility under this section with an overall average rate impact not to exceed six percent of the electric utility’s gross revenues for the preceding calendar year. If the commission allows an overall average rate impact greater than that specified in subsection (6) of this section, the commission shall estimate the electric utility’s cost of capital for the deferral period and may also consider estimated changes in the electric utility’s costs and revenues during the deferral period for the purpose of reviewing the earnings of the electric utility under the provisions of subsection (5) of this section.

      (9) The commission may impose requirements similar to those described in subsection (8) of this section for the amortization of other deferrals under this section, but may not impose such requirements for deferrals under subsection (2)(c) or (d) or (3) of this section.

      (10) The commission may authorize amortization of a deferred amount for an electric utility under this section with an overall average rate impact greater than that allowed by subsections (6) and (8) of this section if:

      (a) The deferral was directly related to extraordinary power supply expenses incurred during 2001;

      (b) The amount to be deferred was greater than 40 percent of the revenue received by the electric utility in 2001 from Oregon customers; and

      (c) The commission determines that the higher rate impact is reasonable under the circumstances.

      (11) If the commission authorizes amortization of a deferred amount under subsection (10) of this section, an electric utility customer that uses more than one average megawatt of electricity at any site in the immediately preceding calendar year may prepay the customer’s share of the deferred amount. The commission shall adopt rules governing the manner in which:

      (a) The customer’s share of the deferred amount is calculated; and

      (b) The customer’s rates are to be adjusted to reflect the prepayment of the deferred amount.

      (12) The provisions of this section do not apply to a telecommunications utility. [1987 c.563 §2; 1989 c.18 §1; 1989 c.956 §1; 1993 c.175 §1; 1999 c.865 §31; 2001 c.733 §3; 2003 c.132 §1; 2003 c.234 §3]

      757.262 Rates to encourage acquisition of cost-effective conservation resources; rules. (1) The Public Utility Commission, by rule, may adopt policies designed to encourage the acquisition of cost-effective conservation resources and small-scale, renewable-fuel electric generating resources.

      (2) In furtherance of the policies adopted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, and in such manner as the commission considers proper, the commission may authorize periodic rate adjustments for the purpose of providing some protection to a utility from reduction of short-term earnings that may result from implementation of such policies. The adjustments may include, but are not limited to, adjustments based in whole or in part upon the extent to which actual sales deviate from a base level of sales the commission considers appropriate. [1993 c.175 §3; 1999 c.944 §3]

 

      757.264 Annual forecast of certain projected production tax credits required; inclusion in rates. Each public utility that makes sales of electricity shall forecast on an annual basis the projected state and federal production tax credits received by the public utility due to variable renewable electricity production, and the Public Utility Commission shall allow those forecasts to be included in rates through any variable power cost forecasting process established by the commission. [2016 c.28 §18b]

 

      757.265 [Repealed by 1971 c.655 §250]

 

      757.266 Rates may encourage tree planting programs as offset to carbon dioxide emissions. The Public Utility Commission of Oregon may allow a rate or rate schedule of a public utility to reflect amounts for small scale programs that enable the utility to gain experience with tree planting on underproducing forestland, as defined by the State Forestry Department, as an offset to carbon dioxide emissions. [1993 c.286 §1]

 

      Note: 757.266 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 757 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

      757.268 [2005 c.845 §3; repealed by 2011 c.137 §5]

 

      757.269 Setting of rates based upon income taxes paid by utility; limitation on use of tax information; rules. (1) When establishing schedules and rates under ORS 757.210 for an electricity or natural gas utility, the Public Utility Commission shall act to balance the interests of the customers of the utility and the utility’s investors by setting fair, just and reasonable rates that include amounts for income taxes. Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, amounts for income taxes included in rates are fair, just and reasonable if the rates include current and deferred income taxes and other related tax items that are based on estimated revenues derived from the regulated operations of the utility.

      (2) During ratemaking proceedings conducted pursuant to ORS 757.210, the Public Utility Commission must ensure that the income taxes included in the electricity or natural gas utility’s rates:

      (a) Include all expected current and deferred tax balances and tax credits made in providing regulated utility service to the utility’s customers in this state;

      (b) Include only the current provision for deferred income taxes, accumulated deferred income taxes and other tax related items that are based on revenues, expenses and the rate base included in rates and on the same basis as included in rates;

      (c) Reflect all known changes to tax and accounting laws or policy that would affect the calculated taxes;

      (d) Are reduced by tax benefits generated by expenditures made in providing regulated utility service to the utility’s customers in this state, regardless of whether the taxes are paid by the utility or an affiliated group;

      (e) Contain all adjustments necessary in order to ensure compliance with the normalization requirements of federal tax law; and

      (f) Reflect other considerations the commission deems relevant to protect the public interest.

      (3) During a ratemaking proceeding conducted under ORS 757.210 for an electricity or natural gas utility that pays taxes as part of an affiliated group, the Public Utility Commission may adjust the utility’s estimated income tax expense based upon:

      (a) Whether the utility’s affiliated group has a history of paying federal or state income taxes that are less than the federal or state income taxes the utility would pay to units of government if it were an Oregon-only regulated utility operation;

      (b) Whether the corporate structure under which the utility is held affects the taxes paid by the affiliated group; or

      (c) Any other considerations the commission deems relevant to protect the public interest.

      (4)(a) Because tax information of unregulated nonutility business in an electricity or natural gas utility’s affiliated group is commercially sensitive, and public disclosure of such information could provide a commercial advantage to other businesses, the Public Utility Commission may not use the tax information obtained under this section for any purpose other than those described in this section, in ORS 757.511 and as necessary for the implementation and administration of this section and ORS 757.511.

      (b) The commission shall adopt rules to implement paragraph (a) of this subsection that:

      (A) Identify all documents and tax information that an electricity or natural gas utility must file in its initial filing in a proceeding to change rates that include amounts for income taxes, recognizing that any party may object to providing such documents on the grounds that they are not relevant; and

      (B) Determine the procedures under which intervenors in such proceedings may obtain and use documents and tax information to fully participate in the proceeding.

      (5) As used in this section, “affiliated group” means a group of corporations of which the public utility is a member and that files a consolidated federal income tax return. [2011 c.137 §1]

      757.279 Fixing rates or charges by commission; cost of hearing. (1) Whenever the Public Utility Commission of Oregon finds, after hearing had upon complaint by a licensee, a public utility, a telecommunications utility or a consumer-owned utility that the rates, terms or conditions demanded, exacted, charged or collected in connection with attachments or availability of surplus space for such attachments are unjust or unreasonable, or that such rates or charges are insufficient to yield a reasonable compensation for the attachment and the costs of administering the same, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rates, terms and conditions thereafter to be observed and in force and shall fix the same by order. In determining and fixing such rates, terms and conditions, the commission shall consider the interest of the customers of the licensee, as well as the interest of the customers of the public utility, telecommunications utility or consumer-owned utility that owns the facility upon which the attachment is made.

      (2) When the order applies to a consumer-owned utility, the order shall also provide for payment by the parties of the cost of the hearing. The payment shall be made in a manner which the commission considers equitable. [1979 c.356 §5; 1983 c.251 §1; 1987 c.414 §165; 1989 c.5 §6; 1999 c.832 §6]

 

      757.282 Criteria for just and reasonable rate for attachments; rate reduction. (1) A just and reasonable rate shall ensure the public utility, telecommunications utility or consumer-owned utility the recovery from the licensee of not less than all the additional costs of providing and maintaining pole attachment space for the licensee nor more than the actual capital and operating expenses, including just compensation, of the public utility, telecommunications utility or consumer-owned utility attributable to that portion of the pole, duct or conduit used for the pole attachment, including a share of the required support and clearance space in proportion to the space used for pole attachment above minimum attachment grade level, as compared to all other uses made of the subject facilities, and uses that remain available to the owner or owners of the subject facilities.

      (2) A licensee shall receive a rental deduction if the licensee is in compliance with rules adopted by the Public Utility Commission for certifying compliance with the laws regulating pole attachments. A licensee is eligible for the rental reduction unless the commission or the utility authorizing the attachment notifies the licensee in writing that the licensee has failed to comply with either the commission’s rules or the terms of a contract between the licensee and the utility authorizing the attachment.

      (3) For purposes of determining the rental rate for a pole attachment, the usable space on the pole shall include 20 inches of safety clearance space between communication circuits and electric circuits, provided the licensee is in compliance with rules and agreements as described in subsection (2) of this section. [1979 c.356 §6; 1989 c.5 §7; 1999 c.832 §7]

 

      757.285 Presumption of reasonableness of rates set by private agreement. Agreements regarding rates, terms and conditions of attachments shall be deemed to be just, fair and reasonable, unless the Public Utility Commission finds upon complaint by a public utility, telecommunications utility, consumer-owned utility or licensee party to such agreement and after hearing, that such rates, terms and conditions are adverse to the public interest and fail to comply with the provisions hereof. [1979 c.356 §7; 1987 c.414 §166; 1989 c.5 §8; 1999 c.832 §8]

 

      757.287 Application to electrical utility attachments. Nothing in ORS 757.270 to 757.290 shall be deemed to apply to any attachment by one or more electrical utilities on the facilities of one or more other electrical utilities. [1979 c.356 §8]

 

      757.290 Regulatory procedures. The procedures of the Public Utility Commission for petition, regulation and enforcement relative to attachments, including any rights of appeal from any decision thereof, shall be the same as those otherwise generally applicable to the commission. [1979 c.356 §9; 1987 c.414 §167]

      (B) Is located on the customer-generator’s premises, the territorial sea as defined in ORS 196.405, or the outer continental shelf;

      (C) If located on the territorial sea or the outer continental shelf, is directly interconnected to the customer-generator’s premises;

      (D) Can operate in parallel with an electric utility’s existing transmission and distribution facilities; and

      (E) Is intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer-generator’s requirements for electricity.

      (2) An electric utility that offers residential and commercial electric service:

      (a) Shall allow net metering facilities to be interconnected using a standard meter that is capable of registering the flow of electricity in two directions.

      (b) May at its own expense install one or more additional meters to monitor the flow of electricity in each direction.

      (c) May not charge a customer-generator a fee or charge that would increase the customer-generator’s minimum monthly charge to an amount greater than that of other customers in the same rate class as the customer-generator. However, the Public Utility Commission, for a public utility, or the governing body, for a municipal electric utility, electric cooperative or people’s utility district, may authorize an electric utility to assess a greater fee or charge, of any type, if the electric utility’s direct costs of interconnection and administration of the net metering outweigh the distribution system, environmental and public policy benefits of allocating such costs among the electric utility’s entire customer base. The commission may authorize a public utility to assess a greater fee or charge under this paragraph only following notice and opportunity for public comment. The governing body of a municipal electric utility, electric cooperative or people’s utility district may assess a greater fee or charge under this paragraph only following notice and opportunity for comment from the customers of the utility, cooperative or district.

      (3)(a) For a customer-generator, an electric utility shall measure the net electricity produced or consumed during the billing period in accordance with normal metering practices.

      (b) If an electric utility supplies a customer-generator more electricity than the customer-generator feeds back to the electric utility during a billing period, the electric utility shall charge the customer-generator for the net electricity that the electric utility supplied.

      (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, if a customer-generator feeds back to an electric utility more electricity than the electric utility supplies the customer-generator during a billing period, the electric utility may charge the minimum monthly charge described in subsection (2) of this section but must credit the customer-generator for the excess kilowatt-hours generated during the billing period. An electric utility may value the excess kilowatt-hours at the avoided cost of the utility, as determined by the commission or the appropriate governing body. An electric utility that values the excess kilowatt-hours at the avoided cost shall bear the cost of measuring the excess kilowatt-hours, issuing payments and billing for the excess hours. The electric utility also shall bear the cost of providing and installing additional metering to measure the reverse flow of electricity.

      (d) For the billing cycle ending in March of each year, or on such other date as agreed to by the electric utility and the customer-generator, any remaining unused kilowatt-hour credit accumulated during the previous year shall be granted to the electric utility for distribution to customers enrolled in the electric utility’s low-income assistance programs, credited to the customer-generator or dedicated for other use as determined by the commission, for a public utility, or the governing body, for a municipal electric utility, electric cooperative or people’s utility district, following notice and opportunity for public comment.

      (4)(a) A net metering facility shall meet all applicable safety and performance standards established in the state building code. The standards shall be consistent with the applicable standards established by the National Electrical Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Underwriters Laboratories or other similarly accredited laboratory.

      (b) Following notice and opportunity for public comment, the commission, for a public utility, or the governing body, for a municipal electric utility, electric cooperative or people’s utility district, may adopt additional control and testing requirements for customer-generators to protect public safety or system reliability.

      (c) An electric utility may not require a customer-generator whose net metering facility meets the standards in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection to comply with additional safety or performance standards, perform or pay for additional tests or purchase additional liability insurance. However, an electric utility shall not be liable directly or indirectly for permitting or continuing to allow an attachment of a net metering facility, or for the acts or omissions of the customer-generator that cause loss or injury, including death, to any third party.

      (5) Nothing in this section is intended to prevent an electric utility from offering, or a customer-generator from accepting, products or services related to the customer-generator’s net metering facility that are different from the net metering services described in this section.

      (6) The commission, for a public utility, or the governing body, for a municipal electric utility, electric cooperative or people’s utility district, may not limit the cumulative generating capacity of solar, wind, geothermal, renewable marine, fuel cell and microhydroelectric net metering systems to less than one-half of one percent of a utility’s, cooperative’s or district’s historic single-hour peak load. After a cumulative limit of one-half of one percent has been reached, the obligation of a public utility, municipal electric utility, electric cooperative or people’s utility district to offer net metering to a new customer-generator may be limited by the commission or governing body in order to balance the interests of retail customers. When limiting net metering obligations under this subsection, the commission or the governing body shall consider the environmental and other public policy benefits of net metering systems. The commission may limit net metering obligations under this subsection only following notice and opportunity for public comment. The governing body of a municipal electric utility, electric cooperative or people’s utility district may limit net metering obligations under this subsection only following notice and opportunity for comment from the customers of the utility, cooperative or district.

(1) Except as otherwise permitted by subsection (4) of this section, a public utility may issue stocks and bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness, certificates of beneficial interests in a trust and securities for the following purposes and no others:

      (a) The acquisition of property, or the construction, completion, extension or improvement of its facilities.

      (b) The improvement or maintenance of its service.

      (c) The discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations.

      (d) The reimbursement of money actually expended from income or from any other money in the treasury of the public utility not secured by or obtained from the issue of stocks or bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, or securities of such public utility, for any of the purposes listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection except the maintenance of service and replacements, in cases where the applicant has kept its accounts and vouchers for such expenditures in such manner as to enable the Public Utility Commission of Oregon to ascertain the amount of money so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

      (e) The compliance with terms and conditions of options granted to its employees to purchase its stock, if the commission first finds that such terms and conditions are reasonable and in the public interest.

      (f) The finance or refinance of bondable conservation investment as described in ORS 757.455. Bonds, notes, certificates of beneficial interests in a trust and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership, issued for this purpose are conservation bonds for the purposes of ORS 757.460. Conservation bonds may rely partly or wholly for repayment on conservation investment assets and revenues arising with respect to conservation investment assets.

      (2) Before issuing such securities a public utility, in addition to the other requirements of law, shall secure from the commission upon application an order authorizing such issue, stating:

      (a) The amount of the issue and the purposes to which the issue or the proceeds thereof are to be applied;

      (b) In the opinion of the commission, the money, property or labor to be procured or paid for by such issue reasonably is required for the purposes specified in the order and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the applicant of service as a public utility, and will not impair its ability to perform that service; and

      (c) Except as otherwise permitted in the order in the case of bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, such purposes are not, in whole or in part, reasonably chargeable to operating expenses or to income.

      (3) This section and ORS 757.410 apply to demand notes but do not apply to the issuance or renewal of a note or evidence of indebtedness maturing not more than one year after date of such issue or renewal.

      (4) Nothing in ORS 757.400 to 757.460 shall prevent issuance of stock to stockholders as a stock dividend if there has been secured from the commission an order:

      (a) Finding that the stock dividend is compatible with the public interest;

      (b) Authorizing such issue and a transfer of surplus to capital in an amount equal to the par or stated value of the stock so authorized; and

      (c) Finding that a sum equal to the amount to be so transferred was expended for the purposes enumerated in subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) Conservation bonds authorized pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may be issued directly by a public utility or through a finance subsidiary. A “finance subsidiary” means any corporation, limited liability company, company, association, trust or other entity that is:

      (a) Beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by a public utility or, in the case of a trust, for which a public utility or subsidiary thereof is the grantor; or

      (b) Unaffiliated with a public utility and acquires bondable conservation investment directly or indirectly from a public utility in a transaction approved by the commission. [Amended by 1961 c.319 §1; 1995 c.539 §4; 2005 c.22 §504]

 

      757.417 Limitation on application of ORS 757.415. ORS 757.415 does not apply to the issuance, renewal or assumption of liability on any evidence of indebtedness when such issuance, renewal or assumption is for the purpose of acquiring specific real or personal property, if the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with all other then outstanding evidences of indebtedness issued, renewed or assumed under this section, does not exceed whichever is the greater of the following amounts:

      (1) The amount of $75,000.

      (2) The amount of one-half of one percent of the sum of:

      (a) The total principal amount of all bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness of the public utility issued or assumed and then outstanding; and

      (b) The capital and surplus as then stated on the books of account of the public utility. [1971 c.655 §88]

 

      757.419 Limitation on application of ORS 757.480. ORS 757.480 does not apply to any mortgage or other encumbrance upon any real or personal property given to secure payment of any evidence of indebtedness issued under ORS 757.415. [1971 c.655 §89]

 

      757.420 Hearings and supplemental orders relating to issuance of securities; joint approval of issuance by interstate utility. (1) To enable the Public Utility Commission to determine whether the commission will issue an order under ORS 757.415, the commission may hold a hearing and may make such additional inquiry or investigation, examine such witnesses, books, papers, documents and contracts and require the filing of such data as the commission deems necessary. The application for such order shall be given priority and shall be disposed of by the commission within 30 days after the filing of such application, unless that period is extended with the consent of the public utility.

      (2) The commission may, upon application of the public utility, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as the commission finds necessary or appropriate, and may by any such supplemental order modify the provisions of any previous order as to the particular purposes, uses, extent to which, or the condition under which, any security theretofore authorized or its proceeds may be applied. Such supplemental orders are subject to the requirements of ORS 757.415. The period of time permitted under subsection (1) of this section for disposing of applications shall not apply to supplemental orders.

      (3) If a commission or other agency is empowered by another state to regulate and control the amount and character of securities to be issued by any public utility within such other state, the commission of Oregon has power to agree with such commission or agency of such other state on the issue of stocks, bonds, notes, other evidences of indebtedness or securities by a public utility owning or operating a public utility both in such state and in this state, and has power to approve such issue jointly with such commission or agency and to issue a joint certificate of such approval. However, no such joint approval is required in order to express the consent to and approval of such issue by the State of Oregon if the issue is separately approved by the Oregon commission.

 

      757.425 State not obligated following approval of issuance. No provision of ORS 757.405 to 757.450, and no deed or act done or performed under or in connection therewith, shall be held or construed to obligate the State of Oregon to pay or guarantee, in any manner whatsoever, any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, authorized, issued or executed under the provisions of ORS 757.405 to 757.450.

 

      757.430 Conditional approval of issuance authorized. The Public Utility Commission may by order grant permission for the issue of stocks or bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness in the amount applied for, or in a lesser amount, or not at all, and may attach to the exercise of the permission such condition or conditions as the commission deems reasonable and necessary.

 

      757.435 Disposal of proceeds from issuance of securities; rules. (1) No public utility shall, without the consent of the Public Utility Commission, apply the issue of any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, or any part or proceeds thereof, to any purpose not specified in the commission’s order, or to any purpose specified in the commission’s order in excess of the amount authorized for such purpose, or issue or dispose of the same on any terms less favorable than those specified in such order, or a modification thereof.

      (2) The commission has power to require public utilities to account for the disposition of the proceeds of all sales of stocks and bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness, in such form and detail as the commission deems advisable, and to establish such rules and regulations as the commission deems reasonable and necessary to insure the disposition of such proceeds for the purpose or purposes specified in the order.

 

      757.440 Approval required before utility may guarantee another’s indebtedness. No public utility shall assume any obligation or liability as guarantor, indorser, surety or otherwise in respect to the securities of any other person, firm or corporation, when such securities are payable at periods of more than 12 months after the date thereof, without first having secured from the Public Utility Commission an order authorizing it so to do. Every assumption made other than in accordance with such an order is void.

 

      757.445 Wrongful issues or use of proceeds by utility. No public utility shall directly or indirectly, issue or cause to be issued any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, in nonconformity with the order of the Public Utility Commission authorizing the same or contrary to the provisions of ORS 757.400 to 757.460, or of the Constitution of this state, or apply the proceeds from the sale thereof, or any part thereof, to any purpose other than the purposes specified in the commission’s order, or to any purpose specified in the commission’s order in excess of the amount in the order authorized for such purpose.

 

      757.450 Wrongful acts relating to issuance of securities. No person shall:

      (1) Knowingly authorize, direct, aid in, issue or execute, or cause to be issued or executed, any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, in nonconformity with the order of the Public Utility Commission authorizing the same, or contrary to the provisions of ORS 757.400 to 757.460 or of the Constitution of this state.

      (2) In any proceeding before the commission, knowingly make any false statement or representation or with knowledge of its falsity file or cause to be filed with the commission any false statement or representation which may tend in any way to influence the commission to make an order authorizing the issue of any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, or which results in procuring from the commission the making of any such order.

      (3) With knowledge that any false statement or representation was made to the commission in any proceeding tending in any way to influence the commission to make such order, issue, execute or negotiate, or cause to be issued, executed or negotiated, any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness.

      (4) Directly or indirectly, knowingly apply, or cause or assist to be applied, the proceeds, or any part thereof, from the sale of any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, to any purpose not specified in the commission’s order, or to any purpose specified in the commission’s order in excess of the amount authorized for such purpose.

      (5) With knowledge that any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, has been issued or executed in violation of ORS 757.400 to 757.460, negotiate, or cause the same to be negotiated.

 

      757.455 Conservation program investment policy; application for bondable investments; utility rates to include investment costs. (1) It is the policy of the Public Utility Commission of Oregon to encourage financing investments at the lowest possible cost to utility customers, including but not limited to conservation program expenditures.

      (2) If the commission decides that a public utility should defer and amortize certain conservation program expenditures, the public utility may apply to the commission for an order designating all or part of the conservation program expenditures as bondable conservation investment, for the purpose of financing or refinancing the designated expenditures under ORS 757.415 (1)(f). After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the commission may approve the application if it finds that the conservation program expenditures included in the application are used, useful and prudent and that financing or refinancing is likely to be more favorable to customers than other reasonably available alternatives. Upon approval, the commission shall issue an order stating the amount of the conservation program expenditures that qualify as bondable conservation investment.

      (3) The commission shall set rates to include in revenue requirement recovery of a public utility’s bondable conservation investment, as well as the costs of equity and debt capital associated with it, including, without limitation, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on conservation bonds. Revenues collectible or collected under this subsection shall be known as “conservation investment assets.” The commission shall not revalue bondable conservation investment for rate-making purposes, determine that revenues required to recover bondable conservation investment and associated equity and debt capital costs are unjust or unreasonable, impair or reduce in any way the value of conservation investment assets, or impair the timing or the amount of revenues arising with respect to conservation investment assets that have been used to secure financing or refinancing under ORS 757.415 (1)(f).

      (4) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply to any amounts presently deferred by a utility regardless of whether expended prior to September 9, 1995.

      (5) As used in this section, “conservation program expenditures” includes, without limitation, loans and cash payments made to customers, the costs of conservation measures installed at the expense of the public utility, specific acquisition program development, promotion and labor costs and associated general supervision, rents, leases and overheads. [1995 c.539 §3]

 

      757.460 Pledge of conservation investment assets as bond collateral; perfection of security interest; foreclosure. (1) A public utility or finance subsidiary may pledge conservation investment assets as collateral for conservation bonds by providing for a security interest in the conservation investment assets. A security interest in conservation investment assets is created and perfected only upon entry of an order by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon approving a contract governing the granting of the security interest, and the filing with the Secretary of State of a Uniform Commercial Code Article I financing statement showing such pledger as “debtor” and identifying the conservation investment assets and the bondable conservation investment pledged as security. The security interest is enforceable against the debtor and all third parties, subject to the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the conservation investment assets perfected in the manner described in this section if value has been given by the purchasers of the conservation bonds. An approved security interest in conservation investment assets is a continuously perfected security interest in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect to the associated bondable conservation investment, whether or not those revenues have accrued. Upon approval by the commission, the priority of the security interest shall be as set forth in the contract governing the conservation bonds. Conservation investment assets constitute property for the purposes of contracts securing the conservation bonds, whether or not the related revenues have accrued.

      (2) The relative priority of a security interest created under this section is not defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to conservation investment assets with other funds of the debtor. The holders of conservation bonds shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the debtor in which revenues arising with respect to conservation investment assets pledged to the holders of conservation bonds have been commingled with other funds, but the perfected security interest is limited to an amount not greater than the amount of the revenues received by the debtor within 12 months before any default under the conservation bonds held by the holders or the institution of insolvency proceedings by or against the debtor, less payments made from the revenues to the holders during that 12-month period. If a default occurs under an approved contract governing conservation bonds, the holders of the conservation bonds or their authorized representatives, as secured parties, may foreclose or otherwise enforce the perfected security interest in the conservation investment assets securing the conservation bonds, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the conservation investment assets perfected in the manner provided in this section. Upon application by the holders of the conservation bonds or their representatives, without limiting other remedies of those holders or representatives, the commission shall order the sequestration and payment to the holders or their representatives of revenues arising with respect to the debtor.

      (3) The granting, perfection and enforcement of security interests in conservation investment assets to secure conservation bonds is governed by this section and not by ORS chapter 79.

      (4) A transfer of conservation investment assets by a public utility to a finance subsidiary that the parties have expressly stated in the governing documentation to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in an order issued by the commission and made in connection with the issuance by the finance subsidiary of conservation bonds, shall be treated as a true sale and not as a pledge or other financing of the conservation investment assets. According the holders of conservation bonds a preferred right to revenues of the public utility or the provision by the utility of other credit enhancement with respect to conservation bonds does not impair or negate the characterization of any transfer as a true sale.

      (5) Any successor to a public utility pursuant to any bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding shall perform and satisfy all obligations of the utility under an approved contract governing conservation bonds in the same manner and to the same extent as was required of the utility before the proceeding, including, without limitation, collecting and paying to the holders of the conservation bonds or their representatives revenues arising with respect to the conservation investment assets pledged to secure the conservation bonds.

      (6) As used in this section:

      (a) “Conservation investment assets” has the meaning given under ORS 757.455.

      (b) “Finance subsidiary” has the meaning given under ORS 757.415. [1995 c.539 §2]

 

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING UTILITIES

 

      757.480 Approval needed prior to disposal, mortgage or encumbrance of certain operative utility property or consolidation with another public utility; exceptions. (1) A public utility doing business in Oregon shall not, without first obtaining the Public Utility Commission’s approval of such transaction:

      (a) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the whole of the property of the public utility necessary or useful in the performance of the public utility’s duties to the public or any part thereof of a value of $1 million or more, or sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of any franchise, permit or right to maintain and operate the public utility or public utility property, or perform any service as a public utility;

      (b) Mortgage or otherwise encumber the whole or any part of the property of the public utility necessary or useful in the performance of the public utility’s duties to the public, including any franchise, permit or right to maintain and operate the public utility or public utility property, or perform any service as a public utility; or

      (c) By any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate any of the public utility’s lines, plant, system or other property whatsoever, or franchise or permit to maintain or operate any public utility property, or perform any service as a public utility, or any part thereof, with any other public utility.

      (2) A public utility doing business in Oregon shall annually file with the commission a report that includes a summary of each transaction in excess of $25,000 but less than $1 million that the public utility made during the previous calendar year that involved the sale, lease, assignment or other disposition of the whole of the property of the public utility necessary or useful in the performance of the public utility’s duties to the public or any part thereof.

      (3) Every sale, lease, assignment, mortgage, disposition, encumbrance, merger or consolidation subject to subsection (1) of this section made other than in accordance with the order of the commission authorizing the same is void.

      (4) For purposes of complying with subsections (1)(a) and (2) of this section, a public utility shall include in the calculation of the value of the property to be sold, leased, assigned or otherwise disposed of only the portion of the value of the property that has been recognized as the basis of an operating expense or capital expenditure in an Oregon rate valuation or other hearing or proceeding.

      (5) This section does not prohibit or invalidate the sale, lease or other disposition by any public utility of property that is not necessary or useful in the performance of the public utility’s duties to the public.

      (6) A water utility doing business in Oregon shall not, without first obtaining the Public Utility Commission’s approval of a transaction, sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the whole of the property of the water utility necessary or useful in the performance of the water utility’s duties to the public or any part thereof of a value in excess of $10,000, or sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of any franchise, permit or right to maintain and operate the water utility or water utility property, or perform any service as a water utility. [Formerly 757.155; 1999 c.530 §1; 2019 c.252 §1]

 

      757.483 Condemnation or acquisition of service territory or property of electric company by electric utility; stranded costs obligation. (1) For purposes of this section:

      (a) “Electric company” has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600.

      (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600.

      (c) “Retail electricity consumer” has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600.

      (2) Upon the request of an electric company, the Public Utility Commission shall establish a stranded costs obligation payable by an electric utility to an electric company in association with a condemnation or transaction described in subsection (3) of this section.

      (3)(a) An electric utility that condemns the service territory or property of an electric company, or acquires property pursuant to a transaction described in ORS 757.480, must pay the stranded costs obligation established by the commission under subsection (2) of this section.

      (b) The purpose of the stranded costs obligation is to prevent shifting the costs associated with the loss of service territory or property of an electric company from the retail electricity consumers of the electric utility to the retail electricity consumers of the electric company.

      (4) The commission may determine the stranded costs obligation in accordance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s current methodology for determining stranded costs under the same or similar circumstances.

      (5) This section does not interfere with or supersede the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. [2016 c.28 §18]

 

      757.485 Purchase of property or stocks of one utility by another. (1) No public utility shall, directly or indirectly, purchase, acquire or become the owner of any of the stocks or bonds or property utilized for utility purposes and having a value in excess of $10,000 of any other public utility unless authorized so to do by the Public Utility Commission.

      (2) Every contract by any public utility for the purchase, acquisition, assignment or transfer to it of any of the stock of any other public utility by or through any person, partnership or corporation without the approval of the commission shall be void and of no effect, and no such transfer or assignment of such stock upon the books of the corporation pursuant to any such contract is effective for any purpose. [Formerly 757.160]

 

      757.490 Approval needed for certain contracts. (1) When any public utility doing business in this state enters into a contract with another corporation with relation to the construction, operation, maintenance or use of the property of said public utility in Oregon, or the use of the property of the other contracting party, or any part thereof, or for service, advice, engineering, financing, rentals, leasing or for any construction or management charges in respect of any such property, or for the purchase of property, materials or supplies, the proposed contract shall be filed with the Public Utility Commission for the investigation and approval when the public utility owns a majority of or controls directly or indirectly the voting stock of the other contracting corporations.

      (2) Any such proposed contract shall be filed with the commission within 90 days of execution of the contract. The contract shall be deemed to be executed on the date the parties sign a written contract or on the date the parties begin to transact business under the contract, whichever date is earlier. The commission shall promptly investigate and act upon the contract in accordance with ORS 757.495 (3) and (6).

      (3) In making such investigation the commission and accountants, examiners and agents, appointed by the commission for the purpose, shall be given free access to all books, books of account, documents, data and records of the public utility as well as of the corporation with which it is proposing to contract, which the commission may deem material to the investigation. The failure or refusal of either of the parties to the proposed contract to comply with this subsection is prima facie evidence that such contract is unfair, unreasonable and contrary to public interest, and is sufficient to justify a determination and finding of the commission to that effect, which has the same force and effect as any other determination or order of the commission. [Formerly 757.165; 1989 c.956 §6]

 

      757.495 Contracts involving utilities and persons with affiliated interests. (1) When any public utility doing business in this state enters into any contract to make any payment, directly or indirectly, to any person or corporation having an affiliated interest, for service, advice, auditing, accounting, sponsoring, engineering, managing, operating, financing, legal or other services, or enter any charges therefor on its books, which shall be recognized as an operating expense or capital expenditure in any rate valuation or any other hearing or proceeding, the contract shall be filed with the Public Utility Commission within 90 days of execution of the contract. The contract shall be deemed to be executed on the date the parties sign a written contract or on the date the parties begin to transact business under the contract, whichever date is earlier.

      (2) When any public utility doing business in this state enters into any contract, oral or written, with any person or corporation having an affiliated interest relating to the construction, operation, maintenance, leasing or use of the property of such public utility in Oregon, or the purchase of property, materials or supplies, which shall be recognized as the basis of an operating expense or capital expenditure in any rate valuation or any other hearing or proceeding, the contract shall be filed with the commission within 90 days of execution of the contract. The contract shall be deemed to be executed on the date the parties sign a written contract or on the date the parties begin to transact business under the contract, whichever date is earlier.

      (3) When any such contract has been submitted to the commission, the commission promptly shall examine and investigate the contract. If, after such investigation, the commission determines that the contract is fair and reasonable and not contrary to the public interest, the commission shall enter findings and an order to this effect and serve a copy thereof upon the public utility, whereupon any expenses and capital expenditures incurred by the public utility under the contract may be recognized in any rate valuation or other hearing or proceeding. If, after such investigation, the commission determines that the contract is not fair and reasonable in all its terms and is contrary to the public interest, the commission shall enter findings and an order accordingly and serve a copy thereof upon the public utility, and, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, it shall be unlawful to recognize the contract for the purposes specified in this section.

      (4) When any such contract has been filed with the commission within 90 days of execution and the commission has not entered an order disapproving the contract under subsection (3) of this section, the commission may not base its refusal to recognize any expenses or capital expenditures incurred under the contract in any rate valuation or other hearing or proceeding solely on the basis that such contract has not been approved under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5) No public utility shall issue notes or lend its funds or give credit on its books or otherwise to any person or corporation having an affiliated interest, either directly or indirectly, without the approval of the commission.

      (6) The action of the commission with respect to all the matters described in this section when submitted to the commission shall be by findings and an order to be entered within 90 days after the matter has been submitted to the commission for consideration, and the findings and order of the commission with respect to any of such matters shall be and remain in full force and effect, unless and until set aside, modified or remanded in a proceeding for judicial review of an order in the manner provided by ORS 756.610. [Formerly 757.170; 1989 c.956 §7; 2005 c.22 §505; 2005 c.638 §9; 2017 c.312 §5]

 

      757.500 Contracts between certain public utilities. When any public utility is primarily engaged in another enterprise and is only indirectly engaged in the production, transmission, delivery or furnishing of heat, light, water or power to or for the public by reason of a contract or agreement, express or implied, between itself and another public utility which is directly engaged in such business, the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission over such public utility extends only to the right to modify, control, rescind, alter or amend any such existing contract or agreement where the interest of the customers of such public utility directly engaged in such business demands. No such contract or agreement is valid or enforceable until it has been approved by the commission as being in the public interest. [Formerly 757.175]

 

      757.505 [Repealed by 1971 c.655 §250]

 

      757.506 Findings and policy regarding exercise of influence over utility by person not engaged in utility business. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:

      (a) The protection of customers of public utilities which provide heat, light or power is a matter of fundamental statewide concern;

      (b) Existing legislation requires the Public Utility Commission’s approval of one public utility’s acquisition of another public utility’s stocks, bonds and certain property used for utility purposes, but does not require the commission’s approval of such acquisitions by persons not engaged in the public utility business in Oregon; and

      (c) An attempt by a person not engaged in the public utility business in Oregon to acquire the power to exercise any substantial influence over the policies and actions of an Oregon public utility which provides heat, light or power could result in harm to such utility’s customers, including but not limited to the degradation of utility service, higher rates, weakened financial structure and diminution of utility assets.

      (2) It is, therefore, the policy of the State of Oregon to regulate acquisitions by persons not engaged in the public utility business in Oregon of the power to exercise any substantial influence over the policies and actions of an Oregon public utility which provides heat, light or power in the manner set forth in this section and ORS 757.511 in order to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted harm to such utilities’ customers. [1985 c.632 §2]

 

      757.510 [Repealed by 1971 c.655 §250]

 

      757.511 Application for authority to exercise influence over utility; contents of application; issuance of order; dissemination of information about acquisition. (1) No person, directly or indirectly, shall acquire the power to exercise any substantial influence over the policies and actions of a public utility which provides heat, light or power without first securing from the Public Utility Commission, upon application, an order authorizing such acquisition if such person is, or by such acquisition would become, an affiliated interest with such public utility as defined in ORS 757.015 (1), (2) or (3).

      (2) Notice must be given to the commission of an application under this section at least 60 days before the application is filed with the commission. The notice must indicate whether the transaction is a transaction described in ORS 757.814 (1). If the transaction is a transaction as described in ORS 757.814 (1), the commission shall give notice to cities and counties as required by ORS 757.814 (1).

      (3) The application required by subsection (1) of this section shall set forth detailed information regarding:

      (a) The applicant’s identity and financial ability;

      (b) The background of the key personnel associated with the applicant;

      (c) The source and amounts of funds or other consideration to be used in the acquisition;

      (d) The applicant’s compliance with federal law in carrying out the acquisition;

      (e) Whether the applicant or the key personnel associated with the applicant have violated any state or federal statutes regulating the activities of public utilities;

      (f) All documents relating to the transaction giving rise to the application;

      (g) The applicant’s experience in operating public utilities providing heat, light or power;

      (h) The applicant’s plan for operating the public utility;

      (i) How the acquisition will serve the public utility’s customers in the public interest; and

      (C) Return of investment and return on investment; and

      (D) Any other method approved by the commission by rule or order.

      (9) For purposes related to the emission reduction program established under this section, the commission may consider the amount of reduced emissions created by a project or the value of reduced emissions created by a project.

      (10) The commission shall establish a rate cap for each public utility for which a project is authorized under this section. The rate cap must limit the cost of all of the public utility’s projects authorized under this section to an amount that does not exceed a percentage of the public utility’s revenue requirement as identified by the commission by rule or order.

      (11) The commission shall biennially conduct a study on whether federal law or regulation or other state laws or rules provide adequate incentives for public utilities that furnish natural gas to invest in projects that reduce emissions in the ordinary course of business. The commission shall report the results of a study conducted under this subsection, and may make recommendations for legislation, to the Legislative Assembly in the manner described in ORS 192.245 not later than February 1 of each odd-numbered year.

      757.607 Direct access conditions; cost recovery. The Public Utility Commission shall ensure that direct access programs offered by electric companies meet the following conditions:

      (1) The provision of direct access to some retail electricity consumers must not cause the unwarranted shifting of costs to other retail electricity consumers of the electric company. The commission may, in establishing any rates and charges under ORS 757.600 to 757.667, consider and mitigate the rate impact on consumers from the reduction or elimination of subsidies in existing rate structures.

      (2) The direct access, portfolio of rate options and cost-of-service rates may include transition charges or transition credits that reasonably balance the interests of retail electricity consumers and utility investors. The commission may determine that full or partial recovery of the costs of uneconomic utility investments, or full or partial pass-through of the benefits of economic utility investments to retail electricity consumers, is in the public interest.

      (3) The commission shall allow recovery, through a transition charge, of any otherwise unrecoverable costs arising from or related to an electric company’s contractual or other legal obligations to the Bonneville Power Administration under ORS 757.663, or arising from or related to a failure of the Bonneville Power Administration to meet its contractual or other legal obligations to the electric company, from those classes of consumers for which electric power was purchased from the Bonneville Power Administration.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 757.355, the commission may allow a return on the unamortized balance of an uneconomic utility investment or an economic utility investment that is included in rates. [1999 c.865 §8]

 

      757.609 Date for announcing prices for electricity in subsequent calendar year; estimated prices. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall set a date on which all electric companies must announce prices that will be charged for electricity by the companies in the subsequent calendar year. Retail electricity consumers who are eligible for direct access must be allowed at least three business days after the date set by the commission to elect whether to use direct access or to purchase electricity from an electric company.

      (B) Is not subject to ORS 469.631 to 469.645 and 469.860 to 469.900.

      (5)(a) A retail electricity consumer that uses more than one average megawatt of electricity at any site in the prior year shall receive a credit against public purpose charges billed by an electric company or Oregon Community Power for that site. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the total amount of qualifying expenditures for new cost-effective energy conservation, not to exceed 68 percent of the annual public purpose charges, and the above-market costs of new renewable energy resources incurred by the retail electricity consumer, not to exceed 19 percent of the annual public purpose charges, less administration costs incurred under this paragraph and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection. The credit may not exceed, on an annual basis, the lesser of:

      (A) The amount of the retail electricity consumer’s qualifying expenditures; or

      (B) The portion of the public purpose charge billed to the retail electricity consumer that is dedicated to new cost-effective energy conservation, new market transformation or the above-market costs of new renewable energy resources.

      (b) To obtain a credit under paragraph (a) of this subsection, a retail electricity consumer shall file with the State Department of Energy a description of the proposed conservation project or new renewable energy resource and a declaration that the retail electricity consumer plans to incur the qualifying expenditure. The State Department of Energy shall issue a notice of precertification within 30 days of receipt of the filing, if such filing is consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection. The credit may be taken after a retail electricity consumer provides a letter from a certified public accountant to the State Department of Energy verifying that the precertified qualifying expenditure has been made.

      (c) Credits earned by a retail electricity consumer as a result of qualifying expenditures that are not used in one year may be carried forward for use in subsequent years.

      (d)(A) A retail electricity consumer that uses more than one average megawatt of electricity at any site in the prior year may request that the State Department of Energy hire an independent auditor to assess the potential for conservation investments at the site. If the independent auditor determines there is no available conservation measure at the site that would have a simple payback of one to 10 years, the retail electricity consumer shall be relieved of 54 percent of its payment obligation for public purpose charges related to the site. If the independent auditor determines that there are potential conservation measures available at the site, the retail electricity consumer shall be entitled to a credit against public purpose charges related to the site equal to 54 percent of the public purpose charges less the estimated cost of available conservation measures.

      (B) A retail electricity consumer shall be entitled each year to the credit described in this paragraph unless a subsequent independent audit determines that new conservation investment opportunities are available. The State Department of Energy may require that a new independent audit be performed on the site to determine whether new conservation measures are available, provided that the independent audits occur no more than once every two years.

      (C) The retail electricity consumer shall pay the cost of the independent audits described in this paragraph.

      (6) Electric utilities and retail electricity consumers shall receive a fair and reasonable credit for the public purpose expenditures of their energy suppliers.

The State Department of Energy also shall adopt methods to account for eligible public purpose expenditures made through consortia or collaborative projects.

      (7)(a) In addition to the public purpose charge provided under subsection (2) of this section, an electric company or Oregon Community Power shall collect funds for low-income electric bill payment assistance in an amount determined under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

      (b) The commission shall establish the amount to be collected by each electric company from retail electricity consumers, and the rates to be charged by each electric company to retail electricity consumers, so that the forecasted collection by all electric companies in calendar year 2018 is $20 million. In subsequent calendar years, the commission may not decrease the rates below those established for calendar year 2018. The commission may temporarily adjust the rates if forecasted collections or actual collections are less than $20 million in any calendar year. A retail electricity consumer may not be required to pay more than $500 per month per site for low-income electric bill payment assistance.

      (c) Funds collected through the low-income electric bill payment assistance charge shall be paid into the Housing and Community Services Department Low-Income Electric Bill Payment Assistance Fund established by ORS 456.587 (2). Moneys deposited in the fund under this paragraph shall be used by the Housing and Community Services Department solely for purposes related to low-income electric bill payment assistance and for the Housing and Community Services Department’s cost of administering this subsection. Funds collected by an electric company or Oregon Community Power under this subsection shall be expended in the service area of the electric company or Oregon Community Power from which the funds are collected.

      (d)(A) The Housing and Community Services Department shall determine the manner in which funds collected under this subsection will be allocated by the Housing and Community Services Department to energy assistance program providers for the purpose of providing low-income bill payment and crisis assistance.

      (B) The Housing and Community Services Department, in consultation with electric companies, shall investigate and may implement alternative delivery models to effectively reduce service disconnections and related costs to retail electricity consumers and electric utilities.

      (C) Priority assistance shall be directed to low-income electricity consumers who are in danger of having their electricity service disconnected.

      (D) The Housing and Community Services Department shall maintain records and provide those records upon request to an electric company, Oregon Community Power and the Citizens’ Utility Board established under ORS chapter 774 on a quarterly basis. Records maintained must include the numbers of low-income electricity consumers served, the average amounts paid to low-income electricity consumers and the type of assistance provided to low-income electricity consumers. Electric companies and Oregon Community Power shall, if requested, provide the Housing and Community Services Department with aggregate data relating to low-income electricity consumers served on a quarterly basis to support program development.

      (e) Interest on moneys deposited in the Housing and Community Services Department Low-Income Electric Bill Payment Assistance Fund established by ORS 456.587 (2) may be used to provide bill payment and crisis assistance to electricity consumers whose primary source of heat is not electricity.

      (f) Notwithstanding ORS 757.310, the commission may allow an electric company or Oregon Community Power to provide reduced rates or other bill payment or crisis assistance or low-income program assistance to a low-income household eligible for assistance under the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981, as amended and in effect on July 23, 1999.

      (8) For purposes of this section, “retail electricity consumers” includes any direct service industrial consumer that purchases electricity without purchasing distribution services from the electric utility.

      (9) For purposes of this section, funds collected by Oregon Community Power through public purpose charges are not considered moneys received from electric utility operations.

      (4) A consumer-owned utility may comply with the public purpose requirements of this section by participating in collaborative efforts with other consumer-owned utilities located in this state.

      (5) Funds assessed and paid by, and credits or other financial assistance issued or extended to, retail electric consumers for purposes of this section may, in the discretion of the governing body of the consumer-owned utility, be expended to fund programs for energy conservation, renewable resources or low-income energy services otherwise required by the laws of this state, adopted by the governing body pursuant to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (Public Law 95-619, as amended November 10, 1981), or conducted by the utility pursuant to agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration under the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Public Law 96-501). All such funds expended, credits issued and incremental costs incurred in connection with the performance of a consumer-owned utility’s obligations under this section shall be credited toward the utility’s public purpose funding obligation under this section.

      (6) A consumer-owned utility also may credit toward its funding obligations under this section any incremental costs incurred by the utility for capital expenditures made to reduce its distribution system energy losses, existing biomass gas and waste to energy systems, existing hydroelectric generation projects using fish attraction water, for new energy conservation and renewable resource funding costs included in its wholesale power supplier’s charges and for electric power generated by renewable or cogeneration resources pursuant to requirements of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-617), to the extent that such costs exceed the average cost of the utility’s other electric power resources.

      (7) A consumer-owned utility also may credit toward its public purpose funding obligations under this section any costs incurred in complying with ORS 469.649 to 469.659.

      (8) Beginning on March 1, 2002, a consumer-owned utility whose territory abuts the greatest percentage of the site of an aluminum plant that averages more than 100 megawatts of electricity use per year shall collect from the aluminum company a public purpose charge equal to one percent of the total revenue from the sale of electricity services to the aluminum plant from any source.

      (9)(a) A retail electricity consumer that uses more than one average megawatt of electricity at any site in the prior year shall receive a credit against public purpose charges billed by a consumer-owned utility for that site. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the total amount of qualifying expenditures for new energy conservation, not to exceed 68 percent of the annual public purpose charges, and the above-market costs of purchases of new renewable energy resources incurred by the retail electricity consumer, less administration costs incurred under this subsection. The credit shall not exceed, on an annual basis, the lesser of:

      (A) The amount of the retail electricity consumer’s qualifying expenditures; or

      (B) The portion of the public purpose charge billed to the retail electricity consumer that is dedicated to new energy conservation, new market transformation or the above-market costs of new renewable resources.

      (b) To obtain a credit under this subsection, a retail electricity consumer shall file with the department a description of the proposed conservation project, new market transformation or new renewable energy resource and a declaration that the retail electricity consumer plans to incur the qualifying expenditure. The department shall issue a notice of precertification within 30 days of receipt of the filing, if such filing is consistent with this subsection. Notice shall be issued to the retail electricity consumer and the appropriate consumer-owned utility. The credit may be taken after a retail electricity consumer provides a letter from a certified public accountant to the department verifying that the precertified qualifying expenditure has been made.

      (c) Credits earned by a retail electricity consumer as a result of qualifying expenditures that are not used in one year may be carried forward for use in subsequent years.

      (d)(A) A retail electricity consumer that uses more than one average megawatt of electricity at any site in the prior year may request that the department hire an independent auditor to assess the potential for conservation measures at the site. If the independent auditor determines there is no available conservation measure at the site that would have a simple payback of one to 10 years, the retail electricity consumer shall be relieved of 54 percent of its payment obligation for public purpose charges related to the site. If the auditor determines that there are potential conservation measures available at the site, the retail electricity consumer shall be entitled to a credit against public purpose charges related to the site equal to 54 percent of the public purpose charges less the estimated cost of available conservation measures.

      (B) A retail electricity consumer shall be entitled each year to the credit described in this paragraph unless a subsequent audit determines that new conservation investment opportunities are available. The department may require that a new audit be performed on the site to determine whether new conservation measures are available, provided that the audits occur no more than once every two years.

      (C) The retail electricity consumer shall pay the cost of the audits described in this subsection.

      (10) A retail electricity consumer with a load greater than one average megawatt shall not be required to pay a public purpose charge in excess of three percent of the consumer’s total cost of electricity services unless the charge is established in an agreement between the consumer and the consumer-owned utility.

      (11) Beginning on March 1, 2002, a consumer-owned utility shall have in operation a bill assistance program for households that qualify for federal low-income energy assistance in the consumer-owned utility’s service area. A consumer-owned utility shall report annually to the Housing and Community Services Department detailing the utility’s program and program expenditures.

      (12) A consumer-owned utility may require an electricity service supplier to provide information necessary to ensure compliance with this section. The consumer-owned utility shall ensure the privacy and protection of any proprietary information provided. [1999 c.865 §27; 2001 c.819 §5; 2007 c.301 §29]

 

      757.689 Recovery of costs of energy conservation measures in rates of electric company. (1) In addition to the public purpose charge established by ORS 757.612, the Public Utility Commission may authorize an electric company to include in its rates the costs of funding or implementing cost-effective energy conservation measures implemented on or after June 6, 2007. The costs may include amounts for weatherization programs that conserve energy.

      (2) The commission shall ensure that a retail electricity consumer with a load greater than one average megawatt:

      (a) Is not required to pay an amount that is more than three percent of the consumer’s total cost of electricity service for the public purpose charge under ORS 757.612 and any amounts included in rates under this section; and

      (b) Does not receive any direct benefit from energy conservation measures if the costs of the measures are included in rates under this section. [2007 c.301 §46]

 

      757.690 [1961 c.691 §17; repealed by 1967 c.164 §4]

      (3) If any amount specified under subsection (2) of this section has not been recovered by PacifiCorp before a dam is removed, the Public Utility Commission shall allow recovery of that amount by PacifiCorp in PacifiCorp’s rates and tariffs. The commission shall allow the recovery without an amortization schedule if the impact of the recovery does not exceed one-half of one percent of PacifiCorp’s annual revenue requirement. If the impact exceeds one-half of one percent of PacifiCorp’s annual revenue requirement, the commission may establish an amortization schedule that limits the annual impact to one-half of one percent of PacifiCorp’s annual revenue requirement. [2009 c.690 §3]

 

      757.736 Surcharges for funding costs of removing Klamath River dams; judicial review. (1) Not more than 30 days after the execution of a final agreement, PacifiCorp must file a copy of the final agreement with the Public Utility Commission along with full and complete copies of all analyses or studies that relate to the rate-related costs, benefits and risks for customers of removing or relicensing Klamath River dams and that were reviewed by PacifiCorp during the decision-making process that led to PacifiCorp’s entering into the final agreement.

      (2) PacifiCorp must include with the filing made under subsection (1) of this section tariffs for the collection of two nonbypassable surcharges from its customers for the purpose of paying the costs of removing Klamath River dams as described in subsection (11) of this section. Notwithstanding the commission’s findings and conclusions under subsection (4) of this section, the commission shall require PacifiCorp to begin collecting the surcharges on the date that the filing is made under subsection (1) of this section, or on January 1, 2010, whichever is later, and PacifiCorp shall continue to collect the surcharges pending a final decision on the commission’s order under subsection (4) of this section. The surcharges imposed under this section shall be:

      (a) A surcharge for the costs of removing the J.C. Boyle Dam; and

      (b) A surcharge for the costs of removing the Copco 1 Dam, the Copco 2 Dam and the Iron Gate Dam.

      (3) The surcharges imposed under this section may not exceed the amounts necessary to fund Oregon’s share of the customer contribution of $200 million identified in the agreement in principle. In addition, the total amount collected in a calendar year under both surcharges may not exceed more than two percent of PacifiCorp’s annual revenue requirement as determined in PacifiCorp’s last case under ORS 757.210 decided by the commission before January 1, 2010.

      (4) Not more than six months after a filing is made under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall conduct a hearing under ORS 757.210 on the surcharges imposed under this section, and shall enter an order setting forth findings and conclusions as to whether the imposition of surcharges under the terms of the final agreement results in rates that are fair, just and reasonable.

      (5) Notwithstanding ORS 183.482 (1), jurisdiction for judicial review of any appeal of an order entered under subsection (4) of this section is conferred on the Supreme Court, and a person seeking judicial review of the order must file a petition for review with the Supreme Court in the manner provided by ORS 183.482. ORS 183.482 (3) does not apply to an order entered under subsection (4) of this section. If a petition for review is filed, the surcharges imposed under the terms of the final agreement shall remain in effect pending a final decision on the petition, but shall be refunded if the rates resulting from the surcharges are finally determined not to be fair, just and reasonable. A petition filed under this subsection must indicate on its face that the petition is filed pursuant to this subsection.

      (6) The commission may not use any commercially sensitive information provided to the commission in a filing made under subsection (1) of this section for any purpose other than determining whether the imposition of surcharges under the terms of the final agreement results in rates that are fair, just and reasonable. Notwithstanding ORS 192.311 to 192.478, the commission may not release commercially sensitive information provided to the commission under this section, and shall require any person participating in a proceeding relating to the surcharge to sign a protective order prepared by the commission before allowing the participant to obtain and use the information.

      (7) The surcharges imposed under this section must be of a specified amount per kilowatt hour billed to retail customers, as determined by the commission. The amount of each surcharge shall be calculated based on a collection schedule that will fund, by December 31, 2019, Oregon’s share of the customer contribution of $200 million identified in the agreement in principle. To the extent practicable, the commission shall set the surcharges so that total annual collections of the surcharges remain approximately the same during the collection period, and, when setting the rate for the surcharges, the commission shall account for the actual and expected changes in energy usage over the collection period and account for the actual and expected changes in interest rates on the collected funds over the collection period. The commission may change the collection schedule if a Klamath River dam will be removed during a year other than 2020.

      (8) Except as provided in ORS 757.738 (2), all amounts collected under the surcharges imposed under this section shall be paid into the appropriate trust account established under ORS 757.738.

      (9) If the commission determines at any time that amounts have been collected under this section in excess of those needed, or in excess of those allowed, the commission must:

      (a) Direct the trustee of the appropriate trust account under ORS 757.738 to refund these excess amounts to customers or to otherwise use these amounts for the benefit of customers; or

      (b) Adjust future surcharge amounts as necessary to offset the excess amounts.

      (10) If one or more Klamath River dams will not be removed, the commission shall direct PacifiCorp to terminate collection of all or part of the surcharges imposed under this section. In addition, the commission shall direct the trustee of the appropriate trust account under ORS 757.738 to apply any excess balances in the accounts to Oregon’s allocated share of prudently incurred costs to implement Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relicensing requirements. If any excess amounts remain in the trust accounts after that application, the Public Utility Commission shall order that the excess amounts be refunded to customers or otherwise be used for the benefit of customers in accordance with Public Utility Commission rules and policies.

      (11) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, “the costs of removing Klamath River dams” includes costs of:

      (a) Physical removal of the dams;

      (b) Site remediation and restoration;

      (c) Avoiding downstream impacts of dam removal;

      (d) Downstream impacts of dam removal;

      (e) Permits that are required for the removal;

      (f) Removal and disposal of sediment, debris and other materials, if necessary; and

      (g) Compliance with environmental laws. [2009 c.690 §4; 2011 c.394 §1]

 

      757.738 Surcharge trust accounts related to removal of Klamath River dams. (1)(a) The Public Utility Commission shall establish a separate trust account for amounts generated by each of the two surcharges imposed under ORS 757.736. The commission shall establish the trust accounts as interest-bearing accounts:

      (A) With an agency of the United States identified in the final agreement;

      (B) In a qualified depository under ORS 295.001 to 295.108; or

      (C) With the State Treasurer, to be invested as provided in ORS 293.701 to 293.857.

      (b) The commission may establish each of the two trust accounts with a different trustee among those listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

      (c) The commission may authorize transfer of funds from one trust account to another as necessary to fund removal of the Klamath River dams.

      (2) If an agreement is entered into under ORS 757.742 (2), the parties to the agreement may agree that a portion of the amounts collected under one surcharge may be deposited in the trust account established for amounts collected under the other surcharge.

      (3) Upon request of an agency of the United States, or upon request of the designee of an agency of the United States, the commission shall require the trustee of the appropriate trust account established under this section to transfer to the agency or designee the amounts that are necessary to pay the costs of removing the Klamath River dams as described in ORS 757.736 (11).

      (4) If any amounts remain in a trust account established under this section after the trustee makes all payments necessary for the costs of removing the Klamath River dams as described in ORS 757.736 (11), the commission shall direct the trustee of the account to refund those amounts to customers or to otherwise use the excess amounts for the benefit of customers. [2009 c.690 §5; 2011 c.394 §2; 2019 c.587 §50]

 

      757.740 Recovery of other costs incurred as result of changes in operation to or removal of Klamath River dams. Pursuant to ORS 757.210, the Public Utility Commission shall allow PacifiCorp to include in its rates and tariffs this state’s allocated share of any costs that are prudently incurred by PacifiCorp from changes in operation of Klamath River dams before removal of the dams, or that are prudently incurred for replacement power after the dams are removed, that are not otherwise recovered under ORS 757.734 and 757.736. [2009 c.690 §6]

 

      757.742 Public Utility Commission authorization to enter agreement with California related to cost apportionment and trust fund. (1) The State of Oregon may enter into an agreement with representatives of the State of California, either as part of a final agreement or by separate agreement, that establishes each state’s share of the customer contribution of $200 million identified in the agreement in principle.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission may enter into an agreement with representatives of the State of California to establish and administer the trust accounts authorized under ORS 757.738 and to ensure that trust account moneys are disbursed for dam removal costs that are necessary and appropriate. [2009 c.690 §7]

 

      757.744 Disclaimers. (1) ORS 757.732 to 757.744 do not authorize the expenditure of any public moneys for removal of Klamath River dams.

      (2) ORS 757.732 to 757.744 do not create a cause of action against the State of Oregon or against any of the officers, employees or agents of the state and may not be used as the basis for an assertion of liability on the part of the State of Oregon or of any officers, employees or agents of the state. [2009 c.690 §8]
